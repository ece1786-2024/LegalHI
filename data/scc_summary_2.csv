2024 SCC 21,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that no secret trial  was held in a case involving a person with police informer status.</strong>A person who acted as an informer  for a police force was charged with criminal offences. The person brought a  motion for a stay of proceedings based in part on abusive state conduct related  to the laying of the charges. Because the person’s informer status was at the  centre of the relevant factual context and the parties’ arguments, the judge  dealing with the motion ordered that it be heard <em>in camera</em>, that is, in private. No notice was given to the  media, since the judge was of the view that revealing anything about the  motion, including its existence, would be likely to compromise the person’s  anonymity. The motion, its content and the exhibits and transcripts submitted  to the judge remained confidential and were not in any court record. The motion  was dismissed in a written judgment, which had no file number and could not be  consulted by the public.The person was subsequently  convicted and appealed the conviction. The appeal was heard <em>in camera</em>, and no notice was given  to the media. The Court of Appeal allowed the person’s appeal, stayed the  conviction and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of  abuse of process by the state. The Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its  court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a version of  its decision in which certain information was redacted, that is, blacked out.  In that decision, the Court of Appeal denounced the holding of a “secret  trial”, which alarmed the public and the media. It also expressed its  disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for  the person’s trial.A number of media organizations,  the Attorney General of Quebec and the Chief Judge of the Court of Québec then  asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in this  case. In a second decision, the Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all  information that might tend to identify the person. The Court of Appeal also  refused to partially unseal, or open up, the appeal record by redacting the  same information as in the public version of its decision. The media  organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec appealed that second decision  to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has allowed  their appeals in part.<strong>Court openness is a cardinal principle of the Canadian justice system. Any exception to this principle must be limited.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the  Court confirmed that no secret trial was held in this case. The Court in fact specified  that “the very concept of ‘secret trial’ does not exist in Canada. . . .  [T]he  cardinal principle of court openness may be tempered where the circumstances of  a case so require. Various confidentiality orders may be made . . .,  up to and including an order that all hearings be held <em>in camera</em> . . . But it is well established that  ‘secret trials’, those that leave no trace, are not part of the range of  possible measures.” According to the Supreme Court,  the magnitude of the controversy that arose after the Court of Appeal’s first decision  was released could have been limited if that court had not used the expression  “secret trial” to describe what were actually <em>in camera</em> hearings held in a proceeding that began and  initially moved forward publicly.Where, as in this case, an informer asserts their status in a proceeding  that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose  their status, and the informer‑police relationship is central to the  proceedings, the appropriate way to protect the informer’s anonymity will  generally be to proceed totally <em>in camera</em>.  Even in these most confidential of cases, it is still possible — and even  essential — to protect the informer’s anonymity while favouring confidentiality  orders that do not entirely or indefinitely keep the existence of a hearing or  judgment from the public. What is in issue is the maintenance of public  confidence in the administration of justice and compliance with the guiding  rule from <em><a href=""https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2384/index.do"">Named  Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43</a></em>, which requires a court to protect informer  privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open  court principle.As the Supreme Court noted, when  justice is rendered in secret, without leaving any trace, respect for the rule  of law is jeopardized and public confidence in the administration of justice  may be shaken. The open court principle allows a society to guard against such  risks, which erode the very foundations of democracy. By ensuring the  accountability of the judiciary, court openness supports an administration of  justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also  helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and its  participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity.  Court openness is therefore of paramount importance to our democracy — an  importance that is also reflected in the constitutional protection afforded to  it in Canada. In this case, the Supreme Court found  that the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the motions for disclosure of  the information that had been kept confidential up to that time but that it erred  in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. The case is  therefore remanded to the Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted  version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting  the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction."
2024 SCC 20,"<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies what is required for an exclusion  clause in a contract of sale to exempt the seller from an implied condition  under Ontario’s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. </strong>This appeal concerned a party’s ability to contract out of an  implied condition of sale under Ontario’s <em>Sale  of Goods Act</em>. Implied conditions are obligations that are automatically  incorporated into a contract unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. The  Supreme Court clarified what was required to show that the parties expressly  agreed to contract out of the implied condition.   Pine Valley  Enterprises Inc. was hired by the City of Toronto to work on a municipal  project to remediate flooding, which included the removal and replacement of  topsoil for drainage. Pine Valley contacted Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., a  topsoil provider, to obtain topsoil with a specified composition. Earthco provided  Pine Valley with laboratory reports from different topsoil samples taken about  six weeks prior, and warned against purchasing the topsoil without updated test  results.  However, Pine Valley had  already missed project deadlines and urgently wanted delivery of the topsoil to  avoid a financial penalty. Pine Valley therefore insisted on immediate  delivery. Pine Valley and Earthco agreed to add two exclusion clauses to their  contract that stated that Pine Valley had the right to test and approve the  material before it was shipped, and that if it waived those rights, Earthco  would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its  facility. After the  topsoil was delivered and placed on the project site, water ponding was noted. New  testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the topsoil than the  initial test results had indicated, and Pine Valley had to remove and replace  the topsoil. Pine Valley then sued Earthco for damages, alleging that it did  not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been  indicated in the initial test results.The trial judge  dismissed Pine Valley’s action. He found that the contract was for a sale of  goods by description within the meaning of section 14 of Ontario’s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which sets out an  implied condition that goods must correspond with their description. He agreed  that Pine Valley did not get the topsoil it bargained for, because of the  variation between the topsoil that was promised and the topsoil that was  delivered. However, the trial judge concluded that the exclusion clauses met  the requirements of an “express agreement” according to section 53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which allows parties to  contract out of the implied condition under section 14. He concluded as such  despite the fact that the exclusion clauses did not explicitly mention that  they were added to the contract for this purpose.  The Court of  Appeal disagreed with the trial judge and found that the wording in the  exclusion clauses was insufficient to exempt Earthco from liability under section  14 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. The  Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco  to pay damages. Earthco appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The exclusion clauses were an express agreement  pursuant to section 53. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin said that to be sufficient for the purposes of section  53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, an  “express agreement” must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a  statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be  expressly set forth within the parties’ contract. The determination as to what  qualifies as an express agreement must also be informed by principles of  contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, and the  paramount consideration must be the objective intention of the parties. In the instant  case, the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion  clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties’ express agreement was that  Pine Valley accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously  supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it  knew was an organic and changing substance. For these reasons, Justice Martin  allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge’s judgment. "
2024 SCC 19,"<strong>The Supreme Court says a trial court was right to refuse evidence of  prior sexual activity in a sexual assault case.   </strong>The accused was convicted of a sexual assault that  took place on April 2, 2018. The complainant was his spouse, who testified that  her marriage to the accused had completely broken down in February of that  year. However, in an earlier statement to the police, the complainant also  stated that she and the accused had engaged in consensual sexual activity on  the evening of April 1, the night before the sexual assault. Prior to his trial, the accused asked the court to  allow evidence that he and the complainant had engaged in consensual sexual  activity in the evening of April 1 and in the morning of April 2. He argued  that admitting such evidence would serve to challenge the complainant’s  credibility – specifically with respect to her claim that the marriage had  completely broken down at the time of the alleged assault – to provide context,  and to support his defence that the complainant had consented to the sexual  activity, as it was all part of one interaction. Under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, evidence of a complainant’s sexual activity with the  accused or with any other person is not admissible to support an inference that  the complainant is either (a) more likely to have consented to the sexual  activity at the center of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief. In law,  this is called “twin-myth reasoning” and relying on such inferences is not  allowed.The trial judge dismissed the accused’s application to  admit this evidence. He found no inconsistency between the complainant’s  statement to the police and her testimony. In his view, the evidence the accused  wanted to submit was irrelevant to her credibility – it would only serve to  support one of the two inferences prohibited under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. As required under section  278.95 of the <em>Criminal </em>Code, the  content of the accused’s application, the hearing that was held to decide the  issue and the trial judge’s decision were subject to a publication ban. The  case went to trial and the accused was ultimately convicted. The accused’s appeal proceeded <em>in camera </em>(closed to the public) and the appeal record was sealed  (not made public). A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia  dismissed the accused’s appeal. It agreed with the trial judge that the accused  had not identified a legitimate use of the proposed evidence. The accused then appealed the decision to the Supreme  Court of Canada. By way of a motion, the Crown relied on section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to ask the Court for an <em>in camera </em>hearing, for filed materials  to be sealed, and for any other order necessary to protect information and  evidence related to the accused’s application to admit evidence on prior sexual  activity. The Court heard oral arguments on the motion before continuing with  the hearing on the appeal. The Supreme Court has dismissed the accused’s appeal  and allowed the Crown’s motion in part.   <strong>The evidence of prior sexual activity was inadmissible at the trial.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice O’Bonsawin held that the accused failed to  sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence  that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability  to make full answer and defence. The trial judge did not make a mistake in  denying the application. As such, the accused’s conviction was upheld. With respect to the Crown’s motion, Justice O’Bonsawin determined  that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>did not extend to  appellate proceedings. Rather, she said the Supreme Court’s power to make an  order limiting court openness in the instant case was derived from implied  jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records. The Court’s  discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as  practicable while protecting the complainant’s personal dignity and privacy and  the accused’s fair trial rights.Justice O’Bonsawin then applied the test set out in <a href=""/case-dossier/cb/2021/38695-eng.pdf""><em>Sherman Estate v. Donovan</em></a>, a prior unrelated  decision of this Court, to conclude that the circumstances of the instant case  did not justify all of the measures requested by the Crown. Banning publication  of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity  other than that which formed the subject-matter of the charge was  sufficient.     "
2024 SCC 18,"<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the convictions of two men guilty of manslaughter.</strong>The issue in these appeals  was whether the trial judge made a mistake in instructing the jury on how to  establish causation between the accused’s unlawful acts and the victim’s death from  stabbing wounds inflicted by a third person. Emanuel Lozada and Victor  Ramos were accused of manslaughter as a result of an unlawful act (known in law  as “unlawful act manslaughter”) after participating in a fight in downtown  Toronto, which resulted in the fatal stabbing of a victim. It was never  suggested that either Mr. Lozada or Mr. Ramos had stabbed the victim. A third person  was convicted of second degree murder for the stabbing. Rather, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos were accused of acting as co-principals in the fatal attack or aiders  and abettors to the stabber. To convict Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos, the Crown needed to establish causation between their unlawful acts –  their participation in the group assault – and the victim’s death. To do so,  the Crown had to prove that the unlawful acts were a significant contributing  cause to his death. The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Ramos fought with the  victim and punched or kicked him, while Mr. Lozada fought with one of the  victim’s friends. It argued that the two men’s assaults left the victim  vulnerable to being stabbed by the third man. In their defence, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos argued that the stabbing was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence  of their decision to join a fight. As such, the stabbing event broke the chain  of causation between their assaults and the victim’s death and they could not  be held criminally responsible for it. The jury convicted Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos of unlawful act manslaughter. The two men appealed their  convictions together at the Ontario Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial  judge made a mistake when instructing the jury on whether their conduct was a  significant contributing cause of the victim’s death. The majority of the Court  of Appeal dismissed their appeals. It found that when considered in isolation,  two passages from the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on reasonable  foreseeability misstated the law. However, the majority concluded that read as  a whole, the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury were accurate. Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeals.<strong>The jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation.</strong>Writing for the majority,  Justice Moreau said that on a reading of the jury instructions and the trial  judge’s answers to the jury’s questions as a whole, the instructions conveyed  the proper test for causation: whether the conduct of Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos  was a significant contributing cause of the victim’s death. Moreover, the trial  judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools – i.e. the  question of reasonable foreseeability – to assist the jury in determining  whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would  absolve Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos of legal responsibility for manslaughter. For  these reasons, Justice Moreau dismissed the appeals and upheld the manslaughter  convictions.  "
2024 SCC 17,"<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies  how zoning regulations and other restrictions on land use affect how owners of  expropriated property are compensated.  </strong>Expropriation is a forcible acquisition by the Crown  of privately-owned property for public purposes. A “constructive expropriation”  happens when a public authority acquires private property by using its  regulatory powers. In such cases, the owners can be entitled to compensation  based on the property’s market value. At issue in this case was the Lynch family’s property  in the Broad Cove River watershed in Newfoundland. Groundwater within the  watershed drains towards the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City of St.  John’s for the local water supply. Pursuant to the <em>City of St. John’s Act</em>, the Lynch property is subject to the City’s  pollution control and expropriation powers. In 1994, the Lynch property was  zoned as watershed (the “watershed zoning”). Within the watershed zone, the  City’s permission is required for any use of the land, and it may only be  granted for three discretionary uses: agriculture, forestry and public utility. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynch family has tried  to obtain permission to develop the property. In 2013, the City rejected a  formal application to develop a residential subdivision on the property, citing  its authority under the <em>City of St.  John’s Act </em>and the property’s designation as part of the watershed zone. Following  that refusal, the Lynch family turned to the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of  Appeal, which declared that the City had expropriated the Lynch property when it  refused to permit any development on it. The court’s decision meant that the  Lynch family was entitled to compensation from the City. The City asked the Board of Commissioners of Public  Utilities to assess how much the Lynch family was owed. In turn, the Board  sought the opinion of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador to  determine whether compensation should be assessed based on the watershed zoning  or whether the watershed zoning should be ignored and the value determined as  if residential development were allowed. This question was important because  valuation according to the watershed zoning would diminish the market value of  the property compared to the Lynch family’s desire to use it for residential  development. As a result, taking the watershed zoning into account would reduce  the compensation owed to the Lynch family.The judge applied a legal principle according to which  changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are ignored in  the compensation assessment. As such, the question became whether the watershed  zoning was made with a view to expropriating the Lynch property. The judge ruled  that the watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not part of the  expropriation scheme. This meant that it could operate to influence the market  value of the Lynch property and was not to be ignored for the purpose of  determining compensation. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed  the Lynch family’s appeal. It disagreed with the first judge and concluded that  the watershed zoning was connected to the expropriation. As such, it ordered  the Board to determine compensation without reference to the watershed zoning. The  City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.  <strong>The watershed  zoning was independent from the expropriation scheme. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Martin held  that the Lynch family was entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair  compensation for the City’s constructive expropriation of the property. She  agreed with the first judge’s finding that the watershed zoning was an  independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation. As such,  Justice Martin determined that the market value assessment for the property  must take into account the fact that the watershed zoning limits use of the  property to discretionary agriculture, forestry and public utility. To ignore  the watershed zoning would compensate the Lynch family for something they never  would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop  residential housing. For these reasons, Justice Martin allowed the appeal, set  aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restored the first judge’s order. "
2024 SCC 16,"<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial in French for an accused person who was not informed  of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice.  </strong>This case was about the  analytical framework that a court of appeal must apply when an accused person appeals  their conviction because they were not informed of their right to be tried in  the official language of their choice the first time they appeared before a  judge, where no decision on their language rights was made at first instance.Section 530 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>guarantees to every  accused person the right to be tried in the official language of their choice. To  make certain that the accused’s choice is free and informed, section 530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> imposes a duty on the  judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is  advised of their right and of the time before which they must apply for a trial  before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official  language of their choice.Franck Yvan Tayo Tompouba is a  bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial  conducted in English in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. During the  judicial process leading to Mr. Tayo Tompouba’s conviction, the judge did  not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to  the requirements of section 530(3) of the <em>Code</em>. Mr. Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French or  raise the breach of his right to be advised of his right to make such an  application.Mr. Tayo Tompouba appealed  his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. It was then that he asserted  for the first time that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French.  Mr. Tayo Tompouba alleged that his language rights had been violated due,  among other things, to the fact that the judge had breached his duty under  section 530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. While it was of the view that the judge’s breach was an error of law  that warranted its intervention, it found that the evidence did not make it  possible to decide certain key questions, including when Mr. Tayo Tompouba  had learned of his fundamental right, whether he would in fact have chosen a  trial in French if he had had an opportunity to do so, and whether he had not  made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. It therefore found  that the evidence was insufficient and that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had not met  the burden of persuading it that the judge’s breach of the duty set out in section 530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> had resulted in a violation  of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. Mr. Tayo Tompouba appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which has allowed his appeal.<strong>The Court of Appeal erred in imposing on Mr. Tayo Tompouba the  burden of proving that his fundamental right had been violated at first  instance.  </strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner stated that section 530(3) imposes a two‑pronged  informational duty on the judge before whom an accused first appears: to ensure  that the accused is duly informed of their fundamental right and of how it is  to be exercised, and, where the circumstances so require, to take the necessary  steps to inform the accused of this.  Chief Justice Wagner affirmed that a breach of this informational duty is an  error of law warranting appellate intervention under section 686(1)(a) of  the <em>Code</em>. As he explained, this  breach, once established, taints the trial court’s judgment and gives rise to a  presumption that the accused’s fundamental right to be tried in the official  language of their choice, which is guaranteed to the accused by section 530  of the <em>Code</em>, was violated. The Crown  can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the  curative proviso in section 686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Code</em>, which allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal where an  error or irregularity shown by the accused did not cause them any prejudice.In this case,  Chief Justice Wagner concluded, first, that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had  proved that an error reviewable on appeal had been made and, second, that the  Crown had failed to establish that Mr. Tayo Tompouba’s fundamental right had  not in fact been violated despite the judge’s breach of his informational duty  under section 530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.  For these reasons, Chief Justice Wagner allowed the appeal, quashed Mr. Tayo  Tompouba’s conviction and ordered that a new trial be held in French."
2024 SCC 15,"<strong>The Supreme Court holds  that the military status of military judges does not violate the constitutional  guarantee of judicial independence to which persons tried before courts martial  are entitled. </strong>These appeals are about whether the requirement under  the <em>National Defence Act</em> that military  judges be military officers violates the right to a hearing by an independent  and impartial tribunal guaranteed under Section 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.   The appeals were brought by nine members of the  Canadian Armed Forces who were accused of various service offences under the  Code of Service Discipline, which forms part of the <em>National Defence Act</em>. Service offences, which include offences  specific to military personnel and offences under the <em>Criminal Code </em>and other Canadian laws, are tried before a court  martial, a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a  superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Courts martial are presided over by  military judges, who are required by the <em>National  Defence Act </em>to have been lawyers and military officers for at least 10  years. As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command.     In the courts martial, most of the nine accused members  challenged the requirement under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be  officers. They argued that this requirement violates their right to a hearing  by an independent and impartial tribunal under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. The divided loyalties of  military judges as judge and officer were said to deflect them from a proper  exercise of their judicial duties and leaves them vulnerable to pressures from  the chain of command.Under Canadian law, courts must evaluate independence  and impartiality under Section 11(d) by asking whether an informed and  reasonable person would perceive the tribunal at issue as independent. In the  courts martial, some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial  independence because of their dual status of judge and officer, and that for  this reason, the accused members’ Section 11(d) rights were infringed. The  Court Martial Appeal Court disagreed, and said that an informed person, viewing  the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through,  would conclude that military judges are sufficiently impartial and independent  to meet the requirement under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter. </em>Therefore, the accused members’ rights were not infringed.  The accused members appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.     The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The status of  military judges as officers under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>is not incompatible with their judicial functions for the  purpose of Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer affirmed  that accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military  judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and  impartiality under Section 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian  criminal courts, but this does not require that the two systems be identical in  every respect. He held that as presently configured in the <em>National Defence Act</em>, Canada’s system of military justice fully  ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account  of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of  maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the forces and public trust in  a disciplined armed forces. Justice Kasirer concluded that properly understood,  the military context does not diminish judicial independence. "
2024 SCC 14,"<strong>The Supreme Court restores  the convictions of a man found guilty of sexual assault and sexual  interference. </strong>This appeal dealt with the  question of whether a judge in a criminal trial made a mistake in understanding  and treating key parts of the complainant’s evidence in a manner that led him  to unfairly convict the accused. In legal terms, this is called  “misapprehending” the evidence. D.F., whose name cannot be  disclosed due to a publication ban protecting the complainant, was accused of  sexual assault, sexual interference (meaning touching someone under the age of  16 for a sexual purpose), and of making sexually explicit material available to  a child. The complainant was eight years old at the time of the alleged  offences. The offences allegedly took place while the accused was spending the  day and evening at the house of the complainant’s mother. The mother testified  that she had been at the house all day and evening except when she briefly stepped  out to a nearby store after dinner. D.F. stayed behind during that time with the  complainant and her two younger siblings. At trial, there were some  inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony under cross-examination  regarding whether or not her mother was home when the alleged sexual touching  happened. However, the trial judge held that any minor inconsistencies in her  testimony were a result of the complainant’s immaturity and confusion, and that  she was otherwise credible and reliable. The trial judge also found the other  witnesses credible and reliable, including the complainant’s mother, who  testified that except for her trip to the store, she had been around the  children all evening and did not observe any wrongdoing. Based on the evidence  as a whole, including the testimonies, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a  reasonable doubt of D.F.’s guilt and convicted him.   D.F. appealed his  convictions. A majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal  from the conviction on the count of making sexually explicit material available  to a child, but allowed the appeal from his other two convictions. In the  majority’s view, the trial judge misapprehended the complainant’s evidence on  whether or not the complainant’s mother was home at the time of the alleged  sexual touching. That mistake was related to an important issue at trial, and played  an essential role in the trial judge’s reasoning process leading to convicting  D.F. Moreover, the majority said that the trial judge did not sufficiently  address the inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and that of her  mother in his decision to convict. For these reasons, the majority ordered that  the convictions for sexual assault and sexual interference be set aside and that  a new trial be held on those counts.    One judge disagreed and  would have dismissed D.F.’s appeal in its entirety. In his view, the trial  judge did not make any errors in assessing the evidence. The trial judge  recognized that the complainant’s evidence regarding the location of her mother  at the time of the offences was inconsistent but he had not relied on it to convict  D.F. Rather, the trial judge had correctly applied a common sense approach to  assessing evidence of child witnesses to determine she was a credible and  reliable witness overall. Finally, the dissenting judge determined that the  trial judge’s reasons sufficiently explained why he was satisfied beyond a  reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offences.  The Crown appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  <strong>The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.  </strong>As such, D.F.’s convictions  for sexual assault and sexual interference are restored. Chief Justice Wagner read  the judgment of the Court. You can watch a recording of it <a href=""https://video.isilive.ca/scc/2024/2024-04-22--40941-oral-english.mp4.html"">here</a>.
