The amount of the surcharge is 30\u00a0percent of any fine imposed, or, where no fine is imposed, $100 for every summary conviction count and $200 for every indictable count. Although sentencing judges have the discretion to increase the amount of the surcharge where appropriate, they cannot decrease the amount or waive the surcharge for any reason. The imposition of the surcharge cannot be appealed. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At sentencing, several offenders challenged the constitutionality of the surcharge on the basis that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, contrary to s.\u00a012 of the Charter, violates their right to liberty and security of the person, contrary to s.\u00a07 of the Charter, or both. The offenders all live in serious poverty and face some combination of addiction, mental illness and disability. While the results were mixed at sentencing, the respective courts of appeal rejected the constitutional challenges.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be allowed. Section\u00a0737 of the Criminal Code infringes s.\u00a012 of the Charter and is not saved by s.\u00a01. It is invalidated with immediate effect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Brown and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The mandatory victim surcharge constitutes punishment, engaging s.\u00a012 of the Charter, and its imposition and enforcement on several of the offenders, as well as the reasonable hypothetical offender, result in cruel and unusual punishment. The surcharge cannot be saved under s.\u00a01 of the Charter. It is not necessary to consider whether s.\u00a07 of the Charter is infringed. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The surcharge constitutes punishment because it flows directly and automatically from conviction and s.\u00a0737(1) itself sets out that it applies \u201cin addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender\u201d. The surcharge also functions in substance like a fine, which is an established punishment, and it is intended to further the purpose and principles of sentencing. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The surcharge constitutes cruel and unusual punishment and therefore violates s.\u00a012 of the Charter, because its impact and effects create circumstances that are grossly disproportionate to what would otherwise be a fit sentence, outrage the standards of decency, and are both abhorrent and intolerable. In the circumstances of this case, the fit sentence for the offenders would not have included the surcharge, as it would have caused undue hardship given their impecuniosity. Sentencing is first and foremost an individualized exercise which balances various goals, while taking into account the particular circumstances of the offender as well as the nature and number of his or her crimes. The crucial issue is whether the offenders are able to pay, and in this case, they are not.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For the offenders in this case and for the reasonable hypothetical offender, the surcharge leads to a grossly disproportionate sentence. Although it advances the valid penal purposes of raising funds for victim support services and of increasing offenders\u2019 accountability to both individual victims of crime and to the community generally, the surcharge causes four interrelated harms to persons like the offenders. First, it causes them to suffer deeply disproportionate financial consequences, regardless of their moral culpability. Second, it causes them to live with the threat of incarceration in two separate and compounding ways \u2014 detention before committal hearings and imprisonment if found in default. Third, the offenders may find themselves targeted by collections efforts endorsed by their province of residence. Fourth, the surcharge creates a de facto indefinite sentence for some of the offenders, because there is no foreseeable chance that they will ever be able to pay it. This ritual of repeated committal hearings, which will continue indefinitely, operates less like debt collection and more like public shaming. Indeterminate sentences are reserved for the most dangerous offenders, and imposing them in addition to an otherwise short\u2011term sentence flouts the fundamental principles at the very foundation of our criminal justice system. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The surcharge also fundamentally disregards proportionality in sentencing. It wrongly elevates the objective of promoting responsibility in offenders above all other sentencing principles, it ignores the fundamental principle of proportionality set out in the Criminal Code, it does not allow sentencing judges to consider mitigating factors or the sentences received by other offenders in similar circumstances, it ignores the objective of rehabilitation, and it undermines Parliament\u2019s intention to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in prison. The cumulative charge-by-charge basis on which the surcharge is imposed increases the likelihood that it will disproportionately harm offenders who are impoverished, addicted and homeless. It will also put self-represented offenders at an additional disadvantage because they may not know that they may negotiate the terms of their plea in order to minimize the amount of the surcharge. While judicial attempts to lessen the disproportion may be salutary, they cannot insulate the surcharge from constitutional review. Indeed, reducing some other part of the sentence may minimize disproportion, but it cannot eliminate the specific and extensive harms caused by the surcharge. Moreover, imposing a nominal fine for the sole purpose of lowering the amount of the surcharge would ignore the legislature\u2019s intent that the surcharge, in its full amount, would apply in all cases as a mandatory punishment. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is unnecessary to engage in a s.\u00a01 Charter analysis, because the state did not put forward any argument or evidence to justify the surcharge if found to breach Charter rights. It follows that the mandatory victim surcharge imposed by s.\u00a0737 of the Criminal Code is unconstitutional.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section\u00a0737 of the Criminal Code should be declared to be of no force and effect immediately. The state has not met the high standard of showing that a declaration with immediate effect would pose a danger to the public or imperil the rule of law. Reading back in the judicial discretion to waive the surcharge that was abrogated in 2013 is also the wrong approach, because it is a highly intrusive remedy, and because Parliament ought to be free to consider how best to revise the imposition and enforcement of the surcharge. Because robust submissions on the issue were not made, it would be inappropriate to grant a remedy to offenders not involved in this case and those no longer in the system who cannot now challenge their sentences. However, a variety of possible remedies exist. The offenders may be able to seek relief in the courts, notably by recourse to s.\u00a024(1) of the Charter. The government could also proceed administratively, while Parliament may act to bring a modified and Charter-compliant version of the surcharge back into the Criminal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The surcharge is constitutionally valid. It does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, nor does it deprive impecunious offenders of their security of the person. Moreover, any deprivation of liberty that may result from its application accords with the principles of fundamental justice. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While the surcharge constitutes punishment within the meaning of s.\u00a012 of the Charter, and while a fit and proportionate sentence for the offenders in this case or the hypothetical impecunious offender would not include the surcharge, the negative effects associated with the surcharge are not abhorrent, intolerable or so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency. As a result, they do not rise to the level of gross disproportionality, and therefore the surcharge cannot be characterized as cruel and unusual. Indeed, a number of the components to the surcharge regime attenuate the particularly severe impact of the surcharge on impecunious offenders.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, offenders who are unable to pay within the prescribed time will not be subject to enforcement mechanisms if they either participate in a fine option program or seek the extension of time to pay to which they are entitled. There are no restrictions on the number of extensions an offender can seek over a given period, and there is no limit on the length of an extension. Extensions may also be granted either before or after the offender defaults, and obtaining an extension is not onerous or procedurally difficult given that applications can be brought by the offender or by someone else on his or her behalf and may be adjudicated either by the court or by a person designated by the court. To the extent that a province establishes procedures that are complex to the point of being inaccessible, this cannot be attributed to the impugned provision but rather to the manner in which the province implements it. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, offenders will not be imprisoned if they default due to poverty; only offenders who have the means to pay, but who choose not to, risk being imprisoned following a committal hearing. While it may be difficult for judges to draw the line between an inability to pay and a refusal to do so, the fact that judges may misapply the law cannot render the surcharge unconstitutional, particularly since the provision providing for committal in default of payment does not establish an overly broad standard that cannot be properly applied by trial judges. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Third, while compelled attendance at a committal hearing will necessarily deprive a defaulting offender of his or her liberty to some degree, the deprivation will only occur where it is necessary in the public interest. Such cases will also be very rare, especially given that non\u2011payment is not a criminal offence. Moreover, there is no evidence that impecunious offenders are in fact routinely being detained unnecessarily pending their committal hearings. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Fourth, an unpaid surcharge cannot be entered as a civil judgment, and therefore, an offender who defaults will not face the same financial consequences as one who defaults in paying a fine or an ordinary debt. Any provincial collection efforts employed against defaulting offenders are neither required nor authorized by the Criminal Code and are therefore not an effect of the impugned surcharge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Fifth, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the stress caused by the surcharge to impecunious offenders is severe enough to make the punishment imposed cruel and unusual. And finally, although the surcharge may not be conducive to attempts by some offenders to achieve rehabilitation and reintegration into society, this alone is not sufficient to meet the high bar for establishing a s.\u00a012 Charter violation. In any event, an offender who is ineligible for a traditional record suspension as a result of his or her inability to pay the surcharge is not left without recourse. While not perfect alternatives, conditional pardons and remission orders may be granted by the Governor in Council. While it is likely that some will face great difficulty in paying the surcharge, courts should not simply accept that the circumstances of the offender at the date of sentencing will necessarily continue into the future. Not only are findings to the contrary pessimistic in nature; they also undermine the very basis on which the principle of rehabilitation is premised.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With respect to s.\u00a07 of the Charter, the surcharge does not engage the offenders\u2019 security interest due to the stress associated with the mandatory imposition of the surcharge. Neither common sense nor the evidence provides a basis for the conclusion that the actual stress impecunious offenders may experience as a result of the surcharge is serious enough that it has a profound effect on their psychological integrity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The offenders\u2019 liberty interest is nevertheless engaged insofar as non-payment of the surcharge triggers the possibility of being compelled to attend a committal hearing which will necessarily entail some deprivation of personal liberty. However, this deprivation of liberty is not overbroad in relation to impecunious offenders \u2014 it is rationally connected to the purpose underlying the committal hearing: to determine whether an offender has the funds to pay the surcharge and to give him or her an opportunity to explain the non-payment. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The mandatory victim surcharge that everyone convicted of a crime has to  pay is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court has ruled. The majority said it was  cruel and unusual punishment, and struck it down.</strong>\r\n   The <em>Criminal  Code </em>says that anyone found guilty of a crime has to pay a \u201cvictim  surcharge.\u201d The amount depends on the type of crime. It is 30% of any fine  charged. If there is no fine, it is $100 for every summary conviction count and  $200 for every indictable (pronounced \u201cin-DYE-ta-bull\u201d) count. (These are  different types of charges, with indictable counts being more serious.) The  surcharge has to be paid even if the judge gives the person a \u201cdischarge,\u201d  meaning there is no other punishment. The money is meant to help victims. A lot of people who commit crimes are poor. Many live  with addictions or mental health issues. Sometimes they simply can\u2019t pay.  Before 2013, a judge could choose not to make someone pay the surcharge if it  would cause too much hardship. Parliament changed the law in 2013 to say that  judges had to impose it no matter what. They could increase it, but couldn\u2019t  lower it. In hardship cases, the most judges could do was give the person more  time to pay. This case involved seven people appealing four  different decisions in two provinces. In each case, the offenders said they couldn\u2019t  afford the surcharge. One person was ordered to pay $1,400. He was homeless,  addicted, and unemployed, with a yearly income of only $4,800. Another was  ordered to pay $700. He had addiction and mental health issues and had only  $136 each month after food and housing were paid for. Other people had  different physical and mental health issues, and some struggled with  addictions. All lived in poverty. But they were still ordered to pay hundreds  or thousands of dollars. Even judges making the orders said the offenders  couldn\u2019t afford to pay, but their hands were tied. The offenders argued this violated section 12 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  which is part of Canada\u2019s constitution<em>.</em> Section 12 says that \u201ceveryone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel  and unusual treatment or punishment.\u201d The lower courts and all judges at the  Supreme Court accepted that the surcharge was \u201cpunishment\u201d; the question was  whether it was \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d \u201cCruel and unusual\u201d means more than just harsh.  It means punishment so unacceptable and extreme that society shouldn\u2019t allow  it. The Quebec and Ontario Courts of Appeal said the  surcharge wasn\u2019t cruel and unusual punishment and was constitutional. They said  all the offenders had to pay it, while conceding they probably wouldn\u2019t be able  to. The majority at the Supreme Court disagreed. It said the  mandatory victim surcharge was, in fact, cruel and unusual punishment. The  surcharge created a crushing financial burden on very poor people (for them, a  few hundred dollars is more like $23,000 for an average Canadian). People who  couldn\u2019t pay were constantly under threat of being arrested and jailed, even if  only briefly, for not paying. They might also be harassed by collections  agencies. They could end up in court over and over again to explain why they  hadn\u2019t paid, which amounts to public shaming. And the surcharge was basically an  unending punishment, because all of this would continue until it was paid.  Offenders couldn\u2019t apply for a pardon that might allow them to get work and  move forward. The majority said this also burdened the justice system, which spent  more trying to get poor people to pay the surcharge than it would ever get  back. The  majority noted that a sentence works best if it is made for the individual. The  mandatory victim surcharge didn\u2019t allow judges to look at a person\u2019s  circumstances, or the best way to rehabilitate them. It also didn\u2019t make sense sometimes\u2014for  example, five  counts of vandalism would have a higher surcharge than a count of murder.  This decision means that judges can\u2019t order victim  surcharges anymore. It doesn\u2019t mean all victim surcharges ordered in the past  are canceled. When a law is struck down in court, it is struck down  retroactively only for the people who fought the case. But the majority noted  that cruel and unusual punishment happens both when it is imposed and when it  is enforced. A convicted person who was ordered to pay a surcharge before the  law was struck down, but hasn\u2019t, could challenge it when brought to court to  explain the non-payment. "

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0person who shares an electronic device with someone else can\u2019t waive  the other user\u2019s <em>Charter</em> rights, the Supreme Court  has ruled. Police violated a man\u2019s <em>Charter</em> rights when they took his computer to search it with only his spouse\u2019s  consent.</strong>\r\n   Mr.  Reeves wasn\u2019t allowed to live in the family home after he was charged with domestic  violence. His spouse told Mr. Reeves\u2019 probation officer that the year before,  she thought she\u2019d seen child pornography on the home computer they shared. In  response to this report, a police officer came to the home. He didn\u2019t have a  search warrant, and didn\u2019t think he had enough evidence of a possible crime to  get one. But Mr. Reeves\u2019 spouse let the officer in and signed a form saying he  could take the computer. The  police kept the computer for four months before doing anything. They didn\u2019t  report to a judge or justice of the peace that they had taken it, which the law  said they had to do. When they finally searched it, they used a faulty warrant.  However, they found 140 images and 22 videos of child pornography. Mr. Reeves  was charged. Section  8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em> says that \u201ceveryone has the right to be secure against  unreasonable search or seizure.\u201d This means the state can\u2019t search or take  something private without permission, unless the law specifically allows it, like  when police have a warrant. Everyone agreed that the police violated Mr.  Reeves\u2019 <em>Charter </em>rights when they didn\u2019t  report the seizure and when they searched the computer with a faulty warrant.  But Mr. Reeves argued the initial seizure of the computer was also a <em>Charter</em> breach. He said that the violations  were together so serious that the files shouldn\u2019t be allowed into evidence. The  Crown (the prosecution) argued the police were allowed to take the shared  computer because Mr. Reeves\u2019 spouse gave them permission. The  judge who heard the pre-trial argument agreed with Mr. Reeves that the computer  evidence couldn\u2019t be used. Without it, Mr. Reeves  was found not guilty. The Court of Appeal said that, given the  series of <em>Charter </em>breaches, this was  a borderline case, but said the evidence should be allowed. It ordered a new  trial.  All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed with the pre-trial judge that the files shouldn\u2019t  be allowed into evidence. They said the not-guilty verdict should stand.  The  majority said that the police breached Mr. Reeves\u2019 <em>Charter </em>rights by taking the computer without his consent and  without a warrant. An individual who shares a computer with someone else takes  the risk that the other person can access their personal data, and maybe even tell  the police about it. But the law shouldn\u2019t allow the police to take the device  or its data directly, without the individual\u2019s consent or a warrant. When two  people share a personal computer, one can\u2019t consent to its search or seizure on  behalf of the other. Only Mr. Reeves could waive his own <em>Charter</em> privacy rights; his spouse could not. When  deciding if section 8 has been violated, courts balance society\u2019s interest in  protecting personal privacy with its interest in allowing police to enforce the  law. The real question isn\u2019t whether someone broke the law (when charges are  laid, there\u2019s usually evidence that they did). It\u2019s whether the police went too  far in trying to find evidence of a crime. Where a police investigation invades  someone\u2019s privacy in a way that could cause the public to lose confidence in  the justice system, courts won\u2019t allow the evidence to be used. While this may  result in a not-guilty verdict, it is necessary to signal the importance of  protecting the privacy of every Canadian, including those never charged with a  crime. The majority said the police went too far when, along with the two other <em>Charter</em> breaches, the officer took  Mr. Reeves\u2019 home computer without his permission or a warrant.  The  majority didn\u2019t decide if the police officer\u2019s entry into the home was legal,  because it didn\u2019t rule on whether one person can allow the police to enter and search  shared spaces. It wasn\u2019t the central issue in this case. The devices  Canadians use every day, like laptops and cell phones, contain a great deal of private  information. They can also be used to access even more information stored  elsewhere, like in email and social media accounts. This case was important  because it affected the privacy rights of all Canadians in shared devices."

In 2009, Revenu Qu\u00e9bec issued\nunexpected notices of assessment against several corporations of Groupe Melior.\nThese notices and the subsequent collection action resulted in the bankruptcy\nof most of the corporations and of the holding company. This caused the total\nloss of value of the patrimony of Fiducie, which was comprised exclusively of\nshares in the holding company. B and M, acting in their capacity as trustees of\nFiducie, commenced an action against a group of professionals (lawyers and\naccountants) to recover the lost value of Fiducie\u2019s patrimony, claiming that they\nhad committed a number of professional faults in setting up the tax structure\nof Groupe Melior and, in doing so, had breached their duty to advise Fiducie. The\nprofessionals moved to dismiss the action for lack of sufficient interest under\nart.\u00a0165(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u201cC.C.P.\u201d). The motion was allowed by the Superior Court and\nthe action was dismissed. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed B and M\u2019s\nappeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J.\ndissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver,\nKarakatsanis, Gascon, Brown, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The\ncourts below did not err in dismissing Fiducie\u2019s claim for lack of sufficient\ninterest under art.\u00a0165(3) C.C.P. The principles of procedural and\ncorporate law in Quebec bar shareholders from exercising rights of action that\nbelong to corporations in which they hold shares, unless they can demonstrate a\nbreach of a distinct obligation and a direct injury that is distinct from that\nsuffered by the corporation in question. In this case, since the claim does not\nestablish these requirements, B and M have not demonstrated a direct and\npersonal interest that would allow Fiducie to claim damages from the\nprofessionals.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article\n55 C.C.P. defines the basic rule of standing in Quebec and sets out the\nrequirement that a party bringing an action must have a sufficient interest\ntherein. The interest required must be direct and personal and cannot, barring\nan exception at law, be premised on another party\u2019s right of action. The\nexistence of a sufficient interest is one of the conditions that define whether\nor not an action is admissible at law and it is one of the preliminary\nconditions that individuals must fulfill before a court will consider their\nclaim. It is not presumed by the court; rather, it must be established by the\nclaimant, who must provide a precise statement of facts to underpin the\nsufficiency of his or her interest in the motion to institute proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\ndefendant may challenge the sufficiency of interest of the claimant under art.\u00a0165(3)\nC.C.P. at the preliminary motions stage, but this challenge will only\nsucceed where the plaintiff clearly has no interest. Courts must act with\nprudence before preliminarily dismissing a claim on this basis; however, since\na sufficient interest is a condition of admissibility for all claims, courts\nmust be capable of determining its existence and dismiss claims where the\nalleged interest is insufficient. The scarcity of judicial resources\nrequires that courts be able to dismiss claims that are manifestly unfounded at\na preliminary stage. The sufficient interest of the claimant\nmust therefore be capable of determination at the stage of preliminary motions,\nwithout the court needing to determine whether the claim is founded in law. In\nall actions for civil liability, this requires that the sufficient interest of\nthe claimant be established before the court considers the claim on its merits.\nThe facts alleged by the claimant must relate to the substantive right at\nissue, since the existence of a sufficient interest cannot be determined in the\nabstract. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthis case, it was incumbent upon Fiducie to allege facts necessary to\ndemonstrate the sufficiency of its interest in claiming damages for civil\nliability against the professionals. To assess whether it can succeed, the\nsubstantive rules of corporate law under the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec must\nbe considered. Under the civil law of Quebec, shareholders do not possess a\nright of action in relation to faults committed against a corporation in which\nthey hold shares. Article 298 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec recognizes\nthat legal persons such as corporations have a distinct legal personality. Like\nother claimants with the capacity to act, the corporation itself must exercise\nits rights of action in its own name. The corollary is that shareholders may\nnot personally exercise a right of action that belongs to the corporation. In Houle\nv. Canadian National Bank, 1990 CanLII 58 (SCC), [1990] 3 S.C.R. 122, the Court recognized that\nin certain circumstances shareholders may possess their own right of action\nagainst the same defendant as the corporation if they can establish (1)\u00a0that\nthe defendant breached a distinct obligation owed to the shareholders, and (2)\u00a0that\nthis breach resulted in a direct injury suffered by the shareholders,\nindependent from that suffered by the corporation. The Court did not,\nhowever, create an exception to the general rule. Shareholders can have an\nindependent right of action where they establish the essential elements of\ncivil liability in a way that is distinct from the fault and injury caused to\nthe corporation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthis case, B and M failed to demonstrate that Fiducie had an independent cause\nof action in civil liability against the professionals. The alleged facts that\nrelate to the first requirement of Houle refer primarily to legal\nobligations owed to the corporations of Groupe Melior and not to Fiducie;\naccordingly, they do not suffice to give the latter an independent right of\naction against the professionals as they do not disclose the breach of an\nindependent legal obligation owed to Fiducie. As for the second requirement,\nthe injury alleged by Fiducie to have been caused by the professionals \u2014 the\nbankruptcy and ensuing loss of the seniors\u2019 residence \u2014 was suffered by the\ncorporations of Groupe Melior, not directly by Fiducie. The amount\nclaimed by Fiducie as damages for the total loss of value of\nits patrimony was calculated primarily to reflect the net value of the seniors\u2019\nresidences owned and operated by the corporations. However, these residences\nbelonged to the corporations and not to Fiducie, although as the ultimate\nshareholder, it inevitably suffered from the bankruptcy. As a result, the\nalleged facts do not disclose a distinct injury suffered directly by Fiducie.\nAlthough the characterization of an injury as direct or indirect\nrequires an assessment of causation which is typically left to the trial judge,\nin this case, the alleged facts were not sufficient to establish the required\ninterest of the claimant.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nC\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. The courts below erred\nin dismissing Fiducie\u2019s motion to institute proceedings (\u201cMIP\u201d) at the\npreliminary stage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An\naction may be dismissed at the preliminary stage, but only if it is clear that\nthe plaintiff has no interest under art.\u00a0165(3) C.C.P. At this\nstage, the plaintiff must allege the necessary elements of the substantive\nright being claimed. To be sufficient to show that an interest exists at the\nadmissibility stage, allegations must, at a minimum, be clear and precise;\nhowever, in the case of causation, an allusion is generally sufficient. Where\nthe allegations are not contradicted, the court must assume them to be true.\nGiven the serious consequences of dismissing an action prematurely, the\nplaintiff must be given an opportunity to be heard on the merits if there is\nany doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Houle\nshows that, in certain exceptional circumstances, shareholders may have a right\nof action distinct from that of the corporation for a loss in the value of\ntheir shares, and may therefore have a sufficient interest to bring an action\nin their own names. For this purpose, the shareholders must allege\n(i)\u00a0that there was a breach of a distinct obligation owed to them and\n(ii)\u00a0that the breach caused direct personal damage to them. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Thus,\nthe concept of distinct or independent damage is not an additional condition to\nbe met. The shareholder\u2019s damage need not be unrelated to that of the\ncorporation. In Houle, the Court insisted only on damage that was direct\nand personal \u2014 as required by the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 and explicitly\nrecognized that a loss in the value of shares may, in exceptional\ncircumstances, constitute such damage. Once the value of shares is at issue, a\nshareholder\u2019s damage cannot be completely dissociated from that of the\ncorporation. The Court of Appeal therefore erred in this case by requiring that\nFiducie allege damage that was entirely distinct from and independent of the\ndamage sustained by the Groupe Melior corporations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At\nthe preliminary stage, the allegations in the MIP are sufficient to establish that\nFiducie has the necessary interest to bring an action. According to the\nuncontradicted allegations, there were separate contracts of mandate between,\non the one hand, Fiducie and the professionals and, on the other hand, the\nGroupe Melior corporations and the same professionals. It is also alleged in\nthe MIP that the professionals breached their obligations under their mandates\nwith Fiducie, thereby causing direct personal damage to it, that is, the\ndestruction of its trust patrimony. As for the use of the value of the seniors\u2019\nresidences owned by the Groupe Melior corporations as a method of valuation, it\nis a question that relates solely to the quantum of damages, and not to the\nvery existence of damage. To the extent that there is ambiguity in the allegations\nwith regard to the amount of the damages being claimed, the solution lies in an\namendment of the MIP and in the expert evidence that will be presented at\ntrial, not in the death sentence represented by dismissal of the action at the\npreliminary stage. Where, as in this case, there are sufficient allegations, it\nis well established that a judge must refrain from deciding a question of fact,\nor even a question of mixed fact and law, at the preliminary stage unless, in\nthe case of an exception to dismiss based on the plaintiff\u2019s clearly having no\ninterest, sufficient evidence is adduced at that stage. Thus, questions of\nfact, such as the determination of the directness of the damage, must be left\nto the trial judge and decided after the relevant evidence has been considered.\nThe rule is the same where fault, a question of mixed fact and law, is\nconcerned. In this case, therefore, it is for the trial judge to determine,\nafter reviewing the evidence, whether the alleged breaches, damage and causal\nconnection are sufficient to establish Fiducie\u2019s interest on the merits. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It\nis clearly premature to dismiss the action at this stage of the proceedings. The scarcity of judicial resources must not become a pretext for\nlimiting access to the courts to cases in which there is a clear chance of\nsuccess or to plaintiffs whose interest is not in any doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Houle v.

        "summary": "<strong>Shareholders usually can\u2019t sue when a corporation is harmed, causing their  shares to lose value, the Supreme Court has confirmed.</strong>\r\n     This  case dealt with a complex business structure. Mr. Brunette and Mr. Maynard managed  a trust. The trust owned only one thing: 100% of the shares in a holding  company (a company set up to own shares in <em>other</em> companies). That holding company owned shares in companies together known as  the Groupe Melior, which owned and operated seniors\u2019 homes. In 2009, most of  these companies went bankrupt after they received unexpected tax bills. These  bankruptcies also caused the holding company to go bankrupt. Since the only  thing the trust owned was shares in the holding company, it was now worthless. The  Groupe Melior\u2019s business structure was based on advice from lawyers and  accountants. Mr. Brunette and Mr. Maynard said the lawyers and accountants  didn\u2019t do their jobs properly. They said this caused the surprise tax bills,  which caused the bankruptcies, which led to the complete loss of value of the trust.  They also argued the lawyers and accountants were supposed to tell the trust  about possible problems with the tax structure right away, but didn\u2019t. Mr.  Brunette and Mr. Maynard sued the lawyers and accountants for $55 million on  the trust\u2019s behalf.  The  main issue was whether the trust, represented by Mr. Brunette and Mr. Maynard,  was allowed to sue the accountants and lawyers. Before the trial, accountants  and lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing Mr. Brunette and Mr.  Maynard clearly had no \u201cinterest\u201d to sue. In law, having an interest means that  the issue affects you in a personal and direct way. It is a necessary condition  to have a judge hear your claim in court. If a person being sued thinks that  the person suing them clearly has no interest, they can ask that a judge reject  the lawsuit before a trial takes place. This makes sure that courts don\u2019t waste  time and resources on cases that have no chance of success. In the present  case, the issue was whether the trust had a sufficient interest for the case to  go to trial. The  problem with the claim was that the trust was only a shareholder of the  companies that went bankrupt. In Quebec\u2019s civil law, as well as the common law  used in the rest of Canada, shareholders usually can\u2019t sue for damages to a  company they hold shares in. This is particularly true if the damage results in  a loss in value of their shares. Only the company has the right to sue. This is  in part because the law considers that when damage is done to a company,  shareholders are harmed only indirectly. According to the <em>Civil Code of Quebec</em>, only direct harm can be claimed in court. The  only time shareholders can sue is if the wrongdoer owes them a separate legal  duty than the one owed to the corporation, and that this causes a separate harm  to the shareholders. In order to decide if the trust had an interest that would  give it the right to sue, the court had to decide if the lawyers and  accountants owed it a separate duty and caused it a separate and direct harm. The  trial judge and Court of Appeal agreed that the trust couldn\u2019t sue. The  majority at the Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts. It said the Groupe Melior  corporations were directly harmed, but not the trust. The lawyers and  accountants did not have an obligation to inform and advise the trust about the  Groupe Melior\u2019s tax structure. Also, the trust\u2019s loss was the same as that lost  by the Groupe Melior corporations (the value of the seniors\u2019 homes). It was the  exact same harm, which meant that it couldn\u2019t be claimed by the shareholders,  only by the companies. The majority noted that the business structure was  designed to protect the trust from having to pay the Groupe Melior\u2019s debts. But  this also meant it couldn\u2019t exercise the corporations\u2019 right to sue.  This case came from  Quebec, which uses the civil law. Both systems apply different rules to solve  legal problems. Because they are different, they don\u2019t always end up with the  same result. But often, like in this case, they do.  "

At the police station,\nthe qualified technician failed to observe the accused himself for a period of\n15 or 20\u00a0minutes before administering each breathalyzer test. The accused\nargued that this was a breach of the duty to operate the breathalyzer properly\nand that it was sufficient to rebut the presumptions of accuracy and identity\napplicable to breathalyzer test results under s.\u00a0258(1)(c) of the Criminal\nCode, which had to lead to his acquittal in the absence of additional\nevidence from the Crown. At trial, only the qualified technician testified. The\ntrial judge found that because the observation procedure, whose general purpose\nwas to ensure the reliability of the results, had not been followed in this\ncase, this was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the reliability of\nthe results. He therefore acquitted the accused. On appeal, the Superior Court\nset aside the judgment of acquittal and ordered a new trial. A majority of the\nCourt of Appeal set aside the Superior Court\u2019s judgment and restored the\nverdict of acquittal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal is allowed, the verdict of\nacquittal is set aside and a new trial is ordered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Brown, Rowe\nand Martin\u00a0JJ.: To rebut the presumptions in s.\u00a0258(1)(c) of the Criminal\nCode, an accused must adduce evidence tending to show that the\nmalfunctioning or improper operation of the approved instrument casts doubt on\nthe reliability of the results. The accused\u2019s burden is discharged if the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1)\u00a0the accused adduces evidence relating\ndirectly to the malfunctioning or improper operation of the instrument, and\n(2)\u00a0the accused establishes\u00a0that this defect tends to cast doubt on\nthe reliability of the results. In the case of improper operation of an\ninstrument, while abstract evidence alone may sometimes meet the requirement of\nraising a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the results, it is more\nlikely that evidence that relates more concretely to the facts in issue will be\nrequired. What is essential is that the possibility that the defect affected the\nreliability of the results is serious enough to raise a reasonable doubt.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe instant case, the evidence adduced did not rebut the presumptions. Even if\nit is assumed that improper operation of the instrument was established here\nbased on failure to complete the 15\u2011 or 20\u2011minute observation period,\nthere was clearly no evidence that this improper operation tended to cast doubt\non the reliability of the results. The mere improper operation alleged by the\naccused did not in itself tend to show that the reliability of the results was\nin doubt. Without evidence that related more concretely to the facts in issue,\nthe accused\u2019s argument was in the realm of speculation and could not satisfy\nthe reasonable doubt test. Acceptance of theoretical evidence based on\nspeculation reflects a misinterpretation of the accused\u2019s burden of proof,\nwhich is an error of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J.\n(dissenting): The appeal must be dismissed. An accused who seeks to counter the\npresumptions in s.\u00a0258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code bears only the\nburden of raising a reasonable doubt about a malfunction or improper operation\nof the breathalyzer that could affect the reliability of the results. Requiring\nevidence that relates more concretely to the facts in issue imposes an\nobligation on the accused to cast doubt on the accuracy of the results on the\nfacts of the case, which is contrary to the Court\u2019s reasoning in R. v. St\u2011Onge\nLamoureux, 2012 SCC 57, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 187.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nSt\u2011Onge Lamoureux, the Court found that the requirement of adducing\nevidence tending to show that\nthe instrument was malfunctioning or was operated improperly was justified under s.\u00a01 of the Charter, notably because\nthere was still a real possibility that the accused could counter the statutory\npresumptions by showing that the relevant procedures had not been followed, in\nwhich case the reliability of the results could not be assumed. Thus, where the\nevidence tends to show \u2014 on the reasonable doubt standard \u2014 that the\nmalfunctioning or improper operation of the breathalyzer increased the\npossibility of an inaccurate result, reliability is affected and the accused\nhas met his or her burden. The accused does not have to tender additional\nevidence in order to directly raise a reasonable doubt about the accuracy of\nthe results on the facts of the case. It is sufficient for the accused to\nadduce evidence tending to show that a recommended procedure was not faithfully\nfollowed and that the purpose of the procedure is to ensure the reliability of\nthe results.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthis regard, a qualified technician\u2019s testimony may be sufficient to counter\nthe presumptions. Where the technician testifies about a recommended procedure,\nstates that its purpose is to ensure the reliability of the results and,\nfinally, admits that he or she did not follow the procedure faithfully or does\nnot know whether it was followed faithfully, the accused is not obliged to\ntender additional evidence. If the Crown then fails to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the deficiency in question had no impact on the accuracy\nof the results on the facts of the case, the Crown completely loses the\nbenefit of the statutory presumptions in s.\u00a0258(1)(c). It is for\nthe trier of fact to assess the evidence adduced in order to determine whether\nit is sufficient to counter the statutory presumptions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe instant case, the trial judge made no error of law that would warrant\nappellate intervention in finding that the accused had raised a reasonable\ndoubt about improper operation of the breathalyzer that could affect the\nresults and that the presumptions of accuracy and identity in s.\u00a0258(1)(c)\nhad therefore been countered. It was open to the trial judge to make that\nfinding in light of the concrete and specific evidence showing that a procedure\nfor ensuring the reliability of the results had not been followed and that this\ndeficiency could affect the reliability of the results. Requiring an accused to\ntestify about his or her alcohol consumption and physiological reactions, even\nthough the qualified technician\u2019s testimony was sufficient to raise a\nreasonable doubt about improper operation of the breathalyzer that could affect\nthe reliability of the results, would upset the delicate balance between the\nconstitutional rights of accused persons and Parliament\u2019s objectives.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally,\nthe Court should not order a new trial based on arguments made for the first\ntime on appeal, because to do so would be to give the Crown a second chance to\nhave the accused convicted. Such a result would be contrary to the double\njeopardy principle.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred\nto: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>In a criminal case, \u201creasonable\u201d doubt should be based  on evidence, not speculation, the Supreme Court has confirmed.</strong>\r\n     In 2012, Mr. Cyr-Langlois was pulled over on suspicion  of drunk driving. He was taken to a police station, where his blood alcohol  level was tested with a breathalyzer device. Following standard procedure, two  breath samples were taken about 20 minutes apart. The officer who took the  samples didn\u2019t stay in the same room with Mr. Cyr-Langlois to watch him before  each test. Another officer did. Mr. Cyr-Langlois blew over the legal limit for  both samples. He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and  driving with blood alcohol \u201cover 80\u201d (more than 80 mg of alcohol in 100 mL of  blood). This appeal was about the \u201cover 80\u201d charge. When the Crown (the prosecution) charges someone with  a crime, it has to prove the person committed the crime beyond a \u201creasonable  doubt.\u201d This is a very high standard, but it is not absolute certainty (in law,  as in life, very few things can be proven with 100% confidence). If a judge or  jury thinks an accused person is \u201cprobably\u201d guilty, they have to find the  person <em>not</em> guilty. \u201cProbably\u201d is not  enough. On the other hand, if a doubt is purely theoretical or imaginary, and  not based on evidence, it is not \u201creasonable\u201d doubt. This high standard is  important because everyone\u2014even police, lawyers, and judges\u2014can make mistakes.  But mistakes are less likely to happen when this high standard is met. In a drunk driving case, the main evidence against a  person is usually a blood alcohol test. A breathalyzer test is assumed to be trustworthy  (that is, proving drunkenness beyond reasonable doubt) unless the accused person  can show it isn\u2019t. They would have to show evidence that the device may not  have been working properly, or was used incorrectly, <em>and</em> that this could affect the reliability of the results. This  would be reasonable doubt. Unless the Crown had other evidence, the person  would have to be found not guilty. Mr. Cyr-Langlois didn\u2019t argue that the breathalyzer  wasn\u2019t working. He said the police officer didn\u2019t use it properly, because the  procedure wasn\u2019t followed exactly. He said a police officer had to wait and  watch the suspected drunk person for 20 minutes, take a sample, wait 20  minutes, and take a sample again. The reason the officer was supposed to watch  the person was to make sure nothing happened during that time that could affect  the result. For example, burping or throwing up could bring traces of alcohol directly  from the stomach into the mouth, which could change the result. Mr.  Cyr-Langlois said the police officer who took the samples left the room. The  officer wasn\u2019t sure if his colleague had watched Mr. Cyr-Langlois the whole  time. Mr. Cyr-Langlois said this meant the procedure wasn\u2019t followed, so the  test results couldn\u2019t be trusted. He said he should be found not guilty. The summary conviction judge agreed with Mr.  Cyr-Langlois, and found him not guilty. The Crown appealed to the Superior  Court, which cancelled the not-guilty verdict and ordered a new trial. The  Court of Appeal ruled for Mr. Cyr-Langlois, saying the not-guilty verdict  should stand. The majority at the Supreme Court canceled the  not-guilty verdict and said there should be a new trial. Mr. Cyr-Langlois\u2019  arguments were speculation, not reasonable doubt. He didn\u2019t suggest that anything  happened before the two samples that might have made the test less reliable,  like a digestive issue. He argued it was enough that an officer might not have  watched him the whole time, and <em>theoretically</em> something could have been missed. To raise reasonable doubt, he had to show  concrete proof the incorrect use of the breathalyzer could have affected the  results and made them untrustworthy. For example, he could have testified that  he had burped before the samples were taken. He didn\u2019t testify, so it didn\u2019t  matter if an officer was watching him for the whole time or not. This decision was  given from the bench on October 17, 2018. The Court released written reasons  explaining it on December 6, 2018. The Court also released two other decisions  involving breathalyzers about six weeks before this one: <em><a href=\"37395-37403-eng.aspx\">R. v.  Gubbins</a></em> and <em><a href=\"37207-eng.aspx\">R. v. Awashish</a></em>.  "

The articles contained statements by the source that, if\ntrue, could provide strong evidence implicating him in multiple terrorism\noffences. The RCMP successfully applied ex parte to the Ontario Court of\nJustice, under s.\u00a0487.014 of the Criminal Code,\nfor an order directing Vice Media to produce the screen\ncaptures of the messages exchanged with the source. Rather than producing that\nmaterial, Vice Media brought an application in the Superior Court to quash the\norder. The reviewing judge dismissed Vice Media\u2019s challenge to the production order,\nholding that it was open to the authorizing judge to conclude that the media\u2019s\ninterest was outweighed by the public interest in obtaining reliable evidence\nof very serious terrorism offences.

Lessard, 1991 CanLII 49 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 421,\nand its companion case, Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick\n(Attorney General), 1991 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 459, continues to provide a suitable model for considering applications\nfor search warrants and production orders relating to the media and provides adequate protection to the media and the special role it\nplays in Canadian society. However, certain aspects of\nthat framework should be refined: its factors should be reorganized; the effect\nof prior partial publication of the materials sought should be assessed on a\ncase\u2011by\u2011case basis; and a modified standard of review should be\nadopted when reviewing an order related to the media that was made ex parte.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nLessard framework, which seeks to balance the state\u2019s interest in the\ninvestigation and prosecution of crime and the media\u2019s right to privacy in\ngathering and disseminating the news, sets out nine factors for judges to\nconsider when determining whether to issue a search warrant relating to the\nmedia. These factors should be reorganized to make them\neasier to apply in practice. On an application for a\nproduction order against the media, a four-part analysis should be applied: (1)\u00a0the\nauthorizing judge must consider whether to exercise his or her discretion to\nrequire notice to the media; (2)\u00a0all statutory preconditions must be met; (3)\u00a0the\nauthorizing judge must balance the state\u2019s interest in the investigation and\nprosecution of crimes and the media\u2019s right to privacy in gathering and\ndisseminating the news; and (4)\u00a0if the authorizing judge decides to\nexercise his or her discretion to issue the order, he or she should consider\nimposing conditions to ensure that the media will not be unduly impeded in the\npublishing and dissemination of the news. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to the first stage of the analysis, a presumptive notice requirement should not be imposed in situations where the police are seeking a production order in relation\nto the media. The traditional model of ex parte applications gives effect to the\nlanguage of the Criminal Code and to this Court\u2019s decision in R.\u00a0v.\nNational Post, 2010 SCC 16, [2010] 1\nS.C.R. 477. The Criminal Code permits ex parte applications for production orders, subject to the authorizing\njudge\u2019s overriding discretion to require notice where he or she deems\nappropriate. Absent urgency or other circumstances that justify proceeding ex\nparte, the authorizing judge may find it desirable to require that notice\nbe given to the media, especially if he or she considers that more information\nis necessary to properly balance the rights and interests at stake. However, that\nconclusion is not mandatory. The police should show some evidentiary basis for why\nthere is urgency or other circumstances that justify proceeding ex parte; bare assertions\nwill not provide a basis for doing so. A broad and unsupported claim that the media is\nunlikely to cooperate with police or that the media could theoretically put the\nmaterials beyond the reach of authorities if notice were to be given should not suffice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nperforming the balancing exercise at the third stage of the analysis, the\nauthorizing judge should consider all of the circumstances, including, but not\nlimited to, the likelihood and extent of any potential chilling effects; the\nscope of the materials sought by the police and whether the order sought is\nnarrowly tailored; the likely probative value of the materials; whether there\nare alternative sources from which the information may reasonably be obtained\nand, if so, whether the police have made all reasonable efforts to obtain the\ninformation from those sources; the effect of prior partial publication of the\nmaterials sought; and more broadly, the vital role that the media plays in the\nfunctioning of a democratic society and the fact that the media will generally\nbe an innocent third party. The decision as to whether to grant the order\nsought is discretionary, and the relative importance of the various factors\nguiding that discretion will vary from case to case. Although chilling effects\ncannot be overlooked, they should not be presumed in all cases regardless of\nthe circumstances; rather, the existence and extent of any potential chilling\neffects should be assessed on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis. Further, the\ndistinction between confidential and non-confidential sources should not be\nerased. Additionally, a strict necessity test for production orders should not\nbe imposed. While probative value may be a relevant consideration, requiring\nthe police to demonstrate that a\nproduction order is necessary to secure a conviction would effectively transform the production order application into a\ntrial of the alleged offence on the merits and would seriously undermine the\nability of the police to investigate and gather evidence of potential\ncriminality.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Rather\nthan being assessed as an independent factor to be considered on its own, prior\npartial publication of the information sought should now be treated as part of\nthe overall Lessard balancing exercise. While prior partial publication\nwas considered in Lessard as a factor that always militates in favour of\ngranting an order, the effect of prior partial publication should now be\nassessed on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis. Prior partial publication should\nnot necessarily lessen the degree of protection afforded to the unpublished\nmaterials, since permitting state access to these materials still interferes\nwith the media\u2019s right to privacy in gathering and disseminating the news and\ncompelled production of these materials may still cause chilling effects. In\ndetermining the effect of prior partial publication, the authorizing judge\nshould consider all the circumstances, including the nature of the materials\n(both published and unpublished) and how much of the full body of materials has\nalready been published. This more nuanced approach adds greater flexibility to\nthe Lessard framework and permits a more contextual inquiry.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nstandard of review to be applied to ex parte production orders targeting\nthe media should be a modified version of the standard set out in R. v. Garofoli, 1990 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421. The traditional Garofoli approach, namely, whether in light of the record before the authorizing judge, as\namplified on review, the latter\ncould have granted the authorization, is highly\ndeferential and, in some\ncases, works unfairness due to absence of the media at the authorization\nstage. In such circumstances, the authorizing judge would have performed the Lessard\nanalysis without having fully weighed both sides of the scale. A decision made\nwithout having considered all of the relevant information that could reasonably\nhave affected the outcome cannot rightly be shown deference, and therefore a\nfresh weighing by the reviewing judge is justified. Thus,\nthe following test should be applied:\nif the media points to information not before the authorizing judge that, in\nthe reviewing judge\u2019s opinion, could reasonably have affected the authorizing\njudge\u2019s decision to issue the order, then the media will be entitled to a de\nnovo review. If, on the other hand, the media fails to meet this threshold\nrequirement, then the traditional Garofoli standard will apply. Where\nthe media was given notice and appeared before the authorizing judge, there is\ngenerally good reason to apply the traditional Garofoli standard on\nreview, since permitting a de novo review may do little more than add\nunnecessary time and expense. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying the refined Lessard framework to the facts of this case, the production order should not be set\naside. First, it was open to\nthe authorizing judge to proceed ex parte and decline to exercise his discretion to\nrequire notice. The authorizing\njudge was justified in relying on the police\u2019s explanation for seeking the\norder ex parte, which included the risk that Vice Media could move the materials beyond\nthe reach of Canadian courts if alerted to the police\u2019s interest in the material. Vice Media did not point to any information not before the\nauthorizing judge that could reasonably have affected the decision to issue the\norder. Accordingly, the traditional Garofoli standard of review applies.\nSecond, the statutory preconditions for the issuance of a production\norder were satisfied. Notably, the evidence\nof the police provided reasonable grounds to believe that (1)\u00a0the source had committed certain offences; (2)\u00a0Vice Media had in its possession the\nmaterials sought; and (3)\u00a0those materials would\nafford evidence respecting the commission of the alleged offences.\nThird, based on the record, it was\nopen to the authorizing judge in conducting the Lessard\nbalancing exercise to conclude that the state\u2019s interest in the investigation and\nprosecution of crime outweighed\nthe media\u2019s right to privacy in gathering and\ndisseminating the news. Even on a de novo review, the order was properly granted. Disclosure of the materials sought would not reveal a confidential\nsource; no \u201coff the record\u201d or \u201cnot for attribution\u201d communications would be\ndisclosed; there is no alternative source through which the materials sought\nmay be obtained; the source used the media to publicize his activities with a\nterrorist organization as a sort of spokesperson on its behalf; and the state\u2019s\ninterest in investigating and prosecuting allegations\nof serious terrorism offences weighs heavily in the\nbalance. Fourth, the authorizing\njudge imposed adequate terms in the production order, providing Vice Media with ample time to comply with\nthe order. Vice Media thus had sufficient\nopportunity to move to have the production order set aside, as it did.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is neither necessary nor appropriate in this case to formally recognize\nthat freedom of the press enjoys distinct and independent constitutional\nprotection under s.\u00a02(b) of the Charter. The appeal can\nreadily be disposed of without rethinking s.\u00a02(b), and the matter\nwas not fully argued by the parties or considered by the courts below.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally,\nthis\ncase does not engage the new Journalistic Sources Protection Act because\nthe facts arose before the legislation came into force.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella,\nKarakatsanis and Martin\u00a0JJ.: A strong, independent\nand responsible press ensures that the public\u2019s opinions about its democratic\nchoices are based on accurate and reliable information. This is not a\ndemocratic luxury \u2014 there can be no democracy without it. Section\u00a02(b) of the Charter contains a distinct\nconstitutional press right which protects the media\u2019s core expressive functions \u2014 its right to\ngather and disseminate information for the public benefit without undue\ninterference. The press enjoys\nthis constitutional protection, not only because \u201cfreedom of the press and\nother media\u201d is specifically mentioned in the text of s.\u00a02(b), but\nalso because of its distinct and independent role. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Strong constitutional\nsafeguards against state intrusion are a necessary precondition for the press\nto perform its essential democratic role effectively. A\nvigorous, rigorous, and independent press holds people and institutions to\naccount, uncovers the truth, and informs the public. It further provides the public\nwith the information it needs to engage in informed debate. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Given\nthe media\u2019s unique role, the purpose underlying protection for the press in\ns.\u00a02(b) is related to, but separate from, the broader guarantee of\nfreedom of expression. When the state seeks access to\ninformation in the hands of the media through a production order, both the press\u2019\ns.\u00a02(b) rights and s.\u00a08 Charter privacy rights are engaged. A rigorously\nprotective harmonized analysis is therefore required. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\npress\u2019 s.\u00a02(b) right includes not only the right to transmit news\nand other information, but also the right to gather this information without\nundue interference from government. Section\u00a02(b)\u2019s press and\nmedia guarantee includes protection for journalistic\nwork product, such as a\nreporter\u2019s personal notes, recordings of interviews, or source contact lists.\nIt also includes protecting communications with confidential\nsources as well as those\nwhose comments are \u201coff the record\u201d or \u201cnot for attribution\u201d. And it includes\nprotecting the journalist\u2019s documentation of his or her investigative work.\nThese are the indispensable tools which help the press gather, assess and\ndisseminate information. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This\nCourt previously set out the approach for how s. 8 applies to production orders when\nthe target is the press in Lessard and its companion case, New Brunswick. In these cases, the Court\nheld that there must be a balancing of the constitutional s.\u00a08 privacy\nrights of the press with the interests of the state in investigating crime. Both cases were decided\non the assumption that although the press had enhanced privacy interests under\ns.\u00a08, there was no distinct role for the press\u2019 s.\u00a02(b) rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An\napproach based solely on s.\u00a08 privacy rights is no longer sustainable. Recognizing a distinct press guarantee in s.\u00a02(b) of the Charter\nmeans that the press is no longer just the \u201cbackdrop\u201d referred to in New\nBrunswick. An independent, distinct protection for\nthe press in s.\u00a02(b) requires an approach that explicitly\naddresses those rights, as well as the s.\u00a08 privacy rights. The fact that both\nconstitutional rights for the press are engaged suggests a new harmonized\nanalysis, in which the press\u2019 right to be secure against unreasonable search\nand seizure as well as its right to be protected from undue interference\nwith legitimate newsgathering activities, are explicitly taken into account. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 What\nis now required is a proportionality inquiry showing that the benefit\nof the state\u2019s interests in obtaining the information outweighs the harmful\nimpact on the press\u2019 constitutionally protected s.\u00a08 and s.\u00a02(b)\nrights. Among the considerations to\nbe weighed by authorizing judges are: the media\u2019s reasonable expectation of\nprivacy; whether there is a need to target the press at all; whether the evidence is available from any other source, and if so,\nwhether reasonable steps were taken to obtain it; and whether the proposed\norder is narrowly tailored to interfere with the press\u2019 rights no more than\nnecessary. Generally, the more intrusive the proposed\norder is on the s.\u00a08 privacy and s.\u00a02(b) rights of the media,\nthe greater the impact on the press\u2019 ability to gather and publish the news.\nAnd, in turn, the greater the harmful impact on the public\u2019s right to know the\nfruits of the press\u2019 activities. An obvious collateral impact on the press of\nbeing required to comply with a production order is a chilling effect not only\non the particular press being targeted, but on the press generally.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 On\nthe other side of the balance, the more serious the crime under investigation,\nthe more cogent the evidence sought and the more urgent the investigative need,\nthe stronger the state\u2019s interest will be. While the cogency of the evidence is\na relevant consideration, an\nassessment of whether it is necessary for the Crown to obtain a conviction is\nnot required in evaluating the strength of the state\u2019s interest.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Recognizing\nthat s.\u00a02(b) requires a more rigorous approach to authorizations\nagainst the press compels clarification of some aspects of the jurisprudence,\nthe first being the relevance of prior publication. One of the media\u2019s core\nfunctions is the exercise of discretion over what is and is not published, and\nthere is often an expanse of unpublished material behind each published story.\nState access to the unpublished portion clearly interferes with both privacy\nand newsgathering. Where part or all of a communication with a journalist was\nintended or understood to be \u201coff the record\u201d, it too is entitled to protection\nfrom disclosure requirements. This aligns with the need to protect journalists\u2019\nsource materials even where the identification of a confidential source is not\nat issue. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally,\nthis Court has interpreted provisions similar to s.\n487.014(1) of the Criminal Code to permit, but not require, ex parte\nproceedings. There are strong rationales for requiring notice to the press in\ncases like this. If the authorizing judge lacks evidence and submissions from\nthe party exclusively in possession of the information needed for the balancing\n\u2014 the innocent media third party whose s.\u00a02(b) rights are engaged \u2014\nthere is nothing to balance. While the issue of notice is\nultimately a matter within the discretion of the authorizing judge, it is\nhighly preferable in most cases to proceed on notice to the media. Where there are exigent\ncircumstances or a real risk of the destruction of evidence, notice may not be\nfeasible, but these cases will be rare.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The orthodox approach for reviewing production orders set out in Garofoli\nwas not designed to scrutinize\nwhether s.\u00a02(b) Charter rights were sufficiently protected.\nIn proceedings where the press is involved, and there has been no notice before\nthe authorizing judge, the press will not have had the opportunity to explain\nhow the order would interfere with its work until after the authorization is\nmade. In such cases, the press is entitled to a de novo balancing on the\nreview. If, on the other hand, the press was present and\nable to make its case before the authorizing judge, the more deferential Garofoli\napproach would be justified.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the production order strikes a proportionate balance between\nthe rights and interests at stake. The order is narrowly tailored, targeting\nonly the journalist\u2019s communications with the source, and those communications\nare not available from any other source. The suggestion that the production order\nwould interfere with Vice Media\u2019s newsgathering and publication functions shrivels\nin a context where the source was not a confidential one and wanted everything\nhe said to be made public. Crucially, there is no suggestion that anything the\nsource said was intended or understood to be \u201coff the record\u201d. The journalist\u2019s\nown conduct shows that the relationship was not confidential in any way. Accordingly,\nthe benefit of the state\u2019s interest in obtaining the messages outweighs any\nharm to Vice Media\u2019s rights.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (Hoy A.C.J.O.\nand Doherty and Miller\u00a0JJ.A.), 2017 ONCA 231, 137 O.R.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld an order for a  journalist to give police copies of conversations with a person who said he  belonged to a terrorist group. </strong>\r\n   In 2014, Vice Media Canada published three stories  about a Canadian man who said he was a member of the so-called \u201cIslamic State\u201d  terrorist group in Syria. The stories were based on conversations one of Vice\u2019s  journalists had with the man through an instant messaging application. Police read  the stories and thought the man was committing serious crimes (participating in  terrorist activities and making death threats). Police wanted to investigate, but the news stories  weren\u2019t enough. Even though the man was identified by name and wanted people to  know what he was doing, they needed hard evidence\u2014like copies of the actual  conversations. But the messaging application the journalist used to talk to the  man didn\u2019t store them. The only way police could get them was from one of the  participants. They asked a judge to order Vice and the journalist to give them copies  of the messages so they could build their case. This kind of order is called a  \u201cproduction order,\u201d because it forces someone to produce (in the sense of \u201cprovide\u201d)  something for someone else.  For most legal issues, judges will hear both sides in  court before making a decision. There are some exceptions where a judge will  hear only one side, such as if the issue is urgent or there is a danger the  evidence could be lost. This happens in an \u201c<em>ex parte</em>\u201d hearing. <em>Ex parte</em> means without the other party being there (and  without them knowing about it). In this case, the police didn\u2019t want Vice to  know they were trying to get the information. They were afraid that Vice might  move it somewhere Canadian courts couldn\u2019t touch it. The judge granted the  order in an <em>ex parte </em>hearing. Later,  when Vice received the order, it said it only had screenshots of the messages.  It didn\u2019t think it should have to give those to police and went to court to  fight it.  At the time Vice went to court, the law said the  order could be canceled only if  no other reasonable judge would have allowed it. Judges can\u2019t look at all  details of all issues from the start and re-analyze them every time. This would  take too long and cost too much. These are some of the reasons higher-court  judges \u201cdefer to,\u201d or rely on, lower-court judges\u2019 decisions. They look at what  a reasonable judge might have done, not what decision they might personally  have made. The reviewing judge heard Vice\u2019s arguments but said  it still had to share the screenshots. This was because the original judge\u2019s  decision had a reasonable basis. The Court of Appeal agreed. All  of the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Vice had to give police the  screenshots. They looked at all the factors and said the original judge\u2019s  decision was reasonable. They noted it was important for media to be able to  gather and share news with the public without government interference, and that  it had a special role in society. But, in this case, society\u2019s interest in  investigating and prosecuting crimes outweighed it. The  majority said that while this wasn\u2019t an appropriate case to make major changes  to the rules on media search warrants and production orders, they had to be  tweaked. According to the rules, a judge first has to think about whether it is  best to let the media know about a police request for a warrant or production  order, or to hold a hearing <em>ex parte</em>.  The majority added a slightly modified rule. It said that if a warrant or order  is granted <em>ex parte</em>, the media should  be able to go to court to argue points the original judge didn\u2019t know about. If  these points could reasonably have affected the original judge\u2019s decision,  another judge has to review the whole decision from the beginning (not just  looking at whether it had a reasonable basis). Second, the judge has to make  sure all the conditions listed in the <em>Criminal  Code</em> are met. Specifically, that there is a good chance a crime has been or  will be committed, that the person has the information the police are looking  for, and that the information will provide evidence of the crime. Third, the  judge has to look at all the facts and circumstances. S/he has to balance  society\u2019s interest in investigating and prosecuting crimes against the media\u2019s  right to privacy in gathering and sharing news. Finally, the judge has to think  about ways to make sure the media wouldn\u2019t be overly restricted in carrying out  its work. Applying these updated rules to this case, the majority said the  lower courts were right. The new <em>Journalistic Sources Protection Act</em> became law in 2017. It didn\u2019t apply to this case because the events happened  before it came into force."

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0person  named as an irrevocable beneficiary of a life insurance policy doesn\u2019t always  have a right to keep the insurance money, the Supreme Court has confirmed. A  third party may have a right to the insurance money if there has been \u201cunjust  enrichment.\u201d </strong>\r\n   Mr. Moore  bought a $250,000 life insurance policy in 1985, while he was married to Ms.  Moore. Ms. Moore was named the sole beneficiary, which means that she would get  the money if Mr. Moore died. The Moores separated in 1999 and divorced in 2003.  Until 2000, the Moores paid the $507.50 premium each year out of their joint bank  account. In 2000, Ms. Moore and Mr. Moore verbally agreed that Ms. Moore would  pay all of the yearly premiums. In exchange, Mr. Moore would keep Ms. Moore on  the policy as the sole beneficiary. From 2000 on, Ms. Moore paid the premiums  herself.  In 2000,  Mr. Moore moved in with Ms. Sweet. Soon after, he made her the \u201cirrevocable\u201d  beneficiary of the policy, even though he had agreed to keep Ms. Moore named as  sole beneficiary. He didn\u2019t tell Ms. Moore that he made this change.  Ontario\u2019s <em>Insurance Act</em> sets out the rules for  insurance policies. It says an insured person can name another person (or group  of people) as the beneficiary of their life insurance policy. That other person  can be named either a \u201crevocable\u201d beneficiary or an \u201cirrevocable\u201d beneficiary. \u201cRevocable\u201d  beneficiaries can be removed from a policy at any time. They don\u2019t have to  agree, or even be informed that they are being removed. Ms. Moore was a  \u201crevocable\u201d beneficiary. \u201cIrrevocable\u201d beneficiaries, like Ms. Sweet, can only  be removed if they agree to it.  Ms. Moore  only found out that she had been removed as the beneficiary when Mr. Moore died  in 2013. At this point, she sued Ms. Sweet for $250,000, the value of the  policy. She argued that Ms. Sweet got a benefit at her expense, and there was  no legal basis for it. This kind of situation is called \u201cunjust enrichment.\u201d Ms.  Moore asked the court to put the money  in a \u201cconstructive trust,\u201d a common request when unjust enrichment happens. A  constructive trust means someone has to hold certain property for someone  else\u2019s benefit.  Both Ms.  Moore and Ms. Sweet agreed that the verbal agreement between the Moores was a  contract. The question was whether the <em>Insurance </em><em>Act</em> gave Ms. Sweet legal  basis to keep the money in spite of that. The trial judge ruled in favour of Ms. Moore,  saying Mr. Moore had given her rights to the policy through their verbal  agreement. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It said that while Ms. Moore should  get back all the money she paid for the premiums (about $7,000), Ms. Sweet  should get to keep the rest of the money.  The majority at the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Ms. Moore. The  fact that Ms. Sweet was an irrevocable beneficiary of the policy wasn\u2019t enough  for her to be allowed to keep the money. The <em>Insurance Act</em> set out how beneficiaries could be named, but it  didn\u2019t say that naming a new beneficiary would automatically override other  people\u2019s rights from previous agreements. Courts already said that other people  could have rights to an insurance policy no matter who was actually listed on  it. This could be through a contract or by the concept of \u201cequity\u201d (rules of  fairness). Those people could claim the insurance money on some legal or \u201cequitable\u201d  (fair) basis, like unjust enrichment. The  majority also noted that Ms. Sweet would have received nothing if Ms. Moore  ever stopped paying. For those reasons, the majority said that Ms. Moore should  get the insurance money under a constructive trust. This  case was about what happens when someone has a pre-existing right to an  insurance policy, but someone else is named as the irrevocable beneficiary. The  majority said that in this case, the beneficiary was unjustly enriched and  could not keep the insurance money."

        "summary": "<strong>The choice to speak either English  or French in certain courts is a protected right, the Supreme Court has  confirmed. When this right is not respected, there might have to be a new hearing.</strong>\r\n   Mr. Mazraani worked as a personal insurance representative for  Industrial Alliance for six months in 2012. His contract said he was  self-employed. When he lost his job, he wanted to apply for Employment  Insurance benefits, but self-employed people aren\u2019t eligible. His case ended up  before the Tax Court of Canada.  Canada has two official languages, English and French. The Constitution  says that people have the right to use either language in certain courts (such  as a court created by Parliament, like the Tax Court). It doesn\u2019t matter how  well a person can speak either language. It\u2019s their choice, and they can change  their mind in the middle of a hearing (that is, a trial, an appeal, or another legal  proceeding) if they want. Language rights are different from the <em>Charter </em>right to understand (and be  understood) during a trial. They are meant to protect official language  communities. Every court has rules of procedure that apply to it. The Tax Court\u2019s  rules said that the parties could say which language they wanted to use in  court and ask for an interpreter if they needed one. But some cases are dealt  with in a less formal way, to save time (and money) for everyone. In these  cases, the usual rules don\u2019t apply. The simplified rules that applied in Mr.  Mazraani\u2019s case didn\u2019t say how someone could tell the court which language s/he  wanted to use. They also didn\u2019t set out how someone could ask for an  interpreter.  When the hearing started, Mr. Mazraani wanted to use English. Industrial  Alliance\u2019s first witness wanted to speak in French. But the judge said they  would have to come back another day when an interpreter was available for Mr.  Mazraani. Industrial Alliance decided not to wait, so the witness spoke in  English. The hearing lasted a few more days and other witnesses who wanted to speak  in French were asked to speak in English. The judge also asked Industrial  Alliance\u2019s lawyer to make his arguments in English, even though he was more  comfortable in French. Even so, many parts of the hearing happened only in  French, and Mr. Mazraani couldn\u2019t understand them. The Tax Court judge ruled Mr. Mazraani was an employee. He criticized  Industrial Alliance\u2019s witnesses as \u201cmisleading\u201d and said they played with words  to avoid telling the truth. He said the company acted so badly that it had to  pay Mr. Mazraani\u2019s legal costs. This was to discourage \u201cabuse of process\u201d  (misuse of the courts). Industrial Alliance appealed, saying the judge had violated the language  rights of its witnesses and lawyer. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed. It also  said Mr. Mazraani\u2019s rights were violated because large parts of the hearing were  never translated for him. It ordered a new hearing before a different judge. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed the witnesses\u2019 and lawyer\u2019s  language rights were violated, and that Mr. Mazraani\u2019s were, too. It didn\u2019t  matter that there were no rules about language rights in the simplified Tax  Court procedures. The judge still had to make sure people\u2019s language rights  were protected (especially people coming to court without lawyers, like Mr.  Mazraani). It was wrong for the judge to ask anyone to use a different  language. Every party, witness, and lawyer had to know s/he had a real choice  about what language to use. The Court said that language rights were so  important that there would usually have to be a new hearing when they were  violated, even if the violation didn\u2019t affect the result. In this case, the  violations had a clear effect on the proceedings and the decision, so the Court  ordered a new hearing. This decision noted that breaching  someone\u2019s language rights can be seen as a sign of bias against a language  group. This lowers public trust in our courts, which is one reason it is so  important for judges to protect these rights."

        "summary": "<strong>The Constitution allows the federal, provincial and territorial  governments to work together to regulate securities trading under a single,  unified system, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Securities  are stocks, bonds, and other financial products. They are often traded on stock  markets by investors. Canada is one of the only developed countries that doesn\u2019t  have a <em>national</em> (that is, a  Canada-wide) regulator to oversee securities trading.

Courts have read the Constitution as saying that only  provinces and territories can make laws about securities trading within their  borders. The federal government can\u2019t make these kinds of laws, but it has  other general powers over trade and commerce. So, in Canada, each province and  territory has its own securities regulator. The  federal government thought financial markets were so important to the Canadian  economy that they should be overseen by a single regulator. In 2011, it asked  the Supreme Court whether Parliament would be allowed to pass a federal law to  do that. The Court said no, because under the Constitution, the provinces and  territories have power over most aspects of securities regulation. The federal  government can\u2019t make laws on issues that belong to the provinces and  territories. The Court said, though, that a <em>cooperative</em> approach could be constitutional. In a cooperative approach, provinces and  territories would deal with aspects of securities regulation within their power,  and the federal government would deal with aspects within its power. Based on this advice, the  governments of Canada, Ontario, B.C., Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, P.E.I., and  Yukon proposed a \u201cCooperative System\u201d to oversee securities markets across the country. It was made up of a  \u201cdraft law\u201d that the federal Parliament could pass, a \u201cmodel law\u201d that  provincial and territorial legislatures could pass, and a national securities  regulator.<strong> </strong>The system was set out  in an agreement between executive levels of government (that is, the Prime  Minister and Premiers, and their cabinets). Quebec, Alberta, and Manitoba had concerns about the proposal. In  2015, Quebec asked its Court of Appeal to answer two questions about it.  The first was whether the proposed Cooperative System would be permitted by the  Constitution. The second was whether the draft federal law overstepped the  federal government\u2019s general trade and commerce powers. The Court of Appeal answered no to both  questions. The  Supreme Court unanimously answered yes to the first question, and no to the  second question. While the proposal is constitutional, the Court said that each  province and territory has to decide for itself whether it is a good idea to  join. This is a policy choice, not a legal one.  On  the first question, the Court said the Cooperative System is constitutional  because it doesn\u2019t interfere with \u201cparliamentary sovereignty.\u201d Parliamentary  sovereignty is an important constitutional principle. It means that the  legislature (and<em> only </em>the  legislature) can pass, change, and get rid of any laws that it chooses to. Some  provinces argued that the Cooperative System would force provincial and  territorial legislatures to pass the model law, and any changes made to it at a  later date (which would go against parliamentary sovereignty). But the Court  disagreed, and said that any legislature remains free to reject the model law,  or any of its changes, if it wants to. Even though a \u201cCouncil of Ministers\u201d  would be in charge of approving changes to the Cooperative System, they  wouldn\u2019t have the power to  change any actual laws. If a legislature  disagrees with the Cooperative System or any changes, it could always reject them. For  the second question, the Court said the draft federal law falls within  Parliament\u2019s general powers to regulate trade and commerce, which it has under  the Constitution. But Parliament can only use this power to make laws dealing  with truly national issues, which are issues that provinces and territories  can\u2019t deal with on their own. In this case, the draft federal law was written  very carefully. It focuses on \u201csystemic risk\u201d that could hurt Canada\u2019s economy,  and doesn\u2019t go beyond that. It is meant to work together with provinces\u2019 and  territories\u2019 laws, and doesn\u2019t interfere with their role in securities  regulation.  Finally,  and related to the second question, the Court said it is fine for the federal  government to give the Council of Ministers the power to make federal  regulations on its behalf. Regulations are \u201csecondary rules\u201d made by people or groups  that are given rule-making powers by the legislature. Some of the provinces saw  a problem with Parliament letting a group like the Council of Ministers, made  up mostly of <em>provincial</em> representatives,  be involved in making <em>federal</em> regulations. But the Court doesn\u2019t see a problem with this. Parliament can  choose to delegate power to make federal regulations to other people or groups,  including provincial groups, if it wants to. It can also take that power away, if  it wants to.  This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal from a provincial  \u201creference.\u201d References are questions that governments ask courts for their  opinion on. (In law, an \u201copinion\u201d isn\u2019t just a belief or point of view. It is a  formal explanation of the law.) The federal government can ask the Supreme  Court for a legal opinion on an issue, like it did with the <em>Securities Act</em> <em>Reference</em> in 2011. Provincial and territorial governments can ask  their Courts of Appeal for opinions, too. These opinions can be appealed to the  Supreme Court. This case began as a reference to the Quebec Court of Appeal by  the Quebec government."

        "summary": "<strong>Courts can\u2019t force parties to renegotiate contracts, the Supreme Court  has confirmed. Unexpected changes in electricity prices didn\u2019t mean that Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec  had to share its profits from the Churchill Falls power station.</strong>\r\n     In 1969, after many years of  negotiations, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corporation (part  of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro) agreed to build a power station on the  Churchill River. It was a huge and expensive project. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec took on most  of the financial risk in the contract. It agreed to buy most of the electricity  at fixed prices price for 65 years, whether it needed it or not, and to cover  any construction cost overruns. But it got a long-term supply of cheap energy  in return for taking this risk on. The Corporation got a long-term, stable  source of income. That meant it was able to borrow money to build the station,  which in 2018 was worth over $20 billion. By 2009, the price of electricity was  much higher than it had been forty years before. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec was taking  advantage of the low rates and selling electricity to customers outside Quebec  at higher prices. The Corporation didn\u2019t think this was fair. It said it should  be able to share in the profits. In 2010, when Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec refused to  renegotiate the contract, the Corporation asked the courts to force it to. In Quebec law, people who sign a  contract together have certain duties toward each other. The province\u2019s <em>Civil Code</em> says that all sides have to treat  each other with \u201cgood faith.\u201d That means they have to be honest and not do  anything to hurt each other. As part of this duty, they are sometimes expected  to cooperate. How far the duty goes depends on the kind of contract it is. It  is stronger for a \u201crelational\u201d contract than for a \u201ctransactional\u201d one. A  relational contract is based on a long-term, cooperative relationship where  risks and benefits are expected to be shared (like a partnership). A  transactional contract specifically sets out risks and benefits agreed to by  all sides. The Corporation said the contract was relational, so Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec had  to share its benefits. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec said it wasn\u2019t a relational contract, so it  didn\u2019t have to share anything. Both the trial court and the Court  of Appeal ruled for Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec.  The majority at the Supreme Court  also ruled for Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. It said the trial judge was not wrong to decide  that the contract wasn\u2019t relational, and that Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec didn\u2019t have to  renegotiate. The contract set out many things very precisely, which showed both  sides meant to follow the specific wording of the agreement, not to rely on any  ongoing relationship. Good faith didn\u2019t mean Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec had to give up the benefits  it had negotiated. Good faith also didn\u2019t mean Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec had to renegotiate  just because there was an unexpected change in electricity prices. While Quebec  courts sometimes make a party compromise a bit to find a solution, no court  ever forced parties to renegotiate the key parts of a contract. Also, no court  ever found that a duty to cooperate meant a party had to give up some of its  profits just because the other party wasn\u2019t profiting as much. Finally, the  majority agreed with the trial judge that the Corporation\u2019s claim was too late  anyway. This case dealt with a long-term contract and civil law concepts of good  faith, equity, and unforeseeability. The majority confirmed that courts should  not change contracts or force parties to renegotiate them if this would upset  the balance the parties originally agreed to."

The Crown then sought certiorari\nto quash the order, which was granted by the Superior Court. The accused\nappealed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that certiorari is\navailable to an accused where a judge acts without jurisdiction and, in certain\ncircumstances, when a judge makes an error of law on the face of the record. In\nthis case, it was of the view that certiorari should not have been\ngranted as the decision was made in the exercise of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s\njurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held:\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Certiorari\nin criminal proceedings is available to parties only for a jurisdictional\nerror by a provincial court judge. The availability of\nextraordinary remedies, notably certiorari, is constrained by the\ngeneral prohibition against interlocutory appeals in criminal matters. The use\nof certiorari is tightly limited so as to ensure that it is not used to run\nafoul of the prohibition. Fragmenting criminal proceedings by\npermitting interlocutory appeals risks having issues decided without the\nbenefit of a full evidentiary record, which is a significant source of delay\nand an inefficient use of judicial resources. Permitting parties access\nto certiorari review for an error of law on the face of\nthe record, in particular in an evidentiary ruling, gives rise to de facto\ninterlocutory appeals and is in direct tension with the approach set out\nin R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, to achieve prompt justice in criminal cases. Furthermore, allowing the use of certiorari to provide\nfor de facto interlocutory appeals in criminal cases would give rise to\nan unprincipled distinction between trials that proceed before provincial\ncourts and those before superior courts, since certiorari is not available against a superior court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe criminal context, jurisdictional errors occur where the court fails to\nobserve a mandatory provision of a statute or where a court acts in breach of\nthe principles of natural justice. In dealing with the accused\u2019s\napplication, the Court of Qu\u00e9bec made a legal error,\nnot a jurisdictional one. The Crown was under no obligation to inquire into\nwhether the records exist as the accused did not establish a basis for their\nexistence or relevance. Nevertheless, given that the Court of Qu\u00e9bec made no\njurisdictional error, certiorari cannot be used to correct the error.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred\nto: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Rulings made in the middle  of a criminal case can\u2019t be challenged until after the judgment, even if they  are wrong, the Supreme Court has confirmed. The Court emphasized that the purpose  of this general rule is to avoid trial interruptions and prevent delays.</strong>\r\n   Ms. Awashish was charged with  impaired driving and driving \u201cover 80.\u201d When a person is charged with a crime,  s/he has a right to see copies of the documents related to the charges. This is  called disclosure. The Crown (the prosecution) gave Ms. Awashish disclosure.  Her lawyer asked for more documents. These related to the breathalyzer used to  test her, including maintenance records and training records for the person  using it. A provincial court judge ordered the Crown to give Ms. Awashish the  documents. In a criminal case, there will  normally be a final decision, called a judgment, which results in a verdict of  guilty or not guilty. But a judge will also make other smaller decisions along  the way, such as how much court time a trial will take or what evidence should  be admitted. These smaller decisions normally can\u2019t be challenged, except as  part of an appeal of the trial judgment to a higher court (that is, after a  guilty or not-guilty verdict). There are only very limited exceptions to this  rule. In this case, though, the Crown  asked a superior court judge to review the provincial court judge\u2019s decision to  order the disclosure before the trial judgment. It did so using a legal procedure  called <em>certiorari</em>.<em> Certiorari</em> (pronounced different ways,  including ser-tee-oh-RARR-ee) is a court\u2019s power to cancel another court\u2019s  decision because of an obvious mistake. It is not the same as an appeal, and is  rarely granted in criminal cases in Canada. <em>Certiorari </em>was only  even a possibility because Ms. Awashish\u2019s case was being heard before the Court  of Quebec, which is a provincial court, not the Superior Court. Provincial and  territorial courts are sometimes called \u201cinferior courts\u201d because they get  their powers from legislatures. They can\u2019t hear all the same kinds of cases  that superior courts can, and can have their decisions changed by superior  courts. Superior courts, on the other hand, get their powers from the  Constitution. Their decisions can\u2019t be changed by other courts, except when  there is an appeal. Superior courts include most trial courts, and all  provincial and territorial appeal courts. Trial-level superior courts can be  called different names in different provinces; for example, B.C. has a \u201cSupreme  Court\u201d and Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick have \u201cCourts of  Queen\u2019s Bench.\u201d  The Superior Court judge ruled for  the Crown and granted <em>certiorari</em> (that is, canceled the provincial court judge\u2019s order). She agreed with the  Crown that Ms. Awashish didn\u2019t show why the request for additional documents  should be allowed. In response, Ms. Awashish asked the Crown to tell her if it  had the documents she wanted. But the Crown wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny if the  records existed, because it said that they weren\u2019t relevant to her case. The  provincial court judge (the same one who made the original order) once again  ordered the Crown to provide the information. The Crown again asked the  Superior Court for review. A different judge granted a second <em>certiorari</em> application, saying the  information didn\u2019t have to be shared unless Ms. Awashish could show it was  relevant. The Court of Appeal ruled for Ms.  Awashish. It said that <em>certiorari </em>is  only available in limited situations, such as if a party\u2019s basic rights would  be permanently harmed. It said <em>certiorari</em> shouldn\u2019t have been granted because the provincial court judge had the power to  make the decision (even if she made the wrong one). The Supreme Court unanimously ruled  for Ms. Awashish. It said parties could only use <em>certiorari</em> in criminal cases when a provincial or territorial court  judge went beyond his or her powers (a \u201cjurisdictional error\u201d). It agreed with  the Court of Appeal that the provincial court judge applied the wrong rules to  Ms. Awashish\u2019s request. But this was a legal error, which could be corrected on  appeal, not a jurisdictional error that needed to be fixed with <em>certiorari</em>. So, even though the decision  was wrong, <em>certiorari </em>couldn\u2019t be  used to fix it. The Court also noted that letting parties appeal decisions  before trials are finished would create delays. That\u2019s why these types of  appeals, known as \u201cinterlocutory appeals,\u201d are not allowed in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. While <em>certiorari</em> is different from an appeal,  courts limit it for the same reason, because lawyers could use it to get around  the rule against interlocutory appeals. The Court noted that it had previously  been clear that courts need to do a better job of finishing criminal trials in  a reasonable time. Allowing <em>certiorari</em> in situations like Ms. Awashish\u2019s would go against that. The decision confirmed the general rule that trials should not be  interrupted to deal with side issues. The Court noted that <em>certiorari </em>would still be available in some circumstances, such as  when a legal error affected other people who wouldn\u2019t have the right to appeal  a judgment. The Court said that if Ms. Awashish asked for disclosure again, the  documents\u2019 relevance should be looked at in light of the Court\u2019s decision in <a href=\"37395-37403-eng.aspx\"><em>R.  v. Gubbins</em></a>, which was  released on the same day."

        "summary": "<strong>Breathalyzer maintenance records don\u2019t have to be disclosed unless an  accused person can show they are likely relevant to his or her defence, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     Mr.  Gubbins and Mr. Vallentgoed were charged with having blood alcohol \u201cover 80\u201d in  separate incidents. As part of their defences, they asked for copies of the  maintenance records for the breathalyzer devices used to test their blood  alcohol levels.  Mr.  Vallentgoed received some records showing that the breathalyzer used to test  him had been sent for repair the day after he was charged, and twice more in  the previous four months. His lawyer asked for more information about the  repair work. The Crown (the prosecution) refused. It said the repair records  belonged to third parties, and that they weren\u2019t relevant anyway. The summary  conviction judge agreed with the Crown, and convicted Mr. Vallentgoed of  driving with blood alcohol \u201cover 80.\u201d The summary conviction appeal judge ruled  for Mr. Vallentgoed, saying the case should go back to trial after the Crown gave  him the records. Mr.  Gubbins also asked for maintenance records for the breathalyzer used to test  him. The Crown said the records were held by a third party (the contractor who  maintained the device). An expert witness testified that maintenance records  weren\u2019t relevant to whether a <em>particular</em> test was accurate, so they weren\u2019t relevant to Mr. Gubbins\u2019 defence. The trial  judge ruled for Mr. Gubbins and ordered the trial stopped until the Crown gave  Mr. Gubbins the records. The summary conviction appeal judge agreed. Mr.  Vallentgoed\u2019s and Mr. Gubbins\u2019 appeals were heard together before the Court of  Appeal because they dealt with the same issue: what records an accused person  has a right to when defending a criminal charge. The Court of Appeal agreed  with the Crown. It restored Mr. Vallentgoed\u2019s conviction and sent Mr. Gubbins\u2019  case back for trial. It said the breathalyzer maintenance records were  \u201cthird-party\u201d records and didn\u2019t have to be disclosed. This  case turned on the difference between \u201cfirst-party\u201d and \u201cthird-party\u201d records  in a criminal case. When a person is charged with a crime, the Crown has to  share information related to the person\u2019s defence. There are some exceptions,  for example if the information is \u201cprivileged\u201d or protected by law. Some police  records will be considered \u201cfirst-party\u201d records (like anything created or  gathered by police during the investigation). First-party records have to be  disclosed when the accused person asks, unless the Crown can show they are privileged  or obviously not relevant to the case. Other police records will be considered  \u201cthird-party\u201d records (like documents related to police administration or  operations). Documents that aren\u2019t part of the investigation and do not belong  to the police, such as medical records belonging to a hospital, are also  considered third-party records. Third-party records will only be disclosed if  the accused person can show they are likely relevant to the case. The problem  in these cases was that some courts had said breathalyzer maintenance records were  first-party records, while others had said they were third-party records. The  law was not clear. The  majority at the Supreme Court said breathalyzer maintenance records were  third-party records. They didn\u2019t need to be disclosed unless the accused person  could show they were likely relevant to his or her defence. The majority looked  at the relevance of the maintenance records and who controlled them. While they  would be relevant to whether a breathalyzer device was <em>maintained</em> properly, they wouldn\u2019t be relevant to whether it was <em>working</em> on a given day. (Breathalyzers  do self-tests each time they are used; those records were relevant and had  already been shared.) The records weren\u2019t held by the Crown because they belonged  to the RCMP and other third parties, such as contractors. They were not part of  any RCMP investigation file since they were just general operational records. The  majority upheld Mr. Vallentgoed\u2019s conviction and sent Mr. Gubbins\u2019 case for a  new trial. In  this case, the Supreme Court decided how much information about breathalyzer  maintenance records prosecutors have to share with someone accused of an \u201cover  80\u201d offence. This settled a disagreement among lower courts about how these  records should be treated. <a href=\"37207-eng.aspx\"><em>R. v. Awashish</em></a>, released on the  same day, also dealt with breathalyzer records and an \u201cover 80\u201d driving offence.  It was originally appealed for different reasons."

During the winter, guests who left their car in\nthe hotel\u2019s parking lot had to hand over their keys at the front desk so that\ntheir car could be moved for snow removal. During the winters of 2005 and 2006,\ntwo guests had their cars stolen from the hotel\u2019s parking lot. The owners were\ncompensated for their losses by their respective insurers, AXA Insurance Inc.\nand Promutuel Insurance Portneuf\u2011Champlain. Since the insurers were\nsubrogated to the rights of their insured, each of them brought an action\nagainst the hotel operator to recover the amount of compensation paid.\nPromutuel also brought a direct action against the hotel operator\u2019s insurer,\nLombard General Insurance Company of Canada. In the case between the hotel\noperator and Axa, the hotel operator impleaded Lombard in warranty. The actions\nwere joined and were heard together. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe case between the hotel operator and Axa, the trial judge found the hotel\noperator liable for the theft of the car, while the hotel operator\u2019s liability\nwas accepted in the case between it and Promutuel as a result of a default\njudgment. The trial judge also found that the clause in the hotel operator\u2019s\nliability insurance policy excluding coverage for property damage (loss of use\nor physical injury) to personal property in the care, custody or control of the\ninsured did not apply in these cases, despite the fact that the keys to guests\u2019\ncars had to be left at the hotel\u2019s front desk. She therefore ordered Lombard to\ncompensate the hotel operator and Promutuel. The Court of Appeal affirmed the\ntrial judge\u2019s judgment with respect to liability for the thefts of cars but\nallowed the appeal in both cases on the issue of the exclusion clause, which it\nfound to be applicable. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held:\nThe hotel operator\u2019s appeal (file No.\u00a037421) is allowed in part. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held:\nPromutuel\u2019s appeal (file No.\u00a037422) is allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown\nand Martin\u00a0JJ.: The courts below did not err in finding the hotel operator\nliable for the theft of the car insured by Axa, and there are therefore no\ngrounds for intervention on this issue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ntrial judge did not err in characterizing the contract between the hotel\noperator and its guests as a contract for services within the meaning of\nart.\u00a02098 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d). The\ncharacterization of the contractual relationship between the hotel operator and\nits guests is a question of mixed fact and law, since it is necessary here to\nconsider the evidence of the parties\u2019 common intention; the characterization is\ntherefore entitled to deference on appeal. In characterizing the contract, the\ntrial judge properly considered the full range of services offered by the hotel\noperator. As a park and fly hotel, it offered its guests a number of services,\nincluding accommodation, parking and a shuttle service. It is not appropriate\nto separate these services given that a package of services is what was\nconsidered by guests and advertised by the hotel operator. Because the hotel\noperator encouraged its guests to leave their vehicle in its parking lot while\nthey were away, the guests were reasonably entitled to expect that it would\nlook after their interests and take such security measures as were necessary in\nthe circumstances. Since there was a contract for services, the hotel operator\nhad an obligation under art.\u00a02100 C.C.Q. to act in the best\ninterests of its guests, with prudence and diligence. The determination that\nthe hotel operator breached its obligation of prudence and diligence by failing\nto take reasonable steps to secure its parking lot, unbeknownst to its guests,\nis a finding of mixed fact and law that is also entitled to deference on\nappeal, since an assessment of the facts is necessary to make such a finding.\nFinally, the trial judge\u2019s finding that there was a clear causal connection\nbetween the fault and the damage is not open to review\nunless a palpable and overriding error was made, since it is a question of fact.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\naddition, there is no palpable and overriding error in the trial judge\u2019s finding on the issue of custody of the stolen\nvehicles that could justify the Court of Appeal\u2019s intervention. The guests\u2019\nhandover of their car keys to the hotel operator did not trigger the\napplication of the care, custody or control exclusion clause in the insurance\npolicy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While\ncustody is a legal concept, the determination of custody is a highly factual\nquestion that depends on the specific circumstances of each case. Whether the\nhotel operator had custody of the vehicles is therefore a question of mixed\nfact and law, and the trial judge\u2019s answer to this question is entitled to\ndeference on appeal. In the instant cases, the judge\u2019s finding on the limited\neffect of the handover of keys was firmly based on an assessment of the\nevidence. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nhandover of keys is certainly a relevant fact in determining custody of the\nproperty, since the keys provide access to the vehicle. However, the handover\nof keys does not automatically transfer custody. To determine whether there has\nbeen a transfer of custody and thus control of property, a court must consider\nall the circumstances, including the reason for any handover of keys. That reason\nis important because it distinguishes custody from mere physical holding of the\nvehicles, which are two distinct concepts. A holder of property does not have\ncustody of it where the holder is able to exercise only a limited, and not a\ngeneral, power over the property. Here, the trial judge\u2019s finding that the keys\nwere handed over solely for the purpose of snow removal in the parking lot is\nsupported by the evidence concerning the parties\u2019 intention. It was open to the\njudge to conclude from her analysis of the evidence heard that the hotel\noperator had the power to move vehicles only when there was a build\u2011up of\nsnow and that this was not sufficient in itself to transfer custody of the\nstolen cars. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Lastly,\nthere is no inconsistency in the findings of the trial judge, who recognized\nboth that the hotel operator had an obligation of prudence and diligence and\nthat the cars were not in its care, custody or control. The obligations are\ndifferent in nature. The hotel operator\u2019s obligation of prudence and diligence\noriginates in art.\u00a02100 C.C.Q., which governs contracts for\nservices, and attaches to its performance of services. The care, custody or\ncontrol clause excludes coverage for property over which the insured\nexercises certain powers; it does not attach to the insured\u2019s acts. The hotel\noperator\u2019s obligation to take reasonable steps to secure its parking lot does\nnot imply a sufficient transfer of control and of responsibility for the\npreservation of a vehicle to result in a change in legal custody. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nRowe\u00a0J.: There is agreement with Gascon\u00a0J.\u2019s\nanalysis and disposition. With respect to the characterization of the contract\nbetween the hotel operator and its clients, it is a question of mixed fact and\nlaw because the trial judge found it necessary to have regard to extrinsic\nevidence in order to ascertain the true nature of the contract. However, where\nhaving regard to extrinsic evidence is not needed, characterization remains a\nquestion of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred\nto: Uniprix inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0business that holds keys to a customer\u2019s car parked on its lot doesn\u2019t  necessarily have care and control of that vehicle, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     The  Econolodge Aeroport hotel, located near Montreal\u2019s Pierre Elliott Trudeau  airport, offered a \u201cpark and fly\u201d service where guests could park their cars  for free while they traveled. In winter, guests had to leave their keys with  the hotel to make it easier to remove snow from the parking lot. Econolodge  didn\u2019t have any guards, fences, or cameras in the parking lot, and anyone could  enter at any time.  In  the winters of 2005 and 2006, two cars were stolen from its property. Econolodge  still had the car keys its guests had left behind, and didn\u2019t know about the  thefts until the guests returned. The owners filed claims with their insurance  companies and were compensated under their policies. The insurance companies,  in turn, sued the hotel for not taking reasonable steps to prevent the thefts.  Econolodge said it did nothing wrong, but that even if it had, its own  insurance company should pay. That company, Lombard, covered Econolodge for  civil liability (responsibility for actions that harm others or their property,  but aren\u2019t criminal). Lombard said it didn\u2019t have to pay because there was an  exception in the policy. The exception said it wasn\u2019t responsible when the  hotel had care and control of the vehicles. The  trial judge said Econolodge had a contract with its guests for the \u201cpark and  fly\u201d service. Under the Quebec Civil Code, that meant it had to act diligently  in all matters related to the contract. (The Civil Code is the body of law that  applies to non-criminal legal issues in Quebec.) The hotel did not take  reasonable steps to secure the parking area, but let guests believe that it  had. The trial judge said it was therefore responsible. She also said that  Econolodge did not have care and control of the vehicles just because it had  the keys. That meant the exception in the insurance policy did not apply, so Lombard  had to pay. The Court of Appeal agreed that Econolodge was responsible, but disagreed  about the exception. It said Lombard didn\u2019t have to pay because having the car  keys meant Econolodge had control of the vehicles. The  Supreme Court agreed with both lower courts that Econolodge was responsible for  the thefts. But it said that the trial judge wasn\u2019t wrong to decide the policy  exception didn\u2019t apply (which meant Lombard had to pay). She also wasn\u2019t wrong  to say that Econolodge didn\u2019t have care and control of the vehicles in the  legal sense. Looking at the full situation, the Court said it was open to the  trial judge to conclude that people only left their keys with the hotel for a  limited reason. This was to make it easier to clear snow from the lot; summer  guests didn\u2019t have to leave their keys at all. Econolodge wasn\u2019t really taking  \u201ccontrol\u201d of the vehicles, then. Lombard\u2019s insurance policy was meant to cover exactly  this kind of situation\u2014when the insured is at fault providing its usual  services, and harms others (or their property) in the process. One of the  reasons for the exception was to avoid the policy being used as a backdoor way  to insure third-party property that had nothing to do with the contractual services. This case dealt with  the application of part of a standard commercial insurance contract.  Econolodge\u2019s fault fell within what the insurance policy was supposed to cover,  so the insurance company had to pay for it."

The\nMikisew Cree First Nation was not consulted on either of these omnibus bills at\nany stage in their development or prior to the granting of royal assent. The\nMikisew brought an application for judicial review in Federal Court, arguing\nthat the Crown had a duty to consult them on the development of the\nlegislation, since it had the potential to adversely affect their treaty rights\nto hunt, trap, and fish under Treaty No.\u00a08. The reviewing judge granted a\ndeclaration to the effect that the duty to consult was triggered and that the\nMikisew were entitled to notice of the relevant provisions of the bills, as\nwell as an opportunity to make submissions. On appeal, a majority of the\nFederal Court of Appeal concluded that the reviewing judge erred by conducting\na judicial review of legislative action contrary to the Federal Courts Act.\nThe majority held that when ministers develop policy, they act in a legislative\ncapacity and their actions are immune from judicial review. It deemed the\nreviewing judge\u2019s decision to be inconsistent with the principles of\nparliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers, and parliamentary\nprivilege.

        "summary": "<strong>The Crown has to act honourably toward Canada\u2019s Indigenous peoples, but  this does not mean Parliament has to consult them when making laws, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   The  Mikisew Cree First Nation is a band whose traditional territory is mostly in  northeastern Alberta, and contains oil sands. The Mikisew joined Treaty 8 along  with other groups in 1899. Treaty 8 was the eighth agreement signed by Queen  Victoria and First Nations in Western Canada. Under the treaty, in exchange for  giving up their ownership of a large amount of land, the Mikisew kept the right  to hunt, trap, and fish on it. Today, aboriginal treaty rights, like those  under Treaty 8, are protected by the Constitution. Treaties  are understood to be between Indigenous groups and \u201cthe Crown.\u201d \u201cThe Crown\u201d  means Canada as a state. The Crown negotiated and signed treaties like the one  with the Mikisew in 1899, and still has a duty to fulfill them today. The Crown  also has other duties, based on the Aboriginal and constitutional law concept  of the \u201chonour of the Crown.\u201d This requires the Crown to act honourably toward  Indigenous peoples. In  2012, the federal government introduced two bills that changed how Canada\u2019s  environment would be protected. The Mikisew said their rights to hunt, trap,  and fish on the land would be harmed by the new laws. Oil companies and others  would be allowed to build structures on or near many waterways without  government approval. The Mikisew said no one would be making sure fish and  wildlife wouldn\u2019t be harmed. They were not consulted on the changes. The  Mikisew said that the government had a legal duty to consult them, rooted in  the honour of the Crown. In 2013, the Mikisew asked the Federal Court to review  the bills, formally declare that the government should have consulted them, and  block the new laws. At  the Federal Court, the application judge said the Crown should have consulted  the Mikisew when developing the bills. But the Federal Court of Appeal disagreed,  saying the Federal Court didn\u2019t have jurisdiction (power) to hear the Mikisew\u2019s  application in the first place. It also said courts should only be able to hear  challenges to laws that have been passed, not laws that are being developed and  debated. This was because Parliament, not the Crown, develops and passes law,  according to the \u201cseparation of powers\u201d in the Canadian Constitution.  Separation  of powers means that different branches of the state have different roles in  Canada\u2019s democracy. The executive (which includes the Prime Minister and  Cabinet) decides policy and implements laws (for example, by passing  regulations). The legislature (Parliament) makes and passes laws. The judiciary  (the courts) interprets and applies laws once they are passed. In this case,  the Mikisew said the Ministers were acting in their executive roles when they  introduced the laws. The government said they were acting in their legislative  roles. At  the Supreme Court of Canada, all the judges agreed that the Federal Court did  not have jurisdiction to review the actions of the federal Ministers who developed<strong> </strong>the bills. This was because the <em>Federal Courts Act</em> said it could only  review decisions of a federal board, commission, or other tribunal. Ministers  working on policies that might eventually become law did not fall into any of  these categories. The judges disagreed about the honour of the Crown and the  duty to consult. Justice Andromache Karakatsanis said  that there was no duty to consult during the law-making process. However, she  said that while Parliament didn\u2019t have to consult the Mikisew, that didn\u2019t mean  the Crown was off the hook. The honour of the Crown applied to both the  executive and Parliament, even if the duty to consult only applied to executive  action. The Crown still had to act honourably toward the Mikisew when a law  might negatively affect their treaty rights. Justice Karakatsanis noted that it  didn\u2019t matter to the Mikisew and other groups whether action that harmed their  rights was taken by the executive or by Parliament. However, she said the duty  to consult wasn\u2019t the only possible way for them to protect their  constitutional rights, and other approaches could be developed. Two judges  agreed with Justice Karakatsanis. Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella agreed with Justice Karakatsanis that  Parliament had a duty to uphold the honour of the Crown. But she went further  and said that this included a duty to consult Indigenous groups when making  laws that might adversely affect them. What mattered was the effect of  government action on Aboriginal rights, not which branch of government the  action came from. She said that parliamentary sovereignty and privilege could  not override the honour of the Crown, which was also protected by the  Constitution. One judge agreed with Justice Abella. Justice  Russell Brown said the honour of the Crown only bound the executive, not  Parliament. That meant Parliament didn\u2019t have a duty to consult the Mikisew.  Even though Ministers are part of the executive (as members of Cabinet), they  act in their legislative roles when they introduce and debate bills. For Justice  Brown, getting courts involved during the lawmaking process (through the duty  to consult or another approach) would violate the separation of powers and  parliamentary privilege. He said this would create a lot of uncertainty. For  him, bills could only be challenged in court once they became law, but not  before. Justice Malcolm Rowe agreed with everything Justice Brown said, but  added three additional reasons he thought there should be no duty to consult  when preparing laws. He said there were other ways for the Mikisew to assert  their rights without interfering with Parliament\u2019s independence. He also said  it could make it very complicated for governments to prepare legislation and  budgets. Finally, he said that it would put courts in the position of  supervising dealings between Indigenous groups and legislators, something they  are not well suited to do. Two other judges agreed with Justice Rowe (and with  Justice Brown). This case  was about whether the Crown had a duty to consult Aboriginal peoples when  deciding on changes to laws that may harm their treaty rights, and whether courts  had a role in enforcing it. A total of five judges said the honour of the Crown  was involved at the lawmaking stage. But a total of seven said there was no  binding duty to consult before a law was passed."

Their union grieved their\ndismissals before a labour arbitrator. The President objected to the grievances\non the basis that the decision to dismiss the guards was immune from review\nbecause it was protected by the parliamentary privilege over the management of\nemployees and the parliamentary privilege to exclude strangers from the\nlegislative assembly. The arbitrator concluded that the dismissals were not\nprotected by either parliamentary privilege, and therefore that the grievances\ncould proceed. The reviewing judge agreed with the arbitrator\u2019s reasoning with\nregards to the privilege to exclude strangers, but found that the decision to\ndismiss the security guards was protected from review by the privilege over the\nmanagement of employees. A majority of the Court of Appeal held that the\narbitrator had correctly concluded that the dismissals were not protected by\nparliamentary privilege.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and\nBrown\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon and\nMartin\u00a0JJ.: The dismissals are not protected by parliamentary\nprivilege and therefore are not immune from external review under the\napplicable labour relations regime. Although the President is entitled to\nexercise his management rights and dismiss security guards for a just and\nsufficient cause, parliamentary privilege does not insulate the President\u2019s\ndecision from review under the labour regime to which the guards are subject. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Legislative\nbodies in Canada, including provincial legislative assemblies, have inherent\nparliamentary privileges that flow from their nature and function in a\nWestminster model of parliamentary democracy. Inherent parliamentary privileges\nhelp preserve the separation of powers and promote the proper functioning of\nrepresentative democracy, by protecting some areas of legislative activity from\nexternal review. However, the inherent nature of parliamentary privilege means\nthat its existence and scope must be strictly anchored to its rationale. It is\nthe role of the courts to determine whether a category of parliamentary\nprivilege exists and to delimit its scope, whereas it is for the legislative\nassemblies to determine whether in a particular case the exercise of the privilege\nis necessary or appropriate. The scope of parliamentary privilege is delimited\nby the purposes it serves, and extends only so far as is necessary to protect\nlegislators in the discharge of their legislative and deliberative functions,\nand the legislative assembly\u2019s work in holding the government to account for\nthe conduct of the country\u2019s business. Because courts cannot review the\nexercise of parliamentary privileges, even on Canadian Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms grounds, they must ensure that the protection provided by a\nprivilege does not exceed its purpose. Therefore, a purposive approach must be\ntaken when assessing parliamentary privilege claims. Such an approach helps to\nreconcile the privilege with the Charter, by ensuring that it is only as\nbroad as is necessary for the proper functioning of a constitutional democracy.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nparty seeking to rely on the immunity from external review conferred by\nparliamentary privilege bears the burden of establishing its necessity, that\nis, to demonstrate that the scope of the protection it claims is necessary in\nlight of the purposes of parliamentary privilege. The necessity test demands\nthat the sphere of activity over which the privilege is claimed be more than\nmerely connected to the legislative assembly\u2019s functions. The immunity that is\nsought from the application of ordinary law must also be necessary to the\nassembly\u2019s constitutional role. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthis case, the standard of review applicable to the decision of the arbitrator\nis correctness. The arbitrator correctly concluded that the President\u2019s\ndecision to dismiss the security guards is not subject to parliamentary\nprivilege. First, the President has failed to establish the necessity of a\nparliamentary privilege over the management of the guards. Admittedly, the\nguards perform some important tasks that are connected to the constitutional\nfunctions of the National Assembly, including protecting it from security\nthreats and helping to maintain decorum in the chamber. However, the National\nAssembly does not require immunity from outside scrutiny of the general\nmanagement of the security guards in order to discharge its constitutional functions.\nThe management of the guards could be dealt with under ordinary law without\nimpeding the National Assembly\u2019s security or its ability to legislate and\ndeliberate. Permitting the enforcement of basic employment and labour\nprotections for the guards would not undermine the independence required for\nthe National Assembly to fulfil its constitutional mandate with dignity and\nefficiency. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nquestion of necessity can be addressed without looking to the Act respecting\nthe National Assembly (\u201cARNA\u201d). However, while nothing in the\nlegislation abrogates parliamentary privilege, the ARNA establishes that\nall employees of the National Assembly are managed in accordance with general\nlaw. Sections 110 and 120 of the ARNA provide that the employees of the\nNational Assembly are members of the civil service and, as such, are generally\nsubject to a labour relations regime unless they are exempted by regulation. As\nthere is currently no regulatory exemption for the security guards, this\ndemonstrates that the National Assembly does not appear to view exclusive\ncontrol over their management to be necessary to its autonomy. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As\nfor the parliamentary privilege to exclude strangers, while the existence of\nthis privilege has long been recognized, it is not necessary to a legislative\nassembly\u2019s ability to perform its constitutional functions that the scope of\nthe privilege be drawn so broadly as to include the decision to dismiss employees\nwho implement it on the president or speaker\u2019s behalf. Such an immunity would\nimpact persons who are not members of the legislative assembly, and undermine\ntheir access to the labour regime negotiated in accordance with their s.\u00a02(d)\nCharter rights. The President has not shown that the application of\ngeneral labour law to those persons would jeopardize the autonomy, dignity and\nefficiency required for the fulfilment of the National Assembly\u2019s legislative mandate.\nAccordingly, the privilege to exclude strangers does not protect the decision\nto dismiss employees who exercise the privilege from review. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nRowe\u00a0J.: There is agreement that the standard of review is correctness\nand agreement with the majority that the appeal should be dismissed but for\ndifferent reasons. Whatever the scope of privilege for management of employees,\nthe Act respecting the National Assembly (\u201cARNA\u201d) resolves this\ncase. When a legislative body subjects an aspect of privilege to the operation\nof a statute, it is the provisions of the statute that govern. While those\nprovisions remain operative, a legislative body cannot reassert privilege so as\nto do an end-run around the statute whose very purpose is to govern the\nlegislature\u2019s operations. Parliamentary privilege should not be invoked to\nbypass the application of a statute enacted by the legislature to govern its\nown operation. It is not an impediment to the functioning of the legislature\nfor it to comply with its own enactments, and it cannot be regarded as an\nintrusion on the legislature\u2019s privilege.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nrelationship between statute and privilege is determined through ordinary\nprinciples of statutory interpretation. In this case, in the ARNA, the\nNational Assembly has defined how the management of its employees is to be\ncarried out under the public service employment scheme. If the National\nAssembly wants a group of employees to be removed from this scheme, it can do\nso through the derogation procedure referred to in s.\u00a0120 of the ARNA.\nPrivilege would then again operate, provided that the employees fell within the\nscope of privilege. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As\nthe derogation procedure under s.\u00a0120 has not been exercised in this case\nwith respect to the security guards, the President cannot now reassert\nprivilege as to the management of the guards, and thereby insulate the decision\nto dismiss them from the scrutiny of the grievance arbitrator. It would be\ncontrary to the decision of the National Assembly set out in the ARNA for\nthe President to exercise authority over the management of employees on a case\nby case basis, nominally in the exercise of privilege. Accordingly, the\narbitrator did not err in determining that he could hear the grievances. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ.\n(dissenting): There is agreement with the majority that the applicable standard\nof review is correctness because the existence and scope of parliamentary\nprivileges raise a question of general law that is both of central importance to\nthe legal system as a whole and outside the adjudicator\u2019s specialized area of\nexpertise. The correctness standard also applies because the existence and\nscope of parliamentary privileges raise a constitutional issue. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However,\nthere is disagreement with the majority\u2019s disposition of this appeal. The\nparliamentary privileges at issue defeat the grievance arbitrator\u2019s\njurisdiction. The appeal should therefore be allowed and the grievances\ndismissed. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\njurisdiction of the courts with respect to parliamentary privileges is narrow \u2014\nthey can only ascertain the existence and scope of such privileges. They must\ngive considerable deference to the view taken by legislative assemblies and\ntheir speakers or presidents of the scope of autonomy they consider necessary\nto fulfill their functions. The courts must rely on the necessity test to\nascertain the existence and scope of privileges. This test is concerned with a sphere\nof the legislative body\u2019s activity that will be excluded from the ordinary law.\nThe onus is on the legislative assembly to show that the sphere of activity for\nwhich privilege is claimed is so closely and directly connected with the\nfulfilment by the assembly or its members of their functions as a legislative\nand deliberative body that outside interference would undermine the level of\nautonomy required to enable the assembly and its members to do their work with\ndignity and efficiency. In the analysis of the necessity test, the sphere of\nactivity must not be carved up \u2014 the analysis must not focus on each employee\u2019s\nspecific tasks, but rather on the sphere of activity and the category of\nemployees. Once the courts have found that the sphere of activity and the\ncategory of employees are necessary to the proper functioning of the legislative\nassembly, the inquiry ends, since the privilege has been established. There is thus no need to consider whether\ngrievance arbitration may interfere with the proper functioning of the assembly\nor jeopardize the dignity of the institution. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Security\nis one of the spheres of activity necessary to proceedings in an assembly. In a\nparliamentary democracy, there can be no free debate without security. In order for any legislative assembly to\nperform its constitutional functions with dignity and efficiency, it is essential\nthat it operate in a secure environment. Security is therefore a sphere of\nactivity that is protected by absolute parliamentary privileges. All decisions\nrelating to security fall within this sphere of activity, including all\ntasks performed by an assembly\u2019s security guards.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This case lies at the intersection of the two\nprivileges claimed. All of the tasks performed by the security guards\nemployed by the Assembly fall within a sphere of activity that is\nnecessary to the proper functioning of the Assembly, namely security. This is enough in itself to establish the management privilege. In addition,\nthe guards exercise, in particular, the privilege to exclude strangers on the\nPresident\u2019s behalf. Employees\nto whom the exercise of a recognized parliamentary privilege is delegated\nnecessarily perform a function that is closely and directly connected with the\nAssembly\u2019s activities. The connection required to ground a management privilege\nwill therefore be established where it is shown that a category of employees\nexercises or participates in exercising a parliamentary privilege that is\nrecognized and necessary. Accordingly, the labour relations of such employees fall\nwithin the scope of the privilege over the management of employees, and a\ndecision concerning their dismissal is made in the exercise of this\nprivilege. The dismissal of an employee to whom a privilege has been delegated\nis the ultimate exercise of the management privilege. To preserve the integrity\nof the privileges of the Assembly and its members, the President must be able\nto manage the employees who exercise these privileges without having his or her\ndecisions called into question. The courts cannot dictate to the Assembly how\nit must go about ensuring the security of its members within its walls by\nforcing it to employ people the President no longer trusts. If a grievance arbitrator could review the President\u2019s decision to\nterminate the guards\u2019 employment, this would mean that part of the exercise of\nthe President\u2019s own duties becomes de facto reviewable by a court or\ntribunal and therefore that the Assembly would lose control over decisions\nconcerning its security. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nprivileges claimed in this case were not abolished with the coming into force\nof the ARNA, and the Assembly did not waive its privilege in relation to\nthe employees concerned by enacting this statute. The courts must respect the view taken by a speaker\nor president of a statute dealing with the internal affairs of a legislative\nassembly. The interpretation proposed by the President of the Assembly must therefore\nbe given predominant weight in determining whether the Assembly intended to\nlimit its privileges. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nARNA governs the internal affairs of the Assembly, which are outside the\nscope of the courts\u2019 jurisdiction. The preamble to the ARNA recognizes\nthat the Assembly must protect its proceedings from all interference. Section\u00a0110\nof the ARNA states that the Assembly shall continue to be managed within\nthe scope of the Acts, regulations and rules applicable. Except in cases where\nthe Assembly has expressly provided otherwise, the Acts, regulations and rules\nof the ordinary law have never applied to a sphere of activity that is subject\nto parliamentary privileges. The ordinary law that continues to apply to the\nAssembly is thus necessarily defined by privilege, which has been a constant in\nCanada\u2019s constitutional history.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section\u00a0120\nof the ARNA deals with the power of the Office of\nthe Assembly to exclude categories of employees from\nthe personnel of the civil service and with the management powers granted to\nthe Secretary General, but it does not mention the President\u2019s privileges. It\nis not clear that this provision implicitly abolishes the privilege over the\nmanagement of the Assembly\u2019s employees by incorporating them into the public\nservice or that it partially withdraws the privilege to exclude strangers from\nthe President. Given that the Court has recognized that parliamentary\nprivileges have constitutional status, the statute must be interpreted in such\na way that it does not implicitly abrogate these privileges. It is undesirable to adopt an\ninterpretation to the effect that the Assembly implicitly considers a privilege\nunnecessary, thereby denying its existence. More is\nneeded to abrogate a constitutional privilege. Without requiring express\nlanguage in the ARNA, the modern approach to statutory interpretation\ndoes require clear, unequivocal legislative intent to abolish or modify\nparliamentary privileges that are still necessary. In the end, the ARNA does\nnot have the effect of limiting the privileges held by the President, who may\nassert them when deemed necessary, and courts and tribunals cannot assume\njurisdiction without a clear indication that the Assembly has conferred it on them. Interference by courts or tribunals would\nbe inconsistent with the Assembly\u2019s sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied:\nCanada (House of Commons) v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Speaker of the Quebec  legislature couldn\u2019t use parliamentary privilege to avoid the grievance process  when he fired three security guards, the Supreme Court has ruled. Parliamentary  privilege only covers decisions that are necessary for a legislature to fulfill  its constitutional role. </strong>\r\n     In 2012, the Speaker of Quebec\u2019s  National Assembly (its legislature) fired three security guards for using  Assembly cameras to watch people in nearby hotel rooms. The security guards didn\u2019t  think they should be fired. Their union filed grievances (a formal complaint  under a collective agreement) on their behalf. This was the normal procedure  for civil servants who felt they had been wrongly fired by their employer. In this case, however, the Speaker said  his decision to fire the security guards was covered by \u201cparliamentary  privilege.\u201d Parliamentary privilege is a kind of immunity (legal protection)  that comes from the Constitution. It is meant to allow legislatures to operate without  outside interference. It applies both to individual elected members and to the  legislature as a whole. The Speaker said no one else was allowed to review his  decision\u2014not even a labour arbitrator\u2014because it was covered by privilege. (A labour  arbitrator is a person who decides complaints under a collective agreement.) The Speaker based his argument on  two specific types of privilege. The first was the privilege over the  management of employees. The second was the privilege to exclude \u201cstrangers\u201d from  the National Assembly building, a task the security guards did on the Speaker\u2019s  behalf. (\u201cStrangers\u201d are people who aren\u2019t members or officials of the  legislature.) While both sides agreed that the privilege existed, they  disagreed on whether it covered the firing of the guards.  The arbitrator ruled for the security  guards, saying that the decision to fire them was not protected by  parliamentary privilege, and that the grievances could be heard. The Speaker  asked the courts to review the arbitrator\u2019s decision. The reviewing judge ruled  for the Speaker, saying the decision was, in fact, covered by privilege, and the  arbitrator wasn\u2019t allowed to hear the dispute. The Court of Appeal disagreed  and ruled against the Speaker, saying parliamentary privilege did not apply. Justice  Andromache Karakatsanis also ruled against the Speaker, saying that  parliamentary privilege did not apply to his decision to fire the security  guards. She said the purpose of parliamentary privilege was to allow the  Assembly and its members to do the work they needed to do under the  Constitution independently and with dignity and efficiency. The scope of  protected decisions had to be limited to what was closely and directly  connected to the legislature\u2019s constitutional role. This was important because  courts can\u2019t review decisions protected by privilege\u2014even ones that go against  the <em>Charter</em>. Justice Karakatsanis  said that, while security was crucial to the legislature\u2019s work, not all decisions  about security guard management had to be protected. She also said that, while  excluding strangers from the legislative buildings was protected by privilege,  protecting a decision to fire employees who helped do that was going too far. While  the Speaker could fire the security guards if he had a good reason, Justice  Karakatsanis said he still had to follow the same process for them as he would  for any other civil servant. She said the dispute should go back to the  arbitrator to decide. Five judges agreed with Justice Karakatsanis. Justice Malcolm  Rowe agreed that the case should be sent back to the arbitrator to decide, but  for different reasons. He said the Assembly had set out how it would deal with  employee management in the <em>Act Respecting  the National Assembly</em>. In his view, the Assembly defined how it would use  its privilege by passing this law. Under the Act, all employees of the National  Assembly were civil servants, with the same rights and obligations as other  members of the civil service. The Act provided a procedure to remove employees  from the public service employment scheme, but the procedure was not exercised  in this case. Justice Rowe said that the legislature couldn\u2019t set out the rules  that would apply to it in law, and then later rely on privilege to depart from that  law.  Justices  Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Russell Brown, writing in dissent, would have ruled for the  Speaker. They said security was critical to the Assembly\u2019s ability to do its  work, and the Speaker delegated certain security tasks, including the exclusion  of strangers, to the guards. This meant there was a close and direct link  between their work and the work of the Assembly, and so they were covered by parliamentary  privilege. So was the Speaker\u2019s management of these employees, and his decision  to fire them. Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown noted that giving an arbitrator the power  to revise the Speaker\u2019s decision to fire guards he no longer had confidence in  would take away the Assembly\u2019s control over part of its security.  This decision made clear the scope  of the parliamentary privilege over two activities: the management of employees  and the exclusion of strangers. The majority and dissenting judges agreed that privilege  should be limited to what was necessary for a legislature to fulfil its role.  But the majority judges did not think the Speaker\u2019s decision in this particular  case qualified."

        "summary": "<strong>Internet service providers  (ISPs) can charge copyright holders for some steps taken to identify customers  suspected of illegal downloading, the Supreme Court has ruled. But they can\u2019t  charge for things that they already have to do for free under the <em>Copyright Act.</em></strong>\r\n   Online copyright infringement  (illegal downloading of movies and music) has become common in Canada. Until  2015, no legislation specifically dealt with the problem. But a copyright owner  could find out the identity of a downloader by getting a court order for the  ISP to reveal it. To compensate ISPs for their time and effort, and to prevent  them from being overwhelmed with requests, ISPs could charge a reasonable  amount of money for the service. All of this fell under common law rules (rules  created over time by courts). After consulting with both  copyright owners and consumers, the federal government updated the <em>Copyright Act</em>. The Act\u2019s \u201cnotice-and-notice  regime\u201d came into force in 2015. It was meant to work together with the  existing common law rules. Both common law (made by courts) and statutory law  (made by Parliament) are equally valid. But Parliament can change the common  law by passing a statute (like the Act), if it wants to. Where statutory law  (like the Act) doesn\u2019t cover something, the common law can fill in the blanks.  One of the goals of the notice-and-notice  regime is to discourage infringement. It does this by letting customers know when  their accounts have been used to illegally download copyrighted content. Under  the regime, a copyright owner first has to tell an ISP that it thinks one of  the ISP\u2019s customers has shared content illegally. Normally, the copyright owner  doesn\u2019t know the customer\u2019s real identity. It only knows the Internet Protocol  (IP) address used to download the files. Only the ISP can connect the IP  address to a specific customer. The ISP must figure out who was using the IP  address at the time of the infringement. It must then pass on a notice to the  customer, usually by an automatic message to the email address linked to the  account. It then confirms (provides notice) to the copyright owner that this  has been done. Under the Act, the ISP can\u2019t charge the copyright owner for  doing this. If a copyright owner wants to know  a customer\u2019s identity after notice has been given, it still has to get a court  order. The Act says the ISP has to keep records so it can link IP addresses to  customers later. It also says the ISP can\u2019t charge a fee for keeping these  records. A group of film producers got  together to fight illegal sharing of their films. They wanted to know the  real-life identity of a Rogers customer so that they could sue that person. They  had the customer\u2019s IP address, and got a court order for Rogers to give them the  person\u2019s contact and personal information. The producers eventually planned to  sue about 55,000 more customers, so this would be the first of many requests. Rogers  collected the information, but said the producers had to pay a fee for it. It  argued that the notice-and-notice regime didn\u2019t say that ISPs had to share  customers\u2019 real-life identities with copyright owners. That meant the old  common law rules still applied when copyright owners asked for this information.  The producers disagreed. They said disclosing customer identities was part of  the regime created by the <em>Copyright Act</em>,  and so Rogers couldn\u2019t charge anything for the information. The Federal Court ruled for Rogers,  and said ISPs could be compensated for all steps taken to identify a customer  to a copyright owner. But the Federal Court of Appeal disagreed. It said the  Act said Rogers had to keep the information that would identify customers  anyway. It said Rogers couldn\u2019t be compensated for steps it took that  overlapped with things it already had to do under the Act. Justice Russell Brown, writing for  the majority, said ISPs should be paid a reasonable amount to comply with court  orders to reveal customer identities. But they shouldn\u2019t be paid to do things  they already had to do under the notice-and-notice regime. Justice Brown said  the regimerequired the ISP to give  notice to the customer and inform the copyright owner that it did so. He said  this included a duty to make sure the information was accurate. That meant  Rogers could not charge a copyright owner to check the information to make sure  it was correct. He noted that Rogers followed an eight-step process to respond  to court orders asking for customer identities. Some of the steps had to be  done anyway to comply with the Act, and so he said Rogers should not be paid  for them. But others, like connecting the IP address to the person\u2019s real-life  identity and sharing that with the copyright owner, were not covered by the  Act. Rogers could therefore charge a fee for them. Seven other judges agreed  with Justice Brown. Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9  agreed that ISPs should be paid a reasonable amount to disclose customer  identities as part of a court order. But she said Rogers should be able to  charge for all eight steps in this case. In her view, the steps were not about  confirming that the records were accurate. They were about confirming the  customer\u2019s real-life identity <em>using </em>those  records. Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 said that even if some steps were to confirm that the  records were accurate, Rogers should still be compensated. This was because  people\u2019s contact information could have changed, or some notices may have been  sent to the wrong people. Making a mistake in identifying a customer could mean  that the copyright owner might sue the wrong person. For that reason, Justice  C\u00f4t\u00e9 said that Rogers should be able to charge a reasonable amount for  following a careful process. She said Rogers and other ISPs could only charge  for steps that were necessary, though. This case was about the  interpretation of part of the <em>Copyright  Act</em> that dealt with who should have to pay for an ISP to reveal a  customer\u2019s identity. The appeal was based on a pre-trial motion and the courts  have not decided whether copyright infringement actually took place. Both Justice Brown and Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 agreed  that the matter should go back to the motion judge to decide how much Rogers  should be paid."

        "summary": "<strong>Police officers can\u2019t reveal information about confidential informers to  anyone, including lawyers defending them for crimes, the Supreme Court has  confirmed. The same rule applies to police as to everyone else: information can  only be revealed if there is a risk that an innocent person will go to jail.</strong>\r\n  In  2011, four British Columbia RCMP officers were charged with breach of trust,  fraud, and obstruction of justice relating to their conduct with a  protected witness who was under their care in the \u201cSurrey Six\u201d gang murder case. When  the officers were charged with the crimes, they were told they couldn\u2019t tell  anyone anything that might expose confidential informers. This included their  lawyers. The officers said they wanted to talk about confidential informers  with their lawyers to see if it would help defend themselves against the  charges. The Crown pointed out that no confidential informers were involved in  the acts the officers were charged with (the protected witness was not one). It  said the information wasn\u2019t relevant to the  officers\u2019 defence, and they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to share it. This  case involved a legal concept known as \u201cprivilege.\u201d Privilege protects certain  kinds of information from being revealed. \u201cSolicitor-client privilege\u201d is a well-known  type, and protects communications between a client and a lawyer. But there are  other kinds. This case dealt with \u201cinformer privilege,\u201d which protects the  identities of confidential informers who help police. Because it is in the  public interest to encourage people to come forward to help police solve crimes,  and because informers may be harmed if their identities are revealed, the  protection is strong. Courts have said there is only one exception, known as  \u201cinnocence at stake.\u201d This is when there is a real risk that an innocent person  may go to jail, and s/he can\u2019t raise reasonable doubt about his or her guilt  any other way. The trial judge ruled for the officers. Appeals to the Court of Appeal on  technical issues did not change the result.  Justice  Rosalie Silberman Abella, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, ruled for the  Crown. She stressed the importance of informer privilege, noting the real danger  to people and the justice system itself if sensitive information were revealed.  She said police officers have special obligations because of the positions of  trust that they hold. That includes protecting the identities of confidential  informers. The only reason the accused in this case had information about  confidential informers at all was because of their work as police officers.  Other accused persons would never have the benefit of such information, so  preventing the officers from sharing it did not disadvantage them. Police  officers are entitled to the full protection of the law, and to be treated  fairly, but they are not entitled to be treated better than other accused. Justice  Abella said that, like other accused, police officers should not be allowed to share  informer-privileged information with their lawyers unless they show they might  be wrongfully convicted if they don\u2019t. The officers in this case never argued  that they would be; they only said the information might be relevant to their  defence.  This  decision confirmed that the only time an exception will be made to informer  privilege is when there is a danger someone will be wrongfully convicted of a  crime. It made clear that solicitor-client privilege doesn\u2019t destroy informer  privilege, and doesn\u2019t<strong> </strong>allow police  officers to identify confidential informers to their lawyers. <strong>NOTE: </strong>This Case in Brief  was not published at the time of the decision due to a publication ban. It was  published on May 8, 2019, after the publication ban was lifted."

Where, as here, the province sues to recover the cost of\nhealth care benefits on an aggregate basis, that is, for a population of\ninsured persons, s.\u00a02(5)(b) of the Act governs the compellability of\nhealth care documents and provides that \u201cthe health care records and documents\nof particular individual insured persons or the documents relating to the\nprovision of health care benefits for particular individual insured persons are\nnot compellable\u201d. P applied for production of a collection of health care databases\ncontaining coded health care information which the province intended to use to\nprove causation and damages in its action, on the basis that access to those\ndatabases was critical to its ability to defend itself and that production was\nnot barred by s.\u00a02(5)(b). The application judge found that the databases\nwere compellable, since, once the information contained in the databases was\nanonymized, s.\u00a02(5)(b) did not apply.

As such, by operation of s.\u00a02(5)(b)\nof the Act, the databases are not compellable. Neither their relevance to the\npleadings in the province\u2019s action nor their anonymization insulate them from\nthe text of s.\u00a02(5)(b), read in its entire context and in its grammatical\nand ordinary sense, in harmony with the Act\u2019s scheme and object. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The databases at issue in this\ncase are both \u201crecords\u201d and \u201cdocuments\u201d within the meaning of the Act. They\nstore the health care information of particular individual insured persons. And,\nwhile that information is stored on an aggregate rather than individual basis,\neach data entry in the databases is derived from particular individuals\u2019\nclinical records. The mere alteration of the method by which that health care\ninformation is stored \u2014 that is, by compiling it from individual clinical\nrecords into aggregate databases \u2014 does not change the nature of the\ninformation itself. Even in an aggregate form, the databases, to the extent\nthat they contain information drawn from individuals\u2019 clinical records, remain\n\u201chealth care records and documents of particular individual insured persons\u201d.\nFurther, even were it the case that the databases are not, in their entirety,\n\u201chealth care records and documents of particular individual insured persons\u201d, s.\u00a02(5)(b)\nprotects a second category of records and documents, that is, \u201cdocuments\nrelating to the provision of health care benefits\u201d. By using expansive language\n\u2014 relating to \u2014 in describing this second category, the Legislature broadened\nthe scope of protection furnished under s.\u00a02(5)(b) to include documents\nthat are not health care records and documents themselves, such as billing\nrecords and records of drugs administered to a patient. Much of the information\nstored in the databases is precisely that.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section\u00a02(5)(b) of the Act\nconditions the compellability of the records and documents it describes not\nupon their relevance, but upon their nature. The relevance of those records and\ndocuments to a claim brought on an aggregate basis does not alter that nature. Therefore,\nirrespective of their relevance, such records and documents that fall within\nthe scope of s.\u00a02(5)(b) are not compellable. The courts below erred by\nallowing what they saw as the relevance of the aggregate databases to supplant\nthe meaning of, and the legislative intent behind, s.\u00a02(5)(b).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The phrase \u201cparticular individual\ninsured persons\u201d in s.\u00a02(5)(b) is not synonymous with \u201cidentifiable\nindividual insured persons\u201d. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cparticular\u201d is\n\u201cdistinct\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d. Based on this definition, the databases fall within s.\u00a02(5)(b)\u2019s\nscope as comprising the \u201chealth care records and documents of\u201d and the\n\u201cdocuments relating to the provision of health care benefits for\u201d each distinct\nand specific individual in British Columbia, even if, once anonymized, the\ninformation contained within the databases is no longer capable of identifying\nan individual insured person. In addition, equating \u201cparticular\u201d with\n\u201cidentifiable\u201d would be inconsistent with the Act\u2019s scheme and would render\nother provisions in the Act redundant or nonsensical.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred\nto: British Columbia v.

        "summary": "<strong><abbr title=\"British Columbia\">BC</abbr> does not have to give a  tobacco company databases of health care information about individual BC  residents as part of a lawsuit, the Supreme Court has said.</strong>\r\n   In 2000,  the province of British Columbia passed the <em>Tobacco  Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act</em>. This let it sue tobacco  companies for health-care costs related to tobacco use, and the Supreme Court  found it constitutional in 2005. In 2001, BC sued Philip Morris International  and other tobacco companies. Philip Morris makes and sells Marlboro cigarettes,  among other brands.  <abbr title=\"British Columbia\">BC</abbr> sued  \u201con an aggregate basis,\u201d meaning on behalf of a group of insured persons,  rather than for any individual. To prove that tobacco caused health care  problems and how much those problems cost, it said it would rely on several  databases. The databases held individual health-care information for BC  residents between 1991 and 2011, such as costs of medical care, prescription  drug use, and status of health coverage.  Anyone  being sued has a right to see the evidence the other party is relying on. This allows  a defendant to challenge the evidence, and is part of a fair trial. Philip  Morris asked for the databases. However, the Act said that if <abbr title=\"British Columbia\">BC</abbr> sued on behalf  of a population (\u201con an aggregate basis\u201d), it could not share information about  individuals insured by its health plan. As a compromise, BC said that the  tobacco companies could look at individual-level information at a Statistics  Canada Research Data Centre, under strict controls. While other tobacco companies  agreed, Philip Morris did not think this was enough to make the trial fair. It  asked the court to order BC to give it the databases directly, with names and  other identifying information removed. It also asked for individuals to be  linked across databases, to make it easier to analyze the data. The trial  judge ordered <abbr title=\"British Columbia\">BC</abbr> to share the databases, after removing identifying  information. He said that the databases were not the kind of health care  records the Act was meant to cover. The Court of Appeal agreed. It said that BC  should not be able to rely on evidence while denying Philip Morris access to  it. It also said there was no real threat to personal privacy. Justice  Russell Brown, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, disagreed with the lower courts  and ruled for BC. He said the databases did contain information about  individuals, so could not be shared. Compiling individual health-care information  into databases did not change the <em>kind</em> of information it was. Besides, the Act said even documents <em>relating</em> <em>to </em>individual health care benefits could not be shared. The lower  courts did not consider this. Justice Brown said the lower courts were wrong to  focus on how relevant the databases were to the lawsuit, rather than on the  kind of information the Act said could not be shared. He also pointed out that  information about \u201cparticular\u201d insured persons did not mean information about \u201cidentifiable\u201d  insured persons under the Act. That meant that removing identifying information  would not solve the problem. Justice Brown said that it was too early in  the process to talk about trial fairness, because the Act protected it in other  ways. Also, the Supreme Court had already found the Act constitutional, meaning  it considered it would not lead to unfair trials. He noted that BC would have  to share the databases with Philip Morris if an expert witness relied on them  in court. Philip Morris could also ask for a \u201cstatistically meaningful sample,\u201d  with identifying information removed, under a different part of the Act.  In a  similar case in 2016, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal said that New Brunswick  did not have to share similar databases with tobacco companies. (The Act passed  by New Brunswick is mostly the same as <abbr title=\"British Columbia\">BC</abbr>\u2019s.) This decision ensures a similar  provision is applied the same way in both provinces."

(\u201cCompany\u201d) purchased a wooded\nlot in a residential zone in Ville de Lorraine (\u201cTown\u201d), intending to\neventually subdivide the lot for residential construction. On June\u00a023,\n1991, the Town adopted by\u2011law U\u201191, the effect of which was that\napproximately 60\u00a0percent of the area of the Company\u2019s lot became part of a\nconservation zone in which the authorized uses were limited to recreational and\nleisure activities. The Company\u2019s majority shareholder learned of the by\u2011law\nin late 2001 or early 2002. In 2004, the Town informed the Company that it did\nnot intend to change the zoning restrictions applicable to the lot. In November\n2007, the Company brought an action against the Town in which it sought to have\nthe by\u2011law declared to be null, alleging that it had been a victim of\ndisguised expropriation. In 2010, the Company amended its motion to institute\nproceedings to request that the Town\u2019s by\u2011law URB\u201103, which had\nreplaced by\u2011law U\u201191, and by\u2011law 10\u201102 of the\nMunicipalit\u00e9 r\u00e9gionale de comt\u00e9 de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se\u2011De Blainville be declared to\nbe null. The latter by\u2011law had been adopted to bring the land use and\ndevelopment plan into line with the restrictive zoning designation for the\nportion of the Company\u2019s lot that was affected by by\u2011law U\u201191. The\nSuperior Court dismissed the action in nullity for being out of time. The Court\nof Appeal allowed the appeal and declared the by\u2011laws to be inoperable in\nrespect of the Company.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held:\nThe appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nSuperior Court judge exercised his discretion under art.\u00a033 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure judicially. A plaintiff who intends to contest a zoning\nby\u2011law he or she considers abusive must bring an action within a\nreasonable time. In this case, the judge was justified in applying the\npresumption of legal knowledge to determine that the starting point for\nreasonable time was June\u00a023, 1991. Sixteen years elapsed between the\nadoption of by\u2011law U\u201191 and its being contested in court. In\naddition, the time that elapsed after the Company\u2019s majority shareholder had\nacquired factual knowledge of the by\u2011law was at least 5\u00a0years.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0property owner who thinks  s/he is the victim of \u201cdisguised expropriation\u201d needs to act in a reasonable  time to challenge a municipal by-law, the Supreme Court has ruled. An owner can  still ask to be compensated for the loss in property value even if the court rejects  the challenge.</strong>\r\n   In 1989, the numbered company  2646-8926 Qu\u00e9bec inc. bought a wooded property in the town of Lorraine. Mr.  Pichette, the majority shareholder, planned to build a housing subdivision  there eventually. But in 1991 the town passed a zoning regulation and included  over half of the property in a conservation area. Mr. Pichette did not find out  about this until about ten years later when he visited the land for the first  time. He tried to get the town to change its mind about what it had done to the  property, but it didn\u2019t. Mr. Pichette accused the town of \u201cdisguised  expropriation.\u201d Disguised expropriation is when a government illegally takes away some of the rights of owning  a property (but not the property itself) without fair compensation. In this  case, Mr. Pichette said passing a zoning by-law that unfairly limited use of  the property without fair compensation was disguised expropriation.<strong></strong>\r\n   A  property owner who thinks the government has taken away his or her property illegally  can ask the courts for help. For example, a court can cancel a by-law or  declare that it can\u2019t be applied to the property. The court\u2019s power in these cases is  discretionary, meaning it can refuse to intervene, for example, if the property  owner waited too long to do anything. Mr. Pichette\u2019s company turned to the  courts for help in 2007. The company asked for the by-law to be overturned and  for the town to pay damages.  The trial judge said the two issues  (overturning the by-law and the damages) should be decided separately. He focused  on the by-law, keeping the issue of damages aside to decide later. He rejected  the request to overturn the by-law because it was made too late. The  Court of Appeal disagreed with this. It said the trial judge should have thought about whether the by-law was  an abuse of power, which courts could intervene to correct even though there  was a delay. (An abuse of power is when a state actor does something that it  was not supposed to, with or without bad intent.)<strong> </strong>The Court of Appeal ruled for the property owner, but sent the matter  back to the lower court to decide on compensation. The town appealed. Chief Justice Richard Wagner,  writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, ruled for the town. The question before  the Court was whether the trial judge could refuse to declare the by-law unenforceable  against the owner of the land. Specifically, it was whether the trial judge  could refuse to do so when the owner claimed the by-law was illegal, but waited  too long to take legal action. Chief Justice Wagner said the trial judge\u2019s  decision to deny the claim because of the delay was reasonable. The trial judge  was allowed to use his discretion this way in this situation. Sixteen years had  passed from the time the by-law came into effect to the time the company  challenged it in court. At least four years had passed from the time Mr.  Pichette learned about it. Both delays were unreasonable. Also, the Civil Code  of Quebec said the owner no longer had a right to make the claim because it had  waited more than ten years to act. However, Chief Justice Wagner noted that an  owner who didn\u2019t challenge a by-law in a reasonable time could still ask for compensation  to cover the loss in property value caused by the by-law. He didn\u2019t decide on  compensation in this case, because that issue was separate from the issue of  whether the by-law could be enforced, as the trial judge had said.<strong></strong>\r\n     This case dealt with zoning  regulations that a property owner said amounted to disguised expropriation. The  decision confirmed that an owner trying to have a zoning  by-law declared void or unenforceable has to act in a reasonable time to defend  the rights claimed, or the request will be denied."

The police demanded a breath sample after the accident but S refused, on\nthe advice of a state\u2011provided lawyer to whom he spoke after his arrest.\nHe was charged with refusing to provide a breath sample after causing an\naccident resulting in a death, under s.\u00a0255(3.2) of the Criminal Code,\nand with impaired driving causing death and impaired driving causing bodily\nharm. Sometime after being charged, S was abducted by vigilantes who cut off\nhis thumb with pruning shears for his role in the child\u2019s death. S eventually\npleaded guilty to the s.\u00a0255(3.2) offence and the other charges were\nwithdrawn.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nsentencing judge imposed a 4\u2011month sentence of imprisonment on S, coupled\nwith a 30\u2011month driving prohibition. He found that the accident was\ncaused by a non\u2011impaired driving error, S having hit the gas pedal\ninstead of the brake pedal. He further found that S\u2019s refusal to provide a\nbreath sample was the result of bad legal advice and was a mistake of law,\nwhich fundamentally changed S\u2019s moral culpability. In addition to that and\nother mitigating factors, the sentencing judge took into account the violent\nvigilante actions against S. The Court of Appeal allowed a Crown appeal from\nthat sentence and increased the custodial portion of it to 26\u00a0months. It\nfound that the deficient legal advice did not constitute a mistake of law and\nit could not be used to mitigate S\u2019s sentence. It also found that the\nsentencing judge failed to consider, as an aggravating factor, that S chose to\ndrive while distracted in the context of his health and pre\u2011existing\nalcohol problems, and that the sentencing judge erred by taking the vigilante\nviolence into account.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Gascon\u00a0J.\ndissenting in part): The appeal should be\nallowed in part.\u00a0The sentence of 26\u00a0months\u2019 imprisonment imposed by\nthe Court of Appeal should be set aside and replaced with one of time served.\nThe 30\u2011month driving prohibition should be upheld.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nAbella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Wagner, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe\u00a0JJ.: The sentencing range for the s.\u00a0255(3.2) offence is the same\nas for impaired driving causing death and driving \u201cover 80\u201d causing death \u2014\nlow penitentiary sentences of 2 or 3 years to more substantial penitentiary\nsentences of 8 to 10 years. The sentencing range is broad\nbecause these offences cover a broad spectrum of offenders and circumstances.\nIn unique cases, mitigating factors, collateral consequences, or other\nattenuating circumstances relating to the offence or offender may warrant the\nimposition of a sentence that falls below this broad range, or aggravating\nfactors may warrant the imposition of a sentence that exceeds this broad range.\nAs long as the objectives and principles of sentencing codified in ss.\u00a0718\nto 718.2 of the Criminal Code are met and respected, the sentence will\nbe fit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Facts\nthat are irrelevant to the gravity of an offence and to the level of the\noffender\u2019s moral blameworthiness with respect to that offence cannot be relied\non as aggravating in the sentencing analysis. To consider such facts is an\nerror in principle, which may cause a court to punish the offender for an\noffence for which he or she was neither tried nor convicted, and result in the\nimposition of an unfit sentence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Tailoring\nsentences to the circumstances of the offence and the offender may require the\nsentencing judge to examine collateral consequences. A collateral consequence\nincludes any consequence arising from the commission of an offence, the\nconviction for an offence, or the sentence imposed for an offence, that impacts\nthe offender. Collateral consequences do not need to be foreseeable, nor must\nthey flow naturally from the conviction, sentence, or commission of the\noffence, but they must relate to the offence and the circumstances of the\noffender. There is no rigid formula for taking collateral consequences into\naccount, and there is no requirement that collateral consequences emanate from\nstate misconduct in order to be considered a factor at sentencing. However, the\nfundamental principle of proportionality must prevail in every case \u2014 collateral\nconsequences cannot be used to reduce a sentence to a point where it becomes\ndisproportionate to the gravity of the offence or the moral blameworthiness of\nthe offender. Violent actions against an offender for his or her role in the\ncommission of an offence necessarily form part of the personal circumstances of\nthat offender, and should therefore be taken into account when determining an\nappropriate sentence. However, vigilante violence should only be considered to\na limited extent, as giving it too much weight at sentencing allows this kind\nof criminal conduct to gain undue legitimacy in the judicial process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although\nit is not a defence to a criminal charge, mistake of law can be used as a mitigating\nfactor in sentencing, because offenders who honestly but mistakenly believe in\nthe lawfulness of their actions are less morally blameworthy than offenders who\nare unsure about the lawfulness of their actions, or know that their actions\nare unlawful. A mistake of law is a legal concept with rigorous requirements,\nwhich occurs only where a person has an honest but mistaken belief in the\nlegality of his or her actions. Confusion or uncertainty as to the lawfulness\nof one\u2019s actions does not meet the legal requirements for mistake of law,\nhowever, such confusion may still be relevant to the sentencing analysis\ndepending on the facts of the particular case. Its mitigating effect, if any,\nwill necessarily be less than in a situation where there is a true mistake of\nlaw. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nfinding of non\u2011impairment is a relevant mitigating factor when sentencing\nan offender for refusing to provide a breath sample, but the mitigating effect\nof such a finding must be limited for several reasons. First, sentencing\nhearings for refusal offences could be transformed into de facto impaired\ndriving trials, adding to the complexity and length of the proceedings and\ndepleting scarce judicial resources. Second, since refusal offences are in\nessence an evidence gathering tool to obtain the most reliable evidence of\nimpairment, the seriousness of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the\noffender stem primarily from the refusal itself, and not from the offender\u2019s\nlevel of impairment. Third, it could create an incentive for individuals not to\nprovide a breath sample, be convicted of the refusal offence, and then\nsubsequently argue at the sentencing hearing that they were not impaired to\nbenefit from a reduced sentence. The extent to which the mitigating effect must\nbe limited is a fact\u2011driven exercise that depends on the specific\ncircumstances in any given case, and the onus is on the offender to establish, on a balance of\nprobability, that he or she was not impaired at the time the offence was\ncommitted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe instant case, both the sentencing judge and the Court of Appeal committed\nerrors in principle in arriving at the sentences they imposed and these errors\nresulted in the imposition of unfit sentences. The Court of Appeal erred when\nit recast the circumstances of the accident and effectively sentenced S for the\nuncharged offence of careless driving or dangerous driving causing death, and\nwhen it held that the vigilante violence inflicted on S could not be considered\nwhen crafting an appropriate sentence. The sentencing judge erred in finding\nthat S was acting under a mistake of law when he refused to provide a breath\nsample and that this factor fundamentally changed his moral culpability, and in\ngiving undue weight to S\u2019s non\u2011impairment as a mitigating factor.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nS\u2019s unique case, the following factors operate to remove his sentence from the\nnormal range for a s.\u00a0255(3.2) offence: he was not impaired at the time of\nthe accident, he refused to provide a breath sample because of ill\u2011informed\nand incorrect legal advice, and he was attacked by vigilantes. However, they do\nnot justify the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, which does not\nproperly account for the gravity of the offence. A sentence of 15 to 18\u00a0months\u2019\nimprisonment would have been a fit sentence at the time of sentencing. However,\nS has already served just over 10 and a half months of his custodial sentence\nand has spent almost 9 months awaiting the Court\u2019s decision. It would not be in\nthe interests of justice to re\u2011incarcerate S at this time \u2014 it would\ncause him undue hardship and serve no useful purpose. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nGascon\u00a0J. (dissenting in part): There is agreement with the majority\nthat the Court of Appeal\u2019s sentence of 26 months in prison was unfit. However,\nthere is disagreement with the sentence of 15 to 18 months in prison prescribed\nby the majority. The four\u2011month carceral sentence imposed by the\nsentencing judge should be restored. It cannot be revisited on appeal since it\ndoes not implicate a flawed process (material errors in reasoning) \u2014 such as an\nerror in principle or an error in weighing a relevant factor unreasonably \u2014 or\na flawed outcome (demonstrable unfitness). \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nsentencing judge made no error in principle in his analysis of S\u2019s mistake of\nlaw. A mistake of law does not require an offender to be certain as to the\nlawfulness of their conduct. Such a narrow construction is antithetical to the\ncontextual and individualized nature of sentencing. Mistake of law is a\nflexible concept broad enough to include some confusion or uncertainty about\nthe law. Accordingly, thinking conduct is likely legal, but being uncertain, is\nsufficient to constitute a mistake of law. Mistake of law should not be dealt\nwith as a binary, where only a person being completely confident that their\nconduct is legal fundamentally alters culpability. Trial judges should be\ntrusted to take a contextual approach \u2014 one which considers the source, nature\nand reasonableness of a mistake, along with any degrees of uncertainty \u2014 when\nallocating mitigating weight to a mistake of law for the purpose of sentencing.\nIn any event, here, S was certain as to the legality of refusing to provide a\nbreath sample, and therefore made a mistake of law, even on the majority\u2019s\ntest.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nsentencing judge did not give excessive weight to S\u2019s sobriety. An appellate\ncourt can intervene on sentence when a sentencing judge weighs a particular\nfactor unreasonably, but not when the appellate court would have simply weighed\nthe relevant factor differently. When reviewing trial reasons, appellate courts\nmust read the reasons as a whole, and should not isolate single passages from\ntrial reasons to find errors in reasoning. In this case, isolating a passage\nfrom the sentencing judge\u2019s decision to conclude that he gave excessive weight\nto S\u2019s sobriety when sentencing him mischaracterizes the sentencing judge\u2019s\nreasons. The sentencing judge looked at the combined effect of sobriety, bad\nlegal advice, vigilante violence and the many other mitigating factors in this\ncase. Accordingly, his weighing of sobriety provides no basis for appellate\nintervention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even\nif a trial judge makes no errors in the sentencing process, a court of appeal\ncan interfere if the ultimate sentence is demonstrably unfit, meaning that the\nsentence is clearly unreasonable. Demonstrable unfitness is not an unchecked\nsubjective inquiry. An appellate court must demonstrate the unfitness of a\nsentence with reference to the Criminal Code\u2019s sentencing principles,\nincluding proportionality (s.\u00a0718.1), the sentencing objectives (s.\u00a0718),\nindividualization (s.\u00a0718.2(a)) and parity (s.\u00a0718.2(b)). A sentence\nof four months of imprisonment in the circumstances of this case is not demonstrably\nunfit based on this established approach to sentencing appeals. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nfit sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence (how serious\nthe offence is) and the degree of responsibility of the offender (their moral\nblameworthiness). In the instant case, the gravity of the offence \u2014 refusing to\nprovide a breath sample after a fatal car accident \u2014 is very high. However, S\u2019s\nmoral blameworthiness \u2014 as a sober driver who was in a genuine car accident\ncaused by a non\u2011impaired driving error and who refused to provide a\nbreath sample only because he was expressly instructed to do so by his lawyer \u2014\ncould hardly be lower. The tensions that inevitably arise when balancing these\nconflicting considerations underlie the particularly delicate task of\nascertaining proportionality. However, appellate courts are not in a better\nposition than the sentencing judge to reconcile these conflicting forces;\nrather, given the latter\u2019s proximity to the facts of the case and his\ninstitutional expertise, appellate courts are in a worse position. Courts of\nappeal must defer to the sentencing judge with respect to this complex\nbalancing exercise.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Other\nthan the sentencing judge\u2019s expertise and S\u2019s unique circumstances, two\nadditional factors reinforce the proportionality of a significantly reduced\nsentence. First, S was not only mistaken in law, but reasonably mistaken. He\nrelied on a state\u2011provided lawyer\u2019s advice when refusing to provide a\nbreath sample, reasonably so. His moral blameworthiness is therefore\ninfinitesimal.\u00a0Second, the constitutional significance of the right to\ncounsel also weighs in favour of a significantly reduced sentence. People must\nbe able to rely on legal advice given when exercising their constitutional\nright to counsel.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nproportionality of the sentence is reinforced by the applicable sentencing\nobjectives. The objective of deterring the offender and other persons from\ncommitting offences must be emphasized in the impaired driving context.\nHowever, the facts of the case at bar cannot be disregarded, as they are\ncritical to a proportionate sentence for S. S was not tempted to commit a\ncrime, nor did he commit a crime because of insufficient deterrence. He refused\nto provide a breath sample because he was told to do so by his lawyer. A stiff\nsentence in this case will not deter others from refusing to provide a breath\nsample; rather, it will deter others from following their lawyer\u2019s advice.\nSimilarly, the objective of denouncing unlawful conduct and the harm done to\nvictims or to the community that is caused by unlawful conduct must be\nemphasized, but without disregarding the unique facts of this case. Mere\ncommission of an administrative offence, when advised to do so by a state\u2011provided\nlawyer, does not warrant strict denunciation, as it lacks the required moral\nblameworthiness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nsentence should be reduced to account for any mitigating circumstances relating\nto the offence. In the instant case, S\u2019s reliance on bad legal advice, his\nsobriety and the vigilante attacks he suffered are not the only mitigating\nfactors. S\u2019s sentence must also be reduced because of his guilty plea, his\nextreme remorse, his lack of a criminal record, his strong community support\nand the fact that he has been a productive member of society. These mitigating\nfactors operate collectively in determining a fit sentence. Viewed together,\nthey are remarkably mitigating. The majority\u2019s willingness to ultimately impose\na 10\u2011and\u2011a\u2011half\u2011month sentence, despite signalling that\nS\u2019s conduct warrants a sentence as high as 18\u00a0months, demonstrates that\nsuch a harsh sentence would be disproportionate in S\u2019s circumstances. Precisely\nhow these mitigating factors are reflected in a particular sentence is most\nempirically determined through the sentencing principle of parity, which\nprovides that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar\noffenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. The facts in\nS\u2019s case are entirely unique. There are no similar offenders in similar\ncircumstances against which his sentence can be reasonably measured. The case\nwhich is closest in terms of moral blameworthiness imposed the same carceral\nsentence as was imposed here (four months). Further, the jurisprudence\nestablishes a range of up to a year when sentencing this offence only in terms\nof obstruction of justice, rather than as a proxy for impaired driving. The\nflexibility found in the jurisprudence demonstrates that Parliament intended\nthe s.\u00a0255(3.2) offence to operate harshly enough to deter any incentive\nfor refusal, but flexibly enough to recognize that refusal is not coterminous\nwith impaired driving in all situations. Accordingly, based on the unique facts\nin this case and the jurisprudence, there is no basis to claim that S\u2019s four\u2011month\nsentence was manifestly unfit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied:\nR. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Refusing a breathalyzer after causing a fatal accident is as serious as the  crime of drunk driving causing death, the Supreme Court has confirmed. </strong>\r\n     In  May 2013, two year-old Geo Mounsef was killed when Richard Alan Suter drove his  car onto a restaurant patio where the Mounsef family was eating dinner. Mr.  Suter and his wife were arguing as he pulled up to park in front of the  restaurant. At one point, he accidentally hit the gas pedal instead of the  brake and drove into the patio. The sentencing judge later found that Mr. Suter  wasn\u2019t impaired by alcohol at the time. Mr.  Suter was arrested. He spoke to a legal aid lawyer, who confused him and gave  him bad legal advice by telling him not to provide a breath sample. Mr. Suter  then refused to provide the sample, despite being told by a police officer that  this was a crime.  Sometime  after his arrest, Mr. Suter was abducted by a group of vigilantes who used a  set of pruning shears to cut off his thumb. The attack was linked to the death  of Geo Mounsef. Mr.  Suter pleaded guilty to refusing to provide a breath sample after causing an  accident where someone died. There is a wide range of possible penalties for  this, depending on the circumstances and the offender\u2019s moral blame. The  maximum penalty is life in prison, the same as for drunk driving causing death.  This is to reflect the seriousness of the crime and discourage people from  refusing. When a person refuses to provide a breath sample, it means the  police, court, public, and family of the person who died will never really know  whether the driver was impaired or \u201cover 80\u201d at the time. The  sentencing judge would have sent Mr. Suter to prison for over three years, but lowered  the sentence to four months plus a thirty-month driving ban because of the  circumstances. He said four months was appropriate because Mr. Suter\u2019s refusal  to provide a breath sample was based on the lawyer\u2019s bad advice, and that  \u201cfundamentally\u201d reduced his moral blame. Both Mr. Suter and the Crown appealed.  The Court of Appeal increased his prison sentence to twenty-six months.  Justice  Michael Moldaver, writing for the majority at the Supreme Court, said that both  the Court of Appeal and sentencing judge made errors. The Court of Appeal, in  raising Mr. Suter\u2019s sentence to twenty-six months, effectively punished Mr.  Suter for crimes he wasn\u2019t charged with (careless driving or dangerous driving  causing death). It also didn\u2019t consider the vigilante attack as part of his  total circumstances. On the other hand, the sentencing judge, in sentencing Mr.  Suter to four months, gave too much weight to the fact that Mr. Suter was not  drunk at the time and received bad legal advice. Justice Moldaver agreed with the  sentencing judge that Mr. Suter should have received a lower sentence than  would normally be the case. But given the sentencing judge\u2019s errors and the seriousness  of the crime, he thought four months was too low. He decided that a 15- to  18-month sentence would have been appropriate at the time of the plea. However,  Mr. Suter had already served just over 10\u00bd months in custody, and spent almost  nine months awaiting the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Justice Moldaver said that  sending him back to jail now would serve no useful purpose, so he reduced the  sentence to \u201ctime served\u201d (leaving the thirty-month driving ban in place). Five  judges agreed. Justice  Cl\u00e9ment Gascon disagreed and would have kept the four-month sentence. While he  would have weighed the facts differently than the sentencing judge did, he  didn\u2019t find the sentence \u201cclearly unreasonable\u201d (the legal standard required to  change it). Justice Gascon said the circumstances of this case were unique and particularly  sympathetic; Mr. Suter was sober and only refused the breath sample because he  was explicitly told to by his state-provided lawyer. This left him with very  little moral blame. In any case, he said, the sentencing judge was in the best  position to weigh these facts and decide an appropriate sentence. This was the first  time the Court ruled on 2008 changes to the <em>Criminal  Code</em> that raised penalties for refusing a breath sample after an accident where  someone is hurt or dies. The changes meant that refusing a breath sample would  lead to the same penalties as impaired and \u201cover 80\u201d offences causing injury or  death. The decision highlighted that a sentence must match both the seriousness  of the crime and the person\u2019s level of responsibility.\r\n  "

        "summary": "<strong>The Law Societies of British Columbia and Ontario had the power to deny  approval to a proposed law school that would have required students to follow a  religiously-based code of conduct restricting sexual behaviour, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Trinity  Western University (TWU) is a private Christian university in Langley, British  Columbia. It wants to open a law school. At TWU, all students and faculty have  to follow a code of conduct (known as a \u201ccovenant\u201d) that prohibits sexual  intimacy except within marriage between a man and a woman. Students and faculty  must follow the covenant the whole time they attend or work at TWU, whether  they are on or off campus. The Law  Society of British Columbia regulates lawyers in B.C., while the Law Society of  Ontario (formerly known as the Law Society of Upper Canada) does the same in  Ontario. Both Law Societies get their powers from the government. One of their  roles is to protect the public interest in deciding who can practice law in  those provinces. Usually, a person who wants to become a lawyer must have a  degree from an approved law school.  <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr> applied for approval of its proposed law school in both B.C. and Ontario. In  B.C., the Law Society put the decision to a vote by its members (all lawyers  already licensed to practice law there). A majority voted against <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>'s  proposal, and the Law Society passed a resolution to formalize the decision. In  Ontario, the Law Society\u2019s \u201cbenchers\u201d (board of directors) decided not to  approve the proposal.  <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr> and  one of its graduates (who hoped to attend the law school) asked the courts to review  the Law Societies\u2019 decisions in both provinces. They said that the decisions  violated freedom of religion and other rights protected under the <em>Charter</em>. In B.C., the B.C. Supreme Court  and Court of Appeal ruled for <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr> and said that the Law Society\u2019s decision was  invalid. In Ontario, the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal both ruled for  the Law Society. At the  Supreme Court of Canada, the majority ruled for the Law Societies. Justices  Rosalie Silberman Abella, Michael Moldaver, Andromache Karakatsanis, Richard  Wagner (who was not yet Chief Justice when the cases were heard), and Cl\u00e9ment  Gascon wrote their reasons together. For them, the question the Court had to  answer was whether the Law Societies\u2019 decisions not to approve <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>\u2019s proposed law  school were reasonable. They said that they were. To be considered reasonable,  the decisions had to strike a proportionate balance between the religious  rights of the <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr> community and the Law Societies\u2019 objectives to protect the  public interest. For the majority, the \u201cpublic interest\u201d included promoting  equality by ensuring equal access to the legal profession, supporting diversity  within the bar, and preventing harm to LGBTQ law students. Neither Law Society  was stopping someone from following his or her own religious beliefs (including  following the covenant if s/he wanted to). They only prevented <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr> from  enforcing beliefs on other members of the law school community. Because of this,  the majority said the decisions did not seriously limit anyone\u2019s religious freedoms.  As the benefits of  protecting the public interest were important, and the limitation on religious  rights was minor, the majority said that both decisions reflected a  proportionate balance, and were therefore reasonable. Then-Chief Justice Beverley  McLachlin agreed with the majority that the Law Societies\u2019 decisions were  proportionate and reasonable. However, she disagreed with their approach. In  her view, courts reviewing administrative decisions challenged under the <em>Charter</em> should first look at whether a <em>Charter </em>right  (rather than a value) has been breached. If so, the state actor that made the  decision has to show that the infringement is reasonable and justifiable in a  free and democratic society. Unlike the majority, she considered the limitation  on the religious, expressive, and associational rights of the <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr> community to  be serious. But, in addition to negative effects on diversity and equality  within the legal profession, she emphasized that approving <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>\u2019s proposal would  condone discrimination against LGBTQ people based on sexual orientation. The  Law Societies\u2019 refusal to condone this discrimination was in keeping with their  legal obligations to act in the public interest. In Chief Justice McLachlin\u2019s  view, these obligations outweighed <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>\u2019s claims to freedom of religion.  Justice Malcolm Rowe agreed with the  majority that the Law Societies\u2019 decisions were reasonable, but disagreed with  both how and why they reached this conclusion. Like Chief Justice McLachlin and  the dissent, Justice Rowe said that the analysis must focus on <em>Charter </em>rights  (rather than <em>Charter </em>values). Like them, he also said that the state  actor bears the burden of justifying any limit on those rights. In this case,  however, Justice Rowe said the Law Societies\u2019 decisions did not infringe the <em>Charter</em> rights raised by <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>. The TWU community was not just seeking to protect its own  beliefs and practices. It wanted the Law Societies to approve a law school  where students would be forced to follow Evangelical Christian beliefs \u2013  whether they shared these beliefs or not. Justice Rowe said that freedom of  religion protects the right to believe in whatever one chooses and to follow  those beliefs. But it does not protect the right to impose those beliefs and  practices on others. For this reason, he said that <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>\u2019s claim fell outside the  scope of freedom of religion protected by the <em>Charter</em>.  Justices Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Russell  Brown disagreed with the other judges, and would have ruled for <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>. Writing in  dissent, they said that the laws that gave the Law Societies their powers  limited what they could consider in deciding whether to approve a law school.  For them, the decision was only about whether graduates would be fit to  practice law (i.e., competent and ethical). Since there was no evidence that  the graduates would not be fit, they said the Law Societies should have  approved <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>\u2019s proposal. In the dissenting justices\u2019 view, freedom of religion  also protects the freedom to express religious views (for example, through the  covenant) and to associate to study law in an educational community reflecting  their religious beliefs. They disagreed with Chief Justice McLachlin that  approving the proposal meant condoning discrimination. For them, a state actor  (like a law society) accommodating a private actor (like a faith-based  university) does not mean it supports the private actor\u2019s beliefs. If this were  so, it would indirectly force private actors to follow the <em>Charter</em> (even  though the <em>Charter</em> only applies to state actors). They noted that it is  also in the public interest to accommodate different religious beliefs. They  also noted that law societies in other provinces had approved <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr>\u2019s proposed  law school. For Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown, the Law Societies\u2019 decisions seriously  limited the religious freedom of members of the <abbr title=\"Trinity Western University\">TWU</abbr> community, and they were  not justified.  While both the B.C. and Ontario cases had separate histories, they dealt  with the same issue and were heard at the Supreme Court on the same days. In the  end, eight judges agreed that the Law Societies\u2019 decisions limited religious  freedoms (the five majority judges, Chief Justice McLachlin, and the two dissenting  judges). However, five (the majority) said the limitation was not serious,  while three (Chief Justice McLachlin and the two dissenting judges) said it was  serious. Six of the eight judges who said there was a limitation said it was reasonable  (the five majority judges and Chief Justice McLachlin). One judge (Justice  Rowe) said no religious freedoms were infringed."

        "summary": "<strong>The Canadian Human Rights  Tribunal did not have the power to decide if parts of the Indian Act were  discriminatory, because legislation is not a \u201cservice\u201d provided to the public,  the Supreme Court has confirmed. Individuals could still make a <em>Charter</em> claim  in court, however.</strong>\r\n     Indigenous persons can be  registered as status \u201cIndians\u201d under the <em>Indian  Act</em>, the law that determines who qualifies as \u201cIndian.\u201d (\u201cIndian\u201d is an  outdated term to refer to an Indigenous person that still exists in some Canadian  laws.) This gives them access to different programs and services from the  government. Status is not based on ethnicity, heritage, or racial background;  whether it is granted depends on if a person\u2019s parents have (or could get)  status. There are two types of status under the Act. The first, known as  \u201csection 6(1) status\u201d allows a person to pass status on to his or her children,  even if the other parent doesn\u2019t have status. The second, \u201csection 6(2)  status,\u201d does not allow status to be passed on unless the other parent has  status.  Some people who consider  themselves Indigenous may not qualify for status. One reason for this situation  was the existence of past discriminatory government policies that caused people  to lose it. People lost their status by becoming \u201cenfranchised,\u201d which meant losing  their rights under the <em>Indian Act</em>. One  policy encouraged people to give up status to get basic rights other Canadians  enjoyed (like full citizenship and the right to own land). Another policy  automatically \u201cenfranchised\u201d any status woman who married a non-status man. The  goal of these policies was to destroy Indigenous culture and assimilate  Indigenous peoples, so they had serious negative effects on Canada\u2019s Indigenous  community. Both policies were ended by 1985, and the government has passed laws  to give status back to people who lost it, as well as to their children and  grandchildren. This case involved two groups of  people who had status they could not pass on to their children or who were not  eligible for status at all. The situation was due to the discriminatory  policies. The groups said that the government had not done enough to undo the  damage done by the previous policies.  The first group was the Matson  siblings, whose grandmother lost her status when she married a non-status man.  While legislation later gave them section 6(2) status, they are not able to  pass status on to children they have with a non-status person. Had their  grandmother never lost her status, they would have had section 6(1) status and  could pass status on to their children no matter what. The second group was the Andrews  family. Mr. Andrews\u2019 father was voluntarily enfranchised before Mr. Andrews was  born. Later legislation was meant to fix the problem, but didn\u2019t quite. It left  Mr. Andrews with section 6(2) status, and his daughter without any status at  all. Had Mr. Andrews\u2019 father never lost status, Mr. Andrews would have been  eligible for section 6(1) status and his daughter for section 6(2) status. The Canadian Human Rights Commission  brought challenges to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on the Matsons\u2019 and  the Andrewses\u2019 behalf. The Commission argued the law on who qualifies for status  was discriminatory. The Tribunal said it did not have the power to  decide that. The Commission  asked the courts to review the Tribunal\u2019s decisions. Both the Federal Court and  Federal Court of Appeal upheld the decisions.  Justice Cl\u00e9ment Gascon, writing  for the Supreme Court majority, said the Tribunal\u2019s decisions to dismiss the  challenges were reasonable. Courts normally give wide latitude to a  decision-maker\u2019s understanding of its own powers under the law that governs it  (its \u201chome statute\u201d), unless a decision falls outside the range of reasonable  outcomes. The <em>Canadian Human Rights Act</em> was the Tribunal\u2019s home statute. The statute said the Tribunal only had the  power to decide if a \u201cservice\u201d was being delivered in an unequal way, not  whether the law itself was discriminatory. The Matsons and the Andrewses were arguing the <em>Indian Act</em> itself was discriminatory.  Justice Gascon said it was reasonable for the Tribunal to consider whether a  law could be considered a service, and dismiss the claims when it decided that  it was not. But he made it clear that the Matsons and the Andrewses could still  challenge the <em>Indian Act</em> under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  as the Tribunal had said. Justice Russell Brown agreed  that the Tribunal\u2019s decisions should stand. However, he took issue with part of  the majority\u2019s approach to reviewing administrative decisions in general. Justices  Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Malcolm Rowe also agreed that the Tribunal\u2019s decisions should  stand, but for different reasons. They said that courts should look at many  factors before deciding whether to give the Tribunal so much latitude. After  considering these factors, they said the Tribunal\u2019s answer to the question  about whether legislation was a \u201cservice\u201d didn\u2019t just have to fall within a <em>reasonable  range</em> of answers\u2014it had to be the <em>correct </em>one. That meant courts could overturn a decision  if, for example, the Tribunal had incorrectly said that a complaint challenged  a \u201cservice\u201d when it did not. In this case, they found that the Tribunal  was correct when it decided that the act of making laws was not a service, and  they would have upheld the decisions.  The Supreme Court did not rule  on whether parts of the <em>Indian Act</em> were  actually discriminatory, but only confirmed that the Canadian Human Rights  Tribunal did not have the power to decide that. While all the judges agreed on  this point, there was some disagreement about how courts should look at  decisions by administrative bodies.  "

        "summary": "<strong>Prison authorities must show that psychological and statistical tools  used to make decisions about Indigenous inmates are effective for them, the  Supreme Court has said.</strong>\r\n     Correctional Service of Canada (<abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr>) runs federal prisons. Its goal is to help  rehabilitate inmates, while protecting other inmates, staff, and society as a  whole. To do this, it uses certain psychological and statistical tools to make  decisions about inmates, like whether s/he is likely to reoffend or what kind  of supports s/he should get.  Under the <em>Corrections and  Conditional Release Act</em>, <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> has to \u201ctake all reasonable steps to ensure  that any information about an offender that it uses is as accurate, up to date  and complete as possible.\u201d The Act also says <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> must make sure that its policies and programs are suitable  for Indigenous offenders and take their specific needs and circumstances into  account.  Mr. Ewert is a federal inmate and identifies as M\u00e9tis. He was serving  two simultaneous life sentences for murder and attempted murder. Because certain  tools used to make decisions about him were created based mostly on  non-Indigenous people, Mr. Ewert argued they were less accurate for Indigenous  persons like himself. He said that <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> was not  following the law by using these tools on Indigenous offenders without proof  that they worked.  The Federal Court agreed with Mr. Ewert, but this was overturned by the  Federal Court of Appeal. Mr. Ewert appealed to the Supreme Court. Writing for the majority, Justice Richard Wagner (who was not yet Chief  Justice when the case was heard) granted Mr. Ewert a declaration that <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> was  not obeying the law. He said <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> hadn\u2019t taken  reasonable steps to make sure its tools gave accurate and complete results for  Indigenous offenders. Justice Wagner was concerned about the growing gap between  how Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders are treated in the criminal justice  system. For example, Indigenous offenders are more likely to be classified at a  higher security level and less likely to get early release. He said the gap is  due in part to policies that may look neutral on the surface but actually  discriminate against Indigenous offenders. That\u2019s why it was important to  ensure the tools worked. <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> knew there were concerns about the tools, but it  continued using them anyway. Based on all of this, Justice Wagner formally  declared that <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> violated the law. Six judges agreed with Justice Wagner. Justice Malcolm Rowe,  writing in dissent, disagreed. In his view, \u201cinformation\u201d clearly meant only  biographical or factual data about an inmate (for example, whether s/he had  been in a fight in prison). It did not mean the results of psychological and  statistical tools. He said that <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> only needed to keep complete and accurate  records of the results of the assessment tools. He agreed with the majority  that it was important to address the high number of Indigenous inmates in  prisons compared to their share of the population. But this had to be done in a  way that respected the logic of the law. Justice Rowe said Mr. Ewert instead should  have asked the courts to review the specific decisions <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> made about him using  the results of the tools. This case dealt with  the interpretation of section 24(1) of the <em>Corrections and Conditional Release Act</em>, in the context of section 4(g) of the same Act. It was the first time  the Court interpreted section 4(g). While the majority formally declared that  <abbr title=\"Correctional Service of Canada\">CSC</abbr> had violated the Act, Mr. Ewert would still have to apply for judicial  review to challenge any decision. Mr. Ewert also argued his <em>Charter</em> rights were violated, but those  arguments were rejected.  "

        "summary": "<strong>Rioters who  damaged police cars after a Montreal hockey game only have to pay for the  specific damage they caused personally, the Supreme Court has ruled. They  cannot be held responsible for damage others caused independently to the same  vehicle.</strong>\r\n     On April 21, 2008, the Montreal Canadiens beat the Boston Bruins in a  playoff hockey game. Street celebrations turned into riots in downtown Montreal.  Nine police cars were destroyed and six more were damaged. Police were able to  identify and arrest about twenty people who did different wrongful acts, from  kicking doors for some to setting cars on fire for others. The City of Montreal  sued the rioters, asking the court to make each one pay for up to the full cost  of the damage to the car he participated in destroying. If one or more of the  other rioters who damaged the same car could not pay, or could not be  identified, others who damaged the same car would have to make up the  difference. The Civil Code of Quebec applies to non-criminal legal issues in the  province. This case dealt with the interpretation of two articles of the Code,  articles 1480 and 1526. Normally, a person who does something wrong will only  have to pay for the exact harm that s/he causes to someone else. But the Code  gives two exceptions, and allows two or more people to each be held responsible  for all the damage in certain situations that don\u2019t involve contracts. Article  1526 says this can happen where two or more people take part in the same  wrongful act or, by separate wrongful acts, contribute to the same damage.  Article 1480 says this can happen if two or more people took part, together, in  the same wrongful act, or separate wrongful acts, and it\u2019s impossible to tell  who actually caused what damage. In either case, a single injury must have been  caused by the people involved for them to each be held liable for up to the  full cost of the damage. The trial judge ordered some rioters who acted together to each pay for  all the damage they caused to a car. For the other rioters, he said that the  two exceptions did not apply. The judge ordered each of these rioters to pay  only for the precise damage they each caused, plus punitive damages. The City  appealed the judgments where the rioters had not all been found responsible for  all the damage. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge. Justice Cl\u00e9ment Gascon, writing for the Supreme Court majority, agreed  with the courts below. He said the rioters in this appeal could not each be  held responsible for the total damage caused to a car during the riot. Their  situation did not meet the requirements for either one of the exceptions. The  general principle that a person who does something wrong will only have to pay  for the exact harm that s/he causes to someone else should apply. By their  different wrongful acts, these rioters caused distinct damage. It was possible  to identify the damage each of them caused, since it was caught on camera.  Also, most of these rioters didn\u2019t even know or talk to each other. They acted  on their own, often at different times. They could therefore not have chosen to  act together by either open or unspoken agreement. Five judges agreed with  Justice Gascon. Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 had a different opinion. She said the Code did not  require pre-planning or clear agreement for one of the exceptions to apply.  Here, the actions of each person who participated in the destruction of a  particular car were connected because they damaged the same car, in a short  period of time, and egged each other on until that car was seriously damaged or  completely destroyed. These persons acted together to destroy the same car and  should be responsible to pay up to the full amount of the damage caused to that  car. In Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s view, both exceptions in the Code apply, even if it were  possible to identify the specific damage one person caused. The seriousness of  each rioter\u2019s wrongful act would help divide responsibility between the members  of the group associated with each car. But each of them remained responsible to  pay up to the full amount to the City. This decision confirmed that damaging property during a riot doesn\u2019t make someone automatically responsible for damage  caused to the same property by other rioters."

On a robust and\ncareful assessment of the relevant factors tainted by these errors, Israel is a\nclearly more appropriate forum.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Central\nto a proper understanding of the conflicts rules of Canadian private\ninternational law is an appreciation of the distinct roles played by\njurisdiction simpliciter and forum non conveniens, and how these\nmust be understood and analysed as a cohesive whole. The jurisdiction simpliciter\nanalysis is meant to ensure that a court has jurisdiction. This will\nbe the case where a real and substantial connection exists between a chosen\nforum and the subject matter of the litigation. This test prioritizes order,\nstability and predictability by relying on objective connecting factors for the\nassumption of jurisdiction. The forum non conveniens analysis, on the\nother hand, is meant to guide courts in determining whether they should decline\nto exercise that jurisdiction in favour of a clearly more appropriate forum.\nThis doctrine emphasizes fairness and efficiency by adopting a case-by-case\napproach to this question. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At\nthe jurisdiction simpliciter stage, in determining whether a real and\nsubstantial connection exists between a chosen forum and the subject matter of\nthe litigation, a court must first consider whether the existence of a\nrecognized presumptive connecting factor has been established. The situs\nof the tort, which is one such recognized factor, is a reliable basis on which\nto presume a real and substantial connection, even in Internet defamation\ncases. Raising doubt as to the value of the situs of the tort as a\npresumptive connecting factor in such cases, because of the ease with which\npublication can be established, would significantly undermine the objectives of\npredictability and order at the jurisdiction simpliciter stage. Concerns\nrelating to the insufficiency of a presumptive connecting factor should be\naddressed either at the rebuttal stage of the jurisdiction simpliciter\nanalysis or during the forum non conveniens analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthis case, the tort of defamation was committed in Ontario, and therefore a\npresumptive connecting factor has been established. As a result, the Court must\nconsider whether H has successfully rebutted the presumption. The ability to\nrebut the presumption of jurisdiction where there is only a weak relationship\nbetween the subject matter of the litigation and the forum serves as an\nimportant check on jurisdiction. A careful examination of this question is\ntherefore of particular importance in Internet defamation cases, where a\npresumptive connecting factor can easily be established. Presumptive connecting\nfactors must not give rise to an irrebuttable presumption of jurisdiction. In\norder for a defendant to succeed in challenging jurisdiction, the circumstances\nmust demonstrate that the relationship between the forum and the subject matter\nof the litigation is such that it would not be reasonable to expect that the\ndefendant would be called to answer proceedings in that jurisdiction. Assuming\nthat these principles are properly applied, the situs of the tort will\nnot give rise to an irrebuttable presumption of jurisdiction in Internet\ndefamation cases. In the case at bar, H could have reasonably expected to be\ncalled to answer a legal proceeding in Ontario. As such, the presumption of\njurisdiction is not rebutted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At\nthe forum non conveniens stage, the burden is on the defendant to\nsatisfy the motion judge that the alternative forum is clearly more appropriate.\nWhile the normal state of affairs favours exercising jurisdiction in the forum\nwhere it is properly assumed, this should never come at the cost of one party\nfacing unfair or clearly inefficient proceedings. Given the ease with which jurisdiction\nmay be established in a defamation case, in a motion for a stay, a judge must\nconduct a robust and carefully scrutinized review of the issue of forum non\nconveniens. The establishment of a presumptive connecting factor is virtually\nautomatic in Internet defamation cases. As the rebuttal stage of the\njurisdiction simpliciter analysis fails to address all the consequences\nof this fact, it is appropriate for motion judges to be particularly attuned to\nconcerns about fairness and efficiency during the forum non conveniens analysis\nin these types of cases. This should not be understood as imposing a different\nstandard or burden for defamation cases.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As\nthe forum non conveniens analysis is inherently factual in nature,\ncourts of appeal should not normally interfere with a motion judge\u2019s factual\nfindings. However, there are limits to deference. Where the motion judge has\nerred in principle, misapprehended or failed to take account of material\nevidence, or reached an unreasonable decision, courts of appeal may intervene.\nIn the case at bar, the motion judge committed several errors, which tainted his\nforum non conveniens analysis on each of the factors they affected as\nwell as his overall weighing of these factors. As a result, no deference should\nbe afforded to these aspects of the motion judge\u2019s analysis and the Court may\nintervene.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Ultimately,\nH has established that holding a trial in Israel would be fairer and more\nefficient. Israel is clearly the more appropriate forum. A robust and careful forum\nnon conveniens analysis of the relevant factors indicates that H would face\nsubstantial unfairness and inefficiency if a trial were held in Ontario.\nComparative convenience and expense for the parties and comparative convenience\nand expense for the witnesses favour Israel. Loss of legitimate juridical\nadvantage favours a trial in Ontario, but this factor should not weigh too\nheavily in the analysis. Fairness favours Israel, namely in view of G\u2019s\nsignificant business interest and reputation in that country and the\nsignificant unfairness that a trial in Ontario would impose on H. Enforcement\nslightly favours Israel as H has no presence or assets in Ontario. Finally,\nwhile applicable law, as determined by the lex loci delicti principle \u2014 the\nplace where the tort occurs \u2014, favours Ontario in this case, this factor should\nbe accorded little weight in the forum non conveniens analysis in cases\nwhere jurisdiction is established on the basis of the situs of the tort.\nIn those circumstances, lex loci delicti will inevitably also point to\nthe chosen forum on the question of applicable law. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This\nwould not be an appropriate case to adopt the place of most substantial harm to\nreputation test for choice of law instead of lex loci delicti. Although\nin Internet defamation actions, where a tort may have occurred in multiple\njurisdictions, the lex loci delicti rule may allow courts in multiple\nforums to assume jurisdiction and apply their own law, the Court should be\nreluctant to make such changes to the existing private international law\nframework, as this may create legal uncertainty in a manner contrary to the\nobjectives of conflicts rules. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis\u00a0J.:\nThere is agreement with C\u00f4t\u00e9 J.\u2019s conclusion and much of her reasoning.\nHowever, there is disagreement with two aspects of her analysis relating to forum\nnon conveniens. When considering the applicable law factor, assessing what\nlaw would apply in the alternative jurisdiction is not helpful, as the ultimate\nquestion that motivates this factor is whether the plaintiff\u2019s chosen\njurisdiction would be applying foreign law. Further, G\u2019s Israeli reputation is\nnot material to the fairness factor, which is concerned with the plaintiff\u2019s\ninterest in vindicating his reputation in the jurisdiction where he enjoys it.\nUltimately, the overall conclusion reached by C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. on forum non\nconveniens does not turn on any of these elements, and therefore, the\nappeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella\u00a0J.:\nThere is agreement with C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. that the appeal should be allowed. However,\nthere is disagreement with her that the lex loci delicti rule should\ncontinue to serve as the basis for choice of law under the forum non\nconveniens analysis in cases of multijurisdictional Internet defamation.\nThis standard approach to choice of law does not adequately respond to the\nunique issues and challenges raised by Internet defamation, where a single\ndownload can determine which law applies under a strict application of the lex\nloci delicti rule. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per McLachlin\u00a0C.J.\nand Moldaver and Gascon\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\nWhen a Canadian citizen is allegedly defamed for his Canadian business\npractices \u2014 in an article published online in his home province by a foreign\nnewspaper \u2014 he is entitled to vindicate his reputation in the courts of the\nprovince where he lives and maintains his business, and where the sting of the\narticle\u2019s comments is felt. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ncurrent rules that govern the application of the test for jurisdiction simpliciter\nreadily accommodate multijurisdictional defamation cases, even in the Internet\nage. The commission of a tort in the jurisdiction remains a sound presumptive\nconnecting factor on which to establish prima facie jurisdiction even in\nthe context of Internet defamation cases, because the sting of the defamation\nis felt in the place where it is read. In this case, it is not contested that\nthe allegedly libellous article was consulted by 200 to 300 people in Canada;\ntherefore, a tort of defamation was committed in Ontario. There is no valid\nreason to reconsider or set aside this clearly established presumptive\nconnecting factor.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While\na presumptive connecting factor may be established virtually automatically in\nInternet defamation cases, a court does not necessarily assume jurisdiction. If\nthere is no real and substantial connection between the action and the forum,\nthe presumptive connecting factor would be rebutted. Reasonable foreseeability\nis central to the rebuttal step of the analysis: the strength of the\nrelationship between the subject of the litigation and the forum is informed by\nthe reasonable foreseeability of the claim proceeding in that jurisdiction.\nWithout this important check of reasonable foreseeability of being sued in the\njurisdiction, the presumptive connecting factor of the commission of a tort in\nthe jurisdiction could raise concerns of forum shopping. Reasonable\nforeseeability is therefore an important limit on the ease with which\njurisdiction can be presumptively assumed in defamation cases, especially over\nthe Internet. In the present case, it was more than reasonably foreseeable that\nH would be sued in Ontario. The article was highly critical of G\u2019s management\nstyle, allegedly imported from his Canadian business. Furthermore, H made the\narticle readily available to readers worldwide through online publication. It\nis entirely foreseeable that a Canadian citizen and resident would want to\nvindicate his Canadian reputation as the owner of his Canadian businesses in a\nCanadian court. Therefore, the presumption of jurisdiction was not rebutted and\nOntario courts have jurisdiction. The facts undeniably reveal a real and\nsubstantial connection between this case and Ontario.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 If\nthe analysis at the rebuttal stage is done properly, with an adequate\nconsideration of reasonable foreseeability, there is no need to apply a robust\nand carefully scrutinized forum non conveniens analysis, as suggested by\nC\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. This new standard would frustrate the predictability and stability\nthat is at the core of the applicable framework. The basis of the forum non\nconveniens analysis is the clearly more appropriate forum test, which sets\na high threshold for displacing the forum chosen by the plaintiff. This\npurposefully stringent and consistently upheld threshold should not be lowered,\nwhether through lenient application or through a robust and carefully\nscrutinized review. Furthermore, a motion judge\u2019s discretionary decision\nwhether or not to decline jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens\nis entitled to considerable deference, and having appellate courts apply the\nproposed robust and carefully scrutinized approach would disregard the\ndiscretionary nature of forum non conveniens decisions. A motion judge\u2019s\nexercise of his discretionary power or assessment of the evidence should not be\ninterfered with where it is not tainted by any error, or when only tainted by\nerrors that have no impact on the result. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthis case, an assessment of the factors in the forum non conveniens\nanalysis indicates that they do not meet the test of showing that Israel is a\nclearly more appropriate forum than Ontario. Only the factor of\ncomparative convenience and expense for the parties and witnesses favours\nIsrael, and this only slightly so with respect to the witnesses. The\nenforcement of judgment factor does not weigh heavily in the analysis. The\nfactor of loss of legitimate juridical advantage weighs in favour of Ontario,\nand, most importantly, the key factors of applicable law and fairness to the\nparties weigh heavily in favour of Ontario. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to the applicable law factor, the most substantial harm test to\ndetermine the applicable law in multijurisdictional Internet defamation cases\nshould not be adopted in place of lex loci delicti. Such a rule is\nhighly subjective, and will not reliably point to one jurisdiction. It does not provide a clear answer where a person lives and maintains\nan important reputation in one jurisdiction, but acts \u2014 and is the subject of\ndefamatory statements \u2014 in another jurisdiction. It would also lead to complex preliminary motions requiring substantial evidence\nwhich would increase delay and expense. In terms of the proper approach to\nbalancing this factor in the forum non conveniens analysis, it is\nentirely appropriate for courts to only look at the chosen forum in determining\nthe applicable law. Requiring courts to assess the choice of law rules of a\nforeign jurisdiction may require extensive evidence, needlessly complicating\nthe pre-trial motion stage of the proceedings. Where jurisdiction is based on\nthe situs of the tort, the applicable law under lex loci delicti\nwill indeed point to the forum. This does not mean that the applicable law\nfactor should be granted little weight in the forum non conveniens\nanalysis; rather, giving due weight to this factor reflects the notion that a case\nshould proceed in a forum that properly has jurisdiction over the matter unless\nanother forum is clearly more appropriate. Holding that the applicable law\nshould be given little weight ignores the importance of the territorial\njurisdiction of the chosen forum, and distorts the forum non conveniens\nanalysis in favour of the foreign jurisdiction. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nlex loci delicti rule directs courts to apply their domestic law after\nhaving found that the tort of defamation occurred within their jurisdiction.\nDefamation law is directed to the protection of reputation. For choice of law\npurposes, it is therefore logical that a court of a jurisdiction where\npublication occurred is entitled to apply its own law. This remains true even\nif a tort took place simultaneously in another jurisdiction. In this case, as\nthe applicable law is that of Ontario, this factor strongly favours Ontario\nover Israel.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to fairness, this factor, along with the efficient resolution of\ndisputes, is the cornerstone of forum non conveniens. The Court has\nrepeatedly emphasized the importance of plaintiffs being allowed to sue for\ndefamation in the locality where they enjoy their reputation. In the instant\ncase, G has a real and long-standing reputational interest in Ontario. His\nreputation in Israel is not material to the analysis. It is therefore not\nunfair that Ontario be the forum deciding the dispute.By\nC\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied:\nClub Resorts Ltd. v.

It would be fairer and more efficient for Israel to hear the defamation suit  brought against an Israeli newspaper by a Canadian businessperson who owns an  Israeli soccer team. </strong>\r\n     Mitchell Goldhar is a Canadian  businessman who owns a popular Israeli soccer team. He had an apartment in  Israel and visited every few months. In 2011, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz  published an article criticizing his management of the team. The article also mentioned  his Canadian business and management style generally. The article was published  online and available for download in Canada and in Israel. Mr. Goldhar felt the  article was untrue and unfair, and so sued Haaretz for libel (written  defamation, or publishing false information that hurt his reputation). About  200-300 people in Canada and 70,000 people in Israel read the article. This case involved online defamation  in two different countries. When a legal dispute crosses borders, it may not be  clear which courts should hear the case and which laws should apply. Courts decide  these issues by applying \u201cconflict of law\u201d rules. Just because someone sues in a  court in one place, it doesn\u2019t mean that that court is allowed to hear the case  (or meets the first legal test, known as \u201cjurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em>\u201d). A court may also decide that, even though it is  allowed to hear the case, it is clearly more appropriate for it to be heard  somewhere else because it would be fairer and more efficient (in legal terms, the  \u201c<em>forum non conveniens</em>\u201d test). Part of deciding  the appropriate place for a case to be heard is deciding which laws should  apply (\u201cchoice of law\u201d). <strong> </strong>\r\n     In part, conflict of laws rules are meant  to prevent people from picking and choosing the place where the laws most  benefit them (or most disadvantage their opponents). In this case, Mr. Goldhar sued in  Ontario, but Haaretz said the lawsuit should be heard in Israel. It filed a  motion saying Ontario courts did not have jurisdiction, but even if they did, it  was more appropriate for Israeli courts to hear the case. An Ontario judge ruled  in Mr. Goldhar\u2019s favour on the issue, and the Court of Appeal agreed. Haaretz  appealed to the Supreme Court. Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 said that it  was clearly more appropriate for the case to be heard in Israel. Even though  there have been many changes in technology over the years, she said the current  conflict of law rules are still flexible enough to deal with the challenges brought  on by the increase in online publication. Courts have to keep basic principles  of stability and fairness in mind when applying the rules. She said that under  the rules Ontario courts had jurisdiction because the article was read in the  province. (In law, defamation occurs when the untrue statement is \u201cpublished,\u201d that  is, when it is read or downloaded by even one person.) However, she said that it was clearly more  appropriate for Israeli courts to hear the case. In her view, a trial in Israel  would clearly be more convenient, efficient, and fair. Mr. Goldhar was well known  in Israel and his claim was not limited to his Canadian reputation. Also, since  Haaretz and most of its witnesses were based in Israel, a trial in Ontario would  be unfair and inefficient for them. Two judges agreed with Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9. Justice Andromache Karakatsanis, in  separate reasons, agreed with Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 that Ontario courts should not hear  Mr. Goldhar\u2019s case. She disagreed with Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 on some specific points,  but this did not affect her overall conclusion. Justice  Rosalie Silberman Abella also agreed that  it was more appropriate for Mr. Goldhar\u2019s lawsuit to be heard in Israel. But she  noted that the unique challenges posed by Internet defamation, where all it  takes for defamation to occur is one download, meant it was time to change the  approach. She proposed a new approach to both jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em> and the choice of law under <em>forum non conveniens</em>. This would see courts focus on the place where the person  suing suffered the greatest harm to his or her reputation. It would better  respond to the reality of the Internet, emphasize the importance of reputation,  and strike a better balance between freedom of expression and harm to  reputation concerns.  Justice  Richard Wagner (who was not yet Chief Justice when the appeal was heard) also  agreed that Israeli courts should hear the case. However, he said the <em>forum non conveniens </em>analysis should be  tweaked. Like Justice Abella, he said the choice of law in online defamation  cases should be based on where the most harm to reputation occurred, not where  the publication happened. (He did not think the rules about jurisdiction <em>simpliciter </em>needed to change, however.) Using  this new approach, he determined that Israel was clearly a more appropriate place  for the case to be heard than Ontario. Then-Chief  Justice Beverley McLachlin and Justices Michael Moldaver and Cl\u00e9ment Gascon,  writing in dissent, said that Ontario courts should hear the case. They agreed  with Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 that the current rules did not need to be changed to deal  with online defamation. However, they thought that Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 was not  applying the rules of <em>forum non conveniens </em>properly in this case. These  rules required that Haaretz meet a high threshold to show that the case should  be heard in Israel. When the dissenting judges applied the rules to the facts,  they found that Israel was not a clearly more appropriate place to hear the  case than Ontario. They noted Mr. Goldhar was most concerned about his Canadian  reputation. They said Ontario law should apply, and Ontario courts should be  the ones to apply it. This case was about how  courts should deal with defamation claims in the Internet era, where material  is \u201cpublished\u201d in more than one place. Most judges said that the existing rules  were working and would not change them, but came to different conclusions when  they applied the rules. In the end, a majority of judges agreed it would be  clearly more appropriate for Mr. Goldhar\u2019s lawsuit to be heard in Israel. The  Supreme Court did not decide on whether the Haaretz article was actually  defamatory; it only decided that Israeli courts were in the best position to decide  that.\r\n     \r\n  "

F\u2019s trial was characterized by a pattern of escalating acrimony and by a\nseries of disputes between G and the OSC prosecutors, which included personal\nattacks, sarcastic outbursts and allegations of professional impropriety made\nby G. In particular, the OSC prosecutors and G disagreed over the scope of the\nOSC\u2019s disclosure obligations and the format of such disclosure, as well as over\nthe admissibility of documents. Much of the disagreement stemmed from G\u2019s honest\nbut mistaken understanding of the law of evidence and the role of the\nprosecutor. During the trial, despite the frequency and fervor of the dispute,\nthe trial judge initially adopted a hands\u2011off approach, but he finally directed\nG to stop repeating his misconduct allegations. G largely followed the trial\njudge\u2019s directions. Evidentiary disputes were eventually resolved and the trial\nwas completed, with F being acquitted on all charges.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 After\nF\u2019s trial, the Law Society brought disciplinary proceedings against G on its\nown motion, alleging professional misconduct based on his uncivil behaviour\nduring the trial. A three\u2011member panel of the Law Society Hearing Panel\nfound G guilty of professional misconduct, suspended his licence to practice\nlaw for two months and ordered him to pay nearly $247,000 in costs. On appeal\nby G, the Law Society Appeal Panel also concluded that G was guilty of\nprofessional misconduct, but it reduced G\u2019s suspension to one month and\ndecreased the costs award against him to\u00a0$200,000. In its decision, the\nAppeal Panel developed a multi\u2011factorial, context\u2011specific approach\nfor assessing whether in\u2011court incivility amounts to professional\nmisconduct. The Divisional Court upheld the Appeal Panel\u2019s decision as\nreasonable. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed G\u2019s further appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held\n(Karakatsanis, Gascon and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nMcLachlin\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Wagner and Brown\u00a0JJ.: The Appeal\nPanel\u2019s decision should be reviewed for reasonableness.\u00a0This Court\u2019s\ndecisions establish that a reasonableness standard applies to law society\nmisconduct findings and sanctions. Moreover, post\u2011Dunsmuir jurisprudence\nhas firmly entrenched the notion that decisions of specialized administrative\nbodies interpreting their own statute or statutes closely connected to their\nfunction are entitled to deference from courts, and are thus presumptively\nreviewed for reasonableness. That presumption applies here: the Appeal Panel\u2019s\napproach to determining when incivility amounts to professional misconduct and\nits application of that approach in assessing a lawyer\u2019s conduct involve an\ninterpretation of the Rules of Professional Conduct enacted under its\nhome statute and the discretionary application of general principles to the\nfacts before it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\npresumption of deference is not rebutted. Determining when in\u2011court\nbehaviour amounts to professional misconduct does not fall under the category\nof questions of central importance to the legal system as a whole and outside\nthe decision\u2011maker\u2019s expertise, for which correctness review would be appropriate.\nAlthough the permissible scope of lawyers\u2019 behaviour is arguably of central\nimportance to the legal system as a whole, it cannot be said that assessing\nwhether incivility amounts to professional misconduct is outside the Law\nSociety\u2019s expertise. To the contrary, law society disciplinary tribunals have\nsignificant expertise regulating the legal profession, and Law Society\ndisciplinary panels are composed, in part, of other lawyers, who are aware of\nthe problems and frustrations that confront a practitioner. Furthermore, a\ndeferential standard of review does not threaten a trial judge\u2019s power to\ncontrol his or her courtroom. A trial judge is free to control the conduct in\nhis or her courtroom irrespective of the degree of deference accorded to a law\nsociety\u2019s disciplinary decision by a different court. The fact that the\nbehaviour occurs in a courtroom is an important contextual factor that must be\ntaken into account when evaluating whether that behaviour amounted to\nprofessional misconduct; but it does not impact on the standard of review. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nmulti\u2011factorial, context\u2011specific approach developed by the Appeal\nPanel for assessing whether a lawyer\u2019s in\u2011court behaviour crosses the\nline into professional misconduct on the basis of incivility is appropriate. First,\nthe Appeal Panel recognized the importance of civility to the legal profession\nand the corresponding need to target behaviour that detrimentally affects the\nadministration of justice and the fairness of a particular proceeding. At the\nsame time, it remained sensitive to the lawyer\u2019s duty of resolute advocacy \u2014 a\nduty of particular importance in the criminal context because of the client\u2019s\nconstitutional right to make full answer and defence. The Appeal Panel\nrecognized the need to develop an approach that would avoid a chilling effect on\nthe kind of fearless advocacy that is at times necessary to advance a client\u2019s\ncause. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second,\nthe Appeal Panel developed an approach that is both flexible and precise. A\nrigid definition of when incivility amounts to professional misconduct in the\ncourtroom is neither attainable nor desirable; rather, determining whether a\nlawyer\u2019s behaviour warrants a finding of professional misconduct must remain a\ncontext\u2011specific inquiry that is flexible enough to assess behaviour\narising from the diverse array of situations in which lawyers find themselves. Yet,\nstandards of civility must be articulated with a reasonable degree of\nprecision. The Appeal Panel\u2019s approach strikes a reasonable balance between\nflexibility and precision: it sets a reasonably precise benchmark that\ninstructs lawyers as to the permissible bounds of ethical courtroom behaviour,\nby articulating a series of contextual factors \u2014 what the lawyer said, the\nmanner and frequency in which it was said, and the presiding judge\u2019s reaction\nto the lawyer\u2019s behaviour \u2014 that ought generally to be considered when\nevaluating a lawyer\u2019s conduct, and by describing how those factors operate when\nassessing a lawyer\u2019s behaviour. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to what the lawyer said, while not a standalone \u201ctest\u201d, the Appeal\nPanel determined that prosecutorial misconduct allegations, or other challenges\nto opposing counsel\u2019s integrity, cross the line into professional misconduct\nunless they are made in good faith and have a reasonable basis. Requiring a\nreasonable basis for allegations protects against unsupportable attacks that tarnish\nopposing counsel\u2019s reputation without chilling resolute advocacy. However, the\nreasonable basis requirement is not an exacting standard. It is not\nprofessional misconduct on account of incivility to challenge opposing\ncounsel\u2019s integrity based on a sincerely held but incorrect legal position so\nlong as the challenge has a sufficient factual foundation, such that if the\nlegal position were correct, the challenge would be warranted. Nor is it\nprofessional misconduct to advance a novel legal argument that is ultimately\nrejected by the court. The good faith inquiry asks what the\nlawyer actually believed when making the allegations. In\ncontrast, the \u201creasonable basis\u201d inquiry requires a law society to look beyond\nwhat the lawyer believed, and examine the foundation underpinning the\nallegations. Looking at the reasonableness of a lawyer\u2019s legal position at this\nstage would, in effect, impose a mandatory minimum standard of legal competence\nin the incivility context \u2014 this would allow a law society to find a lawyer\nguilty of professional misconduct on the basis of incivility for something the\nlawyer, in the law society\u2019s opinion, ought to have known or ought to have\ndone. This would risk unjustifiably tarnishing a lawyer\u2019s reputation and\nchilling resolute advocacy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With respect to the frequency of what was said and the manner\nin which it was said, the Appeal Panel noted that, as a\ngeneral rule, repetitive personal attacks and those made using demeaning,\nsarcastic, or otherwise inappropriate language are more likely to warrant\ndisciplinary action. As for the presiding judge\u2019s reaction to the lawyer\u2019s\nbehaviour, when the impugned behaviour occurs in a courtroom, what, if\nanything, the judge does about it and how the lawyer modifies his or her\nbehaviour thereafter becomes relevant. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, the Appeal Panel\u2019s approach also allows law society disciplinary\ntribunals to proportionately balance the lawyer\u2019s expressive freedom with its\nstatutory mandate in any given case. The flexibility built into the Appeal\nPanel\u2019s context\u2011specific approach to assessing a lawyer\u2019s behaviour\nallows for a proportionate balancing in any given case. Considering the unique\ncircumstances in each case enables law society disciplinary tribunals to\naccurately gauge the value of the impugned speech. This, in turn, allows for a\ndecision, both with respect to a finding of professional misconduct and any\npenalty imposed, that reflects a proportionate balancing of the lawyer\u2019s\nexpressive rights and the Law Society\u2019s statutory mandate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although\nthe approach that it set out was appropriate, the Appeal Panel\u2019s finding of\nprofessional misconduct against G on the basis of incivility was unreasonable. First,\neven though the Appeal Panel accepted that G\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial\nmisconduct were made in good faith, it used his honest but erroneous legal\nbeliefs as to the disclosure and admissibility of documents to conclude that\nhis allegations lacked a reasonable basis. The Appeal Panel acknowledged that\nsubmissions made on the basis of a sincerely held but erroneous legal belief\ncannot ground a finding of professional misconduct, and accepted that in making\nhis allegations of impropriety against the OSC prosecutors, G was not\ndeliberately misrepresenting the law and was not ill\u2011motivated. Despite\nthis, the Appeal Panel used G\u2019s legal errors to conclude that he had no\nreasonable basis for his repeated allegations of prosecutorial impropriety. Such\na finding was not reasonably open to the Appeal Panel. Allegations of\nprosecutorial misconduct based on a sincerely held but mistaken legal belief\nwill be reasonably based as long as they have a sufficient factual foundation.\nThe question for incivility purposes is not whether G was right or wrong on the\nlaw; rather, the question is whether, based on his understanding of the\nlaw, his allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, which the Appeal Panel found\nwere made in good faith, had a factual foundation. In this case, they did. G\u2019s\nlegal errors, coupled with the OSC prosecutors\u2019 conduct, provided the\nreasonable basis for his allegations. Accordingly, based on the Appeal Panel\u2019s\nown approach, G\u2019s allegations were made in good faith and they were reasonably\nbased.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second,\nthe other contextual factors in this case could not reasonably support a\nfinding of professional misconduct against G on the basis of incivility. The\nevolving abuse of process law at the time accounts, at least in part, for the\nfrequency of G\u2019s allegations; the presiding judge took a passive approach in\nthe face of G\u2019s allegations; and G\u2019s behaviour changed in response to the\ndirections of the trial judge. The Appeal Panel failed to account for these\ncontextual factors in its analysis. The only conclusion that was reasonably\nopen to the Appeal Panel on the record before it was a finding that G was not\nguilty of professional misconduct. Because G, in the circumstances of this\ncase, could not reasonably be found guilty of professional misconduct, the\ncomplaints against him are dismissed and there is no need to remit the matter\nto the Law Society. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nC\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J.: There is agreement with the majority that the Appeal Panel\nerred in finding that G committed professional misconduct and that there is no\nneed to remit the matter back to the Law Society.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However,\nthere is disagreement as to the applicable standard of review. The Appeal\nPanel\u2019s finding of professional misconduct is reviewable on the correctness\nstandard on the basis that the impugned conduct occurred in a courtroom. Applying\nthe approach set out in Dunsmuir, this Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence\ndoes not dictate the standard of review in this appeal. The\ncontext of this case is different in one critical \u2014 and dispositive \u2014 respect:\nthe impugned conduct occurred before a judge in open court. The fact that the\nrelevant conduct occurred in a court of law implicates constitutional\nimperatives about the judiciary\u2019s independence and its capacity to control its\nown processes, and rebuts the presumption of\nreasonableness. Correctness review is required because the Law Society\u2019s\ninquiry into in\u2011court professional misconduct engages the contours of the\nconstitutional relationship between the courts and government regulators. Judicial\nindependence is, without question, a cornerstone of Canadian democracy. It is\nessential to both the impartiality of the judiciary and the maintenance of the\nrule of law. An inquiry by a law society into a lawyer\u2019s in\u2011court conduct\nrisks intruding on the judge\u2019s function of managing the trial process and his\nauthority to sanction improper behaviour. To protect judicial independence, and\nthe authority of judges to manage the proceedings before them in the manner\nthey see fit, the judiciary \u2014 not a regulatory body, a creature of the\npolitical branches of government \u2014 should have the final say over the\nappropriateness of a lawyer\u2019s conduct in that sphere. The reasonableness\nstandard of review, which requires judicial deference to a law society\u2019s\ndisciplinary determinations, is inconsistent with this prerogative. Therefore,\ncorrectness review is required to ensure proper respect for the judiciary\u2019s\nconstitutionally guaranteed place in our democracy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis, Gascon\nand Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): There is agreement with the\nmajority that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review. The simple\nfact that a lawyer\u2019s behavior occurs in the courtroom does not deprive the Law\nSociety of its legitimate role in regulating the profession nor does it justify\nheightened judicial scrutiny. There is also agreement with the majority that,\nin articulating a standard of professional misconduct, the Appeal Panel\nreasonably set out a contextual approach which will vary according to the\nparticular factual matrix in which it is applied.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However,\nthe majority\u2019s disposition in this appeal is disagreed with. The Appeal Panel\u2019s\ndecision was reasonable and there is no basis to interfere. Accordingly, the\nappeal should be dismissed. The majority fundamentally misstates the Appeal\nPanel\u2019s approach to professional misconduct and reweighs the evidence to reach\na different result. This is inconsistent with reasonableness review as it\nsubstitutes the Court\u2019s judgment for that of the legislature\u2019s chosen decision\nmaker. Where, as here, the standard of review analysis leads to the application\nof reasonableness, deference is not optional. Deference bars a reviewing court\nfrom conducting an exacting criticism of a decision in order to reach the\nresult that the decision was unreasonable. It follows that a reviewing court\nalso cannot supplement the decision maker\u2019s reasoning for the purpose of\nundermining it. Neither may a court reweigh evidence or contextual factors\nconsidered by the decision maker. At all times, the starting point of\nreasonableness review is the reasons for the decision under review. There is no\nbasis on this record to interfere with the Appeal Panel\u2019s decision. Its\nanalysis was cogent, logical, transparent and grounded in the evidence. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nreviewing court should give effect to the Appeal Panel\u2019s decision to adopt an\napproach with both subjective and objective considerations (i.e. to require\ngood faith and a reasonable basis for allegations of prosecutorial misconduct\nor that impugn the integrity of an opponent). It was open to the Appeal Panel\nto consider both the factual and legal bases for the allegations at issue, and to\nconclude that there was no reasonable basis in fact or in law for G\u2019s\nallegations. The Appeal Panel\u2019s mandate permits it to determine any question of\nfact or law that arises in a proceeding before it. As such, the Appeal Panel\nwas entitled to consider whether there is a reasonable basis for the\nallegations. Reasonableness, as opposed to good faith, implies consideration of\nwhether the allegations, objectively, had a legal or factual basis. The Appeal\nPanel\u2019s approach is justified by the serious consequences that irresponsible\nattacks can have on opposing counsel\u2019s reputation as well as the public\nperception of the justice system. Collapsing the subjective and objective\nelements of this approach restricts the Appeal Panel\u2019s ability to assess the\nreasonableness of legal submissions to determining whether the lawyer was\nacting in good faith. It was open to the Appeal Panel to hold that a lawyer who\nerroneously alleges prosecutorial misconduct or impugns the integrity of\nopposing counsel should not be shielded from professional sanction because of\nhis or her own incompetence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\ndetermining whether G\u2019s allegations crossed the line into professional\nmisconduct, the Appeal Panel applied its expertise and decided how to assess\nthe evidence as a whole. It was open to the Appeal Panel to weigh the evidence\nin the way it did. Its findings were amply supported by the record, as were its\nconclusions on the cumulative effects of G\u2019s conduct. Ultimately, the reasons\nsupported the Appeal Panel\u2019s conclusion that G was engaged in professional\nmisconduct. Both the evidentiary foundation and the logic of the reasons were\nsound.

The Appeal Panel was alert to the importance of lawyers\u2019\nexpressive freedoms and the critical role of zealous advocacy in our system. In\norder to ensure that these principles were limited no more than necessary, the\nAppeal Panel adopted a contextual approach that took into account the dynamics\nof the courtroom setting. It was reasonable for the Appeal Panel to conclude\nthat in the context of this trial, zealous advocacy did not require G to make\nunfounded allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, to impugn the integrity of\nhis opponents or to frequently resort to invective when describing them. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nare a number of concerns about the implications that follow from the majority\u2019s\ndecision: they immunize erroneous allegations from sanction by the Law Society,\nvalidate improper conduct and threaten to undermine the administration of\njustice and the culture change that the Court has called for in recent years. Moreover,\nsetting aside the decision of the Appeal Panel has the potential to undermine\nthe ability of law societies to promote the efficient resolution of disputes. Law\nsocieties are important actors in the culture change that is needed.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0lawyer\u2019s uncivil behaviour in court may not amount to professional  misconduct if it was based on a mistaken understanding of the law, the Supreme  Court has ruled. All the circumstances must be taken into account.</strong> Joseph Groia was the lawyer for John  Felderhof, a Bre-X mining executive charged with insider trading and other  crimes. The trial was tense, marked by personal attacks and sarcastic remarks. During  the first half of the trial, Mr. Groia believed prosecutors were acting wrongly.  He accused them\u2014repeatedly and in harsh language\u2014of abuse of process. Mr. Groia  was actually wrong about the law, but the judge did not correct him. Lawyers have to follow many ethical  rules. In Ontario, these are enforced by the Law Society of Ontario (formerly  known as the Law Society of Upper Canada). The duty to practice law with \u201ccivility\u201d  is only one of them. Civility is not just about being polite; when lawyers  attack each other personally, it weakens the justice system. Personal attacks  distract from the parties\u2019 dispute and makes it harder for lawyers to work  together to find solutions. The Law Society can charge lawyers who act uncivilly  with professional misconduct. The Law Society began an  investigation into Mr. Groia in 2004 for his behaviour toward the prosecution,  even though no one complained. He was charged with professional misconduct in  2009 and found guilty by a Law Society Hearing Panel in 2012. The Law Society  Appeal Panel confirmed this in 2013. Mr. Groia\u2019s licence to practice law was  suspended for a month and he was ordered to pay $200,000 in costs. He disagreed  with the decision and asked the courts to review it. Both the Divisional Court  and the Court of Appeal upheld the Law Society Appeal Panel\u2019s decision. Justice Michael Moldaver, writing  for the majority at the Supreme Court, ruled for Mr. Groia. In his view, the  Law Society\u2019s decision was unreasonable. He said that Mr. Groia had a  reasonable basis to accuse the prosecution of misconduct, even though the  allegations stemmed from his mistaken understanding of the law. The  prosecutors\u2019 conduct, the fact that the judge did not correct him, and the legal  uncertainty about how to raise the issue of abuse of process all led him to act  as he did. Justice Moldaver worried that the Law Society\u2019s decision would make  lawyers think twice about forcefully defending their clients, for fear they could  be charged with misconduct. He also said the Law Society should pay careful  attention to the legal rulings made by a trial judge who, unlike the Law  Society, saw Mr. Groia\u2019s behaviour in person. Four judges agreed with Justice  Moldaver. Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 agreed with Justice Moldaver that the Law Society  was wrong to punish Mr. Groia. But unlike the majority, she thought that courts  should not simply accept a law society\u2019s disciplinary decision about a lawyer\u2019s  conduct in the courtroom. This was because letting a law society review in-court  behaviour raises concerns about the role and independence of judges. Justices Karakatsanis, Gascon, and  Rowe disagreed with Justice Moldaver on how to review the Law Society\u2019s  decision and on the outcome. They said it was open to the Law Society to find  Mr. Groia guilty of misconduct. In their view, he had disrupted the trial and  unfairly accused the other side\u2019s lawyers of dishonesty. They said the Law  Society reasonably decided that Mr. Groia\u2019s own mistaken view of the law was no  excuse for his bad behaviour. Lawyers have both a professional  obligation to advocate strongly for their clients and a duty to act civilly  during a trial. This case was about deciding when strong courtroom advocacy  becomes incivility, and when incivility becomes professional misconduct. The  Supreme Court said that decision-makers should look at the full situation when  deciding if a line was crossed."

A member must live according to accepted standards of conduct and\nmorality. A member who deviates and does not repent may be asked to appear\nbefore a Judicial Committee of elders and may be disfellowshipped. In 2014, W was\ndisfellowshipped after he engaged in sinful behaviour and was considered to be\ninsufficiently repentant. The decision was confirmed by an Appeal Committee. W\nfiled an originating application for judicial review pursuant to Rule 3.15 of\nthe Alberta Rules of Court seeking an order of certiorari quashing\nthe Judicial Committee\u2019s decision on the basis that it was procedurally unfair.\nThe Court of Queen\u2019s Bench dealt with the issue of jurisdiction in a separate\nhearing. Both the chambers judge and a majority of the Court of Appeal\nconcluded that the courts had jurisdiction to consider the merits of the\napplication. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal\nshould be allowed and the originating application for judicial review should be\nquashed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Review\nof the decisions of voluntary associations, including religious groups, on the\nbasis of procedural fairness is limited for three reasons. First, judicial\nreview is limited to public decision makers, which the Judicial Committee is\nnot. Not all decisions are amenable to a superior court\u2019s supervisory\njurisdiction. Judicial review is only available where there is an exercise of\nstate authority and where that exercise is of a sufficiently public character. Judicial\nreview is a public law concept that allows courts to ensure that lower\ntribunals respect the rule of law. Private parties cannot seek judicial review\nto solve disputes between them and public law remedies such as certiorari\nmay not be granted in litigation relating to contractual or property rights\nbetween private parties. Simply because a decision impacts a broad segment of\nthe public does not mean that it is public in the administrative law sense of\nthe term nor would incorporation by a private Act operate as a statutory grant\nof authority to churches so constituted. The present case raises no issues\nabout the rule of law. The Congregation in no way is exercising state\nauthority. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second,\nthere is no free-standing right to procedural fairness absent an underlying\nlegal right. Courts may only interfere to address procedural fairness concerns\nrelated to the decisions of religious groups or other voluntary associations if\nlegal rights are at stake and the claim is founded on a valid cause of action,\nfor example, contract, tort or restitution. Jurisdiction cannot be established\non the sole basis that there is an alleged breach of natural justice or that\nthe complainant has exhausted the organization\u2019s internal processes. It is not\nenough that a matter be of importance in some abstract sense. W has no\ncause of action. No basis has been shown that W and the Congregation intended\nto create legal relations. No contractual right exists. The\nCongregation does not have a written constitution, by-laws or rules to be\nenforced. The negative impact of the disfellowship decision on W\u2019s client base\nas a realtor does not give rise to an actionable claim. The matters in issue\nfall outside the courts\u2019 jurisdiction. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Third,\neven where review is available, the courts will consider only those issues that\nare justiciable. The ecclesiastical issues raised by W are not\njusticiable. Justiciability relates to whether the subject\nmatter of a dispute is appropriate for a court to decide. There is no single\nset of rules delineating the scope of justiciability. The court should ask\nwhether it has the institutional capacity and legitimacy to adjudicate the\nmatter. Even the procedural rules of a particular religious group may involve\nthe interpretation of religious doctrine, such as in this case. The courts have\nneither legitimacy nor institutional capacity to deal with contentious matters\nof religious doctrine.

        "summary": "<strong>Religious groups don\u2019t need  to have the same fair procedures as public bodies, the Supreme Court has ruled.  Also, courts can\u2019t interfere with their decisions on purely religious  questions.</strong>\r\n     The Highwood Congregation of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is a  religious group with about a hundred members in Calgary. To become a member, a  person must be baptized and show that s/he understands the religious teachings  and lives according to the community\u2019s rules. Anyone who doesn\u2019t follow the rules  will be urged to repent (apologize). If the behaviour continues, a committee of  at least three elders can decide to expel or \u201cdisfellowship\u201d the member. The  Congregation calls this committee a \u201cJudicial Committee.\u201d  Randy Wall became a member in 1980. In 2014, the  Judicial Committee disfellowshipped him for sinning and not fully repenting.  The decision was confirmed by an appeal committee and by the Watch Tower Bible  and Tract Society of Canada, the head office of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses in this  country. Mr. Wall asked the Alberta Court of Queen\u2019s Bench to  review the decision. \u201cJudicial review\u201d is when courts look at tribunals\u2019  decisions to make sure they are proper. Courts can only judicially review the  decisions of public bodies (set up by the government and acting on its behalf),  not private ones. When making decisions, public tribunals must treat everyone fairly  and make decisions without bias. This is what is meant by \u201cprocedural fairness.\u201d\r\n     Mr. Wall argued that the Judicial Committee acted  unfairly. He said that the decision caused him to lose money because Jehovah\u2019s  Witness clients avoided his real estate business. The lower courts first had to  decide whether they had any power (or legal authority) to review the Judicial  Committee\u2019s disfellowship decision. They decided they did, even though the  Judicial Committee was not a public decision-maker. They decided this due to  the financial impact on Mr. Wall and because the procedure may not have been  fair. Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice Malcolm  Rowe said this was wrong. The courts did not have the power to review the  disfellowship decision of a private, religious organization. Mr. Wall didn\u2019t  have a right to the Congregation members\u2019 business. He also didn\u2019t have a right  to membership in the Congregation that courts could enforce, like a contract. Justice  Rowe confirmed that courts can only review the decisions of public  decision-makers and that private decision-makers don\u2019t have to follow fair  procedures unless an enforceable legal right is at stake. He also confirmed  that disagreements about religious principles are \u201cnon-justiciable\u201d\u2014that is, not  appropriate for courts of law to get involved in. This decision confirmed that religious groups can decide  their own membership and rules. Courts cannot interfere with their decisions,  except when needed to resolve an underlying, \u201cjusticiable\u201d legal dispute. "

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court has refused a man\u2019s request to take back his guilty plea because he didn\u2019t  show what he would have done differently if he\u2019d known he could be deported.</strong>\r\n   Wing Wha Wong came to Canada from  China over 25 years ago, but never became a citizen. He was married and had a  child who was born in Canada. In 2014, he pleaded guilty to cocaine  trafficking. He didn\u2019t know that pleading guilty and being convicted of  trafficking could result in him being deported.  While he was in prison, however, he received  a call from an immigration officer. Because he was not a Canadian citizen, the  officer told him he likely could not stay in Canada because he had committed a  serious crime. A crime is \u201cserious\u201d when its possible prison sentence is ten  years or more, or where a person receives a sentence of more than six months. A  person convicted of cocaine trafficking could get a life sentence. Mr. Wong was  sentenced to nine months. His crime was considered serious\u2014and so he could be  required to leave Canada\u2014for both these reasons. Mr. Wong was told he would  have to attend an immigration hearing when he was released, and could be deported.  Immigration rules also said he could not appeal the deportation for any reason. In criminal law, a guilty plea must  be the person\u2019s own personal decision, it must be clear and specific, and it  must be based on all the necessary (legally relevant) information. An accused  person must understand what might happen once s/he pleads guilty. This includes  punishment, but also non-criminal consequences, such as deportation. A person  who wants to take back an uninformed plea must show that the missing information  was serious and caused him or her harm. Harm occurs where the person shows that  s/he would have decided to go to trial, or pleaded guilty under different  conditions, if s/he had all the necessary information at the time of the plea. After serving his sentence, Mr. Wong  sought to take back his guilty plea, arguing that he did not know he could be deported.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected his arguments because he did not  specifically say he would have chosen to go to trial if he knew this. Mr. Wong  appealed. At the Supreme Court, the majority said  that Mr. Wong should not be able to take his plea back. Justices Michael  Moldaver, Cl\u00e9ment Gascon, and Russell Brown, writing together, accepted that Mr.  Wong did not have all the legally relevant information when he pleaded guilty. Like  the Court of Appeal, however, they noted that he didn\u2019t show that he would have  done anything differently. A decision to plead guilty to a crime is deeply  personal. Courts must therefore look at the person, and what s/he specifically  would have done, when deciding whether to allow the person to take back a plea.  They noted that an approach that disregards the deeply personal nature of a  guilty plea, and looks instead at what a person in a similar situation would  have done, would be difficult for courts to apply. One other judge agreed with  Justices Moldaver, Gascon, and Brown. Justice Richard Wagner (who was not  yet Chief Justice when the appeal was heard) disagreed. He would have let Mr.  Wong take his plea back and ordered a new trial. He agreed that Mr. Wong didn\u2019t  have all the necessary information when he decided to plead guilty. Justice  Wagner disagreed that courts should look at the specific accused person.  Instead, he said courts should take a more objective view and look at what a  person in a similar situation might have done. He said Mr. Wong probably would  have done something differently had he known he could be deported, so the  process was not fair. Two judges agreed with Justice Wagner. Most criminal cases end with a  guilty plea. For the justice system to work well, it is important that guilty  pleas be final. But this is unjust when a guilty plea is flawed. This  decision confirms that someone can withdraw a guilty plea by showing s/he did  not have legally relevant information at the time, and would have done  something differently if s/he had it."

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court has confirmed a fine against a lumber company whose  inaction led to a forest worker\u2019s accidental death. </strong>\r\n   In  2010, West Fraser Mills hired an independent contractor to cut down \u201ctrap  trees\u201d to reduce the beetle population on its property. (\u201cTrap trees\u201d are dead  trees used to lure insect pests; the trees are then cut down and destroyed.) The  contractor, in turn, hired a \u201cfaller\u201d (tree-cutter) to do the work. The faller  reported to and was supervised by the contractor. The faller was struck by a falling  tree, and later died. An investigation found that tree was dangerous and should  have been removed before the work began. British  Columbia, like other provinces, has a workers\u2019 compensation scheme to prevent  and deal with workplace injuries and deaths. Under the <em>Workers Compensation Act</em>, the government gave the Workers\u2019  Compensation Board of British Columbia broad powers to make rules about  workplace safety. Different actors, including \u201cowners\u201d and \u201cemployers,\u201d have  different responsibilities.  In  this case, the Board found that West Fraser Mills failed as an \u201cowner\u201d to  ensure safe work practices. This violated a workplace safety regulation the  Board had adopted. The Board also found the company was an employer, although  not the employer of the faller. Under the Act, only an \u201cemployer\u201d could be  fined. The Board fined West Fraser Mills $75,000.  West  Fraser Mills appealed to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Tribunal. It argued  that the legislation did not allow the Board to adopt this particular  regulation about workplace owners. Therefore, there could be no finding of <em>owner</em> misconduct as a basis for a fine. West  Fraser Mills also argued that because it was not the faller\u2019s employer, and  only employers could be fined, there  were no grounds to fine it. The Tribunal rejected the arguments, but reduced  the fine based on the company\u2019s safety record and because it did not purposely  disregard safety standards. The decision was upheld by the B.C. Supreme Court  and Court of Appeal.  Then-Chief  Justice Beverley McLachlin, writing for the majority at the Supreme Court of  Canada, confirmed the Tribunal\u2019s decision and the fine. She said that the Board  acted reasonably in adopting a regulation to respond to increased deaths in the  forestry sector. In her view, the Board was free to interpret the legislation  in a way that better supported the goal of promoting safety, including adopting  a regulation targeting owners. A more narrow approach would undermine this goal.  Finally, she said that the Board had the authority to impose the fine. This was  in part because West Fraser Mills employed individuals on the site in question.  Five judges agreed with Chief Justice McLachlin. Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9, writing in dissent, would have allowed West Fraser  Mills\u2019 appeal. She said that the Board did not have the authority to adopt this  particular regulation or to impose a fine that applied to employers on a  company that only breached its obligations as an owner.  Justices Russell Brown and Malcolm Rowe also  dissented, in separate reasons. They agreed with the majority that the Board  had the authority to adopt the regulation, but would have allowed the appeal  against the fine for the same reasons as Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9. This  case involved courts\u2019 review of an administrative tribunal\u2019s decision. It  confirmed that courts should generally defer to administrative bodies (like the  Board) when those bodies are given wide authority to make regulations."

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0business that leaves a car unlocked with the keys inside will not  necessarily be responsible when someone is injured after the car is stolen, the  Supreme Court has ruled. The business will only be responsible where it should  have known both that the car could be stolen, and that someone could be injured  due to it being driven unsafely.</strong>     In  a 7-2 decision, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis, writing for the majority,  allowed an appeal by the owner of Rankin\u2019s Garage, which had been held liable  for such an injury by lower courts.  One  evening in July 2006, fifteen year-old J and 16 year-old C were at C\u2019s mother\u2019s  house, drinking and smoking marijuana. C\u2019s mother provided some of the alcohol.  Sometime after midnight, the boys left the house to walk around the town and  steal valuables from unlocked cars. They entered Rankin\u2019s Garage and found an  unlocked car with its keys in the ashtray. Though he did not have a driver\u2019s  licence and had not driven on the road before, C decided to steal the car and  told J to get in. While they were on the highway, the car crashed, and J  suffered a catastrophic brain injury. Rankin\u2019s Garage, C, and C\u2019s mother were  sued for negligence. The  jury found Rankin\u2019s Garage 37% responsible, C 23% responsible, C\u2019s mother 30%  responsible, and J himself 10% responsible for his injuries. The trial judge  had found that the owner of Rankin\u2019s Garage should have known that leaving an  unlocked vehicle with the keys in it could result in intoxicated teenagers like  J getting hurt. It therefore owed J a duty of care. (In law, a duty of care is  a requirement to act reasonably to avoid harm to others. The harm must be  reasonably foreseeable, or the duty will not exist.) The  Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge\u2019s holding. Rankin\u2019s Garage appealed. The  majority of the Supreme Court noted that there was no consensus in previous  case law on whether a duty of care existed in similar situations. To determine  whether Rankin\u2019s Garage owed J a duty of care, the majority looked at whether  the garage owner should have known that his failure to take care could cause  harm to someone like J. While the garage owner should have known that leaving a  car unlocked with the keys inside could result in it being stolen, the evidence  did not show that he should have known someone could be <em>injured</em> by a stolen car. This is because there was no evidence  suggesting that a stolen vehicle would be driven unsafely\u2014for example,  suggesting that it would be stolen by a young person. The majority noted that  just because something is <em>possible </em>does  not mean that it is reasonably foreseeable under the law. Rankin\u2019s Garage  therefore did not owe a duty of care to J. Justice  Russell Brown, writing for the dissent, disagreed with the majority\u2019s approach  and would have dismissed the appeal. He considered that the garage owner could  have reasonably foreseen that someone could get hurt as a result of his  negligence in leaving keys inside an unattended, unlocked car. This  case turned on the question of what kinds of harm are reasonably foreseeable.  The majority\u2019s decision clarified that a business will only be liable in this  kind of situation where both the theft and the unsafe operation of the stolen  vehicle should have been foreseen. It further indicated that a defendant may  still owe a duty of care even if a plaintiff participates in criminal activity."

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0Quebec law delaying pay equity for women in female-dominated  workplaces violated  Charter equality rights, the  Supreme Court has ruled, but it declined to strike the law down.</strong>\r\n   In 1996, Quebec passed a law that required  all employers with ten or more employees to ensure pay equity for women by  2001. Pay equity means equal pay for work of equal value. For most employers, the  1996 law meant identifying jobs that are done mostly by women, and comparing  their salaries to the salaries for jobs done mostly by men in the same  workplace. The problem was that there was no way to determine pay equity for  women in workplaces where there were no mostly male jobs for comparison.  Measuring  pay equity in those workplaces was difficult. Quebec gave its Pay Equity Commission  more time to come up with a solution. This meant that women in mostly-female  workplaces waited six years longer for pay equity than women in mixed-gender  workplaces. Some unions went to court to complain that this delay discriminated  against the women who were forced to wait. The trial judge  found that the delay did not violate the women\u2019s equality rights. This was  because the distinction the government made was not based on the women\u2019s sex (a  ground of discrimination listed in the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>). Instead, it was because there was no male  group to compare them to. The Quebec Court of Appeal agreed.  Justice  Rosalie Silberman Abella, for the majority of the Court on this issue, held  that the women\u2019s equality rights were  breached. The delay targeted a group that had suffered systemic discrimination  based on the idea that \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d was worth less than \u201cmen\u2019s work.\u201d Delaying access to pay equity for this group  of women was discriminatory because it continued their historic disadvantage in  the workforce. The government\u2019s reasons  for the delay did not matter to the question of <em>whether </em>discrimination happened, but it did matter to deciding  whether the delay was <em>justified</em>. Justice  Abella, along with three other judges, concluded that it was. The delay was intended  to achieve the important objective of finding an effective solution to the  problem of pay inequity. This long-term benefit outweighed the short-term harm.  Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9, writing for herself  and three other judges, said that there was no breach of the women\u2019s equality  rights. This distinction was not based on sex, but on the unique situation the  women found themselves in\u2014working in places with no male job classes for  comparison. The law did not discriminate against this group of women. It  actually benefitted them by correcting the lower pay they got due to systemic  discrimination. Quebec was the first province to tackle this difficult aspect  of pay equity and should be encouraged, not punished.  Chief  Justice Beverley McLachlin (as she was when the case was heard) agreed with  Justice Abella that the women\u2019s equality rights had been breached. But she  disagreed that this breach was constitutionally justified. She would have  struck down parts of the law. This case  was decided on the same day as <em><a href=\"37347-eng.aspx\">Quebec  (Attorney General) v. Alliance du personnel professionnel et technique de la  sant\u00e9 et des services sociaux</a></em> which struck down other parts of  Quebec\u2019s pay equity laws."

The Pay Equity\nAct set out a process aimed at ensuring that employers provided equal pay\nfor work of equal value. Under ss.\u00a040 to 43, which have now been repealed,\nemployers had a continuous obligation to maintain pay equity and adjust\ncompensation accordingly. After 10 years, the\ncompliance with the Act had not met expectations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In 2009, the Act to amend the\nPay Equity Act replaced the ongoing obligation to maintain pay equity with\na system of mandatory audits every five years in which the employer is only\nrequired to rectify the wages going forward. Under s.\u00a076.5 of the Pay\nEquity Act, adjustments in compensation apply from the date of the posting of\nthe results of the audit process. Section 76.3 provides no requirement that the\naudit posting include the date on which any pay inequity emerged. Under s.\u00a0103.1\npara.\u00a02, no compensation adjustments can be assessed by the Pay Equity\nCommission prior to the date of the audit posting. If, however, an employer\nacts \u201cin\nbad faith or in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner\u201d, adjustments in compensation and interest\napply from the date of that conduct pursuant to s.\u00a076.9 and the Pay Equity\nCommission may make a determination to that effect under s.\u00a0101\npara.\u00a03. The respondents brought proceedings seeking\na declaration that these amendments violated the equality rights in s.\u00a015\nof the Canadian Charter of\nRights and Freedoms.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial\njudge held that ss.\u00a076.3 and 76.5 breached s.\u00a015. The declaration of\ninvalidity was suspended for one year. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial\njudge\u2019s finding that ss.\u00a076.3 and 76.5 breached s.\u00a015 of the Charter.\nIn addition, it concluded that s.\u00a0103.1 para.\u00a02 violated s.\u00a015.\nRegarding the cross\u2011appeal, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal\nheld that the unions did not meet their onus of proving the\nunconstitutionality of the provisions in the 2009 Act to Amend the Pay Equity Act that\nrepealed ss. 40 to 43 of the Pay Equity Act.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting on the appeal): The appeal and the cross\u2011appeal should be dismissed. Sections 76.3, 76.5 and 103.1 para.\u00a02\nof the Pay Equity Act are unconstitutional.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per McLachlin\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver,\nKarakatsanis, Wagner and Gascon\u00a0JJ.: Sections\u00a076.3,\n76.5 and 103.1 para.\u00a02 of the Pay Equity Act\nviolate s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter. The\npurpose of the Act is to provide \u201cequal pay for work of equal value\u201d, a\nstrategy that recognizes that since \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d is valued less than \u201cmen\u2019s\nwork\u201d, the pay and status are lower and the result is systemic wage\ndiscrimination. Leaving wage inequities in place makes women \u201cthe economy\u2019s ordained\nshock absorbers\u201d. Pay equity legislation, such as the Act at issue here,\naccordingly targets women in redressing the pay discrimination they have\nsuffered. The provisions at issue, which alter the way in which the legislation\nidentifies and redresses differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s pay, therefore draw\ndistinctions based on sex.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Assessed\non their own, and regardless of the prior legislative scheme, ss.\u00a076.3,\n76.5 and 103.1 para.\u00a02 have a discriminatory impact. Any pay inequities emerging during the five\nyear period between audits go uncorrected until the next audit. Even when an\naudit reveals the emergence of pay inequity during the previous five years,\nonly adjustment payments going forward are payable. This effectively gives an\namnesty to the employer for discrimination between audits. Employers are required to post the results of the audit, but not the\ndate on which pay inequity emerged, thus obscuring when adjustment payments\nought to have been made. Employees are thus deprived of the evidentiary\nfoundation for showing bad faith by the employer, which is the only route to\nobtaining retroactive compensation. Further, retroactive compensation is only\navailable to sanction deliberate and improper behaviour in the conduct of mandatory\naudits, not the discrimination that may otherwise be revealed by the process. Inequities\nthat subsequently emerge before the next audit will therefore be immune from\nremedial redress except where the claimants can prove intentional discrimination,\nan approach to discrimination long rejected by this Court and at odds with the\npurpose of pay equity legislation, namely, to remedy systemic discrimination. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although the scheme purports to\naddress systemic discrimination, it in fact codifies the denial to women of\nbenefits routinely enjoyed by men \u2014 namely, compensation tied to the value of\ntheir work. Men receive this compensation as a matter of course; women, under\nthis scheme, are expected to endure five year periods of pay inequity, and to\nreceive equal compensation only where their employer voluntarily acts in a non\u2011discriminatory\nmanner, or where they can meet the heavy burden of proving the employer engaged\nin deliberate or improper conduct. The scheme thus places barriers along the\npath to equal pay for women. And it correspondingly tolerates undervaluation of\nwomen\u2019s work whenever women cannot clear the specific hurdle of proving that\nthey should be paid equally because their employer acted improperly. Absent\nsuch behaviour, working women are told that they must simply live with the\nreality that they have not been paid fairly, even where a statutorily mandated\naudit has made that fact clear. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 15(2) has no application in cases\nsuch as this one. It protects ameliorative programs for disadvantaged groups\nfrom claims by those the program was not intended to benefit that the ameliorative\nprogram discriminates against them. Section 15(2) cannot bar s.\u00a015(1)\nclaims by the very group the legislation seeks to protect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 None of\nthe impugned provisions can be justified under s.\u00a01. Encouraging increased\nemployer compliance by lightening the burden through denial of retroactive\npayments can, in some circumstances, constitute a pressing and substantial\nobjective. Although there is no empirical or other evidence to show how denying\nretroactive compensation has advanced this objective, reducing the employer\u2019s\nobligations can be seen, at a theoretical level, to be rationally connected to increased\nemployer compliance. At the minimal impairment stage, however, there is\nvirtually no evidence that other means of encouraging employer compliance \u2014\nsuch as stricter enforcement of the Pay Equity Act\u2019s requirements\nthrough the offence provisions contained within it \u2014 would be ineffective.\nTherefore, eliminating pay equity obligations except for adjustments every five\nyears does not impair female employees\u2019 equality rights as little as reasonably\npossible, it suspends their rights to be free from pay discrimination for five\nyear intervals. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Quebec\nhas failed to demonstrate that the law satisfies the overall balancing\nrequirement of the s.\u00a01 analysis. The harmful effects\nare to create barriers to access for equitable pay for\nthe very people whom this pay equity scheme was designed to help; the benefits are, at the moment, indiscernible and speculative given\nthe absence of evidence. Reducing employers\u2019\nobligations in the hopes of encouraging compliance subordinates the substantive\nconstitutional entitlement of women to be free from\ndiscrimination in compensation, to the willingness of employers to comply with\nthe law. As for the information in the audit\nposting, the justifications analysis fails at every step. Quebec has not\nprovided any explanation for the exclusion of the date when pay inequities re\u2011emerged\nother than to say that it is not relevant information under the new scheme.\nSince the five year gap between remedial compensation has been found to be\nunconstitutional, the date on which pay inequities re\u2011emerge is plainly\nrelevant information.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As\nfor the cross\u2011appeal, the onus of proving the unconstitutionality\nof the provisions in the 2009 Act to Amend the Pay Equity Act that repealed ss. 40 to 43 of the Pay Equity Act was not\nmet.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nC\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting on the appeal): The\nappeal should be allowed and the cross\u2011appeal dismissed. Sections 76.3,\n76.5 and 103.1 para.\u00a02 of the Pay Equity Act do not create a\ndiscriminatory distinction that infringes s.\u00a015 of the Canadian Charter\nof Rights and Freedoms. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At\nthe first step of the analysis under s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter, the\nclaimant must show not only the mere existence of a distinction in the Act,\nbut also a form of disadvantage flowing from that distinction. Because the Act entails distinctions that may affect a group consisting\nessentially of women, it would be absurd if an approach whose focus was on\ndiscriminatory effects did not deal first with the issue of the disadvantage\nresulting from one or more of those distinctions, at least on a prima facie\nbasis. Pay equity for private sector enterprises is a\ncreation of the Quebec legislature and does not have constitutional status. It\nis not appropriate to compare the amendments to the Act with the\nprevious version of the Act. Such an approach would have the effect of\nconstitutionally entrenching one mechanism that confers benefits on a group to\nwhich an enumerated or analogous ground applies, to the detriment of other,\nequally valid, mechanisms. It would then no longer be open to the legislature to\nexplore other avenues. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nemployees in question have enjoyed a significant benefit. The Act, as a\nwhole, creates a complete hybrid scheme that allows for a periodic review of\ncompensation and provides a retroactive remedy in case of abuse. It thus addresses\nthe problem of systemic discrimination in addition to, among others, that of\nintentional discrimination.\nThe Act\u2019s ameliorative effect becomes clear when the situation is\nconsidered through the lens of the comparator group. Thus, employees in an enterprise\nthat has fewer than 10 employees are excluded from the scope of the Act\nand do not benefit from a periodic audit of their compensation. They cannot use\na complaint mechanism comparable to the one provided for in the Act\nshould their employer modify their duties without taking into account the\ninsidious factors at the root of the systemic discrimination from the\nstandpoint of a correlative audit of their remuneration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At\nthe second step of the s.\u00a015(1) analysis, it is necessary to determine\nwhether the amendments are discriminatory by considering whether they respond\nto the actual capacities and needs of the members of the group or instead\nimpose a burden or deny a benefit in a manner that has the effect of\nreinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating their disadvantage. In this case, it\nhas not been established that the measure has a discriminatory effect on the\ngroup.\u00a0The state conduct does not widen \u2014 rather than narrowing \u2014 the gap\nbetween the historically disadvantaged group and the rest of society. Contextual\nfactors like the ones set out in Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration),\n1999 CanLII 675 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497 \u2014\n(1)\u00a0a pre\u2011existing disadvantage, (2)\u00a0a correspondence with\nactual characteristics, (3)\u00a0the impact on other groups and (4) the nature\nof the affected interest \u2014 are helpful in determining whether a particular\ndistinction is discriminatory. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although women face systemic\ndiscrimination in matters of compensation, the impugned sections do not\nperpetuate or reinforce the idea that women can be paid less simply because\nthey are women. The Act\u2019s objective is to permanently eradicate pay\ninequities by establishing a maintenance mechanism in ss.\u00a076.1 to 76.9. This\nnew mechanism responds to the needs of the women concerned by effectively\npreventing abuse by employers and also by providing them with a periodic audit\nof their remuneration. The scheme established by the Act deals with only\none ground of discrimination, namely sex, and applies to only a small portion\nof female employees in Quebec, those who hold positions in predominantly female\njob classes in enterprises with 10 or more employees. There is no doubt that\nwork is an important aspect of life and that, for many people, it is a large\npart of their identity. In enacting the Act, the Quebec legislature has\nrecognized the nature of pay equity and its importance for women. However, the\nadopted measures have not constitutionally entrenched pay equity such that they\nwould be impossible to modify.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Because it is the group to which an enumerated\nground applies that is raising the discriminatory nature of the effects of a\nlaw whose specific object is the amelioration of conditions of the group\u2019s\nmembers, the s.\u00a015(2) analysis must be deferred until after the entire\ns.\u00a015(1) analysis has been completed. If a court were to follow the approach proposed in R. v. Kapp, 2008 SCC 41, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483, according to which it must be determined whether\ns.\u00a015(2) applies before turning to the second step of the s.\u00a015(1)\nanalysis so as to make it\nunnecessary to conclude that the equality guarantee has been violated before\nsaving the impugned measure, the effect would be to\nterminate the analysis prematurely. The order set out\nin Kapp should be followed in any situation in which the claimant is not a member of the group to which the law applies. In the instant case, even if it were to\nbe held that the specific mechanism created by the statutory amendments can be\nconsidered discriminatory, the Act as a whole should be protected under\ns.\u00a015(2). There is no doubt that the Act genuinely has the\npromotion and achievement of substantive equality as its object, as it provides\nfor measures to combat systemic discrimination.

        "summary": "<strong>For the first time, the Supreme Court has found a pay equity law  unconstitutional because it was discriminatory.</strong>In a 6-3  decision, Justice Rosalie Silberman Abella, writing for the majority, dismissed  an appeal by the Government of Quebec.  To tackle  the problem of wage discrimination against women workers, Quebec passed a law  in 1996 forcing employers with 10 or more employees to give equal pay for work  of equal value. Ten years later, less than half of employers had  complied. Less than two-thirds had even started on a plan. In 2009, Quebec changed  the law to require employers to review their progress on pay equity every five  years through audits. If the audits showed women were not being paid fairly, they  could still only get pay equity every five years, with no back pay for unfair  wages in between. Some unions challenged the new law in court. They said  that making pay equity available only every five years was discriminatory. The  Quebec courts agreed that the law breached women\u2019s equality rights under section  15 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em>.  Justice Abella agreed that the law violated women\u2019s  equality rights. Pay equity is based on the idea that stereotypes  about the role of women in society lead to \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d being valued and paid  less than \u201cmen\u2019s work.\u201d Pay equity laws require employers to identify jobs done  mostly by women, and compare their salaries to the salaries for jobs done mostly  by men. Where equal pay is not being given for work of equal value, employers have  pay their women employees to close the gap. By restricting pay  equity to every five years, the law let employers off the hook. The law  continued the disadvantage women already suffered in the workforce. This breach  of women\u2019s equality rights was not constitutionally justified. It continued to  punish women financially for their employers\u2019 failures. Five judges agreed with  Justice Abella. Justices  Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9, Russell Brown, and Malcolm Rowe disagreed. They said Quebec\u2019s law  did not breach women\u2019s equality rights. They noted that <em>Charter</em> rights are \u201cnegative rights,\u201d meaning that governments do  not have to adopt particular laws\u2014but if they do, those laws must comply with  the <em>Charter</em>. Quebec decided to adopt a  pay equity law, and when it saw that the original scheme was not working, it  chose to replace it with one that would better achieve equal pay for women. In  practice, the changes benefitted women employees and brought them closer to  real pay equity. These judges said that the choice of how to improve Quebec\u2019s  pay equity laws should be left to Quebeckers\u2019 elected representatives, not the  Court. They also noted that back pay was available for unfair wages in between  audits. This case was decided on the same day as <a href=\"37002-eng.aspx\"><em>Centrale des syndicats du Qu\u00e9bec v. Quebec \r\n    (Attorney General)</em></a> which upheld  other parts of Quebec\u2019s pay equity laws."

        "summary": "<strong>Courts should look at all relevant circumstances to  determine a child\u2019s \u201chabitual residence,\u201d the Supreme Court has ruled in a case  about the meaning of those words in an international treaty.</strong>\r\n   In  a 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin (as she was when the  case was heard), the Supreme Court provided guidance for courts to determine a  child\u2019s habitual residence under the <em>Convention  on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</em>. The  parents in this case married in Ontario in 2000 and moved to Germany in 2001. They  became permanent residents there and had two children, but later separated. The  children were struggling in school, so the parents decided the mother would  take them to Canada for 16 months to see if things improved. In August 2014, at  the end of the 16 months, the mother did not return the children to Germany.  The father asked the court to order the return of the children. Based on a  court order, the children were eventually returned to Germany in October 2016.  Soon after, the German courts gave the mother sole custody of the children. In  April 2017, the children and the mother returned to Canada. By  the time this case was heard at the Supreme Court, the disagreement between the  mother and father was resolved. However, the questions asked in the appeal were  important, so the Court decided to provide guidance on how to determine a  child\u2019s habitual residence in future cases. This case involved the <em>Convention on the Civil Aspects of  International Child Abduction</em>. Nearly 100 countries are members of the  Convention, including Germany and Canada. The treaty seeks to protect children  by enforcing custody rights and securing children\u2019s quick return to their  country of habitual residence.  Under  Article 3 of the treaty, the children in this case would have to be returned to  Germany if that was their place of habitual residence. The words \u201chabitual  residence\u201d are not defined, and the parents\u2019 main disagreement was about what  those words actually meant. The judge who first heard the case found that the  intentions of the parents were most important. The Divisional Court later found  that the children\u2019s integration into the community was most important. The  Court of Appeal agreed with the first judge. That decision was appealed to the  Supreme Court. The  majority of the Supreme Court held that courts should look at all relevant  considerations   a child\u2019s habitual residence. This includes the child\u2019s links to, and  circumstances in, each country. The circumstances of the parents, including  their intentions, may be considered. However, courts have no definitive list of  factors that they must take into account; they must look at the child\u2019s  complete situation. A court can, however, decline to return a child if an exception  listed in the treaty applies. Determining habitual residence quickly allows  children to be returned as soon as possible. This protects children, deters abduction  by parents, and helps ensure that the proper courts (in the child\u2019s country of  habitual residence) can decide custody and access issues more quickly. Justices  Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Malcolm Rowe, writing in dissent, disagreed with the majority about  how to determine the habitual residence of the children. They said that in  situations where the parents\u2019 intentions were clear, courts should respect those  intentions. They said this would lead to faster and more predictable decisions,  which is one of the goals of the <em>Convention</em>.  In this case, the parents had signed an agreement that said that the move to  Canada would be temporary. For this reason, Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe would have  upheld the rulings of the application judge and the Court of Appeal, which had  found that Germany was the children\u2019s habitual residence. This  case led to changes in the way the Supreme Court deals with international  custody cases. The majority noted that the legal procedures took too long, and  said this was unacceptable because the first goal of the <em>Convention</em> is to bring children home quickly. To prevent future  delays, the Court is making sure that cases like this one will be identified  and sped up. The Court encouraged lower courts to take similar measures. "

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0law preventing  residents of New Brunswick from stocking up on alcohol from another province is  constitutional, the Supreme Court has ruled. Provinces have flexibility to make  laws to address particular conditions and priorities within their borders. They  can do this even if those laws may incidentally restrict the movement of goods  across their borders. </strong> The Court unanimously allowed the Crown\u2019s  appeal in a case of a New Brunswick man who bought alcohol from neighbouring  Quebec. Section 134(<em>b</em>)  of the New Brunswick\u2019s <em>Liquor Control Act</em> forbids residents from possessing large amounts of alcohol not purchased from  the New Brunswick Liquor Corporation\u2014for example, purchased from other  provinces. The RCMP was watching New Brunswick residents who crossed the border  into Quebec to buy cheaper alcohol. On October 6, 2012, Gerard Comeau drove to  Quebec from his home in New Brunswick to stock up. When he returned to New  Brunswick, Mr. Comeau was stopped by the RCMP with large amounts of beer and  some spirits he bought in Quebec. He was fined $240, plus fees. Mr. Comeau fought the fine. He said that section  121 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> guarantees  free trade across provincial borders. The Crown disagreed. It argued that section  121 was only meant to prevent provinces from charging tariffs or similar costs  at the border. The Crown said the provision did not apply in Mr. Comeau\u2019s  situation. The trial judge, breaking with longstanding Supreme Court precedent,  agreed with Mr. Comeau and dismissed the charge. The New Brunswick Court of Appeal dismissed the  Crown\u2019s request for permission to appeal. The Crown appealed to the Supreme  Court.  The Supreme Court held that while section 121  prohibits laws whose <em>main</em> purpose is  to prevent the movement of goods across provincial borders, it does not prohibit  legislation that has <em>incidental</em> effects on trade. While the New Brunswick law Mr. Comeau challenged restricted  the movement of alcohol across the provincial border, this was not its main  purpose. Its main purpose was to manage the supply and demand of liquor in New  Brunswick. Therefore, the law is constitutional.This case turned on the  meaning of section 121 of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>. To understand its meaning, the Court looked at the wording, history,  and position of the provision within the Constitution. It also looked at the legal  principles that guide how courts understand the Constitution. The Court  concluded that section 121 prohibits laws restricting inter-provincial trade,  but only where restricting trade is the laws\u2019 main purpose. If section 121 were  understood to guarantee free inter-provincial trade, it would have far-reaching  effects on agricultural supply management, public health prohibitions,  environmental controls, and similar schemes. Section 121 lets provinces enact  these types of measures, as long as their main purpose is not simply to prevent  the importation of goods from other provinces.\r\n  "

        "summary": "\u00a0<strong>NOTE: </strong>this document contains details that may be  distressing to some readers.<strong>The Supreme Court has upheld first-degree murder convictions for parents  who abused and unlawfully confined a child.</strong>\r\n     A  unanimous Supreme Court dismissed Spencer Jordan\u2019s and Marie-Eve Magoon\u2019s  appeals against their first-degree murder convictions in an oral judgment on  November 27, 2017. The Court\u2019s written reasons, penned by Justices Rosalie  Silberman Abella and Michael Moldaver, were released on April 13, 2018.  The charges in this  case related to the death of six year-old Meika Jordan, who died after spending  a weekend with her father, Spencer Jordan, and her stepmother, Marie-Eve  Magoon. Meika had endured serious abuse in the days before she died, which Ms.  Magoon and Mr. Jordan justified as discipline. Among other things, she had been  deliberately burned, hit in the stomach (with enough force to damage her  internal organs), and suffered several serious blows to her head. She was  ordered to run up and down the stairs as a form of punishment, and beaten when  Mr. Jordan and Ms. Magoon thought she was not complying with their orders. As a  result of her injuries, Meika lost consciousness and died.  Ms. Magoon and Mr.  Jordan were charged with first-degree murder. The trial judge found that they  intended to harm Meika in a way that was likely to cause her death, and that  they were reckless about whether she actually died. They were convicted of  second-degree murder at trial. The trial judge did not find them guilty of  first-degree murder because she was not satisfied that they had unlawfully  confined Meika while inflicting the injuries.  First- and  second-degree murder are related charges. Second-degree murder is the less  serious offence, and is said to be \u201cincluded\u201d in the charge of first-degree  murder. First-degree murder contains all the elements of second-degree murder,  but in addition requires planning or an aggravating circumstance\u2014in this case,  the aggravating circumstance was Meika\u2019s unlawful confinement in the home.  Despite this \u201cinclusion,\u201d  both charges are considered separately when a criminal judgment is appealed. In  this case, it meant that after trial the Crown could appeal the acquittal for  first-degree murder, while Mr. Jordan and Ms. Magoon could appeal their  convictions for second-degree murder. The Alberta Court of Appeal dismissed Ms.  Magoon\u2019s and Mr. Jordan\u2019s appeals, confirming the conviction for second-degree  murder. However, it also allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and upgraded the  convictions to first-degree murder.  Mr. Jordan and Ms.  Magoon appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court looked at the issue of unlawful  confinement in the context of a parent-child relationship. They held that  \u201cconfinement\u201d does not require a child to be physically bound or locked up, and  that it can just as easily result from controlling conduct. When parents  abuse or harm a child beyond any acceptable form of parenting, they lose legal  authority to restrict the child\u2019s liberty, and may be found guilty of unlawful  confinement. The Supreme Court  agreed with the Court of Appeal that the pair\u2019s acts of \u201cdiscipline\u201d went far beyond any acceptable  form of parenting, and amounted to abuse. The Court further agreed that Meika was  unlawfully confined by Ms. Magoon and Mr. Jordan. Therefore, the two could be  found guilty of first-degree murder.  This case dealt  with what constitutes unlawful confinement of a child by a parent, in the  context of a criminal charge of first-degree murder. The Court confirmed the  Alberta Court of Appeal\u2019s conviction of both Mr. Jordan and Ms. Magoon for  first-degree murder. The  penalty for first-degree murder is life in prison with no possibility of parole  for 25 years."

        "summary": "<strong>The offence  of influence peddling includes a promise to influence government to change the  way it operates, the Supreme Court has ruled. The phrase \u201cany matter of  business relating to the government\u201d in the Criminal Code captures activities that go beyond current  government operations, to include those that the government could facilitate.</strong>\r\n     In an 8-1  decision, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis dismissed Bruce Carson\u2019s appeal and  upheld his conviction for influence peddling. Bruce  Carson was formerly a Senior Advisor in the Office of the Prime Minister. In  2010, about a year after leaving that position, he negotiated a deal with H2O  Professionals Inc. where he promised to use his government contacts to help the  company sell water treatment products to First Nations. In exchange, the  company agreed to pay Mr. Carson\u2019s then-girlfriend commissions on the sales.  Mr. Carson promoted the company to First Nations leaders, government officials, and  cabinet ministers and their staff.  Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (as it was called at  the time, or INAC for short) provided funding to First Nations for water  treatment systems like the ones sold by H2O. First Nations themselves  determined how the money would be spent. However, INAC sometimes funded pilot  projects for water treatment systems. Mr. Carson tried to convince INAC to set  up a project to purchase H2O products and pilot them in First Nations communities. Mr. Carson was charged with a fraud against the  government for selling his influence with the government. At trial,  Mr. Carson admitted that he had influence over the government. He also admitted  that he had demanded a benefit for his then-girlfriend in exchange for  promising to help H2O sell its products. He denied, however, that he was  selling his influence in connection with \u201cany matter of business relating to  the government.\u201d The trial judge acquitted Mr. Carson on the basis that  the purchase of water treatment systems by First Nations did not require  government approval or action. That was because First Nations, rather than  government, would decide whether to purchase H2O\u2019s water treatment systems. The  Court of Appeal disagreed, finding that the trial judge\u2019s interpretation was too  narrow. It held that Mr. Carson\u2019s promise was, in fact, related to government  business. It set aside his acquittal and found him guilty. The main question before the Supreme Court was what  counts as a \u201cmatter of business relating to the government.\u201d The majority determined  that this phrase should be interpreted broadly. Business relates to the  government if it depends on or could be facilitated by the government, even if  it requires government to change its operations to promote a specific result. Based  on this, the majority held that Mr. Carson\u2019s promise was indeed in connection  with \u201cany matter of business relating to the government.\u201d This was because, while  First Nations did not need government approval to buy H2O products, INAC could  have encouraged such purchases. It could have changed its funding conditions to  benefit the company, or created a pilot project promoting H2O  products\u2014something Mr. Carson pushed for. For these reasons, the majority held  that it was clear Mr. Carson believed that sales of H2O products to First  Nations could be facilitated by the government. In these circumstances, the  majority considered that Mr. Carson undermined the appearance of government  integrity and that he was guilty of influence peddling. Writing in dissent, Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 disagreed  that the matter was connected to government business, and would have restored  Mr. Carson\u2019s acquittal. In her view, \u201ca matter of business relating to the  government\u201d must be actually\u2014not just potentially\u2014related to the operational  structures of government in place at the time of the offence. The trial judge  had found that the federal government had given First Nations complete  independence to purchase water treatment systems of their own choosing.  Therefore, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 agreed with the trial judge that Mr. Carson\u2019s  activities could not be said to be \u201crelating to the government.\u201d In her view,  the <em>Criminal Code </em>sought to protect  government integrity by criminalizing agreements that would pose a risk of  corruption if they were carried out successfully. She held that no such risk existed  where the \u201cmatter of business\u201d in question did not actually relate to the  government. This case dealt with the meaning and scope of \u201cany  matter of business relating to the government\u201d in section 121(1)(d) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The majority determined  that business relates to the government if it depends on or could be  facilitated by the government. A broad interpretation is necessary because real  or apparent corruption may  undermine the integrity and transparency that are crucial to democracy."

The complaint was filed by a representative of the letter carriers\u2019 union, who claimed that the work place safety inspections performed by the joint health and safety committee should include letter carrier routes and points of call. The health and safety officer issued a direction finding that the employer failed to comply with s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) of the Code, which states that \u201cevery employer shall, in respect of every work place controlled by the employer and, in respect of every work activity carried out by an employer in a work place that is not controlled by the employer, to the extent that the employer controls the activity, ensure that the work place committee or the health and safety representative inspects each month all or part of the work place, so that every part of the work place is inspected at least one each year\u201d. The employer appealed the health and safety officer\u2019s direction to the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal Canada. The appeals officer rescinded the contravention relating to work place inspections, determining that the work place inspection obligation applied only to the parts of the work place over which the employer had control; this did not include letter carrier routes and points of call. The Federal Court dismissed the union\u2019s application for judicial review. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the union\u2019s appeal and reinstated the health and safety officer\u2019s direction that the employer failed to comply with s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) of the Code.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Abella and Martin\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the appeals officer\u2019s order restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ.: Applying the framework set out in Vavilov for determining the applicable standard of review and conducting reasonableness review, the appeals officer\u2019s decision concluding that the obligation to inspect the work place in s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) of the Code is one that can only apply to an employer who has control over the physical work place was reasonable. The appeals officer\u2019s analysis followed a rational and logical line of reasoning and his decision was defensible in light of the relevant legal and factual constraints. He employed well\u2011established principles of statutory interpretation, engaged with the submissions and evidence before him, and drew on his knowledge of the field when considering the practical implications of his interpretation. The interpretation he arrived at is harmonious with the text, context and purpose of the provision and aligns with past decisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal Canada.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The appeals officer\u2019s decision is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. None of the situations set out in Vavilov for departing from the presumption of reasonableness review apply here: the legislature has not statutorily prescribed a standard of review or provided for an appeal from the administrative decision to a court and the question on review does not fall into one of the categories of questions that the rule of law requires be reviewed on a standard of correctness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As provided for in Vavilov, when conducting reasonableness review, a reviewing court must begin its inquiry into the reasonableness of a decision by examining the reasons provided with respectful attention, seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at a conclusion. What is required of statutory delegates to justify their decision will depend on the context in which the decision is made. A reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, the appeals officer\u2019s reasons do not in any way display a fatal flaw in rationality or logic. His decision was not rendered unreasonable by, on the one hand, recognizing that the employer through its internal policies seeks to identify and resolve hazards for letter carriers, while also concluding that it does not have the capacity to ensure all areas of the work place outside the employer\u2019s physical building are inspected annually. Far from being internally incoherent, the appeals officer\u2019s reasoning demonstrates his in\u2011depth understanding of the ways in which the employer fulfils the purposes of the Code, bearing in mind the practical limitations of the work place.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When reviewing a question of statutory interpretation, reviewing courts should not conduct a de novo interpretation, nor attempt to determine a range of reasonable interpretations against which to compare the interpretation of decision makers. A \u201creasons first\u201d approach rather requires reviewing courts to start with how decision makers arrived at their interpretation, and determine whether it was defensible in light of the interpretative constraints imposed by law. Where the meaning of a statutory provision is in dispute, administrative decision makers must demonstrate in their reasons that they were alive to the essential elements of statutory interpretation. In addition to being harmonious with the text, context and purpose of the provision, a reasonable interpretation should conform to any interpretative constraints in the governing statutory scheme, as well as interpretative rules arising from other sources of law. The evidentiary record and the general factual matrix act as constraints on the reasonableness of a decision, and must be taken into account. The principles of justification and transparency require that administrative decision makers\u2019 reasons meaningfully account for the central issues and concerns raised by the parties. However, administrative decisions makers are not required, on their own account, to consider every aspect of the statutory context that might bear on their decisions. While reviewing courts should ensure the decision under review is justified in relation to the relevant facts, deference to decision makers includes deferring to their findings and assessment of the evidence. Reviewing courts must pay respectful attention to decision makers\u2019 demonstrated expertise when considering whether an outcome reflects a reasonable approach given the consequences and the operational impact of a decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the appeals officer interpreted s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) using well\u2011established principles of statutory interpretation, with due regard to the submissions before him. His reasons amply demonstrate that he considered the text, context and purpose of the provision, and his focus on the practical implications of his interpretation enriched and elevated the interpretative exercise. He demonstrated a sustained effort to discern legislative intent throughout his analysis, and did not simply reverse\u2011engineer a desired outcome. His broad interpretation of what constitutes a work place conformed to the definition in the Code and to prior decisions on this point, and accounted for all the areas in which an employee may be engaged in work. His interpretation of the scope of the obligations arising from s.\u00a0125(1) was not contrary to the plain text of the statute, as the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cainsi que\u201d in the opening phrase of the English and French versions of s.\u00a0125(1) do not preclude the conclusion that the provision indicates that certain obligations apply only where an employer has control over the work place. The appeals officer\u2019s reasons also demonstrate that he turned his mind to the context of s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12). He considered the practical implications of the interpretation in light of the purpose of s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12), an imputed purpose accepted by the parties and consistent with the broad, purposive interpretation afforded to remedial legislation. His interpretation did not frustrate the statutory purpose set out in the Code. There is no indication that he failed to consider the evidence presented at the hearing, or that he based his decision on a misapprehension of the evidence, thereby rendering his decision unreasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella and Martin\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The appeals officer\u2019s conclusion that the safety inspection duty in s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) of the Code requires the employer to inspect only those workplaces within its physical control was unreasonable and inconsistent with the purpose and text of the safety inspection provision. The employer contravened its statutory duty in s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) by preventing the health and safety committee from inspecting mail routes for safety hazards.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The introductory language of s.\u00a0125 is an unambiguous dual legislative direction to employers that their safety obligations apply both to workplaces they control and, if they do not control the actual workplace, to every work activity that they do control to the extent of that control. Nothing in the text of s.\u00a0125(1) limits an employer\u2019s inspection duty to workplaces under its physical control.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 125(1)(z.12) is part of an extensive web of employer responsibilities which flow from a general obligation placed on employers to ensure workplace safety, and are designed to prevent accidents and injury to health arising out of, linked with or occurring in the course of employment. All of the 45 duties placed on employers are introduced by language stipulating that they apply in all workplaces controlled by employers and to all employer\u2011controlled work activities carried out by employees. Section 125(1) aims to protect workers from safety hazards \u2014 a purpose that is undermined if the safety inspection duty is confined to workplaces under an employer\u2019s physical control. By drafting s.\u00a0125(1) to cover workplaces within and outside an employer\u2019s physical control, Parliament sought to protect the thousands of employees working outside an employer\u2011owned location, affording the same quality of safety protection to all employees wherever they work.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Safety inspections were a central methodology by which Parliament intended to broaden preventive health and safety protections for workers. They exist to proactively identify hazards before workers are exposed to them, and ensure that they will either be fixed or avoided. It makes little sense that Parliament, having expressly chosen under s.\u00a0125(1) to extend safety protections to activities in workplaces outside an employer\u2019s control, would have intended that a core part of those protections \u2014 the safety inspection duty \u2014 be exempt from that extension. The preventive purpose of the inspection obligation further reinforces that it was not meant to apply only to workplaces under an employer\u2019s physical control.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A narrowing of the inspection duty is inconsistent with the expansive definitions of \u201cworkplace\u201d found in many provincial health and safety statutes. The uniting feature of all these statutes is a functional, purposive definition of a workplace that centers on where the worker performs his or her employment, not on whether the employer controls the physical premises. The language of s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) should not be interpreted in isolation to shrink an employer\u2019s duty to protect workers from safety hazards; it should be read as part of s.\u00a0125(1), which expressly imposes the duty in connection with any work activity to the extent that the employer controls the activity. Therefore, safety inspections should be done in a way that protects employee safety as much as possible in the circumstances, not in a way that deprives whole categories of workers \u2014 those who work outside a physical building \u2014 from protection.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fact that the inspections may be difficult to carry out does not support eliminating the duty completely. Parliament did not intend that a provision binding all federally\u2011regulated employers be interpreted based on whether it is easy or difficult for any particular employer to implement. The language of s.\u00a0125(1) eschews an all\u2011or\u2011nothing view of the safety obligations, in favour of a context\u2011specific approach capable of accommodating the diverse group of federally\u2011regulated employers. The flexibility anticipated by s.\u00a0125(1) is underscored by Parliament\u2019s delegation of inspection responsibilities to joint health and safety committees. By delegating the safety inspection obligation to joint workplace committees, Parliament clearly contemplated a flexible inspection process sensitive to workplace\u2011specific concerns and limitations. Just because inspections may be difficult does not mean that they do not have to be done at all, and just because hazards cannot be fixed entirely does not mean that nothing can be done to address them. This interpretation is the only one that is true to the preventive purpose of s.\u00a0125(1) in general and the safety inspection provision in particular.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, the appeals officer\u2019s reasoning process was deeply flawed. He acknowledged that safety inspections are meant to protect employees from workplace hazards, but failed to give this purpose, and the plain language of s.\u00a0125(1), any meaningful effect, let alone a generous interpretation. His interpretation ignores the second part of s.\u00a0125(1), which simultaneously imposes the inspection duty on employers for work activities in workplaces they do not control. In so restricting the scope of s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12), the appeals officer redrafted the provision. The employer\u2019s control of the work activity of letter\u2011carriers is stringent, bringing its work arrangements with its letter\u2011carriers squarely within the language of s.\u00a0125(1). By restricting inspections to locations where the employer exercises property rights, the appeals officer\u2019s decision risks leaving workplace health and safety committees unable to proactively identify and address the hazards that may arise in the areas where letter\u2011carriers work. By reading out the words and purposes of the safety inspection duty, the appeals officer came to an unreasonable conclusion that subverted not only the preventive purpose of the employer safety duties in s.\u00a0125(1), but of the specific goal in s.\u00a0125(1)(z.12) to ensure that inspections are carried out to make workplace as safe as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

        "summary": "<strong>People delivering mail have a right to safe workplaces, but that doesn\u2019t  mean mail routes have to be inspected every year, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Canada  Post delivers mail across Canada. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers  represents its workers. This includes letter carriers, the people who deliver  the mail. The  federal government is responsible for mail under the Constitution. This means  Canada Post has to follow federal labour laws. One of these laws is the <em>Canada Labour Code</em>. Part of that law deals  with workplace health and safety. Its main purpose is to prevent accidents and  injuries at work. The Code said there had to be a committee to find and fix  dangers to workers\u2019 health and safety. The committee had both worker and  employer members. In  2012, the union filed a complaint about a mail depot in Burlington, Ontario. It  said the committee there wasn\u2019t following the Code. It said the committee was  supposed to inspect each part of the workplace at least once a year. The union said  the workplace included all routes mail was carried on and all places it was  delivered. While the complaint was only about Burlington, it could have had  effects across Canada. Canada Post delivered mail to almost 9 million places  along 72 million kilometres of routes. A  Health and Safety Officer looked into the complaint. She agreed with the union.  But the Appeals Officer at the Occupational Health and Safety Tribunal agreed  with Canada Post. He said the committee only had to inspect parts of the  workplace Canada Post controlled. This meant the depot itself. It didn\u2019t  include mail routes or places mail got delivered. The  union asked for \u201cjudicial review.\u201d (Judicial review is where a court looks at a  decision by someone acting on behalf of the government.) The Federal Court let  the Appeals Officer\u2019s decision stand. But the Federal Court of Appeal said the  Appeals Officer made mistakes. It said the Health and Safety Officer\u2019s decision  should stand. This meant Canada Post had to inspect all the routes and places  mail was delivered. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the Appeals Officer\u2019s decision should  stand. This meant the committee didn\u2019t have to inspect the mail routes and  places where mail was dropped off every year. The  majority said it was open to the Appeals Officer to make the decision he did. He  had looked very closely at the wording, purpose, and context of the specific  section of the Code dealing with inspections. He understood what the practical  effects of his decision would be. He decided that some parts of the Code applied  in general, to all places where workers had to be during the workday. But some  parts applied only to places that the employer controlled. The section about  inspections was one of these. That meant only places that Canada Post actually  controlled had to be inspected every year.  Under  the Code, Canada Post had to do what it could, in general, to keep workers  safe. Workers could report issues on routes or at places they went to deliver  mail. Laws like the Code should usually be interpreted broadly to help workers.  But broad interpretations only help if they make sense. The purpose of the  inspections was to find and fix dangers. Canada Post didn\u2019t control the mail  routes or most of the places mail was delivered. Many of them were on private  property. If there was a danger, Canada Post didn\u2019t have the power to fix or  change it. Inspecting the routes and delivery places each year wouldn\u2019t make  workers safer.  Courts have a role  in looking at administrative decisions like the Appeals Officer\u2019s. This is  called \u201cjudicial review\u201d. When doing judicial review, courts use a \u201c<a href=\"37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx\">standard  of review</a>\u201d to decide if the original decision should stand. Between  the time of the hearing and the decision for this case, the Supreme Court  changed how courts look at administrative decisions. In this case, the Court  applied the same standard of review (\u201creasonableness\u201d) under the new rules as  the lower courts applied under the old ones."

At the time of his birth, his parents were posing as Canadians under assumed names. In reality, they were foreign nationals working on assignment for the Russian foreign intelligence service. V did not know that his parents were not who they claimed to be. He believed that he was a Canadian citizen by birth, he lived and identified as a Canadian, and he held a Canadian passport. In 2010, V\u2019s parents were arrested in the United States and charged with espionage. They pled guilty and were returned to Russia. Following their arrest, V\u2019s attempts to renew his Canadian passport proved unsuccessful. However, in 2013, he was issued a certificate of Canadian citizenship.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Then, in 2014, the Canadian Registrar of Citizenship cancelled V\u2019s certificate on the basis of her interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act. This provision exempts children of \u201ca diplomatic or consular officer or other representative or employee in Canada of a foreign government\u201d from the general rule that individuals born in Canada acquire Canadian citizenship by birth. The Registrar concluded that because V\u2019s parents were employees or representatives of Russia at the time of V\u2019s birth, the exception to the rule of citizenship by birth in s.\u00a03(2)(a), as she interpreted it, applied to V, who therefore was not, and had never been, entitled to citizenship. V\u2019s application for judicial review of the Registrar\u2019s decision was dismissed by the Federal Court. The Court of Appeal allowed V\u2019s appeal and quashed the Registrar\u2019s decision because it was unreasonable.

It was not reasonable for the Registrar to interpret s.\u00a03(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act as applying to children of individuals who have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities at the time of the children\u2019s birth.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 More generally, this appeal and its companion cases (Bell Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 845) provide an opportunity to consider and clarify the law applicable to the judicial review of administrative decisions as addressed in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, and subsequent cases. The submissions presented to the Court have highlighted two aspects of the current framework which need clarification. The first aspect is the analysis for determining the standard of review. The second aspect is the need for better guidance from this Court on the proper application of the reasonableness standard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It has become clear that Dunsmuir\u2019s promise of simplicity and predictability has not been fully realized. Certain aspects of the current standard of review framework are unclear and unduly complex. The former contextual analysis has proven to be unwieldy and offers limited practical guidance for courts attempting to determine the standard of review. The practical effect is that courts struggle in conducting the analysis, and debates surrounding the appropriate standard and its application continue to overshadow the review on the merits, thereby undermining access to justice. A reconsideration of the Court\u2019s approach is therefore necessary in order to bring greater coherence and predictability to this area of law. A revised framework to determine the standard of review where a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision is needed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In setting out a revised framework, this decision departs from the Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence on standard of review in certain respects. Any reconsideration of past precedents can be justified only by compelling circumstances and requires carefully weighing the impact on legal certainty and predictability against the costs of continuing to follow a flawed approach. Although adhering to the established jurisprudence will generally promote certainty and predictability, in some instances doing so will create or perpetuate uncertainty. In such circumstances, following a prior decision would be contrary to the underlying values of clarity and certainty in the law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The revised standard of review analysis begins with a presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard in all cases. Where a legislature has created an administrative decision maker for the specific purpose of administering a statutory scheme, it must be presumed that the legislature also intended that decision maker to fulfill its mandate and interpret the law applicable to all issues that come before it. Where a legislature has not explicitly provided that a court is to have a more involved role in reviewing the decisions of that decision maker, it can safely be assumed that the legislature intended a minimum of judicial interference. Respect for these institutional design choices requires a reviewing court to adopt a posture of restraint. Thus, whenever a court reviews an administrative decision, it should start with the presumption that the applicable standard of review for all aspects of that decision will be reasonableness. As a result, it is no longer necessary for courts to engage in a contextual inquiry in order to identify the appropriate standard. Conclusively closing the door on the application of a contextual analysis to determine the applicable standard streamlines and simplifies the standard of review framework. As well, with the presumptive application of the reasonableness standard, the relative expertise of administrative decision makers is no longer relevant to a determination of the standard of review. It is simply folded into the new starting point. Relative expertise remains, however, a relevant consideration in conducting reasonableness review.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The presumption of reasonableness review can be rebutted in two types of situations. The first is where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard to apply. This will be the case where it has explicitly prescribed the applicable standard of review. Any framework rooted in legislative intent must respect clear statutory language. The legislature may also direct that derogation from the presumption is appropriate by providing for a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision to a court, thereby signalling the legislature\u2019s intent that appellate standards apply when a court reviews the decision. Where a legislature has provided a statutory appeal mechanism, it has subjected the administrative regime to appellate oversight and it expects the court to scrutinize such administrative decisions on an appellate basis. The applicable standard is therefore to be determined with reference to the nature of the question and to the jurisprudence on appellate standards of review. Where, for example, a court hears an appeal from an administrative decision, it would apply the standard of correctness to questions of law, including on statutory interpretation and the scope of a decision maker\u2019s authority. Where the scope of the statutory appeal includes questions of fact or questions of mixed fact and law, the standard is palpable and overriding error for such questions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving effect to statutory appeal mechanisms in this way departs from the Court\u2019s recent jurisprudence. This shift is necessary in order to bring coherence and conceptual balance to the standard of review analysis and is justified by weighing the values of certainty and correctness. First, there has been significant and valid judicial and academic criticism of the Court\u2019s recent approach to statutory appeal rights and of the inconsistency inherent in a standard of review framework based on legislative intent that otherwise declines to give meaning to an express statutory right of appeal. Second, there is no satisfactory justification for the recent trend in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence to give no effect to statutory rights of appeal in the standard of review analysis, absent exceptional wording. More generally, there is no convincing reason to presume that legislatures mean something entirely different when they use the word \u201cappeal\u201d in an administrative law statute. Accepting that the legislature intends an appellate standard of review to be applied also helps to explain why many statutes provide for both appeal and judicial review mechanisms, thereby indicating two roles for reviewing courts. Finally, because the presumption of reasonableness review is no longer premised upon notions of relative expertise and is now based on respect for the legislature\u2019s institutional design choice, departing from the presumption of reasonableness review in the context of a statutory appeal respects this legislative choice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second situation in which the presumption of reasonableness review will be rebutted is where the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied. This will be the case for certain categories of legal questions, namely constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies. First, questions regarding the division of powers between Parliament and the provinces, the relationship between the legislature and the other branches of the state, the scope of Aboriginal and treaty rights under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and other constitutional matters require a final and determinate answer from the courts. Second, the rule of law requires courts to have the final word with regard to general questions of law that are of central importance to the legal system as a whole because they require uniform and consistent answers. Third, the rule of law requires courts to intervene where one administrative body has interpreted the scope of its authority in a manner that is incompatible with the jurisdiction of another since the rule of law cannot tolerate conflicting orders and proceedings where they result in a true operational conflict between two administrative bodies. The application of the correctness standard for such questions therefore respects the unique role of the judiciary in interpreting the Constitution and ensures that courts are able to provide the last word on questions for which the rule of law requires consistency and for which a final and determinate answer is necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The general rule of reasonableness review, when coupled with these limited exceptions, offers a comprehensive approach to determining the applicable standard of review. The possibility that another category could be recognized as requiring a derogation from the presumption of reasonableness review in a future case is not definitively foreclosed. However, any new basis for correctness review would be exceptional and would need to be consistent with this framework and the overarching principles set out in this decision. Any new correctness category based on legislative intent would require a signal of legislative intent as strong and compelling as a legislated standard of review or a statutory appeal mechanism. Similarly, a new correctness category based on the rule of law would be justified only where failure to apply correctness review would undermine the rule of law and jeopardize the proper functioning of the justice system in a manner analogous to the three situations described in this decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For example, the Court is not persuaded that it should recognize a distinct correctness category for legal questions on which there is persistent discord within an administrative body. A lack of unanimity within an administrative tribunal is the price to pay for decision\u2011making freedom and independence. While discord can lead to legal incoherence, a more robust form of reasonableness review is capable of guarding against such threats to the rule of law. As well, jurisdictional questions should no longer be recognized as a distinct category subject to correctness review; there are no clear markers to distinguish such questions from other questions related to interpreting an administrative decision maker\u2019s enabling statute. A proper application of the reasonableness standard will enable courts to ensure that administrative bodies have acted within the scope of their lawful authority without having to conduct a preliminary assessment on jurisdictional issues and without having to apply the correctness standard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Going forward, a court seeking to determine what standard of review is appropriate should look to this decision first in order to determine how the general framework applies. Doing so may require the court to resolve subsidiary questions on which past precedents will often continue to provide helpful guidance and will continue to apply essentially without modification, such as cases concerning general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or those relating to jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies. On other issues, such as the effect of statutory appeal mechanisms, true questions of jurisdiction or the former contextual analysis, certain cases will necessarily have less precedential force.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is also a need for better guidance from the Court on the proper application of the reasonableness standard, what that standard entails and how it should be applied in practice. Reasonableness review is meant to ensure that courts intervene in administrative matters only where it is truly necessary to do so in order to safeguard the legality, rationality and fairness of the administrative process. Its starting point lies in the principle of judicial restraint and in demonstrating respect for the distinct role of administrative decision makers. However, it is not a \u201crubber\u2011stamping\u201d process or a means of sheltering decision makers from accountability. While courts must recognize the legitimacy and authority of administrative decision makers and adopt a posture of respect, administrative decision makers must adopt a culture of justification and demonstrate that their exercise of delegated public power can be justified. In conducting reasonableness review, a court must consider the outcome of the administrative decision in light of its underlying rationale, to ensure that the decision as a whole is transparent, intelligible and justified. Judicial review is concerned with both the outcome of the decision and the reasoning process that led to that outcome. To accept otherwise would undermine, rather than demonstrate respect toward, the institutional role of the administrative decision maker.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Reasonableness review is methodologically distinct from correctness review. The court conducting a reasonableness review must focus on the decision the administrative decision maker actually made, including the justification offered for it. A court applying the reasonableness standard does not ask what decision it would have made in place of the administrative decision maker, attempt to ascertain the range of possible conclusions, conduct a new analysis or seek to determine the correct solution to the problem. Instead, the reviewing court must consider only whether the decision made by the decision maker, including both the rationale for the decision and the outcome to which it led, was unreasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In cases where reasons are required, they are the starting point for reasonableness review, as they are the primary mechanism by which decision makers show that their decisions are reasonable. Reasons are the means by which the decision maker communicates the rationale for its decision: they explain how and why a decision was made, help to show affected parties that their arguments have been considered and that the decision was made in a fair and lawful manner, and shield against arbitrariness. A principled approach to reasonableness review is therefore one which puts those reasons first. This enables a reviewing court to assess whether the decision as a whole is reasonable. Attention to the decision maker\u2019s reasons is part of how courts demonstrate respect for the decision\u2011making process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In many cases, formal reasons for a decision will not be given or required. Even without reasons, it is possible for the record and the context to reveal that a decision was made on the basis of an improper motive or for another impermissible reason. There will nonetheless be situations in which neither the record nor the larger context sheds light on the basis for the decision. In such cases, the reviewing court must still examine the decision in light of the relevant factual and legal constraints on the decision maker in order to determine whether the decision is reasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is conceptually useful to consider two types of fundamental flaws that tend to render a decision unreasonable. The first is a failure of rationality internal to the reasoning process. To be reasonable, a decision must be based on an internally coherent reasoning that is both rational and logical. A failure in this respect may lead a reviewing court to conclude that a decision must be set aside. Reasonableness review is not a line\u2011by\u2011line treasure hunt for error. However, the reviewing court must be able to trace the decision maker\u2019s reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws in its overarching logic. Because formal reasons should be read in light of the record and with due sensitivity to the administrative regime in which they were given, a decision will be unreasonable if the reasons for it, read holistically, fail to reveal a rational chain of analysis or if they reveal that the decision was based on an irrational chain of analysis. A decision will also be unreasonable where the conclusion reached cannot follow from the analysis undertaken or if the reasons read in conjunction with the record do not make it possible to understand the decision maker\u2019s reasoning on a critical point. Similarly, the internal rationality of a decision may be called into question if the reasons exhibit clear logical fallacies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second type of fundamental flaw arises when a decision is in some respect untenable in light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it. Although reasonableness is a single standard that already accounts for context, and elements of a decision\u2019s context should not modulate the standard or the degree of scrutiny by the reviewing court, what is reasonable in a given situation will always depend on the constraints imposed by the legal and factual context of the particular decision under review. These contextual constraints dictate the limits and contours of the space in which the decision maker may act and the types of solutions it may adopt. The governing statutory scheme, other relevant statutory or common law, the principles of statutory interpretation, the evidence before the decision maker and facts of which the decision maker may take notice, the submissions of the parties, the past practices and decisions of the administrative body, and the potential impact of the decision on the individual to whom it applies, are all elements that will generally be relevant in evaluating whether a given decision is reasonable. Such elements are not a checklist; they may vary in significance depending on the context and will necessarily interact with one another.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Accordingly, a reviewing court may find that a decision is unreasonable when examined against these contextual considerations. Because administrative decision makers receive their powers by statute, the governing statutory scheme is likely to be the most salient aspect of the legal context relevant to a particular decision. A proper application of the reasonableness standard is capable of allaying the concern that an administrative decision maker might interpret the scope of its own authority beyond what the legislature intended. Whether an interpretation is justified will depend on the context, including the language chosen by the legislature in describing the limits and contours of the decision maker\u2019s authority.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Both statutory and common law will also impose constraints on how and what an administrative decision maker can lawfully decide. Any precedents on the issue before the administrative decision maker or on a similar issue, as well as international law in some administrative decision making contexts, will act as a constraint on what the decision maker can reasonably decide. Whether an administrative decision maker has acted reasonably in adapting a legal or equitable doctrine involves a highly context\u2011specific determination.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Matters of statutory interpretation are not treated uniquely and, as with other questions of law, may be evaluated on a reasonableness standard. Where this is the applicable standard, the reviewing court does not undertake a de novo analysis of the question or ask itself what the correct decision would have been. But an approach to reasonableness review that respects legislative intent must assume that those who interpret the law, whether courts or administrative decision makers, will do so in a manner consistent with the modern principle of statutory interpretation. Administrative decision makers are not required to engage in a formalistic statutory interpretation exercise in every case. But whatever form the interpretive exercise takes, the merits of an administrative decision maker\u2019s interpretation of a statutory provision must be consistent with the text, context and purpose of the provision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the decision maker must take the evidentiary record and the general factual matrix that bears on its decision into account, and its decision must be reasonable in light of them. The reasonableness of a decision may be jeopardized where the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it. The reasons must also meaningfully account for the central issues and concerns raised by the parties, even though reviewing courts cannot expect administrative decision makers to respond to every argument or line of possible analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While administrative decision makers are not bound by their previous decisions, they must be concerned with the general consistency of administrative decisions. Therefore, whether a particular decision is consistent with the administrative body\u2019s past decisions is also a constraint that the reviewing court should consider when determining whether an administrative decision is reasonable. Finally, individuals are entitled to greater procedural protection when the decision in question involves the potential for significant personal impact or harm. Where the impact of a decision on an individual\u2019s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes. The principle of responsive justification means that if a decision has particularly harsh consequences for the affected individual, the decision maker must explain why its decision best reflects the legislature\u2019s intention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The question of the appropriate remedy \u2014 specifically, whether a court that quashes an unreasonable decision should exercise its discretion to remit the matter to the decision maker for reconsideration with the benefit of the court\u2019s reasons \u2014 is multi\u2011faceted. The choice of remedy must be guided by the rationale for applying the reasonableness standard to begin with, including the recognition by the reviewing court that the legislature has entrusted the matter to the administrative decision maker, and not to the court, concerns related to the proper administration of the justice system, the need to ensure access to justice and the goal of expedient and cost\u2011efficient decision making. Giving effect to these principles in the remedial context means that where a decision reviewed by applying the reasonableness standard cannot be upheld, it will most often be appropriate to remit the matter to the decision maker for reconsideration with the benefit of the court\u2019s reasons. However, there are limited scenarios in which remitting the matter would stymie the timely and effective resolution of matters in a manner that no legislature could have intended. An intention that the administrative decision maker decide the matter at first instance cannot give rise to endless judicial reviews and subsequent reconsiderations. Declining to remit a matter to the decision maker may be appropriate where it becomes evident that a particular outcome is inevitable and that remitting the case would therefore serve no useful purpose. Elements like concern for delay, fairness to the parties, urgency of providing a resolution to the dispute, the nature of the particular regulatory regime, whether the administrative decision maker had a genuine opportunity to weigh in on the issue in question, costs to the parties, and efficient use of public resources may also influence the exercise of a court\u2019s discretion to remit the matter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, there is no basis for departing from the presumption of reasonableness review. The Registrar\u2019s decision has come before the courts by way of judicial review, not by way of a statutory appeal. Given that Parliament has not prescribed the standard to be applied, there is no indication that the legislature intended a standard of review other than reasonableness. The Registrar\u2019s decision does not give rise to any constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies. As a result, the standard to be applied in reviewing the Registrar\u2019s decision is reasonableness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Registrar\u2019s decision was unreasonable. She failed to justify her interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a) in light of the constraints imposed by s.\u00a03 considered as a whole, by international treaties that inform its purpose, by the jurisprudence on the interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a), and by the potential consequences of her interpretation. Each of these elements \u2014 viewed individually and cumulatively \u2014 strongly supports the conclusion that s.\u00a03(2)(a) was not intended to apply to children of foreign government representatives or employees who have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities. Though V had raised many of these considerations, the Registrar failed to address those submissions in her reasons and did not do more than conduct a cursory review of the legislative history of s.\u00a03(2)(a) and conclude that her interpretation was not explicitly precluded by its text.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, the Registrar failed to address the immediate statutory context of s.\u00a03(2)(a), which provides clear support for the conclusion that all of the persons contemplated by s.\u00a03(2)(a) must have been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities in some form for the exception to apply. Second, the Registrar disregarded compelling submissions that s.\u00a03(2) is a narrow exception consistent with established principles of international law and with the leading international treaties that extend diplomatic privileges and immunities to employees and representatives of foreign governments. Third, it was a significant omission to ignore the relevant cases that were before the Registrar which suggest that s.\u00a03(2)(a) was intended to apply only to those individuals whose parents have been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities. Finally, there is no evidence that the Registrar considered the potential consequences of expanding her interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a) to include all individuals who have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities. Rules concerning citizenship require a high degree of interpretive consistency in order to shield against arbitrariness. The Registrar\u2019s interpretation cannot be limited to the children of spies \u2014 its logic would be equally applicable to other scenarios. As well, provisions such as s.\u00a03(2)(a) must be given a narrow interpretation because they potentially take away rights which otherwise benefit from a liberal and broad interpretation. Yet there is no indication that the Registrar considered the potential harsh consequences of her interpretation, or whether, in light of those potential consequences, Parliament would have intended s.\u00a03(2)(a) to apply in this manner. Although the Registrar knew her interpretation was novel, she failed to provide a rationale for her expanded interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was therefore unreasonable for the Registrar to find that s.\u00a03(2)(a) can apply to individuals whose parents have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities in Canada. It is undisputed that V\u2019s parents had not been granted such privileges and immunities. No purpose would therefore be served by remitting this matter to the Registrar. Given that V was born in Canada, his status is governed only by the general rule of citizenship by birth. He is a Canadian citizen.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ.: There is agreement with the majority that the appeal should be dismissed. The Registrar\u2019s decision to cancel V\u2019s citizenship certificate was unreasonable and was properly quashed by the Court of Appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is also agreement with the majority that there should be a presumption of reasonableness in judicial review. The contextual factors analysis should be eliminated from the standard of review framework, and \u201ctrue questions of jurisdiction\u201d should be abolished as a separate category of issues subject to correctness review. However, the elimination of these elements does not support the foundational changes to judicial review outlined in the majority\u2019s framework that result in expanded correctness review. Rather than confirming a meaningful presumption of deference for administrative decision-makers, the majority strips away deference from hundreds of administrative actors, based on a formalistic approach that ignores the legislature\u2019s intention to leave certain legal and policy questions to administrative decision-makers. The majority\u2019s presumption of reasonableness review rests on a totally new understanding of legislative intent and the rule of law and prohibits any consideration of well\u2011established foundations for deference. By dramatically expanding the circumstances in which generalist judges will be entitled to substitute their own views for those of specialized decision-makers who apply their mandates on a daily basis, the majority\u2019s framework fundamentally reorients the relationship between administrative actors and the judiciary, thus advocating a profoundly different philosophy of administrative law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s framework rests on a flawed and incomplete conceptual account of judicial review, one that unjustifiably ignores the specialized expertise of administrative decision-makers and reads out the foundations of the modern understanding of legislative intent. Instead of understanding legislative intent as being the intention to leave legal questions within their mandate to specialized decision-makers with expertise, the majority removes expertise from the equation entirely. In so doing, the majority disregards the historically accepted reason why the legislature intended to delegate authority to an administrative actor. In particular, such an approach ignores the possibility that specialization and expertise are embedded into this legislative choice. Post\u2011Dunsmuir, the Court has been steadfast in confirming the central role of specialization and expertise, affirming their connection to legislative intent, and recognizing that they give administrative decision-makers the interpretative upper hand on questions of law. Specialized expertise has become the core rationale for deference. Giving proper effect to the legislature\u2019s choice to delegate authority to an administrative decision-maker requires understanding the advantages that the decision-maker may enjoy in exercising its mandate. Chief among those advantages are the institutional expertise and specialization inherent to administering a particular mandate on a daily basis. In interpreting their enabling statutes, administrative actors may have a particularly astute appreciation for the on\u2011the\u2011ground consequences of particular legal interpretations, of statutory context, of the purposes that a provision or legislative scheme are meant to serve, and of specialized terminology. The advantages stemming from specialization and expertise provide a robust foundation for deference. The majority\u2019s approach accords no weight to such institutional advantages and banishes expertise from the standard of review analysis entirely. The removal of the current conceptual basis for deference opens the gates to expanded correctness review.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the majority\u2019s framework, deference gives way whenever the rule of law demands it. This approach, however, flows from a court\u2011centric conception of the rule of law. The rule of law means that administrative decision-makers make legal determinations within their mandate; it does not mean that only judges decide questions of law with an unrestricted license to substitute their opinions for those of administrative actors through correctness review. The majority\u2019s approach not only erodes the presumption of deference; it erodes confidence in the fact that law\u2011making and legal interpretation are shared enterprises between courts and administrative decision-makers. Moreover, access to justice is at the heart of the legislative choice to establish a robust system of administrative law. This goal is compromised when a narrow conception of the rule of law is invoked to impose judicial hegemony over administrative decision-makers, which adds unnecessary expense and complexity. Authorizing more incursions into the administrative system by judges and permitting de novo review of every legal decision adds to the delay and cost of obtaining a final decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s reformulation of \u201clegislative intent\u201d invites courts to apply an irrebuttable presumption of correctness review whenever an administrative scheme includes a right of appeal. Elevating appeal clauses to indicators of correctness review creates a two\u2011tier system that defers to the expertise of administrative decision-makers only where there is no appeal clause. Yet appeal rights do not represent a different institutional structure that requires a more searching form of review. The mere fact that a statute contemplates an appeal says nothing about the degree of deference required in the review process. The majority\u2019s position hinges almost entirely on a textualist argument \u2014 i.e., that the presence of the word \u201cappeal\u201d indicates a legislative intent that courts apply the same standards of review found in civil appellate jurisprudence. This disregards long\u2011accepted institutional distinctions between courts and administrative decision-makers. The continued use by legislatures of the term \u201cappeal\u201d cannot be imbued with the intent that the majority ascribes to it. The idea that appellate standards of review must be applied to every right of appeal is entirely unsupported by the jurisprudence. For at least 25 years, the Court has not treated statutory rights of appeal as a determinative reflection of legislative intent, and such clauses have played little or no role in the standard of review analysis. Moreover, pre\u2011Dunsmuir, statutory rights of appeal were still seen as only one factor and not as unequivocal indicators of correctness review. Absent exceptional circumstances, a statutory right of appeal does not displace the presumption of reasonableness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s disregard for precedent and stare decisis has the potential to undermine both the integrity of the Court\u2019s decisions, and public confidence in the stability of the law. Stare decisis places significant limits on the Court\u2019s ability to overturn its precedents. The doctrine promotes the predictable and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the integrity of the judicial process. Respect for precedent also safeguards the Court\u2019s institutional legitimacy. The precedential value of a judgment does not expire with the tenure of the panel of judges that decided it. When the Court does choose to overrule its own precedents, it should do so carefully, with moderation, and with due regard for all the important considerations that undergird the doctrine of stare decisis. A nuanced balance must be struck between maintaining the stability of the common law and ensuring that the law is flexible and responsive enough to adapt to new circumstances and societal norms. Stare decisis plays a critical role in maintaining that balance and upholding the rule of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is no principled justification for departing from the existing jurisprudence and abandoning the Court\u2019s long\u2011standing view of how statutory appeal clauses impact the standard of review analysis. In doing so, the majority disregards the high threshold required to overturn the Court\u2019s decisions. The unprecedented wholesale rejection of an entire body of jurisprudence is particularly unsettling. The affected cases are numerous and include many decisions conducting deferential review even in the face of a statutory right of appeal and bedrock judgments affirming the relevance of administrative expertise to the standard of review analysis. Overruling these judgments flouts stare decisis, which prohibits courts from overturning past decisions that simply represent a choice with which the current bench does not agree. The majority\u2019s approach also has the potential to disturb settled interpretations of many statutes that contain a right of appeal; every existing interpretation of such statutes that has been affirmed under a reasonableness standard will be open to fresh challenge. Moreover, if the Court, in its past decisions, misconstrued the purpose of statutory appeal clauses, legislatures were free to clarify this interpretation through legislative amendment. In the absence of legislative correction, the case for overturning decisions is even less compelling.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court should offer additional direction on reasonableness review so that judges can provide careful and meaningful oversight of the administrative justice system while respecting its legitimacy and the perspectives of its front\u2011line, specialized decision-makers. However, rather than clarifying the role of reasons and how to review them, the majority revives the kind of search for errors that dominated the Court\u2019s prior jurisprudence. The majority\u2019s multi\u2011factored, open\u2011ended list of constraints on administrative decision making will encourage reviewing courts to dissect administrative reasons in a line\u2011by\u2011line hunt for error. These constraints may function in practice as a wide\u2011ranging catalogue of hypothetical errors to justify quashing an administrative decision. Structuring reasonableness review in this fashion effectively imposes on administrative decision-makers a higher standard of justification than on trial judges. Such an approach undercuts deference. Reasonableness review should instead focus on the concept of deference to administrative decision-makers and to the legislative intention to confide in them a mandate. Curial deference is the hallmark of reasonableness review, setting it apart from the substitution of opinion permitted under correctness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Deference imposes three requirements on courts conducting reasonableness review. First, deference is the attitude a reviewing court must adopt towards an administrative decision-maker. Deference mandates respect for the legislative choice to entrust a decision to administrative actors rather than to the courts, for the important role that administrative decision-makers play, and for their specialized expertise and the institutional setting in which they operate. Reviewing courts must pay respectful attention to the reasons offered for an administrative decision, make a genuine effort to understand why the decision was made, and give the decision a fair and generous construction. Second, deference affects how a court frames the question it must answer and the nature of its analysis. A reviewing court does not ask how it would have resolved an issue, but rather whether the answer provided by the decision-maker was unreasonable. Ultimately, whether an administrative decision is reasonable depends on the context, and a reviewing court must be attentive to all relevant circumstances, including the reasons offered to support the decision, the record, the statutory scheme and the particular issues raised, among other factors. Third, deferential review impacts how a reviewing court evaluates challenges to a decision. The party seeking judicial review bears the onus of showing that the decision was unreasonable; the decision-maker does not have to persuade the court that its decision is reasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The administrative decision itself is the focal point of the review exercise. In all cases, the question remains whether the challenging party has demonstrated that a decision is unreasonable. Where reasons are neither required nor available, reasonableness may be justified by past decisions of the administrative body or in light of the procedural context. Where reasons are provided, they serve as the natural starting point to determine whether the decision-maker acted reasonably. By beginning with the reasons, read in light of the surrounding context and the grounds raised, reviewing courts provide meaningful oversight while respecting the legitimacy of specialized administrative decision making. Reviewing courts should approach the reasons with respect for the specialized decision-makers, their significant role and the institutional context chosen by the legislator. Reviewing courts should not second\u2011guess operational implications, practical challenges and on\u2011the\u2011ground knowledge and must remain alert to specialized concepts or language. Further, a reviewing court is not restricted to the four corners of the written reasons and should, if faced with a gap in the reasons, look to other materials to see if they shed light on the decision, including: the record of any formal proceedings and the materials before the decision-maker, past decisions of the administrative body, and policies or guidelines developed to guide the type of decision under review. These materials may assist a court in understanding the outcome. In these ways, reviewing courts may legitimately supplement written reasons without supplanting the analysis. Reasons must be read together with the outcome to determine whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes. This approach puts substance over form where the basis for a decision is evident on the record, but not clearly expressed in written reasons.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As well, a court conducting deferential review must view claims of error in context and with caution, cognizant of the need to avoid substituting its opinion for that of those empowered and better equipped to answer the questions at issue. Because judicial substitution is incompatible with deference, reviewing courts must carefully evaluate the challenges raised to ensure they go to the reasonableness of the decision rather than representing a mere difference of opinion. Courts must also consider the materiality of any alleged errors. An error that is peripheral to the reasoning process is not sufficient to justify quashing a decision. The same deferential approach must apply with equal force to statutory interpretation cases. In such cases, a court should not assess the decision by determining what, in its own view, would be a reasonable interpretation. Such an approach imperils deference. A de novo interpretation of a statute necessarily omits the perspective of the front\u2011line, specialized administrative body that routinely applies the statutory scheme in question. By placing that perspective at the heart of the judicial review inquiry, courts display respect for specialization and expertise, and for the legislative choice to delegate certain questions to non\u2011judicial bodies. Conversely, by imposing their own interpretation of a statute, courts undermine legislative intent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, there is agreement with the majority that the standard of review is reasonableness. The Registrar\u2019s reasons failed to respond to V\u2019s submission that the objectives of s.\u00a03(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act require its terms to be read narrowly. Instead, the Registrar interpreted s.\u00a03(2)(a) broadly, based on a purely textual assessment. This reading was only reasonable if the text is read in isolation from its objective. Nothing in the history of this provision indicates that Parliament intended to widen its scope. Furthermore, the judicial treatment of this provision also points to the need for a narrow interpretation. In addition, the text of s.\u00a03(2)(c) can be seen as undermining the Registrar\u2019s interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a), because the former denies citizenship to children born to individuals who enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities equivalent to those granted to persons referred to in the latter. This suggests that s.\u00a03(2)(a) covers only those employees in Canada of a foreign government who have such privileges and immunities, in contrast with V\u2019s parents. By ignoring the objectives of s.\u00a03 as a whole, the Registrar\u2019s decision was unreasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: Baker v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court has changed how courts look at administrative  (non-court) decisions, to make the law clearer and more predictable.</strong>\r\n   Decisions made by governments, or those acting on their  behalf, are called \u201cadministrative decisions.\u201d They are part of \u201cadministrative  law.\u201d Most legal decisions that affect people are administrative decisions, not  court ones. An administrative decision can be anything from a  letter from a benefits agency, to a town by-law, to a decision by a tribunal. Administrative  decision-makers often aren\u2019t judges or lawyers. Their decisions usually don\u2019t  look like court decisions. But judges and courts have a role. Under the  Constitution, courts can make sure administrative decision-makers follow the  rules. They do this through a process called \u201cjudicial review.\u201d  When a court looks at an administrative decision, it  applies a certain \u201cstandard of review.\u201d The standard of review is the legal  approach to analyzing the decision. Which standard applies depends on what kind  of decision it is. But there was a lot of debate about which standard of review  applied in which situation. There was also debate about how each standard  should be applied. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court confirmed there are two standards of  review when a court looks at administrative decisions. These are \u201creasonableness\u201d  and \u201ccorrectness.\u201d\u201cReasonableness\u201d and \u201ccorrectness\u201d may sound like  normal everyday words. But they have special meanings in law. A \u201creasonable\u201d  decision is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It has to <em>make sense</em> in light of the law and the  facts. A  \u201ccorrect\u201d decision is the <em>only right  answer</em> in light of the law and the facts.  The  majority set out a new way for courts to decide whether they need to ask if a  decision is \u201creasonable,\u201d or whether it needs to ask if it is \u201ccorrect.\u201d It  also gave courts guidance for looking at \u201creasonableness.\u201d\r\n     The majority said that the default (usual) standard of  review should be \u201creasonableness.\u201d This means a court has to look at whether  the decision is \u201creasonable.\u201d There can be more than one \u201creasonable\u201d outcome.  Courts have to accept any decision that\u2019s \u201creasonable.\u201d They have to accept it even  if they would have decided something different themselves. If a decision isn\u2019t  \u201creasonable,\u201d a court should normally send it back to the decision-maker for  another look. The decision-maker may come to the same result, or something  different. Rarely, a court may just decide to replace the decision-maker\u2019s  outcome with its own. The majority said there are some cases where  decision-makers don\u2019t have to give reasons. But people need to understand the  decisions that apply to them. So it\u2019s usually important for decision-makers to  explain why they made the decision they did.  The majority said there are two exceptions where the  standard won\u2019t be \u201creasonableness.\u201d The first exception is where lawmakers specifically  say something different. There are two ways they can do this. The first is by  saying in a law which standard applies. The second is giving a right of appeal  to a court. An appeal is different than judicial review, so different standards  apply. These are called \u201cappellate\u201d standards. They are the same standards  courts use to decide appeals from lower court decisions. An \u201cappellate\u201d  standard ends up being a \u201ccorrectness\u201d standard if a decision is about the law  or the decision-maker\u2019s power to decide the question. The second exception where the standard won\u2019t be  \u201creasonableness\u201d is for the rule of law. The rule of law is the principle that  everyone should follow the same basic legal rules in society. This includes  constitutional questions. It includes general questions of law that affect the  legal system as a whole. It also includes cases where powers of two  administrative bodies overlap. For all of these, courts have to ask whether the  decision is \u201ccorrect.\u201d There can only be one \u201ccorrect\u201d decision. If a decision  isn\u2019t \u201ccorrect,\u201d the court will always change it without sending it back to the  decision-maker. The Supreme Court creates \"precedents\" that other  courts have to follow. It is the only court that can overturn these precedents. But this is rare. In most cases, the Court interprets laws or decides what  to do when something isn\u2019t clear. In this case, the Court overturned (changed) some  of its past precedents. Precedents are important because they make the law  certain and predictable. But some of the precedents on standard of review  weren\u2019t doing that. The majority overturned those precedents to make the law  clearer and more predictable."

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0decision to allow US Super Bowl ads to be shown in  Canada went beyond the CRTC\u2019s power, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     The Canadian  Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission is a federal body. It makes  rules about TV, phone service, and internet on behalf of the government. Some  of the rules deal with \u201csimultaneous substitution\u201d of TV broadcasts. \u201cSimultaneous  substitution\u201d means replacing one station\u2019s broadcast with another\u2019s at the  same time. If a Canadian TV station has the exclusive right to a program in  Canada, under \u201csimultaneous substitution\u201d rules, it can make other stations use  its version. This includes the commercials. Cable and satellite companies have  to use this version on all their channels showing the program. The rules are  meant to give Canadian TV stations a bigger audience. This way, they can make  more money selling advertising. \u201cSimultaneous substitution\u201d isn\u2019t allowed where  it\u2019s not in the public interest. The Super Bowl has  been shown on Canadian TV for over 40 years. Part of the experience has been  the commercials. But, because of \u201csimultaneous substitution,\u201d viewers in Canada  have always seen different commercials than viewers in the United States.  The public told the  CRTC that it wanted to see the US Super Bowl commercials. So the CRTC decided  that \u201csimultaneous substitution\u201d wouldn\u2019t be allowed for the Super Bowl  anymore. In 2015, it made a \u201cpolicy statement\u201d saying this. It made the official  decision in a \u201cFinal Order\u201d in 2016. The Final Order said the change would happen  in 2017. Bell Media bought  the exclusive rights to show the Super Bowl on its CTV stations until 2019.  Bell and the National Football League (which owned the copyright for the Super  Bowl) disagreed with the CRTC\u2019s decision. They said it didn\u2019t have the power to  make it. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the CRTC, saying its decision  was \u201creasonable.\u201d  But the majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the Federal Court  of Appeal took the wrong approach. There are specific ways courts have to look  at decisions made on behalf of the government by bodies like the CRTC. For some  decisions, courts \u201creview\u201d the decision. But in this case, the law said the  parties had the right to \u201cappeal.\u201d That meant the court had to treat the CRTC\u2019s  decision the same way it would treat a court decision. It had to look at  whether the decision was \u201ccorrect\u201d in light of the law. (To better understand what  \u201creasonable\u201d and \u201ccorrect\u201d mean here, read the <a href=\"37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx\">\u201cCase  Law in Brief\u201d on the Standard of Review</a>.) The majority agreed with Bell and the NFL. They said the CRTC didn\u2019t  have the power to make the decision. The decision was made under a specific  section of the <em>Broadcasting Act</em>. The  majority read the words of that section in their entire context. It looked at  its wording and grammar, the purpose of the Act, and what Parliament intended  when it passed it. It said that section only gave the CRTC power to order cable  and satellite companies to carry specific <em>channels</em>.  As part of that power, it could create terms and conditions the companies had  to follow. Part of the reason for the section was to support Canadian content  that cable and satellite companies might not consider profitable.  In this case, the CRTC was saying cable and satellite companies carrying  US stations had to broadcast the US version of the Super Bowl, including the  commercials. This was beyond the powers the CRTC had under that section of the  Act. Going beyond its powers made the decision not \u201ccorrect.\u201d The majority  didn\u2019t decide whether the CRTC could make the decision under a different  section of the Act, though.The <em>Bell Canada </em>and <em>NFL </em>cases were two of three cases known as the \u201cadministrative law  trilogy.\u201d (The other case, <em><a href=\"37748-eng.aspx\">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em>, was about  whether someone was a Canadian citizen.) The Super Bowl ad cases and <em>Vavilov</em> were about very different  issues. But they all dealt with an area of administrative law called \u201cstandard  of review.\u201d To learn more about this (and to better understand the Court\u2019s  reasons in these cases), read the <a href=\"37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx\">\u201cCase  Law in Brief\u201d on the Standard of Review</a>.\r\n  "

At the time of his birth, his parents were posing as Canadians under assumed names. In reality, they were foreign nationals working on assignment for the Russian foreign intelligence service. V did not know that his parents were not who they claimed to be. He believed that he was a Canadian citizen by birth, he lived and identified as a Canadian, and he held a Canadian passport. In 2010, V\u2019s parents were arrested in the United States and charged with espionage. They pled guilty and were returned to Russia. Following their arrest, V\u2019s attempts to renew his Canadian passport proved unsuccessful. However, in 2013, he was issued a certificate of Canadian citizenship.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Then, in 2014, the Canadian Registrar of Citizenship cancelled V\u2019s certificate on the basis of her interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act. This provision exempts children of \u201ca diplomatic or consular officer or other representative or employee in Canada of a foreign government\u201d from the general rule that individuals born in Canada acquire Canadian citizenship by birth. The Registrar concluded that because V\u2019s parents were employees or representatives of Russia at the time of V\u2019s birth, the exception to the rule of citizenship by birth in s.\u00a03(2)(a), as she interpreted it, applied to V, who therefore was not, and had never been, entitled to citizenship. V\u2019s application for judicial review of the Registrar\u2019s decision was dismissed by the Federal Court.

It was not reasonable for the Registrar to interpret s.\u00a03(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act as applying to children of individuals who have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities at the time of the children\u2019s birth.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 More generally, this appeal and its companion cases (Bell Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 845) provide an opportunity to consider and clarify the law applicable to the judicial review of administrative decisions as addressed in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, and subsequent cases. The submissions presented to the Court have highlighted two aspects of the current framework which need clarification. The first aspect is the analysis for determining the standard of review. The second aspect is the need for better guidance from this Court on the proper application of the reasonableness standard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It has become clear that Dunsmuir\u2019s promise of simplicity and predictability has not been fully realized. Certain aspects of the current standard of review framework are unclear and unduly complex. The former contextual analysis has proven to be unwieldy and offers limited practical guidance for courts attempting to determine the standard of review. The practical effect is that courts struggle in conducting the analysis, and debates surrounding the appropriate standard and its application continue to overshadow the review on the merits, thereby undermining access to justice. A reconsideration of the Court\u2019s approach is therefore necessary in order to bring greater coherence and predictability to this area of law. A revised framework to determine the standard of review where a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision is needed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In setting out a revised framework, this decision departs from the Court\u2019s existing jurisprudence on standard of review in certain respects. Any reconsideration of past precedents can be justified only by compelling circumstances and requires carefully weighing the impact on legal certainty and predictability against the costs of continuing to follow a flawed approach. Although adhering to the established jurisprudence will generally promote certainty and predictability, in some instances doing so will create or perpetuate uncertainty. In such circumstances, following a prior decision would be contrary to the underlying values of clarity and certainty in the law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The revised standard of review analysis begins with a presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard in all cases. Where a legislature has created an administrative decision maker for the specific purpose of administering a statutory scheme, it must be presumed that the legislature also intended that decision maker to fulfill its mandate and interpret the law applicable to all issues that come before it. Where a legislature has not explicitly provided that a court is to have a more involved role in reviewing the decisions of that decision maker, it can safely be assumed that the legislature intended a minimum of judicial interference. Respect for these institutional design choices requires a reviewing court to adopt a posture of restraint. Thus, whenever a court reviews an administrative decision, it should start with the presumption that the applicable standard of review for all aspects of that decision will be reasonableness. As a result, it is no longer necessary for courts to engage in a contextual inquiry in order to identify the appropriate standard. Conclusively closing the door on the application of a contextual analysis to determine the applicable standard streamlines and simplifies the standard of review framework. As well, with the presumptive application of the reasonableness standard, the relative expertise of administrative decision makers is no longer relevant to a determination of the standard of review. It is simply folded into the new starting point. Relative expertise remains, however, a relevant consideration in conducting reasonableness review.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The presumption of reasonableness review can be rebutted in two types of situations. The first is where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard to apply. This will be the case where it has explicitly prescribed the applicable standard of review. Any framework rooted in legislative intent must respect clear statutory language. The legislature may also direct that derogation from the presumption is appropriate by providing for a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision to a court, thereby signalling the legislature\u2019s intent that appellate standards apply when a court reviews the decision. Where a legislature has provided a statutory appeal mechanism, it has subjected the administrative regime to appellate oversight and it expects the court to scrutinize such administrative decisions on an appellate basis. The applicable standard is therefore to be determined with reference to the nature of the question and to the jurisprudence on appellate standards of review. Where, for example, a court hears an appeal from an administrative decision, it would apply the standard of correctness to questions of law, including on statutory interpretation and the scope of a decision maker\u2019s authority. Where the scope of the statutory appeal includes questions of fact or questions of mixed fact and law, the standard is palpable and overriding error for such questions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Giving effect to statutory appeal mechanisms in this way departs from the Court\u2019s recent jurisprudence. This shift is necessary in order to bring coherence and conceptual balance to the standard of review analysis and is justified by weighing the values of certainty and correctness. First, there has been significant and valid judicial and academic criticism of the Court\u2019s recent approach to statutory appeal rights and of the inconsistency inherent in a standard of review framework based on legislative intent that otherwise declines to give meaning to an express statutory right of appeal. Second, there is no satisfactory justification for the recent trend in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence to give no effect to statutory rights of appeal in the standard of review analysis, absent exceptional wording. More generally, there is no convincing reason to presume that legislatures mean something entirely different when they use the word \u201cappeal\u201d in an administrative law statute. Accepting that the legislature intends an appellate standard of review to be applied also helps to explain why many statutes provide for both appeal and judicial review mechanisms, thereby indicating two roles for reviewing courts. Finally, because the presumption of reasonableness review is no longer premised upon notions of relative expertise and is now based on respect for the legislature\u2019s institutional design choice, departing from the presumption of reasonableness review in the context of a statutory appeal respects this legislative choice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second situation in which the presumption of reasonableness review will be rebutted is where the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied. This will be the case for certain categories of legal questions, namely constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies. First, questions regarding the division of powers between Parliament and the provinces, the relationship between the legislature and the other branches of the state, the scope of Aboriginal and treaty rights under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and other constitutional matters require a final and determinate answer from the courts. Second, the rule of law requires courts to have the final word with regard to general questions of law that are of central importance to the legal system as a whole because they require uniform and consistent answers. Third, the rule of law requires courts to intervene where one administrative body has interpreted the scope of its authority in a manner that is incompatible with the jurisdiction of another since the rule of law cannot tolerate conflicting orders and proceedings where they result in a true operational conflict between two administrative bodies. The application of the correctness standard for such questions therefore respects the unique role of the judiciary in interpreting the Constitution and ensures that courts are able to provide the last word on questions for which the rule of law requires consistency and for which a final and determinate answer is necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The general rule of reasonableness review, when coupled with these limited exceptions, offers a comprehensive approach to determining the applicable standard of review. The possibility that another category could be recognized as requiring a derogation from the presumption of reasonableness review in a future case is not definitively foreclosed. However, any new basis for correctness review would be exceptional and would need to be consistent with this framework and the overarching principles set out in this decision. Any new correctness category based on legislative intent would require a signal of legislative intent as strong and compelling as a legislated standard of review or a statutory appeal mechanism. Similarly, a new correctness category based on the rule of law would be justified only where failure to apply correctness review would undermine the rule of law and jeopardize the proper functioning of the justice system in a manner analogous to the three situations described in this decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For example, the Court is not persuaded that it should recognize a distinct correctness category for legal questions on which there is persistent discord within an administrative body. A lack of unanimity within an administrative tribunal is the price to pay for decision\u2011making freedom and independence. While discord can lead to legal incoherence, a more robust form of reasonableness review is capable of guarding against such threats to the rule of law. As well, jurisdictional questions should no longer be recognized as a distinct category subject to correctness review; there are no clear markers to distinguish such questions from other questions related to interpreting an administrative decision maker\u2019s enabling statute. A proper application of the reasonableness standard will enable courts to ensure that administrative bodies have acted within the scope of their lawful authority without having to conduct a preliminary assessment on jurisdictional issues and without having to apply the correctness standard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Going forward, a court seeking to determine what standard of review is appropriate should look to this decision first in order to determine how the general framework applies. Doing so may require the court to resolve subsidiary questions on which past precedents will often continue to provide helpful guidance and will continue to apply essentially without modification, such as cases concerning general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or those relating to jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies. On other issues, such as the effect of statutory appeal mechanisms, true questions of jurisdiction or the former contextual analysis, certain cases will necessarily have less precedential force.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is also a need for better guidance from the Court on the proper application of the reasonableness standard, what that standard entails and how it should be applied in practice. Reasonableness review is meant to ensure that courts intervene in administrative matters only where it is truly necessary to do so in order to safeguard the legality, rationality and fairness of the administrative process. Its starting point lies in the principle of judicial restraint and in demonstrating respect for the distinct role of administrative decision makers. However, it is not a \u201crubber\u2011stamping\u201d process or a means of sheltering decision makers from accountability. While courts must recognize the legitimacy and authority of administrative decision makers and adopt a posture of respect, administrative decision makers must adopt a culture of justification and demonstrate that their exercise of delegated public power can be justified. In conducting reasonableness review, a court must consider the outcome of the administrative decision in light of its underlying rationale, to ensure that the decision as a whole is transparent, intelligible and justified. Judicial review is concerned with both the outcome of the decision and the reasoning process that led to that outcome. To accept otherwise would undermine, rather than demonstrate respect toward, the institutional role of the administrative decision maker.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Reasonableness review is methodologically distinct from correctness review. The court conducting a reasonableness review must focus on the decision the administrative decision maker actually made, including the justification offered for it. A court applying the reasonableness standard does not ask what decision it would have made in place of the administrative decision maker, attempt to ascertain the range of possible conclusions, conduct a new analysis or seek to determine the correct solution to the problem. Instead, the reviewing court must consider only whether the decision made by the decision maker, including both the rationale for the decision and the outcome to which it led, was unreasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In cases where reasons are required, they are the starting point for reasonableness review, as they are the primary mechanism by which decision makers show that their decisions are reasonable. Reasons are the means by which the decision maker communicates the rationale for its decision: they explain how and why a decision was made, help to show affected parties that their arguments have been considered and that the decision was made in a fair and lawful manner, and shield against arbitrariness. A principled approach to reasonableness review is therefore one which puts those reasons first. This enables a reviewing court to assess whether the decision as a whole is reasonable. Attention to the decision maker\u2019s reasons is part of how courts demonstrate respect for the decision\u2011making process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In many cases, formal reasons for a decision will not be given or required. Even without reasons, it is possible for the record and the context to reveal that a decision was made on the basis of an improper motive or for another impermissible reason. There will nonetheless be situations in which neither the record nor the larger context sheds light on the basis for the decision. In such cases, the reviewing court must still examine the decision in light of the relevant factual and legal constraints on the decision maker in order to determine whether the decision is reasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is conceptually useful to consider two types of fundamental flaws that tend to render a decision unreasonable. The first is a failure of rationality internal to the reasoning process. To be reasonable, a decision must be based on an internally coherent reasoning that is both rational and logical. A failure in this respect may lead a reviewing court to conclude that a decision must be set aside. Reasonableness review is not a line\u2011by\u2011line treasure hunt for error. However, the reviewing court must be able to trace the decision maker\u2019s reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws in its overarching logic. Because formal reasons should be read in light of the record and with due sensitivity to the administrative regime in which they were given, a decision will be unreasonable if the reasons for it, read holistically, fail to reveal a rational chain of analysis or if they reveal that the decision was based on an irrational chain of analysis. A decision will also be unreasonable where the conclusion reached cannot follow from the analysis undertaken or if the reasons read in conjunction with the record do not make it possible to understand the decision maker\u2019s reasoning on a critical point. Similarly, the internal rationality of a decision may be called into question if the reasons exhibit clear logical fallacies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second type of fundamental flaw arises when a decision is in some respect untenable in light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it. Although reasonableness is a single standard that already accounts for context, and elements of a decision\u2019s context should not modulate the standard or the degree of scrutiny by the reviewing court, what is reasonable in a given situation will always depend on the constraints imposed by the legal and factual context of the particular decision under review. These contextual constraints dictate the limits and contours of the space in which the decision maker may act and the types of solutions it may adopt. The governing statutory scheme, other relevant statutory or common law, the principles of statutory interpretation, the evidence before the decision maker and facts of which the decision maker may take notice, the submissions of the parties, the past practices and decisions of the administrative body, and the potential impact of the decision on the individual to whom it applies, are all elements that will generally be relevant in evaluating whether a given decision is reasonable. Such elements are not a checklist; they may vary in significance depending on the context and will necessarily interact with one another.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Accordingly, a reviewing court may find that a decision is unreasonable when examined against these contextual considerations. Because administrative decision makers receive their powers by statute, the governing statutory scheme is likely to be the most salient aspect of the legal context relevant to a particular decision. A proper application of the reasonableness standard is capable of allaying the concern that an administrative decision maker might interpret the scope of its own authority beyond what the legislature intended. Whether an interpretation is justified will depend on the context, including the language chosen by the legislature in describing the limits and contours of the decision maker\u2019s authority.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Both statutory and common law will also impose constraints on how and what an administrative decision maker can lawfully decide. Any precedents on the issue before the administrative decision maker or on a similar issue, as well as international law in some administrative decision making contexts, will act as a constraint on what the decision maker can reasonably decide. Whether an administrative decision maker has acted reasonably in adapting a legal or equitable doctrine involves a highly context\u2011specific determination.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Matters of statutory interpretation are not treated uniquely and, as with other questions of law, may be evaluated on a reasonableness standard. Where this is the applicable standard, the reviewing court does not undertake a de novo analysis of the question or ask itself what the correct decision would have been. But an approach to reasonableness review that respects legislative intent must assume that those who interpret the law, whether courts or administrative decision makers, will do so in a manner consistent with the modern principle of statutory interpretation. Administrative decision makers are not required to engage in a formalistic statutory interpretation exercise in every case. But whatever form the interpretive exercise takes, the merits of an administrative decision maker\u2019s interpretation of a statutory provision must be consistent with the text, context and purpose of the provision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the decision maker must take the evidentiary record and the general factual matrix that bears on its decision into account, and its decision must be reasonable in light of them. The reasonableness of a decision may be jeopardized where the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it. The reasons must also meaningfully account for the central issues and concerns raised by the parties, even though reviewing courts cannot expect administrative decision makers to respond to every argument or line of possible analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While administrative decision makers are not bound by their previous decisions, they must be concerned with the general consistency of administrative decisions. Therefore, whether a particular decision is consistent with the administrative body\u2019s past decisions is also a constraint that the reviewing court should consider when determining whether an administrative decision is reasonable. Finally, individuals are entitled to greater procedural protection when the decision in question involves the potential for significant personal impact or harm. Where the impact of a decision on an individual\u2019s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes. The principle of responsive justification means that if a decision has particularly harsh consequences for the affected individual, the decision maker must explain why its decision best reflects the legislature\u2019s intention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The question of the appropriate remedy \u2014 specifically, whether a court that quashes an unreasonable decision should exercise its discretion to remit the matter to the decision maker for reconsideration with the benefit of the court\u2019s reasons \u2014 is multi\u2011faceted. The choice of remedy must be guided by the rationale for applying the reasonableness standard to begin with, including the recognition by the reviewing court that the legislature has entrusted the matter to the administrative decision maker, and not to the court, concerns related to the proper administration of the justice system, the need to ensure access to justice and the goal of expedient and cost\u2011efficient decision making. Giving effect to these principles in the remedial context means that where a decision reviewed by applying the reasonableness standard cannot be upheld, it will most often be appropriate to remit the matter to the decision maker for reconsideration with the benefit of the court\u2019s reasons. However, there are limited scenarios in which remitting the matter would stymie the timely and effective resolution of matters in a manner that no legislature could have intended. An intention that the administrative decision maker decide the matter at first instance cannot give rise to endless judicial reviews and subsequent reconsiderations. Declining to remit a matter to the decision maker may be appropriate where it becomes evident that a particular outcome is inevitable and that remitting the case would therefore serve no useful purpose. Elements like concern for delay, fairness to the parties, urgency of providing a resolution to the dispute, the nature of the particular regulatory regime, whether the administrative decision maker had a genuine opportunity to weigh in on the issue in question, costs to the parties, and efficient use of public resources may also influence the exercise of a court\u2019s discretion to remit the matter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, there is no basis for departing from the presumption of reasonableness review. The Registrar\u2019s decision has come before the courts by way of judicial review, not by way of a statutory appeal. Given that Parliament has not prescribed the standard to be applied, there is no indication that the legislature intended a standard of review other than reasonableness. The Registrar\u2019s decision does not give rise to any constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies. As a result, the standard to be applied in reviewing the Registrar\u2019s decision is reasonableness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Registrar\u2019s decision was unreasonable. She failed to justify her interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a) in light of the constraints imposed by s.\u00a03 considered as a whole, by international treaties that inform its purpose, by the jurisprudence on the interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a), and by the potential consequences of her interpretation. Each of these elements \u2014 viewed individually and cumulatively \u2014 strongly supports the conclusion that s.\u00a03(2)(a) was not intended to apply to children of foreign government representatives or employees who have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities. Though V had raised many of these considerations, the Registrar failed to address those submissions in her reasons and did not do more than conduct a cursory review of the legislative history of s.\u00a03(2)(a) and conclude that her interpretation was not explicitly precluded by its text.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, the Registrar failed to address the immediate statutory context of s.\u00a03(2)(a), which provides clear support for the conclusion that all of the persons contemplated by s.\u00a03(2)(a) must have been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities in some form for the exception to apply. Second, the Registrar disregarded compelling submissions that s.\u00a03(2) is a narrow exception consistent with established principles of international law and with the leading international treaties that extend diplomatic privileges and immunities to employees and representatives of foreign governments. Third, it was a significant omission to ignore the relevant cases that were before the Registrar which suggest that s.\u00a03(2)(a) was intended to apply only to those individuals whose parents have been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities. Finally, there is no evidence that the Registrar considered the potential consequences of expanding her interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a) to include all individuals who have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities. Rules concerning citizenship require a high degree of interpretive consistency in order to shield against arbitrariness. The Registrar\u2019s interpretation cannot be limited to the children of spies \u2014 its logic would be equally applicable to other scenarios. As well, provisions such as s.\u00a03(2)(a) must be given a narrow interpretation because they potentially take away rights which otherwise benefit from a liberal and broad interpretation. Yet there is no indication that the Registrar considered the potential harsh consequences of her interpretation, or whether, in light of those potential consequences, Parliament would have intended s.\u00a03(2)(a) to apply in this manner. Although the Registrar knew her interpretation was novel, she failed to provide a rationale for her expanded interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It was therefore unreasonable for the Registrar to find that s.\u00a03(2)(a) can apply to individuals whose parents have not been granted diplomatic privileges and immunities in Canada. It is undisputed that V\u2019s parents had not been granted such privileges and immunities. No purpose would therefore be served by remitting this matter to the Registrar. Given that V was born in Canada, his status is governed only by the general rule of citizenship by birth. He is a Canadian citizen.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ.: There is agreement with the majority that the appeal should be dismissed. The Registrar\u2019s decision to cancel V\u2019s citizenship certificate was unreasonable and was properly quashed by the Court of Appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is also agreement with the majority that there should be a presumption of reasonableness in judicial review. The contextual factors analysis should be eliminated from the standard of review framework, and \u201ctrue questions of jurisdiction\u201d should be abolished as a separate category of issues subject to correctness review. However, the elimination of these elements does not support the foundational changes to judicial review outlined in the majority\u2019s framework that result in expanded correctness review. Rather than confirming a meaningful presumption of deference for administrative decision-makers, the majority strips away deference from hundreds of administrative actors, based on a formalistic approach that ignores the legislature\u2019s intention to leave certain legal and policy questions to administrative decision-makers. The majority\u2019s presumption of reasonableness review rests on a totally new understanding of legislative intent and the rule of law and prohibits any consideration of well\u2011established foundations for deference. By dramatically expanding the circumstances in which generalist judges will be entitled to substitute their own views for those of specialized decision-makers who apply their mandates on a daily basis, the majority\u2019s framework fundamentally reorients the relationship between administrative actors and the judiciary, thus advocating a profoundly different philosophy of administrative law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s framework rests on a flawed and incomplete conceptual account of judicial review, one that unjustifiably ignores the specialized expertise of administrative decision-makers and reads out the foundations of the modern understanding of legislative intent. Instead of understanding legislative intent as being the intention to leave legal questions within their mandate to specialized decision-makers with expertise, the majority removes expertise from the equation entirely. In so doing, the majority disregards the historically accepted reason why the legislature intended to delegate authority to an administrative actor. In particular, such an approach ignores the possibility that specialization and expertise are embedded into this legislative choice. Post\u2011Dunsmuir, the Court has been steadfast in confirming the central role of specialization and expertise, affirming their connection to legislative intent, and recognizing that they give administrative decision-makers the interpretative upper hand on questions of law. Specialized expertise has become the core rationale for deference. Giving proper effect to the legislature\u2019s choice to delegate authority to an administrative decision-maker requires understanding the advantages that the decision-maker may enjoy in exercising its mandate. Chief among those advantages are the institutional expertise and specialization inherent to administering a particular mandate on a daily basis. In interpreting their enabling statutes, administrative actors may have a particularly astute appreciation for the on\u2011the\u2011ground consequences of particular legal interpretations, of statutory context, of the purposes that a provision or legislative scheme are meant to serve, and of specialized terminology. The advantages stemming from specialization and expertise provide a robust foundation for deference. The majority\u2019s approach accords no weight to such institutional advantages and banishes expertise from the standard of review analysis entirely. The removal of the current conceptual basis for deference opens the gates to expanded correctness review.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the majority\u2019s framework, deference gives way whenever the rule of law demands it. This approach, however, flows from a court\u2011centric conception of the rule of law. The rule of law means that administrative decision-makers make legal determinations within their mandate; it does not mean that only judges decide questions of law with an unrestricted license to substitute their opinions for those of administrative actors through correctness review. The majority\u2019s approach not only erodes the presumption of deference; it erodes confidence in the fact that law\u2011making and legal interpretation are shared enterprises between courts and administrative decision-makers. Moreover, access to justice is at the heart of the legislative choice to establish a robust system of administrative law. This goal is compromised when a narrow conception of the rule of law is invoked to impose judicial hegemony over administrative decision-makers, which adds unnecessary expense and complexity. Authorizing more incursions into the administrative system by judges and permitting de novo review of every legal decision adds to the delay and cost of obtaining a final decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s reformulation of \u201clegislative intent\u201d invites courts to apply an irrebuttable presumption of correctness review whenever an administrative scheme includes a right of appeal. Elevating appeal clauses to indicators of correctness review creates a two\u2011tier system that defers to the expertise of administrative decision-makers only where there is no appeal clause. Yet appeal rights do not represent a different institutional structure that requires a more searching form of review. The mere fact that a statute contemplates an appeal says nothing about the degree of deference required in the review process. The majority\u2019s position hinges almost entirely on a textualist argument \u2014 i.e., that the presence of the word \u201cappeal\u201d indicates a legislative intent that courts apply the same standards of review found in civil appellate jurisprudence. This disregards long\u2011accepted institutional distinctions between courts and administrative decision-makers. The continued use by legislatures of the term \u201cappeal\u201d cannot be imbued with the intent that the majority ascribes to it. The idea that appellate standards of review must be applied to every right of appeal is entirely unsupported by the jurisprudence. For at least 25 years, the Court has not treated statutory rights of appeal as a determinative reflection of legislative intent, and such clauses have played little or no role in the standard of review analysis. Moreover, pre\u2011Dunsmuir, statutory rights of appeal were still seen as only one factor and not as unequivocal indicators of correctness review. Absent exceptional circumstances, a statutory right of appeal does not displace the presumption of reasonableness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s disregard for precedent and stare decisis has the potential to undermine both the integrity of the Court\u2019s decisions, and public confidence in the stability of the law. Stare decisis places significant limits on the Court\u2019s ability to overturn its precedents. The doctrine promotes the predictable and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the integrity of the judicial process. Respect for precedent also safeguards the Court\u2019s institutional legitimacy. The precedential value of a judgment does not expire with the tenure of the panel of judges that decided it. When the Court does choose to overrule its own precedents, it should do so carefully, with moderation, and with due regard for all the important considerations that undergird the doctrine of stare decisis. A nuanced balance must be struck between maintaining the stability of the common law and ensuring that the law is flexible and responsive enough to adapt to new circumstances and societal norms. Stare decisis plays a critical role in maintaining that balance and upholding the rule of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is no principled justification for departing from the existing jurisprudence and abandoning the Court\u2019s long\u2011standing view of how statutory appeal clauses impact the standard of review analysis. In doing so, the majority disregards the high threshold required to overturn the Court\u2019s decisions. The unprecedented wholesale rejection of an entire body of jurisprudence is particularly unsettling. The affected cases are numerous and include many decisions conducting deferential review even in the face of a statutory right of appeal and bedrock judgments affirming the relevance of administrative expertise to the standard of review analysis. Overruling these judgments flouts stare decisis, which prohibits courts from overturning past decisions that simply represent a choice with which the current bench does not agree. The majority\u2019s approach also has the potential to disturb settled interpretations of many statutes that contain a right of appeal; every existing interpretation of such statutes that has been affirmed under a reasonableness standard will be open to fresh challenge. Moreover, if the Court, in its past decisions, misconstrued the purpose of statutory appeal clauses, legislatures were free to clarify this interpretation through legislative amendment. In the absence of legislative correction, the case for overturning decisions is even less compelling.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court should offer additional direction on reasonableness review so that judges can provide careful and meaningful oversight of the administrative justice system while respecting its legitimacy and the perspectives of its front\u2011line, specialized decision-makers. However, rather than clarifying the role of reasons and how to review them, the majority revives the kind of search for errors that dominated the Court\u2019s prior jurisprudence. The majority\u2019s multi\u2011factored, open\u2011ended list of constraints on administrative decision making will encourage reviewing courts to dissect administrative reasons in a line\u2011by\u2011line hunt for error. These constraints may function in practice as a wide\u2011ranging catalogue of hypothetical errors to justify quashing an administrative decision. Structuring reasonableness review in this fashion effectively imposes on administrative decision-makers a higher standard of justification than on trial judges. Such an approach undercuts deference. Reasonableness review should instead focus on the concept of deference to administrative decision-makers and to the legislative intention to confide in them a mandate. Curial deference is the hallmark of reasonableness review, setting it apart from the substitution of opinion permitted under correctness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Deference imposes three requirements on courts conducting reasonableness review. First, deference is the attitude a reviewing court must adopt towards an administrative decision-maker. Deference mandates respect for the legislative choice to entrust a decision to administrative actors rather than to the courts, for the important role that administrative decision-makers play, and for their specialized expertise and the institutional setting in which they operate. Reviewing courts must pay respectful attention to the reasons offered for an administrative decision, make a genuine effort to understand why the decision was made, and give the decision a fair and generous construction. Second, deference affects how a court frames the question it must answer and the nature of its analysis. A reviewing court does not ask how it would have resolved an issue, but rather whether the answer provided by the decision-maker was unreasonable. Ultimately, whether an administrative decision is reasonable depends on the context, and a reviewing court must be attentive to all relevant circumstances, including the reasons offered to support the decision, the record, the statutory scheme and the particular issues raised, among other factors. Third, deferential review impacts how a reviewing court evaluates challenges to a decision. The party seeking judicial review bears the onus of showing that the decision was unreasonable; the decision-maker does not have to persuade the court that its decision is reasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The administrative decision itself is the focal point of the review exercise. In all cases, the question remains whether the challenging party has demonstrated that a decision is unreasonable. Where reasons are neither required nor available, reasonableness may be justified by past decisions of the administrative body or in light of the procedural context. Where reasons are provided, they serve as the natural starting point to determine whether the decision-maker acted reasonably. By beginning with the reasons, read in light of the surrounding context and the grounds raised, reviewing courts provide meaningful oversight while respecting the legitimacy of specialized administrative decision making. Reviewing courts should approach the reasons with respect for the specialized decision-makers, their significant role and the institutional context chosen by the legislator. Reviewing courts should not second\u2011guess operational implications, practical challenges and on\u2011the\u2011ground knowledge and must remain alert to specialized concepts or language. Further, a reviewing court is not restricted to the four corners of the written reasons and should, if faced with a gap in the reasons, look to other materials to see if they shed light on the decision, including: the record of any formal proceedings and the materials before the decision-maker, past decisions of the administrative body, and policies or guidelines developed to guide the type of decision under review. These materials may assist a court in understanding the outcome. In these ways, reviewing courts may legitimately supplement written reasons without supplanting the analysis. Reasons must be read together with the outcome to determine whether the result falls within a range of possible outcomes. This approach puts substance over form where the basis for a decision is evident on the record, but not clearly expressed in written reasons.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As well, a court conducting deferential review must view claims of error in context and with caution, cognizant of the need to avoid substituting its opinion for that of those empowered and better equipped to answer the questions at issue. Because judicial substitution is incompatible with deference, reviewing courts must carefully evaluate the challenges raised to ensure they go to the reasonableness of the decision rather than representing a mere difference of opinion. Courts must also consider the materiality of any alleged errors. An error that is peripheral to the reasoning process is not sufficient to justify quashing a decision. The same deferential approach must apply with equal force to statutory interpretation cases. In such cases, a court should not assess the decision by determining what, in its own view, would be a reasonable interpretation. Such an approach imperils deference. A de novo interpretation of a statute necessarily omits the perspective of the front\u2011line, specialized administrative body that routinely applies the statutory scheme in question. By placing that perspective at the heart of the judicial review inquiry, courts display respect for specialization and expertise, and for the legislative choice to delegate certain questions to non\u2011judicial bodies. Conversely, by imposing their own interpretation of a statute, courts undermine legislative intent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, there is agreement with the majority that the standard of review is reasonableness. The Registrar\u2019s reasons failed to respond to V\u2019s submission that the objectives of s.\u00a03(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act require its terms to be read narrowly. Instead, the Registrar interpreted s.\u00a03(2)(a) broadly, based on a purely textual assessment. This reading was only reasonable if the text is read in isolation from its objective. Nothing in the history of this provision indicates that Parliament intended to widen its scope. Furthermore, the judicial treatment of this provision also points to the need for a narrow interpretation. In addition, the text of s.\u00a03(2)(c) can be seen as undermining the Registrar\u2019s interpretation of s.\u00a03(2)(a), because the former denies citizenship to children born to individuals who enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities equivalent to those granted to persons referred to in the latter. This suggests that s.\u00a03(2)(a) covers only those employees in Canada of a foreign government who have such privileges and immunities, in contrast with V\u2019s parents. By ignoring the objectives of s.\u00a03 as a whole, the Registrar\u2019s decision was unreasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: Baker v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0person born in Canada to parents who were undercover  Russian spies is a Canadian citizen, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong>\r\n   Mr. Vavilov was born in Toronto in 1994. In 2010, his  parents were arrested for spying in the United States, where they were living. Mr.  Vavilov learned then that his parents had been undercover Russian spies his  whole life. The United States sent the parents back to Russia as part of a spy  exchange. Mr. Vavilov tried to renew his Canadian passport. He  was rejected twice. Officials said he needed proof he was Canadian, and his  birth certificate wasn\u2019t enough. He needed a certificate of Canadian citizenship.  He got this and applied again. But he still didn\u2019t get a passport. Instead, he  got a letter from the Registrar of Citizenship. The Registrar makes the final  decision on who is a Canadian citizen. The letter said giving Mr. Vavilov the certificate  of citizenship was a mistake and that he was not a Canadian citizen. The Registrar\u2019s decision was based  on her view of the <em>Citizenship Act</em>.  The general rule is that anyone born in Canada is a Canadian citizen. But there  is an exception. This exception applies to a child of \u201ca  diplomatic or consular officer or other representative or employee in Canada of  a foreign government.\u201d If neither parent is a Canadian citizen or permanent  resident, the child won\u2019t be a citizen. The  Registrar said the exception applied in Mr. Vavilov\u2019s case.  The Registrar relied on a report  for her decision. The report was written by a junior analyst. The analyst noted  there was no definition of \u201cother representative or employee in Canada of a  foreign government\u201d in the Act. But she said it could include undercover spies.  The analyst recommended the Registrar cancel Mr. Vavilov\u2019s certificate of  citizenship. Mr. Vavilov asked the Federal Court to review the  Registrar\u2019s decision. The Federal Court ruled for the Registrar. It said the decision  was \u201ccorrect.\u201d The Federal Court of Appeal ruled for Mr. Vavilov. It said the  decision was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and quashed (canceled) it. (To better understand  what \u201ccorrect\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d mean here, read the <a href=\"37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx\">\u201cCase  Law in Brief\u201d on the Standard of Review</a>.) All the judges at the Supreme Court said the  Registrar\u2019s decision was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and that the Federal Court of Appeal  was right to quash it. They said Mr. Vavilov was a Canadian citizen. The judges said the Registrar didn\u2019t justify her view  of the law. They said she didn\u2019t properly consider lawmakers\u2019 debates, court  cases, the text of the <em>Citizenship Act</em>,  and international law. These sources showed that the exception was only meant  to apply to people who had diplomatic \u201cprivileges and immunities.\u201d\r\n   Citizens have to follow all their country\u2019s rules. For  example, Canadian citizens have to pay Canadian taxes and obey Canadian laws. But  people working for foreign governments, like at embassies or consulates, don\u2019t  always have to. They may have \u201cprivileges and immunities.\u201d These are like  exceptions to the rules that citizens have to follow. They are meant to make  sure one country can\u2019t meddle in another country\u2019s foreign policy through its  officials. The officials need the privileges and immunities to do their jobs  properly. That\u2019s why diplomats and other foreign representatives to Canada can\u2019t  become Canadian citizens.  The majority said it didn\u2019t matter that Mr. Vavilov\u2019s  parents were working for a foreign state. What mattered was whether they had  privileges and immunities. They didn\u2019t. That meant the exception didn\u2019t apply  to Mr. Vavilov. Normally, if a court finds an administrative decision  unreasonable, it will send it back to the decision-maker to try again. In this  case, the majority said it wouldn\u2019t be useful to do that. Mr. Vavilov had  already brought up all these issues and nothing changed the Registrar\u2019s mind. The  judges said that Mr. Vavilov was a Canadian citizen.  This case was one of  three cases known as the \u201cadministrative law trilogy.\u201d (The other two cases,  decided in <em><a href=\"37896-37897-eng.aspx\">Bell  Canada v. Canada (Attorney General)</a></em>, were about Super Bowl ads.) <em>Vavilov</em> and the Super Bowl ad cases  were about very different issues. But they all dealt with an area of  administrative law called \u201cstandard of review.\u201d To learn more about this (and  to better understand the Court\u2019s reasons in this case), read the <a href=\"37748-37896-37897-eng.aspx\">\u201cCase  Law in Brief\u201d on the Standard of Review</a>."

On its creation, BCI assumed ownership and management of the investment assets held in pooled investment portfolios (Portfolios), which formerly were held and managed by the Province\u2019s Minister of Finance. At the same time, the Province modernized its public sector pensions by creating a joint trusteeship structure, to allow both pension plan members and their employers to participate in the management of the public sector pension plans. These changes were intended to create a degree of separation between the government and the management of its investment funds and the public sector pensions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 By virtue of two separate agreements, the Province and Canada have agreed to pay the other\u2019s sales taxes in certain circumstances. Under the Reciprocal Taxation Agreement (RTA), Canada agreed to pay certain provincial taxes and fees and the Province agreed to pay the taxes imposed under the federal Excise Tax Act, Part IX (ETA). Provincial entities listed in Schedule A of the RTA could apply for a rebate of any GST paid. BCI was added to Schedule A in 1999 but removed in 2003. Under the Comprehensive Integrated Tax Coordination Agreement (CITCA), the Province and Canada agreed to pay HST on supplies purchased by their respective governments and agents. The CITCA was in effect until 2013, when the Province withdrew from the HST regime and returned to the GST/PST model. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Following BCI\u2019s removal from Schedule A of the RTA in 2003, Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) began to question whether BCI was entitled to claim immunity from GST in respect of the expenses it incurred in managing the Portfolios. In December 2013, BCI filed a petition in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, seeking declarations that as a statutory Crown agent, BCI is immune from taxation in respect of the assets it holds in the Portfolios, and is not bound by either the RTA or the CITCA or the payment obligations found in those agreements. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Canada sought to strike BCI\u2019s petition, arguing that the dispute should be heard by the Tax Court of Canada, not the Supreme Court of British Columbia but its motion was dismissed. The chambers judge held that the Supreme Court of British Columbia had jurisdiction to hear the petition, that BCI, as a statutory Crown agent, enjoys immunity under s.\u00a0125 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which states that no lands or property belonging to Canada or any Province shall be liable to taxation, and that BCI is bound by the taxation agreements. The Court of Appeal agreed. Canada appeals the holding that BCI is immune from taxation and BCI cross-appeals with respect to the binding nature of the agreements. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner\u00a0C.J. dissenting in part): The appeal and cross\u2011appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Brown, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The chambers judge did not err in exercising his jurisdiction to decide BCI\u2019s petition. Both the scope and the timing of BCI\u2019s petition supports the chambers judge\u2019s characterization of BCI\u2019s claim and its decision to exercise its jurisdiction. In deciding whether to exercise its jurisdiction, a court must determine the essential nature of the claim. In this case, the chambers judge determined that the core of BCI\u2019s petition was not an attack on the GST assessments but rather Canada\u2019s ability to tax BCI in the first place. He also concluded that the constitutional immunity and intergovernmental agreements issues were linked \u2014 if the immunity claim was successful, the agreements were the only way BCI could be required to pay GST. There is no reversible error in this analysis. The issues raised in BCI\u2019s petition go beyond the assessment of tax under the ETA, this case is about the rights, obligations, and duties of a Crown agent, under the Constitution and at common law. Furthermore, although challenges to the correctness of a tax assessment under the ETA fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court, at the time BCI filed its petition, the reassessments issued in 2015 had not yet been issued so the Tax Court had no jurisdiction over the dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The ETA\u2019s mechanism for imposing GST on the Portfolios would result in Crown property being subject to taxation. Therefore, s. 125 of the Constitution Act, 1867, renders the relevant provisions of Part IX of the ETA inapplicable in respect of the Portfolios. Part IX of the ETA governs the payment, collection and remittance of the federal GST (and HST, where applicable). Every recipient of a taxable supply must pay GST on the consideration paid for the supply. Suppliers registered under the ETA are required to collect GST and periodically remit it to the federal government. BCI uses two different structures to manage the assets placed with it for investment: investments are either held in the Portfolios or as segregated funds, separate and apart from the assets of the Portfolios. There is no dispute that the investment management services BCI provides outside the context of the Portfolios (i.e. in managing the segregated funds) are taxable supplies for GST purposes. However, for the Portfolios, BCI recovers the costs of managing them from the income realized on the assets held in the Portfolios and does not collect GST on these amounts. Thus, the issue under the ETA does not relate to the nature of BCI\u2019s investment management activities but rather involves whether the Portfolios can be considered a \u201crecipient\u201d of a taxable supply under the ETA. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 123(1) of the ETA defines a \u201crecipient\u201d with reference to either the person who is liable to pay consideration for a supply of services or, if no consideration is payable, the person to whom a service is rendered. To fall within this definition, a recipient must also be a person. At common law, only natural persons and corporations have legal personalities; a trust does not. To capture transactions involving a wide range of entities, the ETA defines \u201cperson\u201d and confers upon a trust a separate, artificial legal identity for tax purposes. The combined effects under the ETA is to impose GST collection, remittance and payment obligations on trusts and trustees in certain circumstances. For the purposes of determining whether BCI enjoys constitutional immunity, it is assumed that the Portfolios are \u201ca trust\u201d within the meaning of Part IX of the ETA. On this assumption, BCI would hold the Portfolio assets in trust for the benefit of the unit holders.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying the ETA to BCI and the Portfolios is further complicated by the fact that BCI is a provincial Crown agent. Intergovernmental immunity from taxation grants each level of government operational space to govern without interference and seeks to maintain the federal-provincial distribution of property set out in the Constitution Act, 1867. Section 125 grants constitutional immunity from taxation when two requirements are met. First, the pith and substance of the impugned charge must constitute \u201ctaxation\u201d within the meaning of ss.\u00a091(3) or 92(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Second, the subject matter of the tax must be property belonging to the federal Crown in the case of a tax imposed by the provincial legislature and to the provincial Crown in the case of a tax imposed by Parliament. Where these two prerequisites are met, s.\u00a0125 applies and renders otherwise valid taxation provisions inapplicable in respect of Crown property. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, there is no question that the federal GST falls squarely within the meaning of \u201ctaxation\u201d in s.\u00a091(3) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and that, as a statutory Crown agent, BCI enjoys the same constitutional immunity in respect of its property as the provincial Crown does. When the Crown holds property in trust, s.\u00a0125 of the Constitution, 1867, protects only the Crown\u2019s interest in trust property from taxation. A private beneficial interest can therefore be taxed when the Crown holds legal title. However, if the tax is imposed on the Crown\u2019s interest in the property, then constitutional immunity applies. In this case, the ETA uses a legal fiction to require a trust to pay tax on taxable services provided to it by its trustee. However, when the trustee is a provincial Crown agent, this mechanism runs afoul of s.\u00a0125 because it imposes tax on property legally owned by the Crown. The ETA does not impose GST on a distinct private beneficial ownership interest in this case. Therefore, the ETA is constitutionally inapplicable to the Portfolios.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 BCI is subject to the RTA and the CITCA. \u00a0In light of their clear wording, the agreements resemble private law contracts and were intended to create legally binding obligations for Canada and the Province. The PSPPA establishes that BCI\u2019s tax immunities and obligations follow those of the Province. Because the language of this provision is broad enough to include obligations voluntarily assumed by the Province, BCI is generally subject to the obligations set out in the agreements to the same extent that the Province would be. However, the nature of any specific obligations under the agreements is beyond the scope of this appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. (dissenting in part): There is agreement with the majority that the Supreme Court of British Columbia appropriately assumed jurisdiction over this litigation and that BCI is bound by the relevant intergovernmental taxation agreements between British Columbia and Canada. However, there is disagreement on the issue of immunity under s.\u00a0125 of the Constitution Act, 1867. BCI\u2019s legal title to the taxed property is insufficient to make it property \u201cbelonging to\u201d the Province, as s.\u00a0125 requires, because the property was entrusted to BCI by private parties to hold and manage for their sole benefit in exchange for payment. The property is liable to taxation only because the private pension boards chose to make it the mechanism of payment for the services they received from BCI. Extending immunity under s.\u00a0125 in these circumstances does not protect the constitutional values of federalism and democracy that s.\u00a0125 exists to promote. Instead, it overshoots those purposes by giving private parties the benefit of an immunity from taxation to which they are not entitled, protecting the Province from adverse contractual consequences, and providing BCI with an unjustified commercial advantage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The unit holders are the beneficiaries of the funds BCI holds in trust. The investment management services that BCI provides for the Portfolios ultimately benefit the unit holders. It is the unit holders that are entitled to the income and capital gains generated by the Portfolios while they exist, and it is the unit holders that are entitled to the net proceeds on termination of the Portfolios. Neither BCI nor the Province has the ability or right to appropriate Portfolio assets. The only benefit BCI derives from the Portfolios is the recouping of its operating costs and capital expenditures from the funds therein, which reduces the value of the units and the ultimate return realized by the unit holders. The Province\u2019s involvement with the public sector pension plans is purely contractual. The pension boards, which form the bulk of the unit holders, are private parties. The real impact of the tax is borne by the private unit holders because BCI provides the services relating to the Portfolios for the benefit of the unit holders alone. Only the pension boards\u2019 choice to pay BCI indirectly by permitting it to take its payment from the trust makes the Portfolios the recipients under the ETA of the services that BCI provides. Had BCI and the pension boards agreed that BCI would bill the boards directly for its services instead of taking its payment from the Portfolios, the boards would have been the recipients under the ETA and would thus have been liable to pay GST. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Private parties cannot rely on s.\u00a0125 of the Constitution Act, 1867, to immunize themselves from paying tax on investment management services they receive from a Crown corporation. The interpretation of s.\u00a0125 should not overshoot the purposes of federalism and democracy. It is clear that Parliament can require private purchasers of provincial services to pay GST in respect of those services without running afoul of s.\u00a0125. Further, s.\u00a0125 is not intended to immunize the Crown from contractual consequences or other adverse commercial effects that it may bear as a result of the taxation of a private party. The commercial and contractual interests of the Crown cannot be favoured at the expense of those of private parties. In the instant case, the property does not belong to the Crown and is thus not immune under s.\u00a0125. Section 125 does not immunize property that private parties have placed with the Crown to hold in trust for their sole benefit from a tax on services that they have contracted to receive from the Crown in respect of that property. The property in substance belongs not to the Crown but to the private parties, and the Crown\u2019s legal title as trustee does not trigger the immunity. Extending the immunity here would overshoot s.\u00a0125\u2019s purposes by extending immunity to private parties\u2019 interests, relying on adverse contractual consequences for the Crown to extend the immunity, and rendering the Crown\u2019s assets more commercially attractive by making them a tax haven for private parties.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Extending the immunity would not advance s.\u00a0125\u2019s purposes. It would not advance s.\u00a0125\u2019s objective of preventing one level of government from appropriating the property of the other, or the fruits of that property, to its own use. Further, holding that immunity does not apply in these circumstances would not undermine the Province\u2019s decision to allow BCI to hold the Portfolio assets in trust. Instead, it would merely impose appropriate tax consequences on a mode of payment for services chosen by BCI and its private clients. Nothing in the PSPPA or trust law requires the mode of payment that is said to give rise to s.\u00a0125 immunity. The PSPPA makes direct payment from the trust funds only one of multiple possible payment options available and also permits BCI to bill its clients directly for services rendered. Providing immunity is not necessary to protect the Province\u2019s operational space to govern. Moreover, requiring the Portfolios to pay GST would not put them at risk. BCI and the pension boards remain free to ensure that the GST is not paid from the trust funds by agreeing that the boards will pay BCI directly for its services, an option that is both provided for by the legislature and used by BCI and the boards for the segregated funds. Finally, applying immunity does not advance the constitutional value of democracy because this case is not about Parliament deciding how taxes levied by the Province should be spent. The Province has already decided how it should spend its tax revenues. It authorized the payment of tax funds to private pension boards in order to meet its contractual obligations to compensate provincial employees. Once the Province paid those funds to the private pension boards, they ceased to be public funds and became subject to the contractual terms of the joint trust agreements. The services at issue are thus provided by BCI to private parties that agreed to pay for those services. All Canada is trying to do is ensure that those private parties pay GST on those services.Cases CitedBy Karakatsanis\u00a0J.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: Reference re Exported Natural Gas Tax, 1982 CanLII 189 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 1004; Quirt v.

        "summary": "<strong>The federal government couldn\u2019t force a BC Crown  corporation to pay GST on its own property, but it still had to pay because BC  agreed, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   British  Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) was a Crown corporation owned  by the British Columbia government. BCI managed and invested pension and other money  for several public-sector organizations. The  federal government collected GST under the <em>Excise  Tax Act</em>. BCI didn\u2019t charge direct fees for some of its investment services.  Instead, it took some of the profits from those investments to cover the costs  of its services. It didn\u2019t charge GST.  Under  the Constitution, the federal and provincial governments each have different  powers. They can\u2019t interfere with each other\u2019s powers. The Constitution says  that they can\u2019t force each other to pay tax. They have \u201cimmunity\u201d against each  other\u2019s taxes. But  the federal government said BCI had to charge GST for the investment services. According  to the federal government, BCI was holding the investments \u201cin trust\u201d for (for  the benefit of) pension boards. The pension boards were private and not part of  any government. Because the pension boards were getting a service, the federal  government said they had to pay GST, which BCI had to collect.  The  federal government also said BCI still had to pay GST even if the investments  weren\u2019t being held \u201cin trust\u201d for anyone else. This was because the BC  government had agreed to pay GST in some situations. According to the federal  government, BCI was bound by BC\u2019s agreement to pay GST. The federal government  said BCI owed over $40 million, plus interest and penalties, for three years. BCI  asked a British Columbia court to legally declare that it didn\u2019t have to pay  federal taxes. The BC court decided the federal government couldn\u2019t force BCI  to pay under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>. But  the court also said that BCI still had to pay because of BC\u2019s agreements with  the federal government. The Court of Appeal agreed. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the lower courts.  BC law didn\u2019t actually say who the \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of the trust was (that is, who  got the real benefits from it). BCI legally owned the investments. BCI was a  Crown corporation managing the investments. So if the federal government  charged BCI GST for investment services under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, it would be charging tax on property owned by the  province. That\u2019s not allowed under the Constitution. But  the majority of judges agreed that BCI still had to pay because it was a  provincial Crown corporation. Just as it benefitted from the province\u2019s tax  immunity, it was also bound by the province\u2019s agreements to pay GST to the  federal government. The majority said that even though one level of government  can\u2019t force the other to pay tax, that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t <em>agree</em> to pay tax if they choose to. Another issue in  this case was which court should decide the dispute. The Tax Court is the only  court that has the power to decide if a federal tax assessment is correct. Because  it is a provincial superior court, the BC court has the power to hear any legal  issue, unless the power to hear it has been given to another court. The issue  about whether BC\u2019s agreements to pay GST applied to BCI wasn\u2019t about a specific  tax assessment, so the Tax Court wouldn\u2019t have had the power to decide it. Since  it made sense to hear all the issues together, it was right for the BC court to  hear it."

In 2012, the trust acquired a residence with funds transferred by the spouses to the trust patrimony and the family moved in. The house was a residence of the family within the meaning of art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q., which sets out that the family patrimony includes the residences of the family or the rights which confer use of them. T filed for divorce in 2014 and passed away in 2015. The liquidators of her succession filed for a declaration that the value of the residence held by the trust should be included in the division of the family patrimony, half of which would therefore go to the estate of T. The trial judge decided that the value of the residence ought to be included in the family patrimony despite the fact that it was held under a trust and not owned directly by one of the spouses. The Court of Appeal allowed K\u2019s appeal and declared that no value from the residence ought to be included in the family patrimony.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Karakatsanis and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Brown, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: Family residences held in trust are not, in principle, outside the scope of the composition of the family patrimony set out at art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. By referring to the \u201crights which confer use\u201d of a family residence at art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q., the legislator intended to include in the family patrimony the type of living arrangements where spouses, without being owners in title, nonetheless are in control of the family residence. Wide discretion should be accorded to the trier of fact when making the determination of what may or may not constitute a right which confers use. In this case, absent an overriding and palpable error in the trial judge\u2019s determination that K held \u201crights which confer use\u201d within the meaning of art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q., it was not open to the Court of Appeal to overturn his decision on appeal.\u00a0His decision should be restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When applying art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. to a family residence not directly owned by the spouses, the question is whether the record supports a finding of rights which confer use of the residence. What may or may not constitute a right which confers use within the meaning of art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. is dependent on the circumstances and will generally be determined in relation to the level of control exercised by either spouse with respect to the residence. Simple occupation of a property not owned by the spouses will not automatically give rise to \u201crights which confer use\u201d within the meaning of art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. However, these rights are not limited to rights of use within the meaning of art.\u00a01172 C.C.Q. or other real rights listed at art.\u00a01119 C.C.Q. If the trial judge is satisfied, based on the evidence before him or her, that the spouses are in control of the residence, not merely by way of exercising control over the entitlement to the value of the assets but by controlling whom may benefit from the use of the property, it is open to him or her to include the value of the residence in the family patrimony based on art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q., even when such residence was acquired directly by a trust or a corporation. Prior ownership and occupation of a family residence can be relevant to show that the spouses hold a right which confers use within the meaning of art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q.; however, it is not, as a matter of law, a necessary condition.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When the constitution of a trust conflicts with the operation of the family patrimony, a court should resolve the matter by relying on the rules pertaining to both of these institutions rather than by lifting the trust veil by analogy with art.\u00a0317 C.C.Q. In Quebec law, trusts are not legal persons endowed with juridical personality. Contrary to a corporation, there is in the case of a trust no veil to lift nor any mastermind hiding behind a distinct juridical personality. In the case of a family residence, issues arising from indirect ownership or de facto control of the property can be resolved with the notion of \u201crights which confer use\u201d set out in art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. For this category of property, there is therefore no need to rely on art.\u00a0317 C.C.Q. by analogy so as to order an equitable partition of the family patrimony. Furthermore, more generally when property listed in art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. is held in trust, arts.\u00a0421 and 422 C.C.Q. may allow the court to correct a potential inequity created by the operation of the trust. Again, it is not necessary to rely on an analogy with art.\u00a0317 C.C.Q. to reach an equitable result in these circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As a remedial set of rules that aims to foster economic equality between spouses, rules relating to family patrimony should be given a generous and liberal interpretation to favour the inclusion of property in the value to be partitioned between the spouses. This principle should guide the interpretation of art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. and its application, even if the record does not demonstrate that one of the spouses was in a position of economic vulnerability. Care should be taken not to adopt an interpretation of the rules governing the family patrimony that would create a breach in the protection guaranteed by the law to vulnerable spouses.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the fact that the spouses were pursuing a legitimate objective in organizing their affairs the way they did is not a bar to inclusion of a residence not directly owned by them in the partition of the family patrimony. In so far as the intention to use a property as a residence of the family has been established, art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. does not require any further demonstration of intention to avoid the rules of the family patrimony. These rules are protective public order rules, in that they are imposed by the legislature to safeguard the interests of vulnerable parties and to insure a certain equity within the institution of marriage. Accordingly, the operation of these rules will not depend on the behaviour, intention or good faith of the parties during their contractual relationship. This does not mean that the intention of the spouses is never relevant when applying art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. to a family residence. The intention of the spouses is essential to characterize a property as a residence of the family within the meaning of art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The public order character of the rules governing the family patrimony does not eliminate the freedom of spouses to acquire, sell or choose never to own the property included in the family patrimony per art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. Neither the constitution of the family patrimony nor its partition alters the rights of ownership held by each spouse in relation to their property. Spouses generally remain free to manage and dispose of their property included in the family patrimony, although certain specific rules will nonetheless limit their freedom to do so. Spouses also need not acquire property falling under the family patrimony provisions, and neither spouse is obligated to own the property enumerated in s.\u00a0415 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. While family patrimony provisions are intended to protect economically disadvantaged spouses, spouses are free to acquire and dispose of property as they wish, even if this means that they do not acquire property falling within the family patrimony. Included in the spouses\u2019 freedom to choose how they arrange their affairs is the option to live in a residence held by a trust. Where spouses opt for the various advantages and disadvantages associated with the legal institution of the trust, it may be that they will not acquire property that is subject to the family patrimony.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where spouses reside in a property owned by a trust, there may be situations in which this arrangement gives rise to \u201crights which confer use\u201d of the property under art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. When such questions arise, the situation must be analyzed on the basis of the legislative provisions governing both the institutions of the trust and the family patrimony. There is agreement with the majority\u2019s rejection of the reliance on an analogy with the lifting of the corporate veil under art.\u00a0317 C.C.Q. To determine whether a right which confers use exists where a residence is owned by a trust, courts must consider the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the trust, its intended purpose, and the rights and obligations of the trustees and beneficiaries under the terms of the trust deed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is disagreement with the majority, which would hold that the level of control attributed to a trustee will determine whether there is a right which confers use. As a general rule, though the powers with which the trustee is charged under the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec are significant, they do not constitute a right which confers use. The trustee has the control and exclusive administration of the trust patrimony but such a role imposes duties and obligations. These powers must be exercised in the best interest of the beneficiaries and in keeping with the purpose of the trust. Powers must not be conflated with rights. It is rather the interests of the beneficiary that are more likely to give rise to a right which confers use under art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. It is important to look both to the trust deed and to the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec in order to gain a full picture of the protections afforded to the beneficiaries. The interpretation of the trust deed pursuant to the rules of contractual interpretation must include an analysis of the parties\u2019 objectives in establishing the trust, along with the trustee\u2019s obligations and the rights of beneficiaries under the terms of the deed. While a deed may entrust a trustee with significant powers, these are circumscribed by the trust provisions of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec. For instance, a trustee must perform his or her duties in keeping with the purpose of the trust and cannot do so for his or her own benefit or in an arbitrary manner.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is also disagreement with the majority that the intention of the spouses in setting up a trust should have no bearing on the determination of whether there are any rights which confer use. The intention in establishing a trust will be relevant insofar as it informs the purpose of the trust. Where a trust has no legitimate purpose beyond evading the family patrimony rules, the powers actually exercised by the trustee might exceptionally be construed, on the facts of that case, as a right which confers use. For instance, where a residence owned by a trust previously belonged to one of the spouses and there has been no change in circumstances in the intervening years apart from the transfer to the trust, a right which confers use may exist under art.\u00a0415 C.C.Q. Such a situation may indicate that the transfer to the trust had the purpose of evading the family patrimony provisions. However, where the trust has a valid purpose and acquires the residence directly, a closer analysis of the terms of the trust deed and the surrounding circumstances will be necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The arrangement in the instant case is anything but artificial as the record discloses no intention to evade the family patrimony provisions and there is unchallenged evidence that the trust was established for the long\u2011term benefit of the children. The trial judge was content with a literal reading of the trust deed and conflated powers with rights. As such, the trial judge erred in finding that K alone held a right which conferred use. If such a right existed, it was held only by T as beneficiary of the trust or was jointly held by both spouses as a result of a tacit agreement between them and the trust.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: G.B. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Quebec family property rules apply to a family home held by a trust that  one of the spouses controls, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   When  people get married in Quebec, a \u201cfamily patrimony\u201d is created. It usually  includes property such as family homes, cars, and furniture. These can be owned  by both spouses, or by just one spouse. It can also include a family home that  a spouse doesn\u2019t own, but has rights to use. Under Quebec\u2019s <em>Civil Code, </em>\u201crights which confer use\u201d  are included in the family patrimony. If the marriage ends, family patrimony  almost always gets divided equally between the spouses. Mr.  Karam and Ms. Yared got married in 1998. They had four children together. In  2011, Ms. Yared was diagnosed with incurable cancer. Mr. Karam decided to set  up a trust for the benefit of the children.  In  Quebec law, a trust is a patrimony without an owner. It doesn\u2019t belong to  anyone. A trust can have settlors, trustees, and beneficiaries who create,  control, and benefit from it. But the property in the trust never becomes part  of anyone\u2019s personal patrimony. When Mr. Karam set up the trust, he didn\u2019t do  it to avoid any rules of family patrimony. He just wanted to protect the family  assets. In  2012, the spouses put money in the trust to buy a home in Montreal. The home  was worth over $2 million. Mr. Karam said he wanted to buy a house that could  be both the family home and an investment that would benefit the children. In  2014, Ms. Yared left the family home and filed for divorce. She made a will and  divided her estate into four trusts, one for each of the children. She died in  2015, before the divorce was finalized.  Ms.  Yared\u2019s brothers were the liquidators (executors) of her estate. In 2016, they  asked a court to include the value of the home held by the trust in the family  patrimony. If either spouse had owned the home, it would have been part of the  family patrimony. But Mr. Karam said it shouldn\u2019t be included because the trust  owned it. The  trial judge said the value of the home should be included, even though neither  spouse directly owned it. The Court of Appeal disagreed and said it shouldn\u2019t  be included. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the value of the home should be  included in the family patrimony. They said that even though neither spouse  owned the family home, Mr. Karam had \u201crights which confer use\u201d to it. Even though  trustees don\u2019t own the property in a trust, the control they have over it may  give them \u201crights which confer use.\u201d In this case, the majority found that Mr.  Karam had control over the family home. He had the power to decide who could  use the home and who had a right to its value.  The  majority said it didn\u2019t matter whether a spouse transferred the home to a trust  or, as in this case, the trust purchased the home directly. Rules  around family patrimony are rules of \u201cpublic order.\u201d That means people can\u2019t get  around them, for example by signing a contract that says something different.  They apply no matter what. This is because the rules are meant to protect  vulnerable spouses and put them on equal footing when a marriage ends. Trusts are an  example of the effect Canada\u2019s two major legal traditions, common law and civil  law, have on each other. Trusts are a common law concept. But they were  introduced into Quebec civil law with the new <em>Civil Code</em> in the 1990s. A common law trust is a kind of shared  ownership. But a civil law trust is the transfer of property to an independent patrimony  that nobody owns. "

(orally): The appeals should be dismissed, substantially for the reasons of the Court of Appeal save for the matters addressed in obiter. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeals should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court reinstated. Given that the property in dispute is located outside Quebec, the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction to issue the writ of seizure before judgment by garnishment. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Dutch company filed a request for a writ of seizure before judgment by garnishment directed at the sums or movable property belonging to the foreign entity, held by the association on the foreign entity\u2019s behalf. A seizure before judgment is a provisional measure which preserves a plaintiff\u2019s right where there is reason to fear that the recovery of his or her debt is in jeopardy. The effect of seizure by garnishment is to place sums of money and movable property belonging to the debtor under judicial control and to make the garnishee the guardian of that property. Given that a seizure by garnishment is carried out in rem and directly affects the property in question, the private international law rules governing Quebec authorities\u2019 jurisdiction over real actions must be considered. Under art.\u00a03152 C.C.Q., Quebec courts have jurisdiction over a real action if the property in dispute is situated in Quebec. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The nature of the legal relationship between the association and the foreign entity is central to the disposition of the appeals in the instant case. The association and the foreign entity entered into a contract under which the foreign entity mandated the association to bill and collect air navigation charges due to the foreign entity from airlines that have the right to fly in its airspace. The contract establishes a relation of mandate whereby the association acts as mandatary for the foreign entity, the mandator. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The effects of the acts concluded by the mandatary on behalf of the mandator are reflected directly in the mandator\u2019s patrimony. The juridical acts that the mandatary performs with third parties are binding on the mandator. That reality will be reflected in the mandator\u2019s patrimony, since it is the mandator\u2019s patrimony, rather than the mandatary\u2019s, which becomes bound to the third parties\u2019 patrimonies. Where the mandate is performed properly, the mandatary assumes no obligation towards third parties and his or her patrimony is not engaged. In this case, when the association deals with third parties, the effects of those dealings are reflected not in the association\u2019s patrimony, but rather in the foreign entity\u2019s patrimony. Therefore, the seized property forms part of the foreign entity\u2019s patrimony. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where a contract of mandate entails the transfer of goods or property between third parties and the mandatary, the mandatary\u2019s obligation towards the mandator is not a debt. A debt presupposes an owing patrimony. The mandatary acts as the holder, as opposed to the owner, of the property, which he or she must hand over or, in the case of sums, remit to the mandator. The mandatary\u2019s patrimony is affected only in the sense that it is charged with the obligation to hand over the property, or to remit the sums, to the mandator. The property, or the sums, never actually enter the mandatary\u2019s patrimony, because they continue to belong to the mandator. This means that the mandatary\u2019s obligation cannot be a debt, since the mandatary owes nothing. The wording of art.\u00a02185 para.\u00a01 C.C.Q. supports the position that the mandatary does not become the owner of the sums collected and does not owe a debt in an equivalent amount to the mandator. The use of the term \u201cremit\u201d is very telling. In the present case, the association has an obligation to remit the sums it collected to the foreign entity; this obligation is distinct from any debt the association might owe to the foreign entity. Although the payments are collected and held by the association on the foreign entity\u2019s behalf, the sums in the association\u2019s bank account have always belonged and continue to belong to the foreign entity. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In order to determine the geographical location of the property at the time of seizure, it is necessary to consider the impact of banking law, if any, on the relationships between the parties and their obligations. While the intervening contract between a customer that deposits money and a bank is a loan, this fact has no bearing on the capacity in which the customer loans the money to the bank or on the characterization of the relationship that the accountholder may have with a third party. For the purposes of issuing a writ of seizure by garnishment, the patrimonial impact of the contract of mandate between the association and the foreign entity remains unscathed by the fact that the sums to be remitted to the foreign entity were deposited in a bank account. The bank account in this case, although in the association\u2019s name, is for practical purposes equivalent to a trust and the sums were held for the benefit of the association\u2019s mandator. Despite the comingling of funds in the account, the funds remained identifiable and thus continued to belong to the foreign entity. A bank account \u2014 and sums deposited in it \u2014 is located at the branch where the account is held. In this case, the bank account in which the association kept the sums it collected on the foreign entity\u2019s behalf was located in Switzerland. The geographical location of the property in dispute here is therefore Switzerland. An in rem action directed at sums located in Switzerland is beyond the jurisdiction of the Quebec Superior Court. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Cinar Corporation v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court issued written dissenting reasons in  a case decided orally by the majority of judges in December 2019.</strong>\r\n     Instrubel was a Dutch company. It had a dispute about  contracts with the Republic of Iraq. It took the dispute to arbitration (a  non-court process often used to settle international contract cases). In 2003,  Iraq was ordered to pay Instrubel $32 million plus interest. Iraq didn\u2019t pay. In  2013, Instrubel asked a Quebec court for help to get payment. It said Iraq had  money in Quebec. Soon after, it asked the  court to seize money from the International Air Traffic Association (IATA). IATA collected fees from airlines on behalf of  different countries, for the right to fly over and into those countries. One of  the countries IATA collected fees for was Iraq. IATA wasn\u2019t involved in the  fight between Iraq and Instrubel. But its headquarters were in Montreal. This  meant Quebec courts had jurisdiction (power) over it.  Quebec has rules to help make  sure people ordered to pay others actually do so. For example, the court can  order a third party to pay a debt it owes to another person to someone else.  (It can also make the third party hand over certain kinds of property belonging  to the person.) The court can also order the money to be seized to make sure  it\u2019s still there by the time the final decision is given. In this case, IATA  could be ordered not to pay its debt until the court made a final decision.  Then it would either pay it to Instrubel or Iraq, depending on who won the  case. IATA told the court it didn\u2019t have any money or  property that belonged to Iraq. But less than a week before, it held $166  million (US dollars) for the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority. The court said  IATA had to transfer $90 million (Canadian dollars) to a bank account in Quebec.  It would stay there until the final decision. IATA asked for the seizure to be  quashed (canceled). The judge who heard the issue said the money couldn\u2019t be  seized. He said Quebec courts didn\u2019t have jurisdiction (power) to seize money  that was outside of Quebec when the court order was issued. He also said the  money IATA collected for Iraq wasn\u2019t a debt, so it couldn\u2019t be seized under  Quebec law. The Court of Appeal overturned the judge\u2019s decision.  Among other things, it said the money could be seized and said it was a debt. It  said the debt legally existed at IATA\u2019s headquarters in Montreal. This was true  even if the money was collected in another place and was held in a bank account  somewhere else.  The Supreme Court decided this case \u201cfrom the bench\u201d  right after the hearing on December 11, 2019.  When a case is decided \u201cfrom the bench,\u201d it means an  oral decision is given right away. The parties don\u2019t have to wait for a written  decision, which takes some time (an average of about five months in 2019).  About a third of decisions were given from the bench in 2019. When a case is decided from the bench, the Court will sometimes  give a written explanation (reasons) later. This can be done to make things  more clear. In most cases, though, there won\u2019t be written reasons. This doesn\u2019t  mean there is no explanation. When giving the oral decision, the Court might  give a short explanation, or say something like, \u201cwe allow (or dismiss) this  appeal substantially for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.\u201d That means it\u2019s  relying on the reasons of the lower court, which basically got it right. In this case, the majority of judges dismissed Iraq\u2019s  and IATA\u2019s appeals \u201csubstantially for the reasons of the Court of Appeal.\u201d They  didn\u2019t give their own written reasons. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision stayed in  effect. That meant the money could be seized from IATA. One judge disagreed and said she  would give written reasons later. It doesn\u2019t happen often that there are only written  reasons for a dissent, when a judgment is from the bench. But dissent is an  important part of Canada\u2019s judicial process.  This case was about  enforcing an international arbitration decision. Quebec courts weren\u2019t involved  in the original decision. But they heard the case because it was important to  support international arbitration. This included support to make sure awards  got paid."

The Indemnity was agreed to by the parties pursuant to the settlement of litigation brought by two First Nations in relation to the mercury waste contamination of two rivers caused by the operation of the Dryden mill.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Twenty\u2011six years later, the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change issued a remediation order in relation to monitoring and maintaining a mercury waste disposal site at the Dryden mill. In the intervening period, ownership of the mill had changed hands in several transactions. The Director\u2019s order was issued to both Resolute, Great Lakes\u2019 corporate successor, and Weyerhaeuser, who also owned the Dryden Property for a time. Weyerhaeuser commenced an action in Superior Court, seeking a declaration that the terms of the Indemnity required Ontario to compensate it for the cost of complying with the Director\u2019s order. Resolute sought leave to intervene in order to claim the same protection. Weyerhaeuser, Resolute and Ontario each moved for summary judgment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The motion judge held that the Indemnity applied to a statutory claim brought by an agent of the Province and that both Resolute and Weyerhaeuser were entitled to indemnification for their costs of complying with the Director\u2019s order. He therefore granted summary judgment in their favour. Ontario appealed. The majority at the Court of Appeal agreed with the motion judge\u2019s finding that the Indemnity applied to the Director\u2019s order, but held that Resolute was not entitled to indemnification and remitted Weyerhaeuser\u2019s entitlement to indemnification to the Superior Court. The dissenting judge would have allowed Ontario\u2019s appeal.\u00a0In his view, the motion judge made reversible errors in his interpretation of the Indemnity; properly construed, the Indemnity was intended to cover only pollution claims brought by third parties, not first party regulatory claims such as the Director\u2019s order. Ontario, Weyerhaeuser and Resolute appeal to the Court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting in part): Ontario\u2019s appeal should be allowed and summary judgment granted in its favour. Resolute and Weyerhaeuser\u2019s appeals should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The Indemnity does not cover the Director\u2019s order. As the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal concluded, the motion judge made palpable and overriding errors of fact and failed to give sufficient regard to the factual matrix when interpreting the scope of the Indemnity, justifying appellate intervention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The motion judge erred when he found that the waste disposal site continues to discharge mercury into the environment. His mistaken finding that discharges of mercury from the waste disposal site were an ongoing source of serious environmental liability undoubtedly drove his conclusion that these discharges could give rise to pollution claims, and that unless the Indemnity covered first party claims, Resolute and Weyerhaeuser would be exposed to significant liability. The motion judge misconstrued the purpose and effect of the waste disposal site \u2014 this site was not a source of ongoing mercury contamination or environmental liability, and therefore its creation would not give rise to a pollution claim. Rather, the waste disposal site was created and used as a solution to the mercury pollution problem, effectively as a burial site for mercury\u2011contaminated waste. There was no evidence of mercury\u2011contaminated waste being discharged from the waste disposal site. This erroneous factual finding was key to his conclusion that the Director\u2019s order was a pollution claim within the meaning of the Indemnity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the Indemnity was a schedule to a broader settlement agreement, so its scope was limited to the issues defined in that agreement, namely the discharge by Reed and its predecessors of mercury and any other pollutants into the river systems, and the continued presence of any such pollutants discharged by Reed and its predecessors in the related ecosystems. The motion judge failed to consider this context when interpreting the scope of the Indemnity. Properly interpreted, the Indemnity was intended to cover only proceedings arising from the discharge or continued presence of mercury in the related ecosystems, not those related to the mere presence of mercury contained in the waste disposal site.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Indemnity must be read in the context of two prior indemnities given by Ontario in 1979 and 1982 in the context of the litigation brought by the First Nations. The Indemnity was given in partial consideration for Great Lakes and Reed releasing Ontario from its obligations under those prior indemnities. It is clear that the 1979 and 1982 indemnities were in response to the ongoing litigation, which involved claims brought by third parties, not by Ontario directly. There is no language in those indemnities that would imply Ontario intended to provide protection against the costs of regulatory compliance.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The motion judge\u2019s view of the importance of the phrase \u201cstatutory or otherwise\u201d in the Indemnity and of why the parties entered into the Indemnity was materially affected by a palpable and overriding factual error. The motion judge found that the Indemnity was provided in consideration for commitments from Great Lakes to make significant financial investments in the Dryden plant. Given what he found to be the rationale for entering into the Indemnity, the motion judge concluded that it would be commercially absurd if Ontario could still impose remediation costs. However, Great Lakes\u2019 financial commitments were actually provided as part of the prior 1979 indemnity. Later, Great Lakes gave no new commitments to modernize in consideration for the Indemnity. The motion judge thus premised his interpretation of the Indemnity on an incorrect factual basis \u2014 one that led him to place too much emphasis on a change in language and misconstrue the bargain actually struck in the Indemnity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The motion judge also erred by failing to consider the Indemnity as a whole when determining whether or not the Director\u2019s order fell within its scope. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Indemnity are critical to its interpretation. Paragraph 2 provides that in any pollution claim, Ontario has the right to elect to take carriage of the defence or to participate in the defence and/or settlement of the claim and any proceeding relating thereto as it deems appropriate. Paragraph 3 requires the parties to cooperate with Ontario in the defence of a claim. These clauses would be utterly meaningless for first party claims. Their inclusion is completely inconsistent with the notion that para.\u00a01 of the Indemnity contemplates first party claims. Nothing in the Indemnity suggests that pollution claims included both first and third party claims, but that the requirements of paras.\u00a02 and 3 would apply only to the subset of pollution claims brought by third parties. To the contrary, para.\u00a02 applies in \u201cany Pollution Claim\u201d. The fact that the requirements of paras.\u00a02 and 3 would be utterly meaningless in first party claims implies that pollution claims encompass only those brought by third parties. Properly interpreted, the Indemnity only applies to third party claims, and therefore does not cover the Director\u2019s order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting in part): The appeals brought by Ontario and Weyerhaeuser should be dismissed and the appeal brought by Resolute should be allowed. The Indemnity enures to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Province, Reed and Great Lakes. Resolute is entitled to rely on the Indemnity to cover past and future costs incurred in complying with the Director\u2019s order as a corporate successor of Great Lakes, but Weyerhaeuser is neither an assignee of the benefit of the Indemnity nor a corporate successor of either Great Lakes or Reed, and it has no entitlement to benefit under the Indemnity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Indemnity is a contract which must be interpreted with a view to ascertaining the objective intentions and reasonable expectations of the contracting parties with respect to the meaning of the contractual provision. The approach is rooted in practicalities and common sense. It considers the language that the parties employed to express their agreement, objective evidence of the background facts that was or reasonably ought to have been within the knowledge of both parties at or before the date of contracting, and the principle of commercial reasonableness and efficacy. The factual matrix cannot overwhelm the words of the contract and cannot change the words of the contract in a manner that would modify the rights and obligations that the parties assumed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Indemnity covers the costs of complying with the Director\u2019s order. The motion judge did not make any of the four errors alleged by the Province in interpreting the Indemnity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, he did not err in failing to consider the text of the Indemnity with reference to the factual matrix, including the two earlier indemnities, the asset purchase agreement in which Reed sold the entire property to Great Lakes, the settlement agreement to which the Indemnity was a schedule, and certain provisions added to the Environmental Protection Act in 1985. Like the Indemnity, the two earlier indemnities addressed the mercury contamination, but they represent distinct agreements given for distinct purposes in distinct sets of negotiations. The Indemnity captures a broad scope relative to the other indemnities. In addition, the earlier indemnities were replaced by the Indemnity, which suggests that the parties themselves did not view those earlier indemnities as being co\u2011extensive in scope with the Indemnity. The Indemnity is a separate agreement and must be interpreted by considering the words the parties used in it, not a previous agreement. The asset purchase agreement is of substantially the same scope as the Indemnity, but it exempted the costs of complying with an earlier regulatory order. The Province was aware of its terms, and nothing prevented the parties to the Indemnity from expressly providing that such orders would not fall within the scope of the Indemnity, as the parties to the asset purchase agreement had done. As to the settlement agreement, the issues which that agreement was intended to address included government actions taken in consequence of the mercury contamination. Further, the Indemnity expressly applies in respect of the presence of mercury in the affected lands, and the settlement agreement cannot overwhelm the text in the Indemnity. As for the statutory amendments, even accepting that they are objective and admissible evidence of what the parties had or ought to have had in contemplation when entering into the Indemnity, it is a far leap to the conclusion that they would have understood the reference to statutory claims in the Indemnity to refer solely to claims brought under the amendments or other third party statutory claims which could have been brought at that time. Moreover, reading the Indemnity as excluding first party claims cannot be reconciled with the amendments\u2019 creation of a right of action for the Province, or the Indemnity\u2019s references to \u201cany province\u201d and statutory actors.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, the motion judge did not err in failing to interpret the indemnification clause in para.\u00a01 of the Indemnity in light of the agreement as a whole. His reading of that clause was consistent with the notice/control and cooperation provisions at paras.\u00a02 and 3 of the Indemnity, which are typical of third party indemnities and are meaningful only for third party claims against the indemnified parties.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Third, the motion judge did not make any palpable and overriding errors in characterizing the reason Great Lakes expended certain money or in concluding that the waste disposal site was the source of the mercury contamination. To the extent that these were errors, they could not possibly have had an overriding effect on the conclusion reached by the motion judge. Such minor and collateral factual findings could not determine the outcome of the case, particularly where the motion judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion on the scope of the Indemnity rested on different factual and contextual considerations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Fourth, the motion judge did not err in interpreting the Indemnity so as to impermissibly fetter the legislature\u2019s law\u2011making powers, thereby rendering the Indemnity unenforceable. As a matter of constitutional law, the executive of the Canadian state cannot bind or restrict the legislature\u2019s sovereign law\u2011making power, whether by contract or otherwise. It follows that a contract entered into by the executive that purports to require that a certain law be enacted, amended or repealed cannot be enforced by way of injunction or specific performance. However, there is an important difference between a contract that impermissibly fetters the legislature\u2019s power to enact, amend and repeal legislation, and a contract whose breach by the Crown exposes it to liability. Where the legislature exercises its law\u2011making power in a manner inconsistent with the terms of a contract, the Crown may still face consequences in the form of liability in damages. While the possibility of such liability may deter the legislature from acting in a manner that runs contrary to the Crown\u2019s contractual promises \u2014 sometimes referred to as an \u201cindirect fetter\u201d \u2014 the legislature is not thereby truly fettered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the enactment of new statutory claims might expose the Province to greater liability under the Indemnity, but the Indemnity in no way prevents the legislature from exercising its sovereign authority to make or unmake any law whatever, and deterring or otherwise discouraging the legislature from exercising its law\u2011making power in a certain way would not render it unenforceable at law. The legislature\u2019s freedom of action is not impacted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As to whether Resolute and Weyerhaeuser could benefit from the Indemnity as successors and assigns of Great Lakes, the motion judge made no error in interpreting the Indemnity as covering the costs imposed on the successors and assigns of Great Lakes by the Director\u2019s order. Although his analysis on this point was rooted primarily in the wording of the Indemnity, he also considered its meaning in light of the agreement as a whole and the circumstances surrounding its formation in 1985. However, he found that neither supported an interpretation of the Indemnity that would exclude coverage for first party claims.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the motion judge did err in principle in holding that a predecessor of Resolute had assigned the benefit of the Indemnity to Weyerhaeuser. He failed to read the impugned contractual term in light of the factual matrix and in a commercially sensible way, focussing his analysis solely on the text of the relevant provisions of the asset purchase agreement between the predecessor and Weyerhaeuser. Although an indemnified party cannot continue to enjoy the benefit of the Indemnity after it assigns its rights thereunder to a third party, the parties structured the agreement in a way that imposed all risk in relation to environmental liabilities on the predecessor while the predecessor relinquished its own protection. This risk\u2011allocation structure makes commercial sense only if the predecessor\u2019s interests remained protected by the Indemnity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The motion judge also committed a palpable and overriding error when he concluded that the Indemnity\u2019s enurement clause extended the benefit of the Indemnity to successors\u2011in\u2011title of the Dryden property. The Indemnity\u2019s enurement clause is a standard contractual term and certainty in commercial transactions is best protected where courts give effect to the common understanding and inclusion of such terms in contracts, absent any indication that the parties intended them to have a different effect. When used in relation to corporations, a \u201csuccessor\u201d generally denotes another corporation which, through some type of legal succession, assumes the burdens and becomes vested with the rights of the first corporation. Nothing in the language of the Indemnity or in the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract suggests that \u201csuccessor\u201d in the Indemnity should extend to both corporate successors of Great Lakes and successors\u2011in\u2011title to the Dryden property. However, it may be possible, in other circumstances, for the term \u201csuccessors\u201d to refer to a successor\u2011in\u2011title.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Sattva Capital Corp.\u00a0v.

        "citation": "2019 SCC 60",
        "summary": "<strong>Companies are responsible for the cost of complying  with environmental orders, not the government, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   In the 1960s, there was a pulp and paper mill in  Dryden, Ontario. A plant on the site produced chemicals to bleach the paper. The  process involved using mercury. At the end of the process, the waste was dumped  into nearby rivers. The mercury flowed downstream, where it poisoned people.  Residents of the Grassy Narrows and Islington First Nations suffered serious,  long-term health effects. In 1977, two First Nations bands sued for damage from  the mercury contamination. By the late 1970s, the mill and plant were owned by a  company called Reed. Another company, Great Lakes Forest Products, was  interested in buying the properties. But it wasn\u2019t sure about buying because of  the lawsuit. A site had been built to safely bury the waste. Samples were taken  and tested regularly to make sure there were no leaks. But Great Lakes didn\u2019t  want to be held responsible for past pollution. The provincial government was afraid the local economy  would suffer if the pulp and paper mill closed, so it wanted the sale to go  through. It said it would give Great Lakes an \u201cindemnity.\u201d An indemnity is a  kind of financial protection. In this case, the government agreed to cover costs  above $15 million to settle legal claims for past pollution. In exchange, Great  Lakes agreed to spend about $200 million to expand and upgrade the mill. The  sale, with the indemnity agreement, went through in 1979.  The First Nations\u2019 lawsuit ended in 1985. As part of  the settlement, the government gave Great Lakes and Reed a new indemnity. It  covered all claims due to previous pollution damage, including the mercury. It replaced  the one from 1979 (and another from 1982). It applied to anyone who might take  over the mill later. In 2009, Bowater owned the waste disposal site, which  was now separate from the mill. It filed for bankruptcy. As part of this  process, a court allowed it to abandon the site in 2011. But the Ontario Ministry  of the Environment said Bowater and Weyerhaeuser (the previous owner) still had  responsibilities. It ordered them to repair the waste disposal site, keep  monitoring and testing, and take steps to prevent and deal with leaks. Weyerhaeuser said the indemnity  from the 1985 settlement applied to the order. It said the provincial  government had to pay for all the costs of complying. Bowater, which had become  Resolute Forest Products, said the same thing.  The motion judge said the indemnity applied to the  order. That meant the government had to cover the cost. The majority at the  Court of Appeal said it applied but Resolute couldn\u2019t claim it. It said the  lower court should decide whether Weyerhaeuser could. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the  indemnity didn\u2019t apply to the order. That meant Resolute and Weyerhaeuser had to  cover the costs of complying with it. The majority noted that the 1985 agreement didn\u2019t say  the government would cover the company\u2019s costs of following environmental  rules. It also wasn\u2019t meant to cover claims between the government and the  company. It was only supposed to cover claims by third parties (that is, people  who didn\u2019t sign the agreement). The majority noted that the indemnity referred to  \u201cpollution claims.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t a pollution claim. There were no leaks and  so no new pollution had happened. The order was about monitoring and testing to <em>prevent</em> more pollution. The majority  said the indemnity was meant to cover claims for new pollution or for mercury  already present in the environment from before. It didn\u2019t mean claims for the  mercury safely contained in the waste disposal site. The motion judge said  mercury was leaking from the site, but this was a mistake.  The  motion judge also said that the government gave the indemnity in 1985 as part  of an exchange. In return, Great Lakes would invest in the Dryden plant. But  this was a mistake. Great Lakes had already agreed to make this investment in  1979. It didn\u2019t make any new commitments for the 1985 indemnity. The motion  judge made his decision on the wrong facts, so the majority at the Supreme  Court was allowed to change it.  This case dealt with  a company that was going bankrupt. Companies can still be responsible for  following environmental rules even when they go bankrupt."

A police officer employed by the city, who had been designated as an inspector by the authority responsible for the subway system (\u201cSTM\u201d), ordered her several times to hold the handrail, since the STM taught police officers that holding the handrail was an obligation under a by\u2011law. K refused to comply and to identify herself. The police officer arrested her and searched her bag. He gave her a statement of offence for disobeying a pictogram indicating that the handrail should be held, which the STM had posted near the escalator pursuant to its By\u2011law R\u2011036, and another statement of offence for hindering the police in their duties. After being acquitted in the Municipal Court, K instituted a civil liability action against the police officer, his employer and the STM, arguing that the arrest was unlawful and unreasonable and that it constituted a fault because holding the handrail was not an obligation under a by\u2011law, but simply a warning. The trial judge dismissed the action, finding that the police officer had not committed any civil fault and that it was K who had behaved in an inconceivable manner by refusing to comply with the officer\u2019s order. A majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed that decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A reasonable police officer in the same circumstances would not have considered failure to hold the handrail to be an offence. The police officer therefore committed a fault when he arrested K. The STM committed a fault by teaching police officers that the pictogram in question imposed an obligation to hold the handrail, a fault that explains \u2014 at least in part \u2014 the officer\u2019s conduct. Finally, as the officer\u2019s principal, the city must be held liable for his fault. As for K, she was entitled to refuse to obey an unlawful order, and she therefore committed no fault that would justify an apportionment of liability.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To carry out their mission of maintaining peace, order and public security, police officers are required to limit citizens\u2019 rights and freedoms using the coercive power of the state. Because the risk of abuse is undeniable, it is important that there always be a legal basis for the actions taken by police officers; in the absence of such justification, their conduct is unlawful and cannot be tolerated. In exercising their powers, police officers are therefore bound by strict rules of conduct that are meant to prevent arbitrariness and unjustified restrictions on rights and freedoms. Police officers who deviate from these rules have no public law immunity. Under Quebec law, a police officer, like any other person, is held civilly liable for the injury caused to another by his or her fault, in accordance with art.\u00a01457 C.C.Q., which imposes on every person \u201ca duty to abide by the rules of conduct incumbent on him, according to the circumstances, usage or law, so as not to cause injury to another\u201d. A police officer commits a civil fault where he or she acts in a manner that departs from the conduct of a reasonable officer in the same circumstances. Police conduct must be assessed according to the test of the normally prudent, diligent and competent police officer in the same circumstances; this test recognizes the largely discretionary nature of police work.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The standard of conduct that a reasonable police officer is expected to meet corresponds to an obligation of means: it is not enough to show that the officer\u2019s conduct was unlawful. Nevertheless, the mere fact that there is a legal basis for a police officer\u2019s actions does not necessarily exempt the officer from civil liability. Police officers are obliged to have an adequate knowledge and understanding of criminal and penal law, of the offences they are called upon to prevent and repress and of the rights and freedoms protected by the Charters. They must be able to exercise judgment with respect to the applicable law and cannot rely blindly on the training and instructions received, which, although they must be considered in assessing an officer\u2019s conduct, are not conclusive in themselves. Police officers cannot avoid personal civil liability simply by arguing that they were merely carrying out an order that they knew or ought to have known was unlawful. Therefore, they will sometimes commit a civil fault if they act unlawfully, even where their conduct is otherwise consistent with the training and instructions received, with existing policies, directives and procedures and with the usual practices. It is all a matter of context: the question is whether a reasonable police officer would have acted in the same manner. Police officers will generally not be civilly liable for enforcing a provision\u00a0\u2014 presumed to be valid at the time of the events\u00a0\u2014 that is subsequently declared invalid, provided that they do not otherwise commit a fault in exercising their powers. However, it does not follow that the existence in law\u00a0\u2014 or the scope\u00a0\u2014 of an offence must be assumed in a civil liability action on the basis of bare assertions to this effect made by the state, a legal person established in the public interest or one of their representatives.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, the police officer committed a civil fault by ordering K to identify herself and by arresting her and conducting a search based on a non\u2011existent offence, namely disobeying the pictogram indicating that the handrail should be held. A reasonable police officer in the same circumstances would not have concluded that disobeying the pictogram was an offence under a by\u2011law. Before depriving K of her liberty, the officer had to ensure that there was valid legal justification for his actions. A reasonable police officer would have concluded that the pictogram simply advises users to be careful, despite the training received. Therefore, the officer\u2019s conduct necessarily constituted a fault insofar as it resulted from an unreasonable belief in the existence of an offence that did not exist in law. As principal, the city is also bound to make reparation for the injury caused, pursuant to arts.\u00a01463 and 1464 C.C.Q., because it is not in dispute that the police officer was acting in the performance of his duties when the fault was committed, even though his conduct was also unlawful.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As for the STM, it has no public law immunity. The general rules of extracontractual civil liability are, in principle, applicable to a legal person established in the public interest, unless that person shows that a specific rule of public law derogates from them. A legal person established in the public interest does not incur civil liability where it makes or passes a regulation or by\u2011law that is subsequently held to be invalid, unless its decision to do so was made in bad faith or was irrational. It may nonetheless be civilly liable if it makes an error of law in implementing its own regulations or by\u2011laws. In the instant case, the training provided to police officers by the STM is part of the implementation of By\u2011law R\u2011036. In this respect, the STM cannot avoid the rules in art.\u00a01457 C.C.Q. It committed a direct fault in the implementation of the by\u2011law by providing training that suggested to police officers called upon to enforce its by\u2011laws that holding the handrail was an obligation pursuant to a by\u2011law. Once the STM undertook to provide police officers with training, it had to ensure that the training would be appropriate and that it would reflect the law. If the police officer was at fault for believing that holding the handrail was an obligation, the STM was equally at fault for misinterpreting the by\u2011law and providing training accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The STM is also liable as mandator for the police officer\u2019s fault. The designation of a police officer as a subway inspector creates a legal relationship analogous to that of mandate within the meaning of art.\u00a02130 para.\u00a01 C.C.Q., in which a public transit authority may incur civil liability to a third person. In enforcing the by\u2011laws of a public transit authority, a police officer ipso\u00a0facto represents that authority in the performance of a juridical act, which must be interpreted broadly. This conclusion in no way compromises the autonomy that a police officer has in exercising his or her powers. If a police officer can be characterized as a subordinate, there is no reason why he or she could not be a mandatary under the rules of civil liability\u00a0\u2014 a relationship that does not require any relationship of subordination.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 K was entitled to refuse to obey an unlawful order and therefore committed no fault that would justify an apportionment of liability under art.\u00a01478 para.\u00a02 C.C.Q. Unless a statutory provision or common law rule clearly imposes it, there is no obligation to identify oneself to, or indeed to cooperate with, a police officer. To conclude that K must be apportioned a share of the liability would amount to saying that there is, in all circumstances, a rule of conduct requiring compliance with an unlawful order given by a police officer, even where the order is based on an offence that simply does not exist in law. A well\u2011informed person whose rights are infringed must be able to respond\u00a0\u2014 within reason\u00a0\u2014 without being held civilly liable. Similarly, K cannot be faulted for not doing anything to mitigate the injury she suffered. A reasonable, prudent and diligent person is not under an obligation to obey an unlawful order. The duty to mitigate must sometimes be displaced where it conflicts with respect for rights and freedoms. In a free and democratic society, no one should accept\u00a0\u2014 or expect to be subjected to\u00a0\u2014 unjustified state intrusions. Interference with freedom of movement, just like invasion of privacy, must not be trivialized.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: Godin v.

        "summary": "<strong>Police weren\u2019t allowed to arrest someone for not holding an escalator  handrail, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   In  2009, Ms. Kosoian went into a subway (metro) station on her way to downtown  Montreal. There was a sign by the escalator saying \u201ccaution\u201d and \u201chold handrail,\u201d  with a picture of someone holding a handrail. While going down the escalator,  Ms. Kosoian was looking in her bag for money to buy her ticket. She wasn\u2019t  holding the handrail. Constable Camacho saw her and told her to hold the  handrail. She didn\u2019t, because she didn\u2019t think she had to. When she got to the  bottom, Constable Camacho stopped her. He asked her to follow him into a holding  room so he could give her a ticket for her conduct. She refused, because she  didn\u2019t think she had done anything wrong. Constable Camacho and another officer  grabbed her and took her to the room. They asked her for identification. She  said no, and asked to call a lawyer.  Constable Camacho said Ms. Kosoian was under arrest.  The officers handcuffed her and forced her to sit on a chair with her hands  crossed behind her back. They searched her bag without permission. She was  upset, but calmed down when the officers told her there was a surveillance  camera in the room. They gave her two fines amounting to hundreds of dollars.  The fines were for disobeying the picture and preventing the officers from  doing their jobs.  The next day, Ms. Kosoian\u2019s spouse filed a complaint  with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de Montr\u00e9al (STM), which ran the subway. He asked  for the surveillance tapes. The STM never responded, and the tapes were  automatically erased after five days. Ms. Kosoian went to a doctor, who said  she had post-traumatic stress and a sprained wrist from the incident. She was  later found not guilty in municipal court and didn\u2019t have to pay the fines for  the tickets. Ms.  Kosoian thought the arrest was illegal, and sued. She said Constable Camacho,  his employer (the City of Laval), and the STM were all responsible.  The  trial judge and the majority at the Court of Appeal said Constable Camacho didn\u2019t  act wrongly, based on the information and training he had. They said the arrest  wasn\u2019t illegal. They said Ms. Kosoian caused her own problems by not  cooperating. The  Supreme Court unanimously disagreed. It said the picture was a warning. There  was no law saying people had to hold the handrail. Ms. Kosoian didn\u2019t have to  obey the picture. Constable Camacho was wrong to stop and search her for  breaking a law that didn\u2019t exist. The City of Laval was responsible as his  employer. The STM was wrong for not training him properly. The STM taught police officers that pictures in subway  stations showed legal rules. But some were just warnings. Those that were legal  rules and really had to be obeyed had clues. For example, one picture showed  the amount of the fine with an image of a gavel to suggest a court of law (even  though Canadian judges don\u2019t use gavels). The handrail picture didn\u2019t have  this. In any case, there was no government law or by-law saying people had to  hold escalator handrails. The  Court said the STM training partly explained why Constable Camacho believed  holding the handrail was a legal rule, and why he acted the way he did. But police  officers still have to use their own judgment. Before stopping Ms. Kosoian,  Constable Camacho should have made sure he had a real legal basis for doing so.  A reasonable police officer should have known that people didn\u2019t have to hold  handrails. Or at least they should have had some doubt. Police officers are  allowed to assume that rules they are asked to enforce may be enforced. They  aren\u2019t allowed to assume a rule <em>exists</em> just because they are told so. The Court said Constable Camacho and the STM were  equally responsible for what happened. Even if Ms. Kosoian didn\u2019t act in the  best way, she had no legal obligation to hold the handrail. That meant she  didn\u2019t have to cooperate and was allowed to walk away. The Court said Ms.  Kosoian should get $20,000 for the harm she suffered.  This  case was about civil liability for doing something wrong. In a free and  democratic society, police officers can\u2019t interfere with people\u2019s freedoms  except where the law says so. They have to know the law and act within it."

The shipping company opted to purchase a reconditioned crankshaft from a supplier. The parties entered into a contract which was formed in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, the supplier\u2019s place of business. It contained a six\u2011month warranty, and limited the supplier\u2019s liability to \u20ac50,000. The choice of law clause in the agreement indicated that the contract was to be governed by the laws in force at the office of the supplier. Well after the warranty expired, the ship\u2019s main engine suffered a major failure. The shipping company sued the supplier, founding its claim upon a latent defect in the engine parts purchased from the supplier.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge concluded that the crankshaft sold by the supplier contained a latent defect that caused the damage to the ship. She then determined that the dispute was governed by the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d), rather than Canadian maritime law. She was of the view that while the dispute over the sale was related to maritime activities, it was not integrally connected to them. Accordingly, the limitation of liability clause in the parties\u2019 contract was unenforceable and the supplier was liable for the full quantum of damages. The majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part. It found that Canadian maritime law governed the dispute, and hence that the supplier was entitled to rely on the limitation of liability clause, which restricted its liability to \u20ac50,000. The shipping company appeals to the Court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and the trial judge\u2019s conclusions restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe and Martin JJ.: The C.C.Q. governs this dispute. Therefore, the supplier cannot rely on the limitation of liability clause in the parties\u2019 contract. The sale of marine engine parts intended for use on a commercial vessel is sufficiently and integrally connected to navigation and shipping so as to come within federal legislative authority under the federal power enumerated at s.\u00a091(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and therefore be validly governed by Canadian maritime law. However, art.\u00a01733 C.C.Q. which pertains to warranties in contracts of sale, is also a validly enacted provincial law that, in pith and substance, concerns a matter of property and civil rights pursuant to s.\u00a092(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and that remains applicable and operative. The sale of marine engine parts thus gives rise to a double aspect scenario: a non\u2011statutory body of federal law and a provincial law both validly directed at the same fact situation overlap. Neither interjurisdictional immunity nor federal paramountcy ousts the application of art.\u00a01733 C.C.Q.; it is therefore ultimately the law governing this dispute. Since art.\u00a01733 is a legislative enactment, Canadian non\u2011statutory maritime law does not prevail over it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Canadian maritime law is a comprehensive body of federal law, uniform throughout Canada, that purports to govern and to deal with all claims in respect of maritime and admiralty matters, subject only to the scope of the federal power over navigation and shipping under s.\u00a091(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Much of Canadian maritime law is non\u2011statutory law, meaning that its principles are derived from precedent and custom and that it is liable to be developed judicially unless it is supplanted by validly enacted federal legislation. Canadian maritime law exists as a body of law with its own distinct identity, in parallel to the common law. When Canadian maritime law validly governs a dispute, that body of law represents a seamless and ubiquitous web that is capable of resolving any legal dispute falling within the scope of its application because Canadian maritime law develops rules by analogy where a matter falls within its ambit. In order to ascertain whether Canadian maritime law may apply to a dispute, it is necessary to determine whether the matter comes within the scope of navigation and shipping under s.\u00a091(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Canadian maritime law governs any matter that is integrally connected to maritime or admiralty matters. Its non\u2011statutory scope is established by case law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The two stages of the division of powers analysis are characterizing the matter at issue and classifying it according to the different heads of legislative power. This analysis takes on a particular form where navigation and shipping \u2014 and more particularly, Canadian non\u2011statutory maritime law \u2014 is concerned. When it comes to a dispute purportedly governed by Canadian maritime law, courts must determine, on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis, whether Canadian maritime law can validly extend to that dispute. Where the purportedly applicable Canadian maritime law is non\u2011statutory, characterization is crucial; the matter should be characterized by looking at the substantive law at issue and to the particular fact situation. Where the dispute is one in contract, what matters is the nature of the agreement at issue \u2014 as understood in light of the terms of the contract, its purpose, and the circumstances in which it was formed. The matter must always be characterized with precision for the sufficiency of the connection with the federal power over navigation and shipping to be properly assessed. The maritime context at issue must be identified narrowly enough to make it possible to determine, at the classification stage, whether the matter comes within the federal power over navigation and shipping. In the present case, the matter at issue can be characterized, with sufficient precision, as the sale of marine engine parts intended for use on a commercial vessel.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second stage, described as classification, requires courts to determine the classes of subjects into which the matter falls. It may require considering the scope of the relevant head of power. The application of specific tests stating the scope of the particular powers is rather common and often necessary to the proper working of the division of powers. Parliament\u2019s power over navigation and shipping has been broadly construed in recognition of the national importance of the maritime industry, thereby permitting the development of uniform legal rules that apply across Canada. However, broad federal powers must necessarily be kept within proper bounds, especially where they have the potential to overlap significantly with provincial powers, as with navigation and shipping. This head of power is not defined by reference to a discrete area of law but instead covers activities. Consequently, Parliament can legislate, through public law and private law rules, so as to establish the framework of legal relationships arising out of navigation and shipping activities, thereby bringing within federal legislative authority matters that would otherwise fall within provincial legislative authority. Insofar as contract rules and principles are directed at activities that are integral to navigation and shipping, they can come within federal legislative authority. This interpretation of federal legislative authority is specific to navigation and shipping.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The integral connection approach should be used to assist in determining whether a matter properly comes within the navigation and shipping power. The ultimate question is whether the maritime elements of the matter are sufficient to render it integrally connected to the navigation and shipping head of power. This test is important for the purpose of avoiding an encroachment on matters coming within provincial legislative authority and it must be applied rigorously to avoid expanding the federal power over matters that are only remotely related to navigation and shipping. The integral connection test encompasses a number of non\u2011exhaustive factors, which may receive different weight depending on the facts of a given case. In the present case, the factors relevant to the integral connection test overwhelmingly support the view that the sale of marine engine parts intended for use on a commercial vessel is integrally connected to navigation and shipping.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A finding that Canadian maritime law can validly regulate a dispute does not end the analysis in the presence of an overlapping provincial rule. The division of powers analysis that unfolds from the modern conception of federalism expressed in Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, applies to the overlap between navigation and shipping and provincial heads of power, just as it does for other classes of subjects under the Constitution Act, 1867. The double aspect doctrine recognizes that the same fact situations can be regulated from different perspectives, one of which may relate to a provincial power and the other to a federal power. The federal power over navigation and shipping is not watertight and remains subject to this flexible understanding of the division of powers. A valid provincial enactment will be allowed to have incidental effects on a federal head of power unless either interjurisdictional immunity or federal paramountcy are found to apply. It follows that these doctrines must be applied to navigation and shipping in the same way as in all division of powers cases.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The sale of goods is a matter that comes plainly within the provincial power over property and civil rights under s.\u00a092(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The mere fact that such a matter, in the context of a sale of marine engine parts, also falls under the navigation and shipping power does not undermine the validity of the relevant C.C.Q. provisions. In the present case, the sale of marine engine parts for use on a commercial vessel can be addressed both from the broad perspective of regulating the sale of goods, which constitutes an exercise of the provincial power over property and civil rights, and from the narrower perspective of the exercise of the federal power over navigation and shipping. The two sets of contract rules and principles are thus valid.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 According to the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity, the core of exclusive heads of power under the Constitution Act, 1867, can be protected from the effects of a law validly enacted by the other order of government. If the doctrine is found to apply, the impugned provisions remain valid but are declared inapplicable to matters that would fall under the core of the exclusive head of power of the other order of government. For the doctrine to apply, the impugned provision must trench on the core of an exclusive head of power under the Constitution Act, 1867 and the effect of this overlap must impair the exercise of the core of the head of power. It is necessary to identify the essential, vital elements of the head of power in question by reference to the jurisprudence. The core of the head of power is necessarily narrower than the scope of the power, here reflected in the integral connection test. The core of navigation and shipping does not apply to the contractual issues raised by the current claim as it is not essential for the exercise of federal competence over navigation and shipping that only one body of law \u2014 Canadian maritime law \u2014 regulate contracts of sale for commercial marine equipment. Interjurisdictional immunity therefore does not apply in this case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 According to the doctrine of federal paramountcy, when valid provincial and federal legislation are incompatible, the federal law prevails and the provincial law is declared inoperative to the extent of the conflict. The purpose of the federal paramountcy doctrine is to ensure that federal legislative intent will prevail when it conflicts with valid provincial laws. However, to have rules that are created by courts prevail over valid legislation would upset the proper interaction in common law systems between rules created by courts and those enacted by legislative authorities. It would therefore run contrary to the purpose of the paramountcy doctrine to declare that the non-statutory rules of Canadian maritime law can prevail over valid provincial legislation. The paramount position of federal legislative intent over provincial legislative intent in certain circumstances cannot be extended to the law developed by courts who exercise admiralty jurisdiction in Canada. As the rules of Canadian maritime law that would arguably be applicable in this case are non-statutory, this case does not present a conflict between a provincial and a federal law so as to trigger the doctrine of federal paramountcy. Article 1733 C.C.Q. is therefore operative and governs the dispute between the shipping company and the supplier.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella and Brown JJ.: There is agreement with the majority that the C.C.Q. governs the shipping company\u2019s claims and that the appeal should therefore be allowed. However, the division of powers issues raised by this appeal are to be resolved as they are in respect of any head of power \u2014 that is, by applying the pith and substance test. While the claim at issue in this case touches upon issues of navigation and shipping, it raises, in pith and substance, a matter coming within property and civil rights, in relation to which the National Assembly of Quebec exclusively may make laws. Accordingly, by operation of arts.\u00a01729 and 1733 of the C.C.Q., the supplier, as a \u201cprofessional seller\u201d, cannot rely on its contractual limitation of liability, and the shipping company is entitled to the full agreed\u2011upon quantum of damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The pith and substance test applies to determining whether a matter comes within navigation and shipping within the meaning of s.\u00a091(10) of the Constitution Act,\u00a01867, just as it applies to determining whether a matter comes within any other head of power. Applying the pith and substance test typically begins by characterizing an impugned law or provision in order to assign it to a head of power since, in most cases, courts are presented with a law enacted either by Parliament or a provincial legislature, and the parties\u2019 dispute is over whether that law is intra vires or ultra vires its enacting body. However, where, as in this case, there is no law to assign to either of those heads of power but rather a claim for damages and loss of profit, the division of powers analysis requires identification of the subject matter engaged by the claim, which must be assigned to one of the Constitution\u2019s heads of power. Whether the matter is raised by a law or a claim does not change which order of government has the constitutional authority to legislate with respect to the matter. In many cases, identifying the matter at issue will resolve the allocation of the matter to a head of power with little difficulty. Examining a claim, rather than a statute, to determine the matter at issue is frequently required in cases in which it is alleged by one party that a matter falls within Parliament\u2019s authority over navigation and shipping, much of the law relied upon by litigants and courts in navigation and shipping cases is non\u2011statutory. There is disagreement with the majority that the issue is about jurisdiction over a substantive body of law rather than jurisdiction over a claim. The majority analyzes the dispute between the parties (i.e., the law as applied to the facts), which is indistinguishable from characterizing a claim and entails the same inquiry.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Having identified the relevant matter, a court must determine which level of government has legislative authority in relation thereto. Depending on these determinations, however \u2014 the matter and which level of government holds legislative authority \u2014 the analysis as to the applicable law may not end there. Recourse to constitutional doctrines such as paramountcy and interjurisdictional immunity may be necessary. These constitutional doctrines apply to matters said to come within Parliament\u2019s power over navigation and shipping, as they would apply to any matter said to come within any other head of power.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 22 of the Federal Courts Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) does not, and cannot, define the scope of Parliament\u2019s legislative authority over navigation and shipping. It is merely a statutory grant of jurisdiction by Parliament to the Federal Court. While Canadian maritime law is a body of federal law which governs matters falling within s.\u00a091(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867, it is the head of power itself \u2014 that is, navigation and shipping \u2014 which defines the boundaries of federal jurisdiction. Merely because a matter arises in a maritime context does not automatically consign the matter to navigation and shipping. Although s.\u00a022 of the FCA may represent Parliament\u2019s considered view of what constitutes \u201cCanadian maritime law\u201d, it cannot be taken as stating the content of Parliament\u2019s legislative authority over navigation and shipping under s.\u00a091(10). It does not define Canadian maritime law or create operative law. The division of powers inquiry does not end simply because a claim can be shown to fall within s.\u00a022(2); a mere grant of jurisdiction to the Federal Court is ineffective without an existing body of federal law to nourish the statutory grant of jurisdiction. Parliament may not, by enactment, define the scope of its legislative authority so as to displace the operation of the pith and substance test as the means by which a matter is determined to come within or fall outside that legislative authority. The fact of a legislative grant of jurisdiction to the Federal Court is therefore legally insignificant to a division of powers analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where a matter is said to come within Parliament\u2019s legislative authority over navigation and shipping, there is no logical basis to apply a different test based on whether an integral connection to Canadian maritime law is shown. A division of powers analysis always entails applying the pith and substance test. One cannot apply the pith and substance test to determine whether a matter comes within provincial legislative authority, while applying a different test to determine whether it comes within federal legislative authority. The division of powers analysis is a single determination, made by applying a single test, about which heads of power a particular matter comes within. The integral connection test superimposes an additional test onto the pith and substance test; it speaks not to whether a particular activity falls within s.\u00a091(10), but to the depth of the connection between that activity and the federal power over navigation and shipping. No such test exists for the other heads of power, and no such test should be applied in determining whether a matter falls within Parliament\u2019s legislative authority over navigation and shipping.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Concerns for uniformity cannot drive the division of powers analysis. Uniformity of maritime law is an important consideration in deciding the scope of Parliament\u2019s legislative authority over navigation and shipping. It properly drives how matters falling within federal heads of power are treated, particularly where the laws governing such subject matters apply across provincial boundaries. However, uniformity does not drive the prior inquiry into whether matters come within those federal heads of power at all. Concerns for uniform treatment of matters coming within a federal head of power such as navigation and shipping cannot always prevail, so as to oust provincial laws of general application. Section 91(10) is not a watertight compartment granting authority for federal laws whose operation cannot be incidentally affected by provincial heads of power. Such an understanding of s.\u00a091(10) would be squarely opposed to the Court\u2019s jurisprudence on federalism, and to the modern realities of the Canadian federation. The Court has held that the law favours, where possible, the concurrent exercise of power by both levels of government. There is room for the application of provincial laws in the maritime context. Although this leaves the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity with an exceedingly limited role in the division of powers analysis, this is not cause for concern. Interjurisdictional immunity should not be the first recourse in a division of powers dispute \u2014 a broad application of interjurisdictional immunity is inconsistent with the notion of flexible federalism and fails to account for the fact that overlapping powers are unavoidable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Resort to the dominant tide of pith and substance should be favoured over resort to interjurisdictional immunity, which forms a mere undertow of federalism jurisprudence. Attempting to define a core of federal jurisdiction poses dangers, particularly in the context of broad and general heads of federal power that apply to numerous activities. Courts must thus be especially cautious when attempting to define the core of navigation and shipping, as the federal head of power over navigation and shipping is undeniably broad. Interjurisdictional immunity risks creating serious uncertainty and, Parliament can always make its legislation sufficiently precise to leave those subject to it with no doubt as to the application of provincial legislation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While the scope of legislative authority conferred upon Parliament in relation to navigation and shipping is undeniably broad, courts must be careful to ensure that it does not swallow up matters that fall within provincial legislative authority, whether over property and civil rights, or other provincial heads of power. The first step in determining the matter raised by the shipping company\u2019s claim is to characterize the nature of the contract. The claims arising in this case relate to the contractual terms agreed to between the parties pursuant to a contract for the sale of goods. As such, the matter at issue is the sale of goods, albeit in the maritime context. This characterization is consistent with the Court\u2019s past jurisprudence. In cases that concern whether a matter falls within s.\u00a091(10) or 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867, the Court has repeatedly defined the matter as a given area of private law in the maritime context. This characterization also reflects the appropriate degree of precision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The weight of Canadian jurisprudence supports the conclusion that the sale of goods, even in the maritime context, is, in pith and substance, a matter coming within the jurisdiction conferred on provincial legislatures by s.\u00a092(13). Sale of goods in the maritime context did not form part of the historical body of law administered by the English admiralty courts. There is nothing particularly \u201cmaritime\u201d about the sale of goods that would require its consignment to Parliament\u2019s legislative authority. Sale of goods does not involve the safe carriage of goods, shipping, the seaworthiness of a ship, good seamanship, or international maritime conventions, nor are there special rules of procedure governing the sale of goods in the maritime context which would benefit from the uniform application across jurisdictions. Where the provinces have developed a comprehensive body of law governing the sale of goods, there is no good reason for the Court to disregard it merely because the claim arising from a particular sale bears some relation to maritime activities. Such an expansive definition of a federal head of power would be an affront to a principal source of provincial legislative competence to regulate local trade and commerce and, therefore, to the constitutional division of powers, which is the primary textual expression of the principle of federalism in the Canadian Constitution. Accordingly, the claim in this case raises a matter which is, in pith and substance, one of property and civil rights, exclusive legislative authority over which rests with the provincial legislatures under s.\u00a092(13) and the provisions of the C.C.Q., including arts.\u00a01729 and 1733 thereof, govern the dispute. Since the claim raises, in pith and substance, a matter falling solely within s.\u00a092(13), there is no need to consider whether to apply the doctrines of paramountcy or interjurisdictional immunity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Canadian Western Bank v.

        "summary": "<strong>Provincial contract law, not federal maritime law, applied to a contract  for ship-engine parts, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Desgagn\u00e9s  Transport was a shipping company in Quebec. W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 was a company that made  and sold ship engines. In 2006, Desgagn\u00e9s Transport ordered $1 million in parts  from W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 to fix a ship engine. The contract said W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 would only have to  pay up to \u20ac50,000 if the parts didn\u2019t work. Three years later the shiphad a major engine failure. One of the  parts had been faulty all along. Desgagn\u00e9s Transport sued W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 for the cost  of repairing the ship and for its lost profits. The total was over $5.6  million. The  issue in this case was which body of law applied. When parties make a contract,  they can say which  law they want to apply. Since they both agree to it by signing the contract,  courts will generally respect the choice. In this case, the contract didn\u2019t say  which law applied, so the courts had to decide. There were two  possibilities. The first was provincial contract law. In Quebec, this is the  civil law found in the <em>Civil Code</em>. Under  these rules, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 would not be able to limit its liability (its legal  responsibility) by saying so in the contract. This meant it would be liable for  the defective part and would have to pay Desgagn\u00e9s Transport the full cost. The  second possibility was federal maritime law. This is a separate system of law,  like common law or civil law, and covers all kinds of disputes closely tied to  navigation and shipping. If federal maritime law applied, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 wouldn\u2019t be liable  for the defective part. It would only have to pay what the contract said.  The  reason two possible bodies of law could apply was that provincial and federal  governments have different powers. These are set out in Canada\u2019s Constitution. The  Constitution says the federal government has power over navigation and  shipping. Provincial governments have power over property and civil rights. Contracts  usually fall under provincial powers. The trial judge said provincial contract law applied. The  majority of the Court of Appeal said federal maritime law applied.  All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that provincial contract law applied.  (Though some said this for very different reasons.) That meant W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 had to  pay the full $5.6 million. The  majority noted that issues can\u2019t always be divided easily into federal or  provincial powers. In these cases, courts must be flexible. Where there is  overlap, they try to make sure both levels of government have as much of a role  as possible.  The  majority said selling ship-engine parts fell under federal maritime law. This  was because it is closely tied to navigation and shipping, a federal power.  However, selling goods is also covered by property and civil rights, which the  provinces have power over. In constitutional law, a situation like this is  called a \u201cdouble aspect scenario.\u201d It means both levels of government have  power at the same time. If this happens, courts will look at whether there is any  reason why only one government\u2019s power should apply. In constitutional law, two  possible reasons are \u201cinterjurisdictional immunity\u201d and \u201cfederal paramountcy.\u201d \u201cInterjurisdictional  immunity\u201d is when something goes to the core of a power, so the other level of  government isn\u2019t allowed to impair (lessen) it. In that case, one government  has \u201cimmunity\u201d from the other\u2019s power. \u201cFederal paramountcy\u201d applies when laws  passed by federal and provincial governments are at odds. It means federal law  prevails, and the parts of provincial law that go against it aren\u2019t applied.  In  this case, the majority said contracts for ship-engine parts didn\u2019t go to the  core of navigation and shipping. That meant the federal power didn\u2019t have  immunity from the provincial power. So the first reason (interjurisdictional  immunity) didn\u2019t apply. For the second reason, the majority noted that federal  paramountcy is meant to make sure provincial legislatures don\u2019t override the  federal Parliament. But federal maritime law is mostly based on court decisions  and custom, not laws written and passed by Parliament. Court decisions and  custom can\u2019t trump laws created by legislatures, like Quebec\u2019s <em>Civil Code</em>. That meant the second reason,  federal paramountcy, didn\u2019t apply. So, provincial contract law applied and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 had to pay the full  $5.6 million. Maritime law has both common  and civil law roots. It is one of the oldest bodies of law. While maritime  cases used to be heard in their own separate courts, today they are heard by  regular courts. "

The launch was held on the scheduled date and was a success. Following the event, Octane sought payment for the costs incurred for the services provided by a subcontractor to produce and organize the event, but the City was slow to pay. In view of the City\u2019s failure to act, Octane finally sent it an invoice in October 2009. In May\u00a02010, nearly three years after the launch was held, the invoice was still unpaid and Octane instituted an action against the City. The City countered by stating that it had in fact never authorized the mandate, which, for that matter, had not been granted as a result of the tendering process required by law. Octane therefore amended its pleading to add\u00a0T, a member of the political staff of the mayor\u2019s office, as a defendant, arguing that he had given it a mandate to produce the event and had assured it many times that the City would pay the costs incurred.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Superior Court allowed Octane\u2019s action against the City and dismissed the alternative claim against T. It was of the view that T had indeed given Octane a mandate but that the contract was null because it had been awarded in contravention of the rules of public order for awarding municipal contracts. However, it found that the rules on restitution of prestations set out in the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d) apply in the municipal context, and it ordered restitution by equivalence for the services provided in the amount of $82,898.63. The Court of Appeal dismissed the City\u2019s appeal as well as Octane\u2019s appeal against T, which it found to be moot. It upheld the Superior Court\u2019s findings on the issue of the nullity of the contract between Octane and the City and on the application of the rules on restitution of prestations in the municipal context.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The rules on restitution of prestations set out in arts.\u00a01699 to 1707 C.C.Q. apply in the municipal context. The preliminary provision of the C.C.Q. states that the C.C.Q. is the foundation of all other laws that apply or rely on civil law concepts. By virtue of arts.\u00a0300 and 1376 C.C.Q., this includes the laws that govern legal persons established in the public interest, such as municipalities. Since the rules on restitution of prestations are in the Book on Obligations, they apply to municipalities unless other special rules exclude their application. The fact that ss.\u00a0573 et\u00a0seq. of the Cities and Towns Act (\u201cC.T.A.\u201d), which require certain rules to be followed when municipal contracts are awarded, are of public order and that their violation is sanctioned by the absolute nullity of the contract is not an express or even an implicit derogation from the rules on restitution of prestations. In the absence of clear, unequivocal legislative direction to this effect, the importance of the C.T.A.\u2019s public order provisions is not enough to exclude the application of the rules of the general law. Since there is no such derogation, the principle remains the restoration of the parties to their previous positions, which must occur where a juridical act is annulled with retroactive effect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Restitution of prestations in the municipal context does not create a bypass. The rules on restitution of prestations give a judge the power to objectively determine the fair value of restitution in order to restore the parties to their previous positions, based on the evidence in the record and the circumstances of each case, where restitution cannot be made in kind. Article 1699 para.\u00a02 C.C.Q. provides that a court may, exceptionally, refuse the restitution of prestations or modify the scope or modalities of restitution where one party derives an undue advantage from it. The legislature thus ensures that the remedy for a first inequity does not create a second one. Obtaining a municipal contract in violation of the rules of public order for awarding such contracts does not necessarily constitute an undue advantage, and a court hearing such a case must not automatically refuse the restitution of prestations. The appropriateness of tempering restitution under art.\u00a01699 para.\u00a02 C.C.Q. must be assessed on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis and not on the basis of automatic or pre\u2011established rules.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, no contract came into existence between Octane and the City for the event production services. The mandate on which Octane\u2019s action is based was never approved by a resolution of the City\u2019s municipal council or by an officer authorized by a valid delegation of powers. The appearance of consent is not sufficient, nor can a municipality\u2019s consent be inferred from its silence. The rules for awarding municipal contracts require certain formalities to be observed in order to protect the public interest by favouring competition, but they do not exempt a municipality from having to pass a by\u2011law or resolution to express its will to contract. If it does not do so, no contract will cross the threshold of legal existence and restitution cannot be grounded in the retroactive annulment of a juridical act in accordance with the doctrine of nullity. In the case at bar, however, the conditions imposed by the rules on receipt of a payment not due are satisfied, with the result that the parties must still be restored to their previous positions under arts.\u00a01491 and 1492 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Three conditions must be met to recover a payment not due under art.\u00a01491 C.C.Q.: (1)\u00a0there must be a payment, (2)\u00a0the payment must have been made in the absence of a debt between the parties, and (3)\u00a0the payment must have been made in error or to avoid injury. Where these conditions are met, and subject to the exception set out in art.\u00a01491 para.\u00a02 C.C.Q., restitution of payments not due is made according to the rules for the restitution of prestations laid down in arts.\u00a01699 to 1707 C.C.Q. It is truly the receipt of something not due that grounds an obligation to restore the parties to their previous positions. An obligation to make restitution will arise only if the payment was made in error or under protest. However, while error is what usually explains a payment made in the absence of debt, the possibility that a payer acted with full knowledge of the facts cannot be ruled out. The burden of proof rests on the person alleging a liberal intention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The provision of services can constitute payment within the meaning of art.\u00a01553 C.C.Q. The payment of a sum of money\u00a0is not all that can be characterized as a payment in Quebec civil law: art.\u00a01553 C.C.Q. expressly provides that payment also means the performance of whatever forms the object of an obligation. Payment may validly be made by a representative of the debtor of an obligation, such as the debtor\u2019s mandatary or subcontractor, unless the nature or terms of the contract prevent such a delegation. In the instant case, it is clear that the subcontractor was acting on Octane\u2019s behalf in producing the City\u2019s event and that the City did not object to this. The provision of services to the City, that is, payment in the legal sense, therefore originated from Octane. This condition for recovering a payment not due is met.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It does not matter what Octane should or could have done to avoid making an error. The purpose of restitution is not to sanction negligence or fault, but rather to restore the parties to their previous positions where it is shown that one of them received something without having a right to it. The only question is whether the provision of services by Octane resulted from an error and not from a liberal intention. Given the nature of the evidence in the record, it cannot be concluded that Octane had a liberal intention to provide services to the City in the absence of a debt. The testimony of Octane\u2019s representatives confirms that they did in fact believe they had an obligation to provide services for the production of the event and that they had no intention of providing those services for free. Octane would not have provided the services in question if it had known that its obligation to the City did not exist in law. In the absence of any liberal intention by Octane or any other cause that could justify its provision of the services to the City for free, it must be concluded that the services were provided as a result of an error, as required by art.\u00a01491 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Restitution for the services provided by Octane for the production of the City\u2019s event must be made by equivalence in accordance with art.\u00a01700 C.C.Q. The trial judge\u2019s findings concerning the good quality and fair market value of the services provided, the benefit the City derived from them and the fact that the event lived up to expectations were not challenged by the City. Since the City has not proved that full restitution would accord an undue advantage to Octane, restitution by equivalence for the services provided corresponds to the cost of producing the event, $82,898.63.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown JJ. (dissenting): The City\u2019s appeal should be allowed and Octane\u2019s appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article\u00a01385 para.\u00a01 C.C.Q. states that \u201c[a] contract is formed by the sole exchange of consents between persons having capacity to contract, unless, in addition, the law requires a particular form to be respected as a necessary condition of its formation\u201d. Sections 573 et\u00a0seq. of the C.T.A. provide in this regard that certain formalities must be observed in the awarding of municipal contracts. These provisions set out imperative standards of public order, the violation of which is sanctioned by absolute nullity. A services contract with a value of $82,898.63 must be awarded after a call for tenders by written invitation in accordance with the C.T.A. A contract entered into in violation of these rules, if it is in fact formed, may be absolutely null in addition to giving rise to the penalties provided for by the C.T.A. Article 1422 C.C.Q., which sets out the effect of nullity, expressly creates an obligation to make restitution. According to art.\u00a01699 para.\u00a01 C.C.Q., restitution takes place \u201cwhere\u201d (\u201cchaque fois\u201d (each time) in the French version) a juridical act is annulled with retroactive effect. Recent judgments of the Court of Appeal confirm that it is possible to order the restitution of prestations where a municipal contract is annulled.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the annulment of a contract presupposes the existence of the contract. In the present case, the contract on which Octane\u2019s claim is based is quite simply non\u2011existent. In civil law, the existence of a contract is conditional on the manifestation of a will to be bound by contract (arts.\u00a01378 para.\u00a01, 1385 para.\u00a01\u00a0and 1386\u00a0C.C.Q.). Where, objectively speaking, the manifestation of such a will is absent (where there is no offer to contract or where such an offer is refused or not accepted), there is no contract. By\u2011laws and resolutions are the legal vehicles by which a municipality expresses its will. A municipality may, through a by\u2011law passed by its council, delegate to an officer the power to incur obligations on its behalf. However, since only one professional services firm was solicited, no officer of the City had a delegation of powers authorizing him or her to enter into a contract with a value exceeding $25,000. As a result, no duly authorized officer could have incurred an obligation in the amount of $82,898.63 on the City\u2019s behalf.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 T was not invested with any delegation of powers authorizing him to make contracts on the City\u2019s behalf, since he was a member of the political staff of the mayor\u2019s office, not a municipal officer or employee. The non\u2011application in the municipal context of the doctrine of apparent mandate codified at art.\u00a02163 C.C.Q. is a general principle or rule of public law that prevails over the civil law rules, because those rules are merely suppletive in nature in this area (art.\u00a0300 C.C.Q.). It is a control measure enacted in the interest of the public to ensure sound administration and transparency. It is very firmly established that persons wishing to enter into a contract with a municipality must at their peril ascertain that the particular person dealt with is acting pursuant to due authority.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where a contract is non\u2011existent, there can be no restitution of prestations as a consequence of the annulment of an invalid contract (arts.\u00a01422 and 1699 C.C.Q.). In the case at bar, there is no juridical act that can be annulled with retroactive effect. Any obligation to make restitution must rather be justified on a different basis. While recent jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal confirms that it is possible to order the restitution of prestations where a municipal contract is annulled, it is silent on whether it is possible to order the restitution of prestations on the basis of receipt of a payment not due where a party claims to have provided services to a municipality in reliance on a contract it believes it entered into but that turns out not to exist at all.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In civil law, the three conditions for bringing an action to recover a payment not due are: (1)\u00a0the existence of a payment made by the payer to the payee, (2)\u00a0the absence of a debt between the parties, and (3)\u00a0an error by the payer. These three conditions must be interpreted cautiously, if not restrictively, and where they are met, art.\u00a01491 para.\u00a01 C.C.Q. expressly creates an obligation to make restitution, subject to the exception set out in art.\u00a01491 para.\u00a02 C.C.Q. Article\u00a01492 C.C.Q. then requires \u201c[r]estitution of payments not due\u201d to be made according to the rules for the restitution of prestations codified at arts.\u00a01699 to 1707 C.C.Q. In principle, the payer bears the burden of establishing that the conditions for bringing an action to recover a payment not due are met. The payer must first prove the existence of a payment and the absence of a debt. An error by the payer is then presumed to be the most likely explanation for a payment that in itself is inexplicable. The payee must then prove that there was no error by the payer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Octane\u2019s appeal against the City and T should be dismissed. Article\u00a02158\u00a0C.C.Q., which concerns the personal liability of a mandatary who exceeds his or her powers, cannot apply in the particular circumstances of this case, because the onus was on Octane to ensure that the proper procedure would be followed in entering into the contract, that is, to ensure: (1)\u00a0that the person with whom Octane was dealing was authorized to act on behalf of the municipality, (2)\u00a0that the City and its employees were acting within their powers, and (3)\u00a0that all legal requirements for the formation or awarding of the contract were met. Octane cannot shift the onus which rested on it to T. Furthermore, even if T had committed a fault for which he could be extracontractually liable when he gave Octane an assurance that it would be paid, he would not have caused the injury suffered by Octane. There is no causation, because it seems that Octane (1)\u00a0made a first payment to the subcontractor, (2)\u00a0entered into a contract with the subcontractor and (3) provided the services to the City before T gave it any kind of assurance.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: Dor\u00e9 v.

        "summary": "<strong>The City of Montreal had to pay a company for services it provided even  though municipal contract rules weren\u2019t followed, the Supreme Court has said.</strong>\r\n   The  City of Montreal was planning a big event in May 2007 to launch its  transportation plan. Less than a month before the event, city officials  realized they needed help. They contacted Octane, a public relations and  communications firm. Mr. Th\u00e9riault, who worked in the mayor\u2019s office, asked  Octane to do some work. Octane got another company, PGB, to help. Octane sent the  city an estimate for about $83,000 for the work PGB would do. The event was a  success. Octane paid PGB the $83,000. Octane sent invoices to the city for its services. The  city paid three of them, but refused to pay the one for PGB\u2019s work. It said  there was no contract between the city and Octane, and Octane made the contract  with PGB on its own.  In  May 2010, Octane sued the city to get the $83,000. On top of there being no  contract, the city said because the services were for more than $25,000, by law  it had to invite other companies to bid. Because rules were broken, it said the  contract wasn\u2019t allowed and it didn\u2019t have to pay. Octane added Mr. Th\u00e9riault  to the lawsuit, in the hope that he might be ordered to pay if the city wasn\u2019t. The trial judge said there was a contract between  Octane and the city. But he said rules were broken. This meant the contract had  to be annulled (cancelled and treated like it never existed). Annulling the  contract meant Octane should get \u201crestitution of prestations\u201d (the last word  pronounced \u201cpress-TAY-shuns\u201d). \u201cRestitution\u201d means giving something back when a  person has gained something they shouldn\u2019t have from someone else. A  \u201cprestation\u201d is a payment, either in money or services. So \u201crestitution of  prestations\u201d means giving back a payment that shouldn\u2019t have been made. It is  meant to return everyone to their original positions. Since the city couldn\u2019t  return the exact services Octane provided, it had to pay their fair value. The  trial judge said only the city had to pay, not Mr. Th\u00e9riault. The  Court of Appeal agreed. It said that since the contract had to be annulled, the  parties had to be put back in their original positions. The majority added that  even if no contract ever existed, this could still be done under the rules of  \u201creceipt of a payment not due.\u201d Under these rules, a court can make someone  give back a payment if it wasn\u2019t owed and was either made by mistake or to  prevent something bad from happening. It is another way to get restitution of  prestations. The majority at the Supreme Court said the city had to  pay Octane the $83,000 based on receipt of a payment not due. A  major question was whether the rules on restitution of prestations applied to cities  and towns. The city argued that special rules applied to municipal governments,  to protect the public interest (and public money). All three levels of court said  restitution of prestations applied to cities and towns. The Supreme Court  majority said the public interest was protected. This was because courts could  decide not to order restitution of prestations (or to order a different amount)  if someone would get an advantage that they shouldn\u2019t. The  majority said the trial judge made a legal mistake in deciding there was a  contract. Since the city didn\u2019t follow the proper process to agree to a deal, no  contract ever existed under the law. Because no contract existed, it couldn\u2019t  be annulled. That meant restitution couldn\u2019t be ordered on the basis of a null (annulled)  contract. But restitution can be based on other things. The majority agreed  that it could be based on the city receiving a payment that wasn\u2019t due. The  \u201cpayment\u201d was the events services Octane provided through PGB. Octane provided  the services because it believed it had to. It thought (mistakenly) it had a  contract with the city. That meant it should get an equal value for its  services back. The  majority didn\u2019t need to decide whether Mr. Th\u00e9riault should pay because it said  the city had to. But it said officials like him might have to pay in some  situations. This case was  decided based on specific rules of Quebec\u2019s <em>Civil  Code</em>.The Supreme Court recently  looked at \u201creceipt of a payment not due,\u201d in a different context, in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37893-eng.aspx\">Threlfall v.  Carleton University</a></em>."

Almost 19 months after charges were laid, he was found guilty of aggravated assault and possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose. Shortly before his convictions, he applied unsuccessfully for a stay of proceedings on the basis that the delay violated his right to be tried within a reasonable time under s.\u00a011(b) of the Charter. The trial judge found that the total delay exceeded the 18\u2011month ceiling set out in R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, and was therefore presumptively unreasonable. The trial judge, however, dismissed the s.\u00a011(b) Charter application and refused to enter a stay, reasoning that it was not the clearest of cases where a stay should be granted. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, with one justice dissenting. The three justices wrote separate reasons, each taking a distinct approach as to whether the presumptive ceilings set out in Jordan apply to youth matters.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Abella, Karakatsanis, Brown and Martin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Gascon, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe JJ.: While Jordan did not explicitly answer the question of whether the 18\u2011 and 30\u2011month presumptive ceilings apply to youth justice court proceedings, the existing Jordan framework is capable of accommodating the enhanced need for timeliness in youth cases. This need is well established in the jurisprudence and codified in the YCJA. It can and should be considered in applying the test for a stay below the ceiling, which requires the defence to establish that (1) it took meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings, and (2) the case took markedly longer than it reasonably should have. An accused\u2019s youthfulness should be considered in assessing the second branch of the test. But unless and until it can be shown that Jordan is failing to adequately serve Canada\u2019s youth and society\u2019s broader interest in seeing youth matters tried expeditiously, there is no need to consider, much less implement, a lower constitutional ceiling for youth matters.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Canada\u2019s youth criminal justice system stands separate from the adult criminal justice system. While every person charged with an offence has the right to be tried within a reasonable time under s.\u00a011(b) of the Charter, this right has special significance for young persons, for at least five reasons. First, because young persons have a different perception of time and less well\u2011developed memories than adults, their ability to appreciate the connection between actions and consequences is impaired. Whereas prolonged delays can obscure this connection and dilute the effectiveness of any disposition, timely intervention reinforces it. Second, delay may have a greater psychological impact on a young person. Third, the increased rapidity with which a young person\u2019s memory fades may make it more difficult for him or her to recall past events, which may in turn impair his or her ability to make full answer and defence, a right which is protected by s.\u00a07 of the Charter. Fourth, adolescence is a time of rapid brain, cognitive, and psychosocial development. Where a prolonged delay separates the offending conduct from the corresponding punishment, the young person may experience a sense of unfairness, as his or her thoughts and behaviours may well have changed considerably since the offending conduct took place. Fifth, society has an interest in seeing young persons rehabilitated and reintegrated into society as swiftly as possible. For all these reasons, youth matters should proceed expeditiously and in a timely manner.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The foregoing notwithstanding, there is no need to introduce a lower presumptive ceiling for youth matters. It has not been shown that there is a problem regarding delay in the youth criminal justice system, let alone one that warrants the imposition of a new constitutional standard. There is no evidence that young persons who proactively request an expedited trial are not being accommodated in the post\u2011Jordan world, nor that actors within the youth criminal justice system are not taking Jordan to heart. Further, Jordan established a uniform set of ceilings that apply irrespective of the varying degrees of prejudice experienced by different groups and individuals. Setting new ceilings based on the notion that certain groups \u2014 such as young persons \u2014 experience heightened prejudice as a result of delay would undermine this uniformity and lead to a multiplicity of ceilings, each varying with the unique level of prejudice experienced by the particular category or subcategory of persons in question. This would quickly become impracticable. The mere fact that Parliament decided to create and maintain a separate youth criminal justice system does not by itself provide a sound rationale for establishing a separate ceiling for youth matters.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The decision not to alter the Jordan ceilings to apply differently to youth justice court proceedings does not mean that an accused\u2019s youthfulness has no role to play under the Jordan framework. The enhanced need for timeliness in youth matters can and should be taken into account when determining whether delay falling below the presumptive ceiling is unreasonable. Like the other factors identified in Jordan, the enhanced need for timeliness in youth matters is simply one case-specific factor to consider when determining whether a case took (or is expected to take) markedly longer than it reasonably should have. This approach recognizes that while the presumptive ceiling remains the same whether the accused is a youth or an adult, the tolerance for delay differs. While the presumptive ceiling provides a hard backstop that offers certainty, predictability, and simplicity, the test for a stay below the ceiling affords the necessary flexibility to ensure case-specific features \u2014 such as the age of the accused\u00a0\u2014 are not lost in the analysis. At the same time, Jordan will not deliver on its promise \u2014 whether for young persons or for adults \u2014 unless all participants in the criminal justice system work together and take a proactive approach from day one. Prosecutors have a strong incentive to be proactive because the failure to do so will be a factor in determining whether a case has taken markedly longer than it reasonably should have. Equally, the defence has a duty to be proactive, as well as an interest in doing so. If the defence hopes to satisfy the \u201cmeaningful steps\u201d test set out in Jordan, it must engage in proactive conduct throughout and show that the accused is committed to having the case tried as quickly as possible. Resigned acquiescence will not do.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is every reason to expect that young persons will enjoy stronger protection against prolonged delay than they did in the pre\u2011Jordan era. While the test for a stay for delay below the ceiling places the onus on the defence to establish that the delay was unreasonable, this does not disadvantage young persons vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis adults or place them in a less advantageous position than they were in pre\u2011Jordan. Jordan affords all accused persons, including youth, the benefit of a strong presumption of unreasonableness once the delay exceeds the presumptive ceiling. Given that both young persons and adults benefit from this strong presumption, they both must bear the onus of justifying a stay when the delay is below the ceiling. While the Court stated in Jordan that stays for delay below the ceiling will be rare and limited to clear cases, this statement must be read in light of the fact that the Jordan framework applies to all criminal proceedings, not just youth matters. While stays for delay below the ceiling may be rare when considered against the entire body of applications for a stay for delay under the ceiling, they may be less rare when considered against the smaller body of youth applications for a stay for delay under the ceiling. Thus, when Jordan is taken to heart and the test for a stay below the ceiling is properly applied to youth court proceedings, the Jordan framework affords young persons robust protection against unreasonable delay.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Any delay resulting from failed attempts at extrajudicial sanctions should be treated on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis. However, without foreclosing the theoretical possibility that such delay might in some rare instances be included in the Jordan calculation, it can reasonably be expected that it will be deducted as defence delay. Removing this type of delay from the Jordan calculation minimizes the risk that authorities will refrain from using extrajudicial sanctions in the first place out of a fear that they may be increasing the likelihood of a stay in the event such measures fail. Removing disincentives against extrajudicial sanctions is an important policy objective given the central role played by such measures in the youth criminal justice system. Furthermore, this approach makes sense at a conceptual level. When an attempt at extrajudicial sanctions is made, that effectively removes the matter from the court system and places it on a different track. It therefore makes good sense to stop the clock and to restart the clock only if and when the matter is placed back into the court system.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The delay in this case fell below the 18\u2011month presumptive ceiling. The total delay was 18 months and 28 days. In line with Jordan, any delay caused by the defence must be subtracted from total delay. For example, the defence will have directly caused the delay if the court and the Crown are ready to proceed, but the defence is not. Here, on one occasion, the court and Crown were ready at the scheduled start time, but M did not show up on time. This created a need to reschedule the hearing, and the earliest available date was five months later. While it is difficult to quantify with precision the extent of the delay caused by the defence, attributing a delay of two to three months to the defence is both fair and reasonable. In addition, delay caused by discrete exceptional events that are reasonably unforeseeable or reasonably unavoidable must also be deducted to the extent such delay could not reasonably have been mitigated by the Crown or the justice system. Such an event occurred when an administrative error in the transcript ordering process resulted in approximately one month of delay. This leaves a net delay of 15 to 16 months, falling below the applicable ceiling.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although this case is close to the line, it does not meet the test for a stay below the ceiling. In a transitional case such as this one, both requirements \u2014 that the defence took meaningful and sustained steps, and that the case took markedly longer than it reasonably should have \u2014 must be applied contextually, sensitive to the parties\u2019 reliance on the previous state of the law. As to the first requirement, while the defence acted responsibly throughout the proceeding, it did not engage in the necessary proactive conduct. Its approach was more one of resigned acquiescence. However, given that about 80 percent of the trial took place before Jordan was released, the defence should have the benefit of the doubt and the first requirement has been met. As to the second requirement, although some factors suggest that this case should reasonably have completed in less time, the issue is whether it took markedly longer than it reasonably should have. The vast majority of this trial took place at a time when the tolerance for institutional delay \u2014 the primary cause of delay in this case \u2014 was high across the country. It is clear from the record that overbooking and systemic delay in the jurisdiction in question were endemic. Further, the seriousness of the offences and the absence of any demonstrated prejudice are relevant in that they help to explain why the Crown had good reason to believe the delay in this case would not have been found to be unreasonable. The persistent systemic delay discussed above also constrained the Crown\u2019s ability to move this case through the system in a timely manner. While the delay here was excessive, a contextual approach leads to the conclusion that the case did not take markedly longer than it reasonably should have. Therefore, a stay is not warranted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Brown and Martin JJ. (dissenting): Section 11(b) of the Charter requires a distinct and lower presumptive ceiling for proceedings brought under the YCJA, reflecting the distinct character of young accused and the recognized distinct prejudice they suffer from delay in the youth justice system. Doing so gives effect to Parliament\u2019s intention in enacting a separate youth criminal justice system, to Canada\u2019s international commitments, to the recognition in pre-Jordan case law that youth proceedings must be expeditious, and to the consideration that led to setting the presumptive ceilings for adults in Jordan. Just as the Court in Jordan determined the appropriate ceiling for adult proceedings, a separate analysis is required for youth proceedings. That analysis leads to a presumptive ceiling of 15 months for youth proceedings in the provincial court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When Parliament created a separate youth criminal justice system over a century ago, it sought to achieve two fundamental objectives: to provide young persons with enhanced procedural protections throughout the criminal process in recognition of their youth, and to create less formal and more expeditious proceedings. Such enhanced procedural protections which recognize that youth proceedings must proceed more expeditiously than proceedings against adults are codified in s.\u00a03(1)(b)(iv) and s.\u00a03(1)(b)(v) of the YCJA, which crystallized the prior state of the common law. Since the enactment of the YCJA, courts have consistently maintained that criminal proceedings against youth should be resolved more quickly than adult proceedings and that reasonable delay in the adult criminal justice system may not be reasonable in youth proceedings. Given the heightened vulnerability of young persons in the justice system and their diminished moral blameworthiness, enhanced \u2014 and robust \u2014 procedural protections have been built into this separate system.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The role of prejudice in connection with young persons was not considered by the Court in setting the Jordan ceilings because Jordan did not fix ceilings for youth justice court proceedings. Therefore, the unique prejudice that young persons suffer as a result of delay was not accounted for in Jordan. The only outcome that is consistent with the reasoning in Jordan is to recognize that, in light of the separate court system created by Parliament and the greater prejudice that has been acknowledged in the case of young persons, there should be a lower presumptive ceiling for youth proceedings. Lowering the presumptive ceiling for youth does not confer enhanced Charter protections on them. Rather, it acknowledges the more profound impact of delay on young persons, and sets a ceiling that aims to confer on them the same protections that adults receive. When it comes to prejudice arising from delayed criminal proceedings, equal protection as between young persons and adults requires differential treatment. This is not a departure from Jordan; indeed, it is the very application of Jordan\u2019s principles to the youth criminal justice system. Refusing to create a separate ceiling would result in the principles underlying Jordan to furnish less protection for young people than they had before Jordan.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To rely on the absence of any reference to the youth justice system in Jordan as the basis for inferring that the Jordan framework applies to it, obliterates the historic distinction between the adult and youth criminal justice systems, to the prejudice of young persons. A framework for adjudicating a constitutional right that is directed to the criminal justice system for adults should not be inferentially taken as having been also directed to be considered in the context of the separate criminal justice system for young persons, particularly when inferring that young persons are captured by the adult framework will lead to less protection than they have received and are constitutionally entitled to. Furthermore, tacking young people onto the adult framework set by Jordan changes Jordan itself, and erodes the clarity it created. Following Jordan, prejudice is no longer an independent consideration and is instead a factor in the setting of the ceilings, and a stay will be granted in response to delay below the ceiling only in rare and clear cases. By changing Jordan so that stays will theoretically be more readily available where necessary to account for the prejudice experienced by young persons, the clarity of Jordan\u2019s instruction that a stay will be granted below the ceiling only in rare and clear cases is undermined and the predictability of the presumption that delay below the ceiling is reasonable dissipates.\u00a0 This results in the worst of both worlds: the rigidity of ceilings that offer youth less protection than they previously received and were entitled to, coupled with a lack of clarity and predictability about if and when a stay will be granted when the delay is below the ceiling. The \u201cbelow the ceiling test\u201d set out in Jordan is not capable of recognizing young persons\u2019 differential tolerance for delay. To ask youth accused to prove special circumstances to show that delay below the ceiling is unreasonable imposes a disproportionately high burden on them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The total delay in this case from the time M was charged to the end of his trial was 18 months and 28 days, above the 15\u2011month presumptive ceiling. It is inappropriate to deduct two to three months as defence delay arising from the fact that M was 2\u00bd hours late to one of his numerous court appearances. The transcript error was the result of an administrative oversight that the justice system could reasonably have mitigated. None of the delay in M\u2019s case should be characterized as defence delay or delay due to a discrete exceptional circumstance. Further, the delay in M\u2019s case is not justified by the transitional exception and the Crown has not demonstrated that the delay in this case was reasonable. Therefore, M\u2019s constitutional right to stand trial within a reasonable time was infringed, and a stay of proceedings should be granted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis J. (dissenting): There is agreement with the majority that a separate presumptive ceiling in the YCJA context is neither warranted nor necessary to accommodate the distinct characteristics of young accused and the youth criminal justice system. Rather, the presumptive ceilings set out in Jordan apply in the context of the youth criminal justice system and adopting a more robust approach to examining the reasonableness of delays falling below the presumptive ceiling provides protection for the rights of young accused pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. However, as no part of the total delay in this case can be characterized as defence delay or delay resulting from discrete exceptional circumstances, the delay suffered by M breaches the 18-month presumptive ceiling. The delay cannot be justified under the transitional exception as the Crown has failed to demonstrate on the evidence that the delay in this case was reasonable based on a reliance on the previous state of the law and therefore, a stay should be granted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is no evidence that the youth criminal justice system suffers from endemic delays that would justify taking the exceptional judicial step of setting a new presumptive ceiling. A failure to lower the ceiling does not put young accused at a disadvantage compared to their adult counterparts and deprive them of the benefits that Jordan extended through the implementation of presumptive ceilings for delay. Young accused benefit from the presumptive 18\u2011month ceiling set out in Jordan for cases going to trial in provincial courts and it is reasonable to presume that the entire criminal justice system, including the youth system, will ultimately benefit from positive initiatives generated in response to the presumptive ceilings established in Jordan. Further, a lower presumptive ceiling is not required to account for the unique prejudice that young persons suffer as a result of delay as the increased prejudice and the special considerations for young persons codified in the YCJA are both best accounted for through the below\u2011ceiling test in Jordan.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Adapting Jordan in the context of the youth criminal justice system by way of the below\u2011ceiling test gives effect to the s.\u00a011(b) rights of young accused in two ways. First, it gives them the benefit of a presumptive ceiling and second, the below\u2011ceiling test is sufficiently flexible to incorporate general considerations concerning the unique impact of delay on young accused and the greater need for timeliness in the youth criminal justice system. The greater need for timeliness, including the unique prejudicial impact of delays on youth, are not simply case\u2011specific factors \u2014 such as the personal attributes, characteristics or circumstances of a specific young accused \u2014 used to determine whether the delay in a given case was markedly longer than it reasonably should have been. Rather, these considerations play a larger role: they must suffuse and inform the entire analysis in order to give effect to the statutory mandates in the YCJA. Thus, both steps of the below\u2011ceiling test must take into account, and be adapted to incorporate, the increased need for timeliness in the youth criminal justice system.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Jordan was referring to the criminal justice system as a whole when the Court explained that it expects stays beneath the ceiling to be rare, and limited to clear cases. Given the legislatively mandated and greater need for timeliness in the youth criminal justice system, it necessarily follows that delay in a proceeding against a young accused will become markedly longer than it reasonably should have been sooner, perhaps significantly so, than it will in a proceeding against an adult. Therefore, stays below the ceiling in the youth context will not be rare or limited to clear cases.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is particularly important that the conduct of the defence be examined liberally and generously in the youth context. While more than resigned acquiescence is required, the defence is not required to engage in proactive conduct throughout and show that the accused is committed to having the case tried as quickly as possible. This requires too much from the defence and thereby risks undermining the state\u2019s general s.\u00a011(b) obligation to try all accused without undue delay. Jordan imposed no requirement on the defence to engage in proactive conduct or to take steps to have the case tried as quickly as possible. Rather, the defence is required to act reasonably and expeditiously throughout the proceedings and take meaningful, sustained steps to expedite the proceedings. Further, the defence initiative required at the first step of the test will necessarily be less in the youth context than in the adult context.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nothing in the jurisprudence before or after Jordan suggests that delays caused by failed attempts at extrajudicial sanction programs should be attributed to the defence. It is wrong to attribute these delays to the accused. It would have the practical effect of extending the presumptive ceiling for young accused beyond the 18\u2011month ceiling that was set in Jordan. It would also undermine the emphasis on timeliness that must be accommodated in the below\u2011ceiling test for matters in the youth criminal justice system.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Time limits for adult criminal trials also apply  to youth criminal trials, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   In  April 2015, KJM was 15 years old. He got into a fight and stabbed someone in  the face and head with a box cutter. He was charged with several crimes. He  said it was self-defence and pleaded not guilty.  KJM\u2019s  trial was set for September 2015. But an issue about some evidence came up that  had to be dealt with. The earliest date available to deal with it was six  months later. But KJM came to court late that day, and there wasn\u2019t time to  finish. The next available date was about four months later. There was also a  delay when a transcript wasn\u2019t ready.  In  the meantime, the Supreme Court released an important decision, <em>R. v. Jordan</em>. <em>Jordan </em>set out new rules to decide how long is too long for a  criminal trial. In Canada, everyone charged with a crime has the right to be  tried in a reasonable time. This right comes from section 11(b) of the<em> Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, part of  Canada\u2019s Constitution. If the time between the charge and the end of trial is  too long, the court can stop the prosecution. This is called a \u201cstay of  proceedings.\u201d<em> Jordan</em> said most trials  should finish either 18 or 30 months after a person is charged, depending on  the type of trial. If a trial takes longer, it should be \u201cstayed\u201d unless the  Crown (the prosecution) can show a good reason why it should continue. A trial taking  less time can still be stayed if the defence tried to move things along and the  trial took \u201cmarkedly\u201d (a lot) longer than it should have. <em>Jordan </em>also created special rules for cases already in progress  when the rules changed, like KJM\u2019s. These were called \u201ctransitional\u201d cases.  In  October, just over 18 months after he was charged, KJM asked for a stay. According  to <em>Jordan</em>, he argued, his trial  should have finished earlier. The trial judge disagreed. KJM was found guilty  of assault and weapons crimes soon after. The  majority of the Court of Appeal agreed KJM\u2019s trial hadn\u2019t taken too long. The Supreme Court had  to decide if the <em>Jordan</em> time limits for  adult criminal trials also applied to youth criminal trials. The majority said they  do. It said the <em>Jordan </em>rules are  flexible enough to apply to everyone, no matter what their situation. But the majority noted that timely trials are especially important for young  people. Young  people tend to be more short-sighted about consequences than adults. They need  the opportunity to grow during their teenage years. Long trials create stress and anxiety and  get in the way of positive change. The majority said that the entire youth criminal  justice system needs to respect this. <strong> </strong>\r\n     The majority also said judges need  to consider a person\u2019s age when a trial takes less than 18 or 30 months. Each  case is different, but a trial that isn\u2019t too long for an adult can be too long  for a young person.  In this case, the total  time between when KJM was charged and when he was found guilty was almost 19  months. The majority said this wasn\u2019t actually over the <em>Jordan </em>time limit. This was because, under the <em>Jordan </em>rules, three to four months were deducted for delays caused  by the defence and the transcript problem. The majority  said that while the defence did try to move things along quickly, it wasn\u2019t  convinced the trial took a lot longer than it should have. The majority also considered  the fact that <em>Jordan </em>came out 15 months after KJM was  charged. That made his case \u201ctransitional\u201d. In the end, the majority said the trial  judge\u2019s decision should stand. Even though it didn\u2019t  apply to KJM, the majority said time taken to deal with young offenders outside  court shouldn\u2019t count toward the <em>Jordan </em>time  limits. This includes time  taken for things like counselling or community service programs. This is to encourage other ways  of dealing with youth crime, which may have better results. This case was about  the right to be tried in a reasonable time. The right doesn\u2019t just benefit  people charged with crimes. It also protects the rights of victims, witnesses,  and society as a whole. Victims and witnesses benefit from less worry and  frustration when trials happen faster, and they can move on. Society benefits  when justice happens quickly and people charged with crimes are treated fairly."

The trial judge acquitted the accused of both charges but the Court of Appeal set aside both acquittals, substituted a conviction on the charge of unlawful act manslaughter, and ordered a new trial on the criminal negligence charge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Rowe\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ.: The Court of Appeal erred in holding that an intravenous injection is objectively dangerous regardless of the circumstances in which it is administered or the training, qualifications and experience of the person who administers it. The Court of Appeal also erred in disturbing the accused\u2019s acquittals based on its conclusion that her conduct markedly departed from that of a reasonable person. These conclusions cannot be squared with the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact which the Court of Appeal replaced with its own.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The actus reus of criminal negligence causing death requires that the accused undertook an act \u2014 or omitted to do anything that it was his or her legal duty to do \u2014 and that the act or omission caused someone\u2019s death. The fault element is that the accused\u2019s act or omission shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons. As with other negligence\u2011based criminal offences, the fault element of criminal negligence causing death is assessed by measuring the degree to which the accused\u2019s conduct departed from that of a reasonable person in the circumstances. For some negligence\u2011based offences, such as dangerous driving, a \u201cmarked\u201d departure satisfies the fault element. In the context of criminal negligence causing death, however, the requisite degree of departure is as an elevated one \u2014 marked and substantial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The actus reus of unlawful act manslaughter under s.\u00a0222(5)(a) of the Criminal Code requires the Crown to prove that the accused committed an unlawful act and that the unlawful act caused death. The underlying unlawful act is described as the \u201cpredicate\u201d offence. Where the predicate offence is one of strict liability, the fault element for that offence must be read as a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonable person in the circumstances. The Crown is not required to prove that the predicate offence was objectively dangerous. An objective dangerousness requirement adds nothing to the analysis that is not captured within the fault element of unlawful act manslaughter. An unlawful act, accompanied by objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory, is an objectively dangerous act. As a result, the actus reus of unlawful act manslaughter is satisfied by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed an unlawful act that caused death. There is no independent requirement of objective dangerousness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fault element of both offences requires that an accused\u2019s conduct be measured against the standard of a reasonable person in their circumstances. An activity\u2011sensitive approach to the modified objective standard should be applied. While the standard is not determined by the accused\u2019s personal characteristics, it is informed by the activity. Evidence of training and experience may be used to rebut an allegation of being unqualified to engage in an activity or to show how a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused would have performed the activity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In measuring the accused\u2019s conduct against this standard in the instant case, the trial judge was obliged to consider the accused\u2019s prior training, experience and qualifications as a naturopath. The trial judge found that the accused was properly qualified to administer intravenous injections and took the necessary precautions at every stage of administering the intravenous injection, including observing sufficient protocols to prevent sepsis. All of the trial judge\u2019s factual findings, which were based on the evidence, amply support the conclusion that an intravenous injection, performed properly by a naturopath qualified to administer such injections, did not pose an objectively foreseeable risk of bodily harm in the circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Rowe\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed in part: the conviction for unlawful act manslaughter should be set aside and a new trial ordered on this charge. Entering a conviction on an appeal from an acquittal is an exceptional measure, and the error of law at issue here is also a rare occurrence. A conviction for manslaughter was not so inevitable as to justify the measure ordered by the Court of Appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The offence of unlawful act manslaughter requires proof of an underlying unlawful act. The actus reus of the offence has three elements: (1)\u00a0an underlying unlawful act; (2)\u00a0the objective dangerousness of that act; and (3)\u00a0a causal connection between the act and the death. Unlawful act manslaughter also has two cumulative fault elements: the mens\u00a0rea of the underlying act and the mens\u00a0rea specific to manslaughter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second element of the actus\u00a0reus, the objective dangerousness of the unlawful act, is assessed without reference to the accused\u2019s personal characteristics. It will be proved if the court is satisfied that the accused did something that a reasonable person would have known was likely to subject another person to a risk of bodily harm. In considering the actus reus, the court is not to assess the extent to which the accused\u2019s conduct departed from this standard of care or the accused\u2019s state of mind. This evidentiary threshold reflects the fact that, at this stage of the analysis, the court is considering whether the accused committed the physical element of the offence, not whether the accused had the state of mind required for a conviction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Injecting a substance across physiological barriers is an inherently dangerous activity. The accused\u2019s experience does not alter this. The dangerousness of the act would have been established even if it had been performed by a health professional who was authorized to do so. By refusing to find that the unlawful injection was objectively dangerous, the trial court failed to arrive at the legal conclusion that was necessary in light of the facts as found. This was an error of law whose impact is such that it requires a new trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>An experienced naturopath wasn\u2019t guilty when one of  her patients died after treatment, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Ms. Javanmardi worked as a naturopath in Quebec for  over 20 years. She had a degree in science. She  also had a doctorate and diploma in naturopathic medicine. Her education included  classes and clinical training about intravenous injections. She gave these  injections to thousands of patients while working as a naturopath. While  naturopaths are allowed to give injections in other provinces, they aren\u2019t  allowed to in Quebec.  In 2008, Mr. Matern visited Ms. Javanmardi\u2019s clinic.  He was 84 and had heart disease. He was frustrated with the treatment he got at  regular medical clinics and hoped naturopathy would help. Ms. Javanmardi recommended  an intravenous injection. Mr. Matern asked for one right away. It turned out that one of the vials  Ms. Javanmardi used for the injection was contaminated. Mr. Matern died later  that night. Two other patients got injections from the same vial that day  without any problems. Ms. Javanmardi was charged with two crimes. The first was \u201cunlawful act  manslaughter.\u201d This means doing something illegal that causes someone to die.  The second was \u201ccriminal negligence causing death.\u201d This means doing something that  a \u201creasonable person\u201d wouldn\u2019t have done that causes someone to die. Both  charges were based on the fact that Ms. Javanmardi gave Mr. Matern an  injection.  To be guilty of a crime, a person must do something  that is against the (criminal) law. But something has to make them <em>responsible</em> for what they\u2019ve done. For  many crimes, responsibility is based on meaning to do something wrong. But for  some crimes, a person can be responsible even if they don\u2019t mean to do anything  wrong. In these cases, a judge will compare what the person did to what a  \u201creasonable person\u201d would have done in the same situation. If the actions of  the accused person and the \u201creasonable person\u201d are very different, the judge  can decide the accused person didn\u2019t take proper care.  The  trial judge found Ms. Javanmardi not guilty on both charges. She said Ms. Javanmardi  had the necessary skills and experience to give  Mr. Matern the injection. She said Ms. Javanmardi followed proper safety  procedures. She bought her nutrients from a respected pharmacy. She chose proper  nutrients for the injection. She also said that a reasonable person in Ms.  Javanmardi\u2019s position wouldn\u2019t have thought that the injection would hurt Mr.  Matern. She said Ms. Javanmardi\u2019s actions weren\u2019t a \u201cmarked departure\u201d (very  different) from what a reasonable person with her skills and training would  have done. The Court of Appeal disagreed. It found Ms. Javanmardi guilty of unlawful  act manslaughter, but said there should be a new trial on criminal negligence. The  majority at the Supreme Court said the trial judge\u2019s ruling should stand. This  meant Ms. Javanmardi was not guilty of both crimes. It is the trial judge\u2019s job  to weigh the evidence and make conclusions about the facts. The majority said  the Court of Appeal was wrong to re-weigh the evidence and replace the trial  judge\u2019s factual conclusions with its own. The majority noted the trial judge was  right to consider Ms. Javanmardi\u2019s extensive training and experience as a  naturopath when deciding what was reasonable in the circumstances.  This\u00a0 case\u00a0 came\u00a0  to\u00a0 the\u00a0 Supreme\u00a0  Court\u00a0 as\u00a0 an\u00a0  appeal\u00a0 \u201cas\u00a0 of\u00a0  right.\u201d\u00a0 That means there is an  automatic right to appeal. The person doesn\u2019t need the Court\u2019s permission. The  right is automatic in criminal cases when a Court of Appeal replaces a  not-guilty verdict with a guilty verdict, as happened here."

The police seized about $42,000 in cash, found when searching his car and apartments, as potential proceeds of crime under Part XII.2 of the Criminal Code. Before trial, R applied under s.\u00a0462.34(4)(c)(ii) of the Criminal Code for the return of the seized funds to pay for reasonable legal expenses associated with his case. The application was allowed and the funds returned to pay for reasonable legal fees, with conditions. R pled guilty to several offences at trial. The sentencing judge imposed a term of imprisonment and forfeiture of R\u2019s interest in an apartment, but declined to impose a fine instead of forfeiture equal to the amount of the returned funds spent by R on his legal fees as requested by the Crown under s.\u00a0462.37(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed. The Court of Appeal varied the sentencing order, adding a fine instead of forfeiture of $41,976.39, equal to the amount of the returned funds, and 12 months\u2019 imprisonment should R not pay his fine.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed and the Court of Appeal\u2019s order set aside.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Brown, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: Generally speaking, sentencing judges should not impose a fine instead of forfeiture in relation to funds that have been judicially returned for the payment of reasonable legal expenses associated with an accused\u2019s criminal defence. The statutory discretion to impose a fine instead of forfeiture under s.\u00a0462.37(3) of the Criminal Code must be exercised in accordance with the purposes of the proceeds of crime regime. This regime as a whole seeks to ensure that crime does not pay or benefit the offender; however, by enacting the legal expenses return provision at s.\u00a0462.34(4)(c)(ii) of the Criminal Code, Parliament not only foresaw the possibility that seized funds may be needed to mount a defence, but explicitly allowed individuals to spend returned funds for this purpose. The return provision pursues two secondary purposes: providing access to counsel and giving meaningful weight to the presumption of innocence. These secondary objectives ensure fairness to the accused in criminal prosecutions. Clawing back reasonable legal expenses as a fine instead of forfeiture would, in most cases, undermine these purposes. If it turns out that the offender did not have a real financial need or the funds were not used to alleviate that need, it would be appropriate to impose a fine instead of forfeiture, as this would align with Parliament\u2019s intent. This might occur where there is wrongdoing in the return of funds application or in the administration of the return order or if the accused experiences an unexpected change in circumstances after the funds have been returned. In the context of this case, ordering a fine undermines Parliament\u2019s intent in enacting the return provision. There is no evidence that R misrepresented his financial position, misused returned funds, or experienced any change in circumstances. Therefore, the sentencing judge\u2019s exercise of discretion was appropriate and should not be interfered with.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As the Criminal Code does not expressly indicate whether judicially returned funds ought to be subject to a fine instead of forfeiture, the resolution of this issue requires recourse to the rules of statutory interpretation. This analysis is guided by the words that Parliament has chosen to use, the way it intended to achieve its objectives, and the scheme it has put in place. Where the dispute involves multiple legislative objectives and the inter-relationship between two or more statutory provisions, the scheme of the Act and the objectives underlying each of the relevant provisions are particularly significant. Parliament had several objectives in mind when it enacted the proceeds of crime regime. Parliament\u2019s primary goal was to ensure that crime does not pay and that it does not benefit the offender. Forfeiture is intended to deprive offenders of the proceeds of their crime. Seizure allows the state to take control of property believed to be proceeds of crime before trial and sentencing, to ensure it remains available for possible forfeiture. The fine instead of forfeiture provision ensures that, if accused persons are able to keep proceeds of crime throughout criminal proceedings, they must in the end pay a fine equivalent to the value of the property that is not available to be forfeited.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The legal expenses return provision shows that Parliament intended that the secondary objectives underpinning it \u2014 providing access to counsel and giving meaningful weight to the presumption of innocence \u2014 must be balanced against the primary objective of ensuring that crime does not pay. The wording and the elaborate and detailed nature of the return provision indicates that Parliament clearly and deliberately sought to address an accused\u2019s need for legal counsel, in the limited and narrow circumstances where the accused has no other assets or means and no other person appears to be the lawful owner of or lawfully entitled to possession of the property. The secondary objectives reflect an underlying intention to promote fairness in criminal prosecutions that runs through the proceeds of crime scheme. They constrain the pursuit of the primary objective. The return provision was intended to respect the principle of fairness in criminal prosecutions, including concepts of fair notice and reliance. It can be expected that accused people will rely on a court order authorized by a specific statutory scheme and those accused persons cannot reasonably know that doing so will lead to additional punishment. Also, accused persons who understand that judicially returned funds will be clawed back later may not apply for the return of funds and represent themselves instead. When an accused person cannot access legal counsel, the presumption of innocence suffers because it is difficult for lay persons to effectively navigate the complexity of criminal cases. Imposing retroactive penalties on accused persons who rely on the presumption of innocence undermines the presumption and the protections it affords.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The judicial return of funds to pay for a lawyer is not the type of benefit that Parliament sought to take away by way of a fine. It is a tightly controlled benefit Parliament expressly intended for a narrow category of accused persons in need. In the instant case, the return provision allowed R, who had no other assets or means to pay for his defence, an opportunity to access seized funds under close judicial scrutiny and tight conditions. It is undeniable that there is less money available to be forfeited to the Crown but a fundamental purpose of the criminal justice system is to provide a fair process to achieve just results, not to extract maximum retribution at any cost. Seized property returned pursuant to a judicial order is not thematically analogous to the reasons listed in s.\u00a0462.37(3) of the Criminal Code for ordering a fine instead of forfeiture. All of the circumstances listed reflect Parliament\u2019s concern that an accused person might hide, dissipate or distribute property that may later be determined to be proceeds of crime. The accused\u2019s lawyer is not some unknown person receiving funds by way of an uncontrolled, private transaction. They have been specifically authorized by a judge to be paid in aid of the accused\u2019s defence. Further, Parliament has set out its desired statutory requirements for the judicial return of seized funds. Nothing indicates any intention to require the accused to demonstrate, in order to avoid the imposition of a fine instead of forfeiture, that the nature of the proceedings are such that it is essential to have counsel. Accordingly, not imposing a fine instead of forfeiture in relation to funds that have been judicially returned for the payment of reasonable legal expenses associated with an accused\u2019s criminal defence will generally be most faithful to Parliament\u2019s intent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0JJ. (dissenting in part): Imposing a fine in lieu of forfeiture where an offender has used proceeds of crime to pay for his or her own defence achieves the forfeiture regime\u2019s primary objective of ensuring crime does not pay; and it does not undermine the utility of the legal expenses restoration provision, which facilitates access to counsel in a manner that is both fair and consistent with the presumption of innocence. There is nothing inconsistent about allowing accused persons, who are presumed innocent, to access seized funds to pay for legal counsel but requiring offenders, who are proven guilty, to pay them back in the event that they are determined to be proceeds of crime. However, there is an important exception to this general rule: where a sentencing judge is satisfied that representation by counsel was essential to the offender\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial, the judge should exercise his or her limited discretion not to impose a fine in lieu of forfeiture. This interpretation gives proper effect to Parliament\u2019s objective of ensuring an effective forfeiture regime while still vindicating the constitutionally protected right to counsel, and more particularly, the constitutional right to state\u2011funded counsel in limited circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Part XII.2 of the Criminal Code, which governs the seizure, restraint, and forfeiture of proceeds of crime, seeks to ensure that crime does not pay. To further this objective, it permits the state to seize and detain property believed on reasonable grounds to be proceeds of crime, thereby preserving it and facilitating the enforcement of any future forfeiture order. At the same time, Parliament recognized that the seizure and detention of property that is reasonably believed, though not yet proven, to be proceeds of crime may have a significant financial impact on accused persons, including by limiting their ability to access counsel. To address this concern, s.\u00a0462.34 of the Criminal Code permits accused persons to apply for a restoration order authorizing the release of seized property to pay for various expenses \u2014 one being reasonable legal expenses \u2014 where they have no other means available and no other person appears to be the lawful owner of or lawfully entitled to possession of the seized property. In creating this provision, Parliament struck a balance between ensuring an effective forfeiture regime and permitting otherwise impecunious accused persons to access funds for certain legitimate purposes. However, a court must, when sentencing an offender for an indictable offence, order the forfeiture of property determined to be proceeds of crime. Alternatively, where a court is satisfied that a forfeiture order should be made in respect of any \u201cproperty of an offender\u201d, but the property cannot be made subject to such an order, the court \u201cmay\u201d order a fine in lieu under s.\u00a0462.37(3) of the Criminal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Offenders who have used proceeds of crime to pay for their own defence derive a benefit from their crime and should generally be required to repay that benefit through a fine in lieu of forfeiture. This follows from a straightforward application of the primary objective of the proceeds of crime regime \u2014 namely, ensuring that crime does not pay. The proper interpretation of s.\u00a0462.37(3) of the Criminal Code reveals that where seized funds are released to an offender and then transferred to a lawyer, both prerequisites to imposing a fine in lieu are met. First, these funds are captured in the broad definition of \u201cproperty of an offender\u201d, which includes property originally in the possession or under the control of any person. Second, a transfer of released funds to a lawyer cannot be made subject to a forfeiture order. Section 462.37(3) sets out a non\u2011exhaustive list of example circumstances where this criterion is met, one of which is where property has been \u201ctransferred to a third party\u201d. Parliament could have limited this class of transfers but did not. In the absence of any limiting language, the grammatical and ordinary sense of \u201ctransfer\u201d \u2014 to move a thing from one place to another \u2014 must prevail. A judicially authorized transfer of released funds to a lawyer is therefore a \u201ctransfer to a third party\u201d. This also fits comfortably within the consistent theme running through the examples listed in s.\u00a0462.37(3), which is simply that the property cannot be made subject to a forfeiture order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is an exception to the general rule that a fine in lieu should be imposed where an offender has used proceeds of crime to pay for his or her own defence. Where a sentencing judge is satisfied, applying the test set out in R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 1988 CanLII 147 (ON CA), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), that representation by counsel was essential to the offender\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial under ss.\u00a07 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the judge should exercise his or her limited discretion not to impose a fine in lieu in respect of the released funds. The language of s.\u00a0462.37(3) is permissive and confers a limited discretion not to impose a fine. This limited discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the spirit of Part XII.2 as a whole. Part XII.2 seeks to balance the need to ensure an effective forfeiture regime and the constitutionally protected right to counsel. To properly understand this balance, however, it is first necessary to examine what the constitutionally protected right to counsel does \u2014 and does not \u2014 entail. Neither s.\u00a010(b) nor any other Charter right postulates a general right to legal assistance. The right to state\u2011funded legal counsel in criminal proceedings grounded in ss.\u00a07 and 11(d) of the Charter is limited to circumstances where legal aid has been denied, the accused lacks other means, and representation by counsel is essential to the accused\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. Thus, where an offender can show that he or she was constitutionally entitled to state\u2011funded legal counsel, it would be inconsistent to order the offender to pay back his or her legal expenses through a fine in lieu. This approach gives proper effect to Parliament\u2019s objective of ensuring an effective forfeiture regime while still vindicating the constitutionally protected right to counsel. To go further would not only upset the careful balance struck by Parliament, it would effectively grant a constitutional entitlement where none exists.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Contrary to the majority\u2019s approach, the primary objective of the proceeds of crime regime need not be sacrificed to achieve the restoration provision\u2019s \u201csecondary purposes\u201d of providing access to counsel, giving meaningful weight to the presumption of innocence, and giving effect to the underlying intention to ensure fairness in criminal prosecutions. Once the respective roles of the restoration provision and the fine in lieu provision are properly understood, it becomes clear that all of the statutory scheme\u2019s objectives can be achieved. The restoration provision facilitates access to counsel in a manner that is both fair and consistent with the presumption of innocence. But where a restoration order is followed by a conviction, an \u201caccused\u201d becomes an \u201coffender\u201d, and a fine in lieu should be ordered because the primary objective of ensuring that crime does not pay takes centre stage. While Parliament intended to give accused persons the benefit of having access to seized funds to pay for reasonable legal expenses, it did not intend to give offenders the benefit of never having to pay them back. Had that been Parliament\u2019s intent, it could easily have enacted such a provision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this instance, the funds transferred to R\u2019s lawyer qualified as R\u2019s property and were determined to be proceeds of crime. They could not be made subject to a forfeiture order. Consequently, the authority to order a fine in lieu was engaged. In exercising her limited discretion not to invoke this authority, the sentencing judge did not consider whether representation by counsel was essential to R\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial and the record is insufficient to decide this issue. The Court of Appeal\u2019s order should therefore be set aside and the case remitted to the sentencing judge for determination.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Distinguished: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Judges don\u2019t have to make someone pay a fine equal to the earnings from  crime they used (with permission) to pay for their defence, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>\r\n   People  shouldn\u2019t profit from crimes. Property someone gets through crime is called  \u201cproceeds of crime.\u201d The <em>Criminal Code</em> says the Crown (the prosecution) can take the property if it is probably proceeds  of crime. The property is held during the owner\u2019s trial. If the person is found  not guilty, and the property is not proven to be proceeds of crime, they can  have it back. If they are found guilty, the Crown can keep it if a judge says  so. Without  the seized property, a person accused of crimes may not be able to afford a  lawyer to defend them. The <em>Criminal Code </em>says  they can ask a judge to let some of the property be used to pay legal fees. If  the judge agrees, they can set conditions to make sure the money is only used  to pay for legal fees.<strong></strong>\r\n   If  the person is found guilty, a judge will decide their sentence. The sentencing  judge also has to decide exactly what property came from crime. The Crown  usually gets to keep this. If the amount the Crown holds at sentencing is less  than the amount the judge decides came from crime, the judge can make the  person pay a fine. This is to prevent people from spending or hiding the  proceeds of crime before they can be taken permanently. If the person doesn\u2019t  pay, they can go to prison (or go to prison longer). Mr.  Rafilovich was arrested for dealing drugs. The police found almost $50,000 worth of cocaine  and $42,000 in cash. The Crown seized the cash as it was probably proceeds of  crime. In 2009, before his trial, Mr. Rafilovich asked to use the money to pay  for his lawyer. The judge said yes, and set a number of conditions, including an  hourly rate and the maximum number of hours the lawyer could bill. Mr. Rafilovich pleaded  guilty and was sentenced to jail. The judge decided the money the police found  was proceeds of crime. But the money was gone because it had all been used to  pay Mr. Rafilovich\u2019s lawyer. The Crown said Mr. Rafilovich should still have to  pay the total amount as a fine. But the sentencing judge said no. He only used  the money to hire a lawyer, which he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do if the money  wasn\u2019t returned.  The Court of Appeal  said the sentencing judge had to charge the fine. It said paying for a lawyer  with proceeds of crime let Mr. Rafilovich benefit from his crime. The point of  seizing proceeds of crime was to prevent people from benefiting from crime. It fined  Mr. Rafilovich almost $42,000. In the past, lower  courts disagreed about what to do in this kind of situation. The Supreme Court  had to decide what to do when an accused person got a judge\u2019s permission to use  possible proceeds of crime for legal fees. The majority said judges can decide whether or not to charge  a fine, depending on the situation. The sentencing judge was allowed to decide <em>not</em> to fine Mr. Rafilovich.      The majority said that sentencing judges shouldn\u2019t normally  fine someone to get back the amount that was used (with a judge\u2019s approval) to  pay for their legal defence. This would be unfair. An accused person is presumed  to be innocent during their trial. (The presumption of innocence is part of the  reason the <em>Criminal Code</em> says the  money can be returned if a judge gives permission.) If the accused person had  to pay the amount they spent on legal fees to the Crown if they lost, they  might decide not to hire a lawyer. The majority said the purpose of the fine  was to prevent people from spending or hiding the proceeds of crime. It wasn\u2019t  to punish someone from relying on the presumption of innocence and hiring a  lawyer to defend themselves. Criminal justice is meant to provide a fair  process to get a just result. It isn\u2019t about getting maximum punishment at any  cost. This case was about how a judge should use their \u201cdiscretion.\u201d  Discretion is a judge\u2019s freedom to decide certain issues. That freedom has  limits set by the law. This was the first time the court looked at a judge\u2019s  discretion to order a fine to get back proceeds of crime used to pay legal  fees. "

Tragically, he never returned and could not be found. Upon his disappearance, R became an absentee under art.\u00a084 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d) and T, his former de facto spouse, universal legatee and the liquidator of his succession, was appointed as his tutor. The presumption of life in art.\u00a085 C.C.Q. required R\u2019s former employer to continue making pension payments to him despite his disappearance, as the terms of his pension plan provided for payments until his death. Almost six years after his disappearance, R\u2019s remains were discovered. The act of death recorded his death as having occurred the day after his disappearance. R\u2019s former employer then sought reimbursement of the amount of pension benefits paid to R between the day after his disappearance and the date of the last payment. The trial judge held that the payments made after the recorded date of death were to be considered not due \u2014 as the three conditions that had to be fulfilled in order to make out a claim for receipt of a payment not due were met \u2014 and were therefore subject to restitution. The Court of Appeal substantially upheld the trial judge\u2019s decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Rowe and Martin JJ.: The pension plan unambiguously contemplated the termination of benefits upon R\u2019s actual death, not the date his death was officially recognized. On the plain language of the plan, R was not entitled to benefits following the month of his death. The rebuttal of the presumption of life retroactively extinguished R\u2019s entitlement to the pension payments made while he was an absentee. Because the legal basis for the payments evaporated, R\u2019s former employer\u2019s claim for receipt of a payment not due under art.\u00a01491 C.C.Q. must succeed: assessed retrospectively, the payments were made in error and in the absence of any debt.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Under the C.C.Q., an absentee is a person who, while domiciled in Quebec, ceases to appear there, without giving news of himself or herself, and without it being known whether he or she is still alive. Quebec\u2019s current absence regime is a relatively modern innovation and marked a fundamental shift in the traditional Quebec law on absence. No longer is an absentee considered to be neither alive nor dead. Instead, art.\u00a085\u00a0C.C.Q. provides that an absentee is presumed to be alive for seven years following his or her disappearance, unless proof of death is made before then, and he or she enjoys full juridical personality during this period. Where proof of death is made within seven years of disappearance, in which case the presumption of life is rebutted, rights and obligations premised on the absentee\u2019s continued existence while he or she is presumed alive are retroactively extinguished from the true date of death.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The wording of art.\u00a085 C.C.Q. provides limited guidance on the question of retroactivity by the fact that it states that an absentee is presumed to be alive for seven years unless proof of his death is made before then, and not until proof of his death is made. But this textual clue that the rebuttal of the presumption has retroactive effect is reinforced by wider considerations. First, art.\u00a085 is clear on its face that the presumption of life will be rebutted by proof of death made within the seven\u2011year period. The presumption of life is therefore a simple presumption \u2014 that is, a legal presumption of fact lasting for seven years which may be rebutted by proof to the contrary or confirmed by the absentee\u2019s return. Article 85 protects an absentee for a limited period \u2014 but in establishing a simple presumption, it creates no permanent rights for that absentee. When rebutted, the presumption falls away and is replaced with reality. Nothing in the C.C.Q. dictates that reality should be ignored or juridical personality allowed to continue past death. The C.C.Q. would need to be explicit in order for reality to be ignored in such a manner. Contrary to the French Civil Code, which contains an express provision indicating that the rebuttal of the presumption of life operates prospectively, there is no similar provision in the C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, when, in other parts of the absence regime, the C.C.Q. intends that reality be ignored, this is stated expressly. In particular, the declaratory judgment of death mechanism clearly illustrates when a legal fiction will triumph over the true state of affairs to prioritize certainty. In that situation, the C.C.Q. allows a declaratory judgment of death to be pronounced, regardless of whether the absentee\u2019s death may be held to be certain, when the presumption is neither confirmed nor rebutted within seven years of an absentee\u2019s disappearance. Inversely, the presumption of life is a mechanism that primarily protects an absentee\u2019s interests in the hope that he or she will return, but allows the true state of affairs to prevail when that outcome is no longer possible. The Quebec legislature, in drafting the absence regime, has chosen seven years as the key point at which a legal fiction is allowed to prevail in most respects over the true state of affairs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Third, retroactivity is consistent with the purposes of the presumption of life \u2014 injecting stability into what would otherwise be an unclear and unsettled state of affairs, and protecting the absentee\u2019s interests. If the presumption is rebutted with retroactive effect, both of these purposes are advanced. A prospective approach overshoots these purposes. The fact that retroactivity leads to some uncertainty over a small subset of transactions or circumstances does not topple or undermine the transactional stability sought by the presumption of life. In contrast to the older absence regime, the two distinct phases of the current absence regime offer simplicity and stability so that transactions can be conducted without contentious debate or a complex web of rules. While a prospective approach would preserve the absentee\u2019s interests, it would also transform the presumption into a source of substantive rights to generate wealth for the absentee\u2019s succession.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Fourth, interpreting the rebuttal of the presumption as occurring with retroactive effect ensures that, within the seven\u2011year period, all concerned individuals receive only what they are entitled to, in accordance with the true state of affairs. Conversely, if the rebuttal of the presumption had only prospective effect, restitution for payments premised on the absentee\u2019s existence, made when the absentee was, in reality, both factually and legally dead, would be impossible. A prospective approach would generate windfalls not intended by the absence regime.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Because most obligations must be performed regardless of whether an absentee is alive or not, most of an absentee\u2019s dealings during the absence period will remain unaffected by the rebuttal. However, a small subset of transactions \u2014 namely payments that are either received or made by virtue of the absentee\u2019s presumed existence during the absence period \u2014 are affected when the presumption of life is rebutted. The very basis for these kinds of obligations, which are directly linked to and premised upon continued existence, retroactively evaporates. There is no direct route from rebutting the presumption of life to any provision which deals with the restitution of prestations. Still, the remedy for receipt of a payment not due is available in such a situation, even when some of the requisite elements of that claim are not present at the time of payment but instead surface at a later date.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There are three essential elements to any claim for receipt of a payment not due under art.\u00a01491 C.C.Q.: (1) there must be a payment; (2) the payment must be made in the absence of debt between the parties; and (3) the payment must be made either in error or under protest to avoid injury. When all three requirements are met, restitution will follow under art.\u00a01492 C.C.Q., in accordance with the rules for the restitution of prestations. The absence of debt requirement is essential to the analysis. An absence of debt is what makes a payment \u201cnot due\u201d. But the mere absence of a debt between the parties is not enough. The payment must also have been made in error or under protest. Where there is, in fact, no obligation, the payer is usually in error. Once an absence of debt is proven by the payer, it falls to the payee to prove that the payment resulted from a liberal intention. If the payee cannot prove that the payer made a payment while being aware that there is no obligation to do so, the payment is deemed to be made in error and not due. Error prevents art.\u00a01491 from being wielded as a tool to unilaterally conscript others into paying for services under the pretence of seeking restitution.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Under the circumstances, art.\u00a01491 C.C.Q. calls for a retrospective approach. The requirements for receipt of a payment not due must be assessed retrospectively from the time of the claim and with the knowledge of the true state of affairs. Where a debt existed at a certain time but the basis for it has subsequently fallen away, the existence of the debt must be determined retrospectively. To meet the goals of the restitution regime, a court should focus on whether the basis for this debt remained intact at the time of the claim. A retrospective approach to art.\u00a01491 fits seamlessly into the broader framework and objectives of similar restitutionary tools throughout the C.C.Q. The thread that runs through all of these tools is that a payment is made under an entirely valid and genuine obligation that later falls away due to some subsequent event. Restitution becomes available as a result of an unanticipated or abnormal event. There is no indication that art.\u00a01491 works differently from these other similar restitutionary mechanisms. Assessing absence of debt contemporaneously with payment in such a case would frustrate the aims of art.\u00a01491 and make it an anomaly within the wider family of restitutionary mechanisms in the C.C.Q. Without retrospectivity, once valid payments would be forever immunized and parties would be unable to recover payments that were not due, allowing undue payments and windfalls to find refuge just beyond the provision\u2019s reach.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. There is no basis in the C.C.Q. to order the tutor to return the monies received from the former employer; the rebuttal of the presumption of life signified the extinction of the former employer\u2019s obligation only with respect to continuing (that is, future) pension payments. Articles 1491 and 1492 C.C.Q. cannot be adjusted to allow the courts to go back in time to find that the former employer\u2019s payments to the absentee were made in error, with the effect of unwinding rights and obligations that were validly due at the time they were performed. The former employer\u2019s claim of restitution under the receipt of a payment not due provisions of the C.C.Q. must therefore fail.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The rebuttal of the presumption of life in art.\u00a085 C.C.Q. cannot be with retroactive effects on the substantive rights and obligations of the absentee. If proof of the absentee\u2019s death is made before the expiry of the seven\u2011year period of absence, the presumption of life is rebutted only prospectively, such that no right or obligations premised upon the absentee\u2019s existence can be claimed or executed for the future, that is, for the remainder of the seven\u2011year period.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A prospective approach is consistent with the modifications made to the absence regime between the Civil Code of Lower Canada (where uncertainty persisted throughout a 30\u2011year period of absence and made it impossible for anyone to claim a right accruing to an absentee during this time) and the C.C.Q. (where the presumption of life injects certainty during a 7\u2011year period of absence and ensures rights and obligations of the absentee are valid until the time the presumption is rebutted). The Civil Code of Lower Canada\u2019s absence regime was unduly complex, inflexible and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 riddled with persistent uncertainty. Difficulties with the regime led to revisions. Under the C.C.Q., the absentee is automatically presumed to be alive for seven years following his or her disappearance. The presumption of life contained in art.\u00a085 C.C.Q. represented a substantial change to the law on absence in Quebec. It is this presumption which fosters certainty by ensuring that absentees are capable of acquiring rights and being bound by obligations. No longer does the right to claim pension benefits during an absence depend on the claimant proving that the absentee was, in fact, alive at the time the right accrued. It is sufficient, for the acquisition of a right by an absentee during his or her absence, to show that such absentee was presumed at law to be alive at the time the right accrued to him or her. Whether through forced performance via court order, or through voluntary performance by a person bound to comply with the law, the rights and obligations of an absentee benefit from an absolute presumption of validity while the presumption of life operates.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The presumption of life ceases to apply after seven years of absence, as it is displaced by a presumption that the absentee is dead. To obtain a declaratory judgment of death seven years after the absentee\u2019s disappearance, it is not necessary to bring proof positive of the absentee\u2019s death, precisely because the absentee is by then presumed to be dead; it is sufficient to prove the absence of the person and the fact that the absence has lasted seven years from the disappearance. This change to the law of absence brought the law of Quebec closer to that of Germany and of France. Another particularly important revision was that the presumption of death would take effect from the time of the declaratory judgment of death, and not from the time the absentee disappeared. The date fixed as the date of death is the date upon expiry of seven years from the disappearance. The operation of the presumption of death and of the declaratory judgment of death does not displace the presumption of life which was in force during the seven\u2011year period of absence. Although the date of departure of the absentee was perhaps less arbitrary for determining the date of death, that of the declaratory judgment of death was more certain. The retroactive nature of the presumption of death was rejected because it would have the effect of validating all irregular acts performed since the departure of the absentee. This general rule of non\u2011retroactivity of the presumption of death is subject only to explicit exceptions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A prospective approach also accords with the longstanding presumption against retroactivity in statutory interpretation. Given the limited guidance to be found in the text of art.\u00a085 C.C.Q., and given that the text of art.\u00a085 and the context of the C.C.Q. do not expressly provide for or support retroactivity, the starting point should be the longstanding presumption against retroactivity. Retroactivity must be grounded in clear legislative intent. To the contrary, there is no need for an express provision to conclude that the presumption of life operates prospectively. The retroactive effects of the rebuttal of the presumption of death and of the annulment of the declaratory judgment of death on substantive rights and obligations are expressly provided for by the C.C.Q. This stands in stark contrast to the absolute silence of the C.C.Q. on the issue of whether the presumption of life can be rebutted with retroactive effects on the substantive rights and obligations of the absentee. One simply cannot infer from an exception a general rule of retroactivity for all purposes whenever the true date of death is known. The absence of express statutory text directing retroactive application of the rebuttal of the presumption of life does not support retroactivity, but rather militates against it. The rule of law requires, as a general principle, that rights and obligations as they exist at a certain point of time should not be affected by subsequent changes in circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A prospective approach moreover accords with the related absence regimes of France and of Germany. Both the Quebec and French regimes are inspired by the German model, and each manifestly reaches similar results on similar issues. Given their common Germanic inspiration, the C.C.Q. is expected to reach a result similar to the French Civil Code, which expressly provides that rights acquired without fraud on the basis of the presumption of absence may not be called in question when the death of the absentee is established or judicially declared, whatever the date fixed for the death may be. A clear provision expressly providing for a presumption of life renders unnecessary and, indeed, superfluous, the existence in the C.C.Q. of a provision equivalent to the one in the French Civil Code. In the absence of an express provision supporting a retroactive approach, there is no reason to isolate Quebec from the rest of the civil law world and from the European trend which inspired the C.C.Q. at the time of its adoption.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, a prospective approach is consistent with, and indeed compelled by, the three purposes of the absence regime and the role of the tutor, and related third parties, in furthering those purposes. The presumption of life seeks, while it is in force, to inject certainty and stability into what would otherwise be an unclear and unsettled state of affairs. A precarious state of affairs, introduced into the absence regime if the presumption of life is rebuttable with retroactive effects, is simply incompatible with the certain state of affairs that the absence regime in general and the presumption of life in particular were intended to achieve. In interpreting the C.C.Q. in a way that reflects the true state of affairs, certainty \u2014 a significant purpose of the absence regime \u2014 is sacrificed on the altar of accuracy. Not knowing whether the income might have to be returned at some point within seven years, the tutor cannot confidently honour the absentee\u2019s obligations, particularly those obligations which could not be the object of an order for restitution in favour of the absentee if the presumption of life is rebuttable with retroactive effects. This undermines the second purpose of the absence regime in general and of the presumption of life in particular, being to protect the interests of the absentee by preserving them for his or her possible return. Imposing retroactive effects on the rights of the absentee paralyzes the tutor, who can no longer safely use the absentee\u2019s incoming revenue streams to discharge his or her obligations as they come due, thereby defeating the purposes of the regime. It represents the antithesis of the certainty which the absence regime was intended to achieve, and it undermines the role a tutor is expected to fulfill in managing an absentee\u2019s affairs. Under a retroactive approach, third parties can no longer safely use the incoming monies, because if the absentee is discovered within seven years to have in fact been dead, the monies must be returned. Such an approach constitutes not only a judicial repeal of the presumption of life as far as rights of an absentee are concerned, but also constitutes such an impermissible repeal as far as obligations of an absentee are concerned. If avoiding windfalls for the absentee\u2019s succession was a concern underlying the absence regime, the legislator would have enacted \u2014 upon expiry of the seven\u2011year delay and absent any return of the absentee \u2014 a presumption of death retroactive to the day of disappearance, and the law would require the date of death to be fixed not at the date upon expiry of seven years from the disappearance but at the date of the disappearance. Therefore, avoiding windfalls for the absentee\u2019s succession is simply not a concern underlying the absence regime. Occasional windfalls are an inevitable effect of the certainty objective which informs the whole of the absence regime. Moreover, the use of the term \u201cwindfall\u201d fails to recognize the source of the entitlement \u2014 a right acquired without fraud.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Adjusting the traditional requirements of art.\u00a01491 C.C.Q. is rendered necessary under the retroactive approach in order to solve the problem which arises from the conclusion that the presumption of life may be rebutted with retroactive effects on the substantive rights and obligations of the absentee, as art.\u00a085 C.C.Q. does not expressly create an obligation to make restitution. It is a departure from existing law and jurisprudence. The three conditions that must be met before a person who received a payment must restore it to the person who made it should normally be interpreted cautiously, if not restrictively. Absent any remedy, the device which should be used to compensate an impoverished person at whose expense another has been enriched is an action in unjust enrichment \u2014 and not an adjustment to the requirements of art.\u00a01491 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, the absence of debt requirement was not met insofar as the payments made were legally due when they were paid by reason of the presumption in art.\u00a085 C.C.Q. The error requirement was also not met. There was no mistaken belief that the payment was due when it was made. The tutor\u2019s enrichment is justified: the pension benefits were paid in accordance with the presumption of life. The former employer did not meet its burden to prove that the tutor had the obligation to return the pension payments received.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Distinguished: Willmor Discount Corp.\u00a0v.

        "summary": "<strong>If a  Quebecker is found dead within seven years of going missing, it can  retroactively affect payments that were based on them being alive, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     Mr. Roseme was a professor. When he retired, he chose  a pension plan that would pay more each month. The compromise was that the  payments would stop when he died. In September 2007, Mr. Roseme was 77 years old. He was  in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. He went for a walk near his home  and never came back. About a year later, his former employer, Carleton  University, heard Mr. Roseme was missing. Carleton said he must be dead. This  meant it didn\u2019t have to keep paying the pension. It said his former partner,  Ms. Threlfall, had to pay back most of the benefits received since he  disappeared. But Ms. Threlfall pointed out that, under Quebec law,  Mr. Roseme was an \u201cabsentee.\u201d An absentee is a person who lives in Quebec and  disappears. No one knows if they are still alive. The law presumes them to be  alive for seven years, unless there is proof of death before then. The law  treats the absentee as if they are alive. They have the same rights (for  example, to pension payments) and duties (for example, to pay their mortgage)  as anyone else. Another person takes over the practical issues for them. If no  proof of death is ever found, the date of death is officially set as the  seventh anniversary of the disappearance.  At this point, Mr. Roseme was an absentee. There was  no proof he was dead. That meant Carleton had to keep paying and Ms. Threlfall  had to manage the payments on his behalf. About six years after he  disappeared, Mr. Roseme\u2019s body was found. The coroner\u2019s report said his death  was likely natural or accidental. His date of death was recorded as September  11, 2007\u2014one day after he disappeared. Since Mr. Roseme went missing, Carleton had paid  almost half a million dollars in pension benefits. Once his death was official,  it asked Ms. Threlfall for the money back. It said Mr. Roseme had agreed the  payments would stop when he died, and he died in 2007. For different reasons, the lower courts both said Ms.  Threlfall had to pay Carleton back.  The Supreme Court majority agreed that Ms. Threlfall  had to pay the money back. It said Mr. Roseme had agreed the pension payments  would stop when he died. This meant when he actually died, not the later date  his death was discovered.  Quebec law presumed Mr. Roseme was alive for the six  years he was missing. But when his body was found, this proved that he wasn\u2019t.  Mr. Roseme had a right to his pension payment while he was alive. This  continued when he went missing but was legally presumed alive. But the majority  said the source of Mr. Roseme\u2019s right to the pension went away when he died,  even if no one knew about it until later. It said that, during the time the  person was <em>presumed</em> to be alive, if  proof was found that they were <em>actually </em>dead,  the law had to rely on the true state of affairs. The majority said this  applied retroactively. This was because of the law about  absentees, and what it is meant to do. Presuming the person is alive protects  their personal and financial interests in the hope that they return. It keeps  things stable, but uncertain. After seven years, the law and the people close  to the absentee need certainty. The death then becomes legally final. If death  is proved within the seven-year period, though, the situation is different.  That\u2019s because the purposes of treating the person as alive no longer apply.  There is no more uncertainty, and no interests to protect for the person\u2019s  return.  Mr. Roseme didn\u2019t have a right to  the pension after he died. The legal basis for Carleton to pay it was the  presumption that he was alive. But this basis fell away once his true date of  death was discovered (even though no one knew that at the time). That meant Ms.  Threlfall had to pay back the money she received on Mr. Roseme\u2019s behalf. Absentees used to be  treated differently in Quebec law. They weren\u2019t considered either alive or  dead. They were declared legally dead once they had been missing for 30 years  or on their 100th birthday. The law was changed with Quebec\u2019s new <em>Civil Code</em> in 1994."

They moved to Quebec with their children in 2013. In 2014, the couple\u2019s relationship deteriorated, and S told R that she had decided to terminate their union. Two applications for divorce were then brought, one by R in Belgium on August\u00a012, and the other by S in Quebec on August\u00a015. Under Belgian law, R then revoked, in a letter, all the gifts he had given S during their marriage, which were valued at over $33 million.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 R applied to the Superior Court under art.\u00a03137 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d) to stay its ruling on S\u2019s proceedings in Quebec on the basis of international lis pendens. That court \u2014 which considered that it would not be possible to recognize in Quebec a decision of a Belgian court based on the provision of Belgium\u2019s Code civil under which R could revoke the gifts, because that provision is discriminatory \u2014 held that S\u2019s divorce proceedings in Quebec should not be stayed. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment, finding that it would be premature to conclude that a Belgian decision with respect to the revocation of the gifts could not be recognized in Quebec. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion, the trial judge had also made an error that had caused her analysis concerning the appropriateness of exercising her discretion to order a stay to be unreasonable. It therefore ordered that S\u2019s divorce proceedings in Quebec be stayed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held\u00a0(Brown\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion on dismissing the application for a stay restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The conditions for the application of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. are met in this case. R has discharged his burden, which is not onerous, of establishing that it is possible that the eventual decision of the Belgian court will be susceptible of recognition in Quebec. However, the Court of Appeal\u2019s intervention in the exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion was unwarranted. It was open to the trial judge to conclude that it was appropriate to decline to order a stay as she did in this case. Her decision on this point must therefore be restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article 3137 C.C.Q. establishes the lis pendens exception in Quebec private international law. Under it, a court may stay its ruling on an action brought in Quebec if the dispute is already the subject of proceedings before the courts of a foreign jurisdiction. Although this article is applied regularly, it constitutes an exception in that the Quebec court is departing from the general principle with respect to cases filed with it by staying proceedings that have in fact been validly brought before it. The international lis pendens exception is intended to allow the domestic court to stay its ruling in order to eventually give effect to the foreign decision in Quebec for the purpose of avoiding a situation in which parallel proceedings result in inconsistent decisions that could both have effects in Quebec. Under this article, three conditions must be met before a Quebec court may stay its ruling. First, the action must have been filed with the foreign forum first. Second, there must be an identity of parties, of facts and of subject \u2014 the condition of three identities \u2014 between the two actions that have been brought. Third, it must be possible for the foreign action to result in a decision that will be susceptible of recognition in Quebec. If any one of these conditions is not met, the application for a stay cannot be granted, because there is then not a situation of lis pendens under art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The court cannot raise the international lis pendens exception of its own motion. Article 3137 C.C.Q. provides that the Quebec authority may stay its ruling on an action only \u201c[o]n the application of a party\u201d. In accordance with the principles of evidence that apply in civil matters, and as in any other case, it is the party who raises international lis pendens and seeks a stay who must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the conditions of that article, including the third one, are met. This is provided for explicitly in art.\u00a02803 para.\u00a01 C.C.Q., which reads \u201c[a] person seeking to assert a right shall prove the facts on which his claim is based\u201d. Article 3155 C.C.Q. changes nothing in this regard. It establishes a presumption that the foreign decision is valid, and this presumption can be rebutted only if one of the six exceptions enumerated in that article applies. While it is true that the condition of susceptibility of recognition under art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. must be considered in light of the exceptions of art.\u00a03155 C.C.Q., the burden is still on the party who seeks to benefit from art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. to show that the three conditions under it are met.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In S\u2019s opinion, what is at issue in the analysis of the third condition in this case is whether art.\u00a01096 of the Belgian Code civil is inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations, which is one of the exceptions to the recognition of foreign judgments that are provided for in art.\u00a03155 C.C.Q. But according to the words setting out this exception, what must be analyzed is the outcome of the foreign decision, not the laws of the foreign jurisdiction. The purpose is not to instruct the foreign authorities in their own law. The Quebec court\u2019s role is limited to ensuring that a foreign decision is not enforced if the decision\u2019s outcome would be so inconsistent with certain of the underlying values of the Quebec legal system as to be incapable of being incorporated into it. Public order as understood in international relations is thus generally more limited than its domestic law counterpart.\u00a0The reason for this lies in a desire to apply Quebec rules of conflict that allow for the application of a foreign law under certain conditions even if that law is inconsistent with Quebec law. Thus, a foreign decision will not be recognized if its outcome runs counter to the moral, social, economic or even political conceptions that underpin Quebec\u2019s legal order. In this case, the trial judge relied solely on an analysis of the discriminatory nature of art.\u00a01096 of the Belgian Code civil to conclude that there was a \u201cgreat\u201d risk that a Belgian court\u2019s decision would not be recognized in Quebec. The discriminatory nature of the legislative provision can be a relevant factor for purposes of the analysis. However, an approach as restrictive as the one adopted by the trial judge strays from the requirements of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the context of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q., the assessment of the possibility that the foreign decision is inconsistent with international public order must take into account the required degree of proof. The burden of showing that the third condition is met, that is, that it will be possible for the foreign proceedings to result in a decision that is susceptible of recognition in Quebec, is not an onerous one. On the basis of the very words of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q., the only requirement is that the action pending in the foreign court \u201ccan result in a decision which may be recognized in Qu\u00e9bec\u201d. Thus, even if the exceptions listed in art.\u00a03155 C.C.Q. remain relevant for the purpose of determining whether the Quebec court may order a stay under art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q., the burden applicable to international lis pendens differs from the one that applies to the proceeding for recognition and enforcement of the foreign decision. Where the international lis pendens exception is at issue, the court does not rule on the question whether the foreign judgment should be incorporated into the Quebec legal order; it merely decides whether the proceedings brought in Quebec should be stayed pending the filing there of an application for exemplification. In such situations, the Quebec court does not always have the benefit of a final foreign decision. The analysis with respect to the condition of susceptibility of recognition cannot therefore be completed as definitively as in the context of the exemplification proceeding. That is why certain authors describe the burden of proof under art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. in terms of a \u201cprognosis\u201d or a \u201cplausibility\u201d of recognition. The applicant can discharge this burden by showing that it is possible that the foreign decision will eventually be recognized in Quebec. This low threshold can be explained in particular by the underlying purposes of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q., namely to foster international comity and avert the risk of potentially conflicting judgments.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge imposed a burden of proof that was more onerous than the one required by art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. R was required to show only that there was a possibility that the eventual Belgian decision would not be manifestly inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations. At this time, the outcome of the eventual Belgian decision is uncertain. There are a number of factors in support of the possibility that that outcome will not involve the revocation of the gifts, and therefore that it will not be manifestly inconsistent with this international public order. This is enough to meet the third condition of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Once the applicant has established that there is in fact a situation of international lis pendens for the purposes of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q., the Quebec court must still exercise its discretion and decide whether it should stay its ruling in the circumstances. The discretion under art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. is grounded in the idea that, even if the dispute was submitted to the foreign court first, and even if none of the exceptions to the recognition of foreign decisions set out in art.\u00a03155 C.C.Q. apply, it is nonetheless possible that the foreign court is not the one that has the closest connections with the dispute. In this regard, the required analysis is related to the one that applies with respect to the discretion under art.\u00a03135 C.C.Q., which codifies the doctrine of forum non conveniens in Quebec private international law. Because of this close relationship, the criteria developed by the courts with respect to forum non conveniens also apply to international lis pendens. The list of criteria is not exhaustive, and the weight to be attached to each of the criteria depends on the circumstances. While the perspective specific to each article differs, there is no reason to distinguish the analysis of the criteria conducted for the purposes of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. from the one required in the context of art.\u00a03135 C.C.Q. solely on the basis of the nature of the application.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The standard for intervention that should be applied to an exercise of the discretion in the context of international lis pendens is an exacting one. An appeal court should intervene only if the judge who ruled on the application erred in principle, misapprehended or failed to take account of material evidence, or reached an unreasonable decision. A simple difference of opinion will not suffice. In the end, the possible recognition of the Quebec judgment in the other country is the only criterion on which the Court of Appeal relied to substitute its own analysis for that of the trial judge in this case. The Court of Appeal expressed no disagreement with her regarding the other criteria she had discussed. This criterion alone could not justify that court\u2019s intervention in the trial judge\u2019s exercise of her discretion. The recognition of the Quebec judgment in the other country cannot be a determinative consideration unless the Quebec judgment would not be effective without being enforced in the other country. There is no doubt in this case that the Quebec judgment would be effective, given that much of the valuable property at issue in the litigation is located in Quebec.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella\u00a0J.: There is agreement that the proceedings in Quebec should not be stayed. However, there is disagreement with the majority\u2019s application of the legal scheme governing the susceptibility of recognition of foreign decisions. R has not discharged his burden of demonstrating that a Belgian decision rendered under art.\u00a01096 of the Belgian Civil Code permitting the unilateral revocation of gifts could be recognized by a Quebec court. As a result, he has not met the test for a stay.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The evidence shows that the Belgian provision is non\u2011discretionary and allows a spouse to unilaterally revoke, without any formalities or justification, gifts bestowed during the marriage. It is an absolute right, even when exercised in bad faith. More significantly, the revocation contemplated under art.\u00a01096 of the Belgian Civil Code is valid in Belgium even when its application results in flagrant inequalities between spouses. In this case, the husband is seeking to unilaterally revoke over $33 million dollars in assets. As the trial judge found, the consequences for the wife will be catastrophic.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The party seeking a stay under art.\u00a03137 of the C.C.Q. bears the burden of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that a stay should be granted. This includes the burden to demonstrate that the outcome of the foreign decision will not be manifestly inconsistent with public order. Because of the uncertainty usually surrounding the effects of a pending decision, the examination simply requires demonstrating a possibility that the decision will be recognized. While it may be desirable in some cases to await the outcome of a pending proceeding to determine whether it will be inconsistent with the public order condition, art.\u00a03137 of the C.C.Q. does not require a court to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal was of the view that the burden was not on the husband who was seeking the stay, but on the wife who opposed it. This reversal of the onus led the Court of Appeal to suggest various hypotheticals showing that it was premature to determine at this stage whether the decision would be manifestly inconsistent with public order. Allowing speculation to drive the analysis, rather than the reality of the revocation for the wife, empties the burden on the husband of any meaning.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A decision, or pending decision, cannot be recognized in Quebec if, contrary to art.\u00a03155 of the C.C.Q., it is \u201cmanifestly inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations\u201d. Not every foreign decision that reaches a result different from what it would likely be under Quebec law will be found to violate the fundamental values underlying the international public order. The international public order exception applies only to situations where the application of a foreign law would contradict the moral, social, economic and political conceptions underlying the Quebec legal system to such an extent as to be incapable of combining with it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The violation of the principle of spousal equality would be manifestly incompatible with public order as understood in international relations. Various international instruments reinforce the view that inequality between spouses in the divorce context is contrary to public order as understood in international relations. As well, the equality of spouses and the protection of a vulnerable one are philosophical underpinnings of the C.C.Q. The spousal property regime in Quebec allows the spouses to choose together which regime they wish to apply to their property. It is a regime based both on consensus and equality between the parties. Foreign judgments which contradict those conceptions, such as any decision made under art.\u00a01096 of the Belgian Civil Code in this case, will not be recognized in Quebec. Without any evidence that there is even a possibility of a judgment in Belgium that does not infringe these fundamental public order values, the outcome of the decision under art.\u00a01096 of the Belgian Civil Code could not be recognized in Quebec.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown\u00a0J. (dissenting): The Quebec Court of Appeal was right to intervene in the discretionary decision of the Quebec Superior Court and grant the requested stay. The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is agreement with the majority that the Superior Court erred in concluding that none of the threshold conditions of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. for the exercise of the discretion were met. However, the majority fails to address the Superior Court\u2019s error of law with respect to the subject of an action, which directly affected that court\u2019s conclusions relating to the condition of first filing with the foreign authority. These errors had a determinative impact on the Superior Court\u2019s decision to decline to stay its ruling.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is also disagreement with the majority regarding the Superior Court\u2019s exercise of its discretion. The discretion conferred on the Quebec authority by art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. has two purposes. First, it is intended to prevent abusive forum shopping, a practice that would on the contrary be encouraged if the Quebec authority systematically deferred to a first filing with a foreign authority. Second, the international lis pendens exception is also intended to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings and a risk of conflicting judgments. The Superior Court erred in ruling out this risk when it found that the claims concerning the partition of the family patrimony and the compensatory allowance had been submitted to the Quebec court first and that the Cour d\u2019appel de Bruxelles could also order a stay with respect to the claims that have been submitted to the Belgian court first. The Superior Court should not have disregarded as it did the risk of conflicting judgments being rendered by the Quebec and Belgian courts. That was an error of law. The discretion provided for in art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. cannot be exercised without giving serious consideration to the very purpose of this article, which is to avoid conflicting judgments.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The courts and the authors recommend that the criteria developed in the context of the doctrine of forum non conveniens be applied to international lis pendens cases. These criteria must be assessed from the specific perspective of art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q., which is not the same as that of art.\u00a03135 C.C.Q. The legislature has provided that the Quebec court\u2019s power to decline to exercise its jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens is exceptional in nature. In contrast, ordering a stay in a case of international lis pendens under art.\u00a03137 C.C.Q. is not exceptional; in a spirit of cooperation based on international comity, Quebec courts are in fact quite open to doing so. Accordingly, it is not necessary to establish that the foreign authority is clearly more appropriate, as is the case in the context of forum non conveniens. In the context of international lis pendens, it is enough to show that the foreign authority is an appropriate forum.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Superior Court also erred on the issue of the law applicable to the revocation of gifts, that is, on the main issue on which the parties disagree. Contrary to the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion, under the Quebec rules of private international law, Belgian law is the law applicable to the revocation of the gifts, at least in respect of the gifts that were given while the parties were residing in Belgium.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, the Superior Court did not consider the fact that an eventual Quebec judgment liquidating the parties\u2019 matrimonial regime would not be susceptible of recognition in Belgium, where the parties still own numerous assets. Where, as in this case, a foreign authority to which a dispute was submitted first is an appropriate forum, the Quebec authority should be circumspect in exercising its discretion to not stay its ruling. First, if the Quebec authority declines to stay its ruling, it and the foreign authority could render conflicting judgments, and the Quebec proceedings could prove to be pointless in the event that the foreign authority to which the dispute was submitted first rendered its decision before the Quebec court. Second, if the Quebec authority were to exercise its discretion not to stay its ruling, there might then be a real risk that the Quebec decision would not be susceptible of recognition by the foreign authority to which the dispute was submitted first specifically because of the Quebec authority\u2019s violation of the lis pendens rule. In this case, the fact that a Quebec decision is not recognized in another country is an important factor, as the parties have numerous assets in Belgium, which means that a Quebec judgment that cannot be recognized in that country could be of no effect in respect of those assets. It makes no sense for a Quebec court to partition the numerous assets located outside Quebec, given that the resulting judgment would not be susceptible of recognition at the place where the assets are located.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: \u00c9ditions \u00c9cosoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0Quebec court doesn\u2019t always have to put its proceedings on hold when a  foreign court is hearing the same dispute, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   In  today\u2019s world, life crosses borders. But laws and courts are local. \u201cPrivate  international law\u201d is the branch of law that deals with this. For example, a  court may decide not to hear a case if another country has a stronger  connection to it. A court in one country may even apply the laws of <em>another</em> country. Two  people met in France and got married in Belgium. They later moved to Quebec  with their children. In 2014, the husband filed for divorce in Belgium. Three  days later, the wife filed for divorce in Quebec. The husband later said he was  taking back all the gifts he ever gave the wife. Belgian law said he could do  this. The gifts totalled over $33 million and included half of the family\u2019s  home in Quebec.  The  husband asked the Quebec court to \u201cstay\u201d the wife\u2019s application (that is, to  put it on hold). This was because courts in two countries would be deciding the  same dispute, and could make contradictory decisions. This is one of the  problems private international law tries to avoid. The wife also asked the  Belgian court to put the husband\u2019s case on hold. She said the Belgian law letting  him take back the gifts was unconstitutional. There  are three conditions to meet before Quebec courts can consider putting  proceedings on hold to wait for a decision in another country. First, someone  must have asked for a court hearing in the other country first. Second, cases  in both countries have to deal with the same legal dispute. Third, it has to be  possible for the (eventual) foreign decision to be recognized in Quebec. If one  of these conditions isn\u2019t met, the Quebec court can\u2019t order a stay. Even if all  three conditions are met, the Quebec court still has the \u201cdiscretion\u201d not to  order a stay. Discretion is a judge\u2019s freedom to decide certain issues. But there  are limits to that freedom. The application judge in Quebec said  the third condition wasn\u2019t met. She said Quebec courts wouldn\u2019t recognize a Belgian  decision taking back the gifts. This was because the law unfairly discriminated  against spouses. That meant the case had to go forward in Quebec. Even if all  the conditions were met, the application judge said she still wouldn\u2019t have used  her discretion to put the Quebec proceedings on hold.  The  Court of Appeal said all the conditions were met. It said the third condition  was met if it was <em>possible </em>that the Belgian  decision might be recognized in Quebec. It said the proceedings on divorce and  division of property had to be put on hold in Quebec. (Other issues related to  the children and support could go ahead.) It also said that the application  judge made serious mistakes in using her discretion. In the meantime, the Belgian  courts said <em>they</em> should decide most  of the issues.  The Supreme Court majority agreed  with the Court of Appeal that the husband met all three conditions for a possible  stay. It said even though it wasn\u2019t clear if the Belgian decision would be  recognized in Quebec, the husband had done enough to show it might be.  But the majority said the  application judge\u2019s decision to hear the case should still stand. Even  if the three conditions are met, Quebec courts shouldn\u2019t automatically put  their proceedings on hold. A judge can still decide it\u2019s appropriate to hear a  dispute in Quebec. This could be, for example, if Quebec was closely connected  to the dispute. In this case, the family home (worth over six million dollars)  was in Quebec. A Quebec decision would have some force even if Belgium didn\u2019t  recognize it. The majority added even  if it might not agree with the application judge\u2019s whole analysis, the Court of  Appeal shouldn\u2019t have interfered. For issues where discretion can be used, the  first judge to hear the facts is best-placed to decide. Higher courts can only  interfere if the first judge made a serious legal or factual mistake. It can\u2019t  just be a difference of opinion. The majority said the application judge didn\u2019t  make such a mistake in this case.  The Supreme Court  previously dealt with private international law in <em><a href=\"37594-eng.aspx\">Barer v.  Knight Brothers LLC</a></em> and <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/37202-eng.aspx\">Haaretz.com v.  Goldhar</a></em>."

The sentencing judge sentenced P to a conditional sentence of two years less a day for two counts of gross indecency. A conditional sentence could not be imposed as a punishment when P committed his acts of gross indecency \u2014 it only became available as a form of sentence in 1996. Furthermore, the parties agreed that it was no longer applicable to the offence of gross indecency, according to the provisions in force, by the time P was charged, convicted and sentenced. In imposing a conditional sentence on P, the judge considered that s.\u00a011(i) of the Charter entitled P to the benefit of a lesser sentence that was available in the interval between the commission of the offences and P\u2019s sentencing. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal, holding that s.\u00a011(i) gave P the right to a conditional sentence. Shortly before the hearing of the Crown\u2019s appeal before the Court, P passed away. The appeal proceeded nonetheless, accompanied by a Crown motion for the Court to adjudicate the appeal even though it had become factually moot.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Abella, Karakatsanis and Brown\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The motion to proceed with the appeal and the appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Martin\u00a0JJ.: This is one of those rare and exceptional cases in which the Court ought to exercise its discretion to adjudicate a moot criminal appeal. First, the Court has had the benefit of adversarial submissions in this case. Second, the Crown\u2019s appeal raises an important constitutional question that has not yet received comprehensive treatment in the jurisprudence. Third, the proper interpretation of s.\u00a011(i) of the Charter is a legal issue of general public importance which transcends P\u2019s death. Fourth, the value of the Court\u2019s ruling on the proper interpretation of s.\u00a011(i) clearly outweighs any concerns about limited judicial resources. It is much more efficient and fair for the Court to decide this question of national importance now, rather than cause future litigants and lower courts to expend further resources debating this question until, inevitably, it reaches the Court anew. Finally, it is for the courts, not Parliament, to define the scope of Charter rights. The Court would therefore not be intruding on the legislative role by answering the question put to it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A purposive analysis of s.\u00a011(i) of the Charter leads to the conclusion that an offender is not entitled to the benefit of a temporary reduction in punishment which occurred in the interval between the time of commission and the time of sentencing. Section\u00a011(i) confers a binary right, not a global one. A binary right involves a comparison of the punishments under the laws in force at two set points in time (commission of the offence and sentencing) and the right to receive the lesser of these punishments. By contrast, a global right involves a review of all punishments that have existed for the offence between its commission and sentencing, and the right to receive the least severe punishment in that entire span of time. The language and origins of s.\u00a011(i) both confirm the purposes of s.\u00a011(i) \u2014 namely the rule of law and fairness \u2014 and indicate that s.\u00a011(i) is intended to confer a binary right.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A Charter right must be interpreted purposively \u2014 that is, in a manner that is justified by its purposes. Purposive interpretation can be mistakenly conflated with generous interpretation. While Charter rights must be interpreted in a large and liberal manner, they are ultimately bounded by their purposes. Courts that have given s.\u00a011(i) a global reading have fallen into the error of prioritizing generosity over purpose. Rather than identifying the principles or purposes underlying s.\u00a011(i), they have simply concluded that s.\u00a011(i) should be given the interpretation most generous to the accused. However, the principle that a provision bearing more than one plausible meaning must be read in a manner that favours the accused is not a principle of Charter interpretation. It is a principle of penal statutory interpretation. Reading s.\u00a011(i) in a manner that would require the court to impose the most favourable punishment identifiable in the interval between the offence and sentencing does not reflect the kind of generous interpretation that Charter rights should receive. Rather, it reflects an unduly generous interpretation, disconnected from the purposes of the right.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When conducting a purposive analysis of a Charter right, the starting point must be the language of the section. Section\u00a011(i) was worded to confer a binary right. The origins of s.\u00a011(i) corroborate this conclusion. While the origins of s.\u00a011(i) are not determinative of the right\u2019s proper scope, they provide an instructive starting point. A review of s.\u00a011(i)\u2019s historical context reveals that there was nothing to inspire a global right at the time of its drafting and enactment. A global right was not part of the legal landscape; the common law certainly did not recognize one, and none of the enactments inspiring s.\u00a011(i) embraced one either.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section\u00a011(i) balances, on the one hand, the principle of the rule of law and, on the other, the principle of fairness. It enshrines the common law rule that an offender should not be retrospectively subjected to a heavier punishment than the one applicable at the time the person committed the offence. The rationale for this rule is the rule of law and, more specifically, the principle of legality, which dictates that persons who rely on the state of the law in conducting themselves, or who risk the liability associated with a law in breaking it, should not subsequently be held to different laws, particularly more stringent ones. However, s.\u00a011(i) constitutionalizes an additional protection. It stipulates that, where the law provides a more favourable punishment at the time of the offender\u2019s sentencing than it did at the time of the offence, the offender is entitled to the benefit of this more favourable, current punishment. The rationale for this is fairness. It would not be fair to subject an offender to a punishment which, in choosing to reduce it, Parliament has expressly recognized as no longer appropriate. Further, a criminal sentence is an expression of society\u2019s collective voice; it is meant to reflect contemporary values.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A binary interpretation of s.\u00a011(i) is not unfair or arbitrary for an offender who is punished according to the law in place at the time he committed his offence, or a more favourable law, if one is in place when he is sentenced. To the contrary, these two laws are linked to the offender and the proceedings against him; the first sets out the punishment he risked incurring at the time he acted, and the other likewise sets the contours for a sentence that reflects society\u2019s attitude about the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender at the precise moment the sentence is imposed. It is, accordingly, fair and rational for the offender to have the benefit of one of these punishments. Conversely, there is no principled basis to grant an offender the benefit of a punishment which has no connection to his offending conduct or to society\u2019s view of his conduct at the time the court is called upon to pass sentence. Furthermore, countervailing fairness considerations militate against a global approach to s.\u00a011(i). A global approach to s.\u00a011(i) would disproportionately benefit those who are sentenced years, or even decades, after their offences. Sexual offences like P\u2019s often go long unreported. Survivors of sexual trauma commonly delay in disclosing abuse for reasons such as embarrassment, fear, guilt, or a lack of understanding and knowledge. There should be no additional gain to an offender under s.\u00a011(i) when a victim is traumatized to the point of requiring significant time to overcome any reluctance to report the offence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0convicted person has the right to the punishment that applied either  when they committed their crime or when they are sentenced, whichever is lower,  the Supreme Court has ruled. They don\u2019t have a right to the lowest punishment  that might have existed any time in between.</strong>\r\n   Everyone  charged with a crime has certain rights. These rights are found in the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Section 11(i) sets out what happens when the  punishment for a crime changes between the time a person commits the crime and  the time they are sentenced for it. It says the person has the right \u201cto the  benefit of the lesser punishment\u201d in that case. Mr.  Poulin committed sexual crimes between 1979 and 1987. He was charged in 2014,  convicted in 2016, and sentenced in 2017. He was old and in poor health, so he  asked for a conditional sentence. A conditional sentence meant Mr. Poulin  wouldn\u2019t go to jail, but had to follow certain conditions. The sentencing judge  agreed.  The  Crown said the judge was wrong to give Mr. Poulin the conditional sentence. It  said this wasn\u2019t an option either when Mr. Poulin committed his crimes, or when  he was sentenced. It said that the judge could only look at those two points in  time when deciding on the \u201clesser\u201d punishment. Mr.  Poulin said section 11(i) meant the judge had to look at those two points in  time. But he said the judge also had to look at all the points in time between.  He said he should have the benefit of the lowest punishment that was available for  his crimes at <em>any time</em> over those three  decades. There was a period of time when the law made a conditional sentence an  option for his crimes. He said section 11(i)\u2019s guarantee of the \u201clesser  punishment\u201d meant he should be able to get it. Most  courts in Canada had followed Mr. Poulin\u2019s interpretation in the past. The  Court of Appeal also agreed. The  majority of the Supreme Court said Mr. Poulin\u2019s interpretation of section 11(i)  was wrong. It said the sentencing judge should only look at the time the crime  was committed and the time Mr. Poulin was sentenced when deciding the lesser  punishment. The  majority said rights should be interpreted generously \u2013 but only within the  limits set out by their purposes. Looking at the purposes of section 11(i), the  majority said only two points in time were really relevant to section 11(i).  The first was the time the crime was committed. The punishment in force at this  time reflected the legal risk the person took in choosing to commit the crime.  The second was the time the person is sentenced. The punishment in force at  this time reflects society\u2019s most up-to-date view on what is appropriate. The  majority said section 11(i) wasn\u2019t meant to give a person the right to comb  through the past to find the most favourable punishment ever available. Section  11(i) protects people against the unfairness of being sentenced to a punishment  that society no longer thinks is appropriate for their crimes. But it would be  unfair to make lower punishments available to people who got away with their  crimes longer. This is often the case with sexual crimes like Mr. Poulin\u2019s.  Longer time periods would mean more chance that punishments might change, even  through error or oversight. Offenders like Mr. Poulin would benefit from a  punishment that had little connection either to their criminal behaviour or to  society\u2019s view of the crimes when they were sentenced. Section 11(i) clearly  wasn\u2019t meant to work like that. The  majority noted there could be a situation where the punishment changes between  the time a person is charged and the time they are sentenced. It could be  unfair to give them a harsher punishment that became law later if they relied  on the lower one and turned themselves in. But the majority said this would  have to be decided in a future case. The issue was moot before the  Supreme Court heard it. \u201cMoot\u201d means a judge\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t matter for the  immediate purpose of the parties. This was because Mr. Poulin died shortly  before the Supreme Court heard the case. The Court decided to hear it anyway  because the issue was important and it might affect others. "

The police became aware of the flag rally in the months preceding it and had developed an operational plan, given the contentious atmosphere in the community which had on numerous occasions culminated in violent clashes between the two sides. The plan included keeping protestors and counter\u2011protestors apart, and flag rally counter\u2011protestors were informed that they were not allowed on the occupied property. When the police spotted F walking on the shoulder of the road running along the occupied property, they headed toward him with the intention of placing themselves between him and the entrance to the property. To avoid the police vehicles, F stepped onto the occupied property, which appeared to cause a reaction in a group of protestors, some of whom began moving toward him. An officer then approached F and told him he was under arrest to prevent a breach of the peace. When F refused to drop the flag he was carrying, he was forced to the ground, handcuffed, placed in an offender transport unit van, moved to a jail cell and released two and a half hours later. The Crown eventually withdrew the charge of obstructing a police officer which had been laid against F for resisting his arrest. F subsequently filed a statement of claim against the Province and the police officers who had been involved in his arrest. He claimed general damages for assault and battery, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment, as well as aggravated or punitive damages and damages for violation of his rights under ss.\u00a02(b), 7, 9 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. F was successful at trial, but a majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the award of damages on the basis that the police had the authority at common law to arrest him. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial solely on the issue of excessive force. F appeals to the Court on the issue of whether the police acted lawfully in arresting him, and on whether a new trial should have been ordered on the question of excessive force.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and the trial judge\u2019s order restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 F\u2019s arrest was not authorized by law, and there is no basis for intervening in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the Province and the police were liable for battery for their use of force in unlawfully arresting him. As a result, no new trial is needed on the issue of excessive force.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To determine whether a particular police action that interferes with individual liberty is authorized at common law, the ancillary powers doctrine must be applied. At the preliminary step of the analysis, the police power that is being asserted and the liberty interests that are at stake must be clearly defined. The analysis then proceeds in two stages. First, the court must ask whether the police conduct at issue falls within the general scope of a statutory or common law police duty. Second, the court must determine whether the conduct involves a justifiable exercise of police powers associated with that duty. At the second stage, the court must ask whether the police action is reasonably necessary for the fulfillment of the duty. There are three factors to be weighed in answering that question: (1)\u00a0the importance of the performance of the duty to the public good, (2)\u00a0the necessity of the interference with individual liberty for the performance of the duty, and (3)\u00a0the extent of the interference with individual liberty. Throughout the analysis, the onus is always on the state. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second stage of the ancillary powers doctrine must always be applied with rigour to ensure that the state has satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the interference with individual liberty is justified and necessary. The standard of justification must be commensurate with the fundamental rights at stake, and in the unique context of a purported power of arrest such as the one in the present case, that standard is especially stringent for a number of reasons. First, the purported power would enable the police to interfere with the liberty of someone acting lawfully. Such a power is extraordinary in nature and it is especially important for the court to guard against intrusions on the liberty of persons who are neither accused nor suspected of committing any crime. Second, the purported police power is preventative, and the court must be very cautious about authorizing police actions merely because an unlawful or disruptive act could occur. Vague or overly permissive standards in such situations would sanction profound intrusions on liberty with little societal benefit. Third, because the purported power of arrest would generally not result in charges, judicial oversight of its exercise would be rare. As a result, any standard outlined at the outset would have to be clear and highly protective of liberty.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, the purported police power is a power to arrest someone who is acting lawfully in order to prevent an apprehended breach of the peace by others. It targets individuals who are not suspected of being about to break any law or to initiate any violence themselves, in situations in which the police nonetheless believe that arresting the individuals in question will prevent a breach of the peace from occurring. The proposed power would involve substantial prima facie interference with significant liberty interests. Indeed, few police actions interfere with an individual\u2019s liberty more than arrest \u2014 an action which completely restricts the person\u2019s ability to move about in society free from state coercion. It would have a direct impact on a constellation of rights that are fundamental to individual freedom in our society, and it would directly undermine the expectation of all individuals, in the lawful exercise of their liberty, to live their lives free from coercive interference by the state. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This purported power falls within the general scope of the police duties of preserving the peace, preventing crime and protecting life and property recognized at common law. Preventing breaches of the peace, which entail violence and a risk of harm, is plainly related to those duties. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the purported police power is not reasonably necessary for the fulfillment of those relevant duties. While preserving the peace and protecting people from violence are immensely important, and while there may be exceptional circumstances in which some interference with liberty is required in order to prevent a breach of the peace, an arrest cannot be justified under the ancillary powers doctrine. There is already a statutory power of arrest that can be exercised should an individual resist or obstruct an officer taking other, less intrusive measures. In addition, the mere fact that a police action was effective cannot be relied upon to justify its being taken if it interfered with an individual\u2019s liberty. If the police can reasonably attain the same result by taking an action that intrudes less on liberty, a more intrusive measure will not be reasonably necessary no matter how effective it may be. An intrusion upon liberty should be a measure of last resort.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As there is no common law power to arrest someone who is acting lawfully in order to prevent an apprehended breach of the peace by others, the police in this case did not have lawful authority to arrest F. The trial judge specifically found that F had not done anything unlawful before being arrested; there was no evidence before her that he had committed any offence in walking along the street, entering the occupied property or standing there with his Canadian flag. Nor was there evidence that he had himself been about to commit an indictable offence or a breach of the peace. The Province and the police have not sought to challenge that finding on appeal, nor have they cited or relied on any statutory power to arrest F. They rely entirely on a common law power to arrest someone who is acting lawfully in order to prevent an apprehended breach of the peace by other persons \u2014 a power that does not exist. In light of this conclusion, a new trial on the issue of excessive force is not necessary. As the police were not authorized at common law to arrest F, no amount of force would have been justified for the purpose of accomplishing that task.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Dedman v.

        "summary": "<strong>Police can\u2019t arrest someone who isn\u2019t breaking the law to prevent others  from breaching the peace, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Mr.  Fleming was on his way to join a protest in Caledonia, Ontario in 2009. The  protest was against the occupation of a piece of land by a First Nations group.  He was carrying a Canadian flag on a wooden pole and walking down a street  beside the occupied land.  Police  officers saw him as they drove by. There had been violence in the past, and  they were planning to keep the groups apart. The officers turned their vehicles  around and sped toward him. Mr. Fleming got off the road and crossed a low  fence. He said he did this to get away from the speeding vehicles and onto  level ground. The officers were yelling. Mr. Fleming said he didn\u2019t think they  were yelling at him because he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. The  people occupying the land came toward him. When they were about ten or twenty  feet away, the police told Mr. Fleming he was under arrest. They ordered him to  drop his flag. He refused. Officers forced him to the ground, took his flag, and  handcuffed him. Mr. Fleming said they injured his arm. The police took him to  jail but let him go a few hours later. He was charged with obstructing a police  officer (preventing a police officer from doing their job). He went to court a  dozen times to fight the charge, which was later dropped. In  2011, Mr. Fleming sued the Province of Ontario and the officers involved in his  arrest. He said the officers acted wrongfully. He said they assaulted and  battered him, wrongfully arrested him, and falsely imprisoned him. He also said  they violated several of his rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, part of Canada\u2019s  Constitution. Police  officers get their powers from statutes (like the <em>Criminal Code</em>) and common law (the law made by judges deciding  cases). They can only act within those laws. Under the common law, the police  can limit someone\u2019s freedom (for example, arrest them) if it\u2019s reasonably  necessary to carry out their duties. The police argued they had the power to  arrest Mr. Fleming under the common law. They said it was to prevent a \u201cbreach  of the peace.\u201d A breach of the peace is more than a disturbance. It means there  is a risk of violence and that someone will get hurt. The  trial judge said the police didn\u2019t have the power to arrest Mr. Fleming. She  said he should be compensated because officers violated his rights. The  majority at the Court of Appeal disagreed. It said the police <em>did </em>have the power to arrest him. It  said arresting him was necessary because officers thought there was going to be  a breach of the peace. It did say there should be a new trial about whether the  officers used too much force, though. The  Supreme Court unanimously said the officers didn\u2019t have the power to arrest Mr.  Fleming. The police can\u2019t arrest someone acting lawfully just because they  think it will stop others from breaching the peace. They already have other  powers to deal with these situations under the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Since they had these less drastic options, arresting  Mr. Fleming wasn\u2019t really necessary. The  Court noted that preserving the peace, preventing crime, and protecting life  and property are the main duties of police officers under the common law. They  have the power to take actions to support these duties, even if these actions  aren\u2019t specifically set out in the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.Preventing breaches of the  peace is obviously related to preserving the peace, preventing crime, and  protecting life and property. But the Court said it wasn\u2019t reasonably necessary  to arrest someone to prevent a breach of the peace, if that person hadn\u2019t done  (and wasn\u2019t about to do) anything wrong.  Police  are allowed to use as much force as reasonably necessary to carry out their  duties. But in this case, they weren\u2019t allowed to arrest Mr. Fleming, so no  amount of force was justified.  Taking away  someone\u2019s freedom, even temporarily, is serious. Often, in situations like Mr.  Fleming\u2019s, the person wouldn\u2019t have any way to challenge their arrest in court,  because there wouldn\u2019t be any charges. The only option would be an expensive  civil lawsuit. This was another reason the Court said the standards for judging  police actions should be strict."

C sought to have the proceedings stayed on the ground that they were abusive in that there had been state conduct that risked undermining the integrity of the justice system. C submitted that high\u2011ranking government representatives had provided journalists with a significant quantity of confidential information for the purpose of prejudicing him. C therefore served a subpoena on D, a journalist who had published information from the leaks. He hoped that the disclosure of the sources would make it possible to identify those who were responsible for the leaks. D contested her subpoena. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec proceeded to the balancing exercise required by the new federal statutory scheme for the protection of journalistic sources set out in s.\u00a039.1 of the Canada Evidence Act (\u201cCEA\u201d) \u2014 a new provision that had been enacted by the Journalistic Sources Protection Act, S.C. 2017, c.\u00a022 \u2014 and quashed the subpoena. The Superior Court, hearing an appeal, applied s.\u00a039.1 CEA anew and confirmed that the subpoena was valid. That decision was appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which held that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Abella J. dissenting): The appeal against the Superior Court\u2019s decision should be allowed in part, the order authorizing disclosure should be set aside, and the case should be remanded to the court of original jurisdiction for reconsideration. The appeal against the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: Section 39.1 CEA concerns subpoenas to give testimony or orders to produce documents that are issued to journalists and are likely to reveal the identities of confidential sources. In carrying out its plan to modernize the law by including s.\u00a039.1 in the CEA, Parliament drew upon the various decisions of the Court, but modified the structure of the test and the weights of the identified criteria. It thus created a scheme of new law from which a clear intention emerges: to afford enhanced protection to the confidentiality of journalistic sources in the context of journalists\u2019 relations with those sources.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A threshold requirement for the application of the new scheme is that the person objecting to the disclosure of information or a document that identifies or is likely to identify a journalistic source must show that he or she is a \u201cjournalist\u201d, and his or her source a \u201cjournalistic source\u201d, as defined in the CEA. Next, if the person succeeds in doing so, it is the party who seeks to know the source\u2019s identity who must then prove that the conditions for judicial authorization of the disclosure are met. If a journalist objects to the disclosure of information on the ground that it is likely to identify a confidential source, non\u2011disclosure should be the starting point for the analysis. It is then up to the party seeking to obtain the information to rebut this presumption. This shifting of the burden of proof is the most important difference between the former common law scheme and the new federal statutory scheme. Whereas the applicability of the journalist\u2011source privilege was the exception in the former scheme, it has now become the rule. The court may not authorize the disclosure of information unless the party seeking its disclosure shows that the condition based on reasonable necessity is met and that the balancing exercise under the CEA weighs in favour of disclosure.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The party seeking the disclosure of information or a document that identifies or is likely to identify a journalistic source must show that the disclosure is reasonably necessary, that is, that the information being sought cannot be produced in evidence by any other reasonable means. If this is not shown, the case is closed, and the application for disclosure will be dismissed. If the party seeking the disclosure of information meets this requirement, he or she must then convince the court that the public interest in the administration of justice outweighs the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the journalistic source. This balancing exercise requires considering, on the one hand, the importance of the document or information being sought to a central issue in the proceeding and, on the other hand, the impact on freedom of the press and on the journalist and the source. To be successful, a party must convince the court that the document or information at issue is so important that this balancing exercise weighs in favour of disclosure. The court must bear in mind that disclosing information that identifies or is likely to identify a source is an appropriate remedy only where the advantages of doing so outweigh the disadvantages. It is only as a last resort that a court should require a journalist to breach a confidentiality undertaking with a source.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the Court, the Crown abandoned its original position with respect to C\u2019s motion for a stay of proceedings, and it now maintains that the disclosure of new information alters the factual matrix. The Crown\u2019s change of position is serious enough to justify an intervention by the Court, but it precludes appellate review of the Superior Court\u2019s decision on the merits. This change of position instead justifies remanding the case to the court of original jurisdiction in order to have that court conduct anew, once the new evidence has been adduced by the Crown, the analysis required by s.\u00a039.1 CEA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal was right to find that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s decision confirming that the subpoena was valid. First, the right of appeal is a statutory right. It is an exceptional right that cannot exist if no legislation provides for it. Second, where there are two levels of appeal, they are provided for in legislation, which is not the case here with the CEA. The existence of a single level of appeal is, moreover, consistent with the purpose of efficiency and expeditiousness being pursued in s.\u00a039.1 CEA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella J. (dissenting): The Journalistic Sources Protection Act is legislation of historic weight. The new scheme anticipates that absent exceptional circumstances, a presumption of protection for journalistic sources will prevail. The burden is on the party seeking disclosure to demonstrate both that there is no other reasonable means of getting the information and that the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of journalistic sources is outweighed by the public interest in the administration of justice. Through the Act, Parliament clearly asserted its intention to provide journalists with more robust statutory protections than existed under the common law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While the factual terrain in this appeal may have shifted, the legal foundation for the Superior Court of Quebec\u2019s conclusion that a disclosure authorization was appropriate is unsustainable in light of the language and purposes of the Act. The Superior Court effectively placed a burden on the journalist to demonstrate why she should not be forced to reveal her sources, rather than requiring the party seeking disclosure to prove why those sources should be revealed. Moreover, the Superior Court applied the new legislation in a way that mirrored, rather than departed from, the former common law regime, and failed to recognize the paramount objective of protecting journalistic sources. Given these fundamental legal errors in the interpretation and application of the legislation, the disclosure authorization issued against the journalist should be set aside and the subpoena quashed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0journalist can only be forced to reveal a source if  it\u2019s absolutely necessary and in the public interest, the Supreme Court has said.</strong>\r\n     Mr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 was a former Quebec politician. In 2016, he  was arrested on charges related to possible political corruption from 2000 to  2012. Ms. Denis was a journalist with Radio-Canada. Between  2012 and 2016, she gave four television reports about the possible corruption.  The reports contained sensitive information that Ms. Denis got from  confidential sources. Mr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 said the criminal charges  were an \u201cabuse of process\u201d (a misuse of the courts). He asked for a \u201cstay of  proceedings\u201d (a suspension of the charges that is usually permanent). He said  that if he knew who Ms. Denis\u2019 sources were, he could identify who was  responsible for the leaks. He could then prove that the government was trying  to hurt his case, which would justify staying the charges. Mr. C\u00f4t\u00e9 got a legal  order to make Ms. Denis reveal her sources. Ms. Denis refused. She said she didn\u2019t even know the  identities of the people who gave her information for two of the reports. The Court of Quebec judge said Ms. Denis didn\u2019t have  to reveal her sources, because she didn\u2019t know who they were. The Superior  Court said the Court of Quebec judge made a mistake. This was because Ms. Denis <em>did</em> know the sources for two of the  four reports. It said she had to provide that information. When Ms. Denis  appealed, the Court of Appeal said it didn\u2019t have the power to decide the issue.  This was because the law said only the first decision (the Court of Quebec\u2019s)  could be appealed, which already happened at the Superior Court. The Court of  Appeal said she could ask for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court,  though. The Supreme Court had to look at two appeals from  Ms. Denis. The first was about whether the Court of Appeal was right to decide  it didn\u2019t have the power to look at her appeal. The second was what should  actually happen with it. The Supreme Court hearing was postponed once because  the Crown (the prosecution) had new evidence and wanted to change its  arguments. The Court didn\u2019t postpone a second time when the Crown asked. The majority at the Supreme Court agreed that the Court  of Appeal didn\u2019t have the power to decide Ms. Denis\u2019 appeal. However, it said the  original court (the Court of Quebec) should look at the whole issue again. The majority said people only have a right to  appeal if a written law says so. In this case, no law said an appeal to a  second court was allowed for an issue like Ms. Denis\u2019. (That is, one that  didn\u2019t decide whether someone was guilty of something, or involve putting them  in jail.) This made sense, because having one level of appeal helps cases move  more quickly. The majority didn\u2019t decide whether Ms. Denis had to  reveal her sources. It said the Court of Quebec should look at everything  again. This was because the Crown had new evidence and wanted to change its arguments.  An appeal court is supposed to decide if a lower court decision should stand.  That means looking at whether the lower court made the right decision, based on  the facts and arguments before it. It can\u2019t do that if suddenly there are new  facts and arguments. That\u2019s one reason why parties normally can\u2019t introduce new  facts and arguments on appeal. (Another reason is that it\u2019s unfair to the other  side.)  This was the first time the Court looked at new rules to  protect journalists\u2019 confidential sources. The majority gave some guidance on  how the rules should be used. It said the person who didn\u2019t want to reveal a  source has to show they are a \u201cjournalist\u201d and their source is a \u201cjournalistic  source\u201d under the <em>Canada Evidence Act</em>.  The person who wants the information has to show they can\u2019t really get it any  other way. They also have to show that the public has a greater interest in  making sure the crime is prosecuted than it does in protecting the confidential  source. The majority said that revealing journalists\u2019 confidential sources  should only be a last resort. The Court previously  looked at journalists\u2019 confidential sources in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/37574-eng.aspx\">R. v. Vice Media  Canada Inc.</a></em> That case fell under the old rules."

It claimed that Teranet Inc., which manages Ontario\u2019s electronic land registry system as a service provider to the government pursuant to statutory authority and in accordance with the terms of implementation and licensing agreements with the province, infringed surveyors\u2019 copyright by digitizing, storing and copying the plans of survey created by the surveyors and registered or deposited in the electronic land registry system. When plans of survey are registered and deposited at a physical land registry office in Ontario, Teranet scans the plans of survey and adds this electronic information to its databases. Teranet operates two service portals, Teraview and GeoWarehouse, through which licensed users can access Ontario\u2019s land registry documents, including plans of survey, for a statutorily prescribed fee.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Seven common issues were certified in Keatley\u2019s proposed class action. In 2016, Keatley and Teranet moved for summary judgment. Determination of the motion turned on the second common issue, which asked whether the copyright in the plans of survey belongs to Ontario pursuant to s.\u00a012 of the Copyright Act as a result of the registration or deposit of those plans in the Ontario land registry office. Section 12 of the Copyright Act provides that the copyright in any work prepared or published by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or any government department belongs to Her Majesty. The motions judge found that the copyright belonged to the Crown and therefore that there was no copyright infringement. Since the answer to the second common issue was dispositive of Keatley\u2019s claim, the motions judge allowed Teranet\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Keatley\u2019s class action. The Court of Appeal dismissed Keatley\u2019s appeal. Keatley appeals to the Court, and Teranet cross\u2011appeals in order to preserve its rights in relation to the remaining common issues.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be dismissed. It is unnecessary to deal with the cross\u2011appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The interpretation of s.\u00a012 of the Copyright Act is informed both by the words of the provision and the general purposes and objectives of the Copyright Act as the Court has come to understand them in the century since s.\u00a012 came into being. Together these interpretive tools yield a narrow scope for Crown copyright. This case is the Court\u2019s first opportunity to examine the scope and application of s.\u00a012 of the Copyright Act, enacted in 1921.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The opening language of s.\u00a012 \u2014 \u201cwithout prejudice to any rights or privileges of the Crown\u201d \u2014 reflects the historical Crown prerogative over publishing. The remainder of s.\u00a012 provides a statutory basis for Crown copyright, which will subsist in any work \u201cprepared or published by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty\u201d. The purpose of statutory Crown copyright is to protect works prepared or published under the control of the Crown where it is necessary to guarantee the authenticity, accuracy and integrity of the works in the public interest. But Crown copyright cannot be so expansive in scope that it allows for the routine expropriation of creators\u2019 copyright in their works or that it impedes the public interest in accessing information.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The notion of direction or control is critical to the assessment of whether Crown copyright exists. The goal of the s.\u00a012 inquiry in its entirety is to determine whether the degree of the Crown\u2019s direction and control over the preparation or publication of the work is sufficient to vest copyright in the Crown.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A work will be prepared by the Crown when its agent or employee brings the work into existence for and on behalf of the Crown in the course of his or her employment or when the Crown essentially determines whether and how a work will be made, even if the work is produced by an independent contractor. In these two circumstances, the Crown exercises direction and control over both the person preparing the work and the work that is ultimately prepared.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The evaluation of the Crown\u2019s direction or control takes on heightened importance in determining whether a work is published by the Crown within the meaning of s.\u00a012. Merely making someone else\u2019s work available to the public is insufficient. A work will only be published by or under the direction or control of the Crown when it can be said that the Crown exercises direction or control over the publication process, including over both the person publishing the work and the nature, form and content of the final, published version of a work.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Determining whether a work was published with sufficient governmental direction or control to comply with s.\u00a012 necessitates an inquiry into the Crown\u2019s interest in the works at the time of publication. Relevant indicia of governmental direction or control may include the presence of a statutory scheme transferring property rights in the works to the Crown; a statutory scheme which places strict controls on the form and content of the works; whether the Crown physically possesses the works; whether exclusive control is given to the government to modify the works; the opt\u2011in nature of the statutory scheme; and the necessity of the Crown making the works available to the public.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The crux of this appeal is publication, namely whether the registered and deposited plans of survey were published by or under the direction or control of the Crown. The nature and extent of the Crown\u2019s direction and control are informed by a comprehensive statutory regime governing land registration in Ontario which gives the Crown complete control over the process of publication. The Crown has proprietary rights in the plan, as well as custody and control over the physical plans. The statutory scheme ensures that the Crown directs and controls the format and content of registered plans. This control subsists after registration or deposit. It is only the Crown who is able to alter the content of the plans and it is the Crown that has ongoing control over and responsibility for the publishing process, including the final form of the work. Likewise, it is the Crown who \u2014 through validly enacted legislation \u2014 has the exclusive authority to make copies of the registered or deposited plans of survey.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When either the Crown or Teranet publishes the registered or deposited plans of survey, copyright vests in the Crown because the Crown exercises direction or control over the publication process. This conclusion furthers the underlying purposes of Crown copyright because registered and deposited plans of survey in the land registry system are intended to be relied upon by members of the public to determine property rights and obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In accordance with the principle of technological neutrality, Ontario\u2019s reliance on new technologies post\u2011digitization does not change the assessment of whether the Crown has copyright by virtue of s.\u00a012 of the Copyright Act. There is no practical difference between obtaining a copy of a registered or deposited plan of survey from a physical land registry office or electronically. Because the Crown has copyright in the works pursuant to s.\u00a012 of the Act, there is no infringement under the electronic registry system.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ.: There is agreement with the majority that the appeal should be dismissed since copyright in plans of survey registered or deposited in the land registry office belongs to Ontario under s.\u00a012 of the Copyright Act. There is disagreement, however, with the majority\u2019s interpretation of s.\u00a012.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Statutory interpretation entails discerning Parliament\u2019s intention by examining statutory text in its entire context and in its grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statute\u2019s scheme and objects. On its face, it would appear that the ordinary and grammatical sense of the text of s.\u00a012 is clear: copyright in \u201cany work\u201d vests in the Crown where the Crown prepares or publishes the work, or a third party prepares or publishes the work under the Crown\u2019s direction or control. However, the legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences, and a literal reading of s.\u00a012 would result in an overly broad Crown copyright which sweeps aside the careful balance that Parliament struck between creators\u2019 and users\u2019 rights. A literal reading would effectively empower the Crown to expropriate copyright from independent creators in any copyrightable work merely by publishing the work itself or causing a third party to publish the work. Although the courts below and the majority recognized the absurdity worked by a literal reading of s.\u00a012, their solution \u2014 requiring that the Crown have sufficient \u201cdirection or control\u201d in the publishing process, including the work itself \u2014 reads out part of s.\u00a012 and distorts what is left.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cPrepared or published by or under the direction or control\u201d of the Crown should be interpreted according to its ordinary meaning: the act of preparing or publishing the work must be done either by the Crown itself or under the Crown\u2019s direction or control. In each case, inquiries must be made into the person preparing or publishing the work, and into that person\u2019s relationship to the Crown. A requirement that both the \u201cprepared\u201d prong and the \u201cpublished\u201d prong entail inquiring into whether the Crown has sufficient direction or control in the work itself should not be imported into the statute. The question to ask is simply whether the Crown brought about the preparation or publication of the work, either by its own agents and servants or by exercising direction or control over a third party.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A work is prepared\u00a0by or under the direction or control of the Crown where the Crown is in a position to determine whether or not a work will be made. It is not sufficient for the purposes of the \u201cprepared\u201d prong for the Crown to determine that, if the work is to be made, it will be made a particular way. A work is prepared by the Crown where an agent or servant of the Crown brings the work into existence in the course of his or her duties. A work is prepared under the direction or control of the Crown where the Crown determines that a third party shall make the work. A work is published by the Crown where the Crown itself publishes the work, and a work is published under the direction or control of the Crown where a third party, such as an independent contractor, publishes the work at the Crown\u2019s behest. Neither prong requires an inquiry into whether the Crown exercises direction and control over the person preparing the work and the work that is ultimately prepared. The only inquiry is into the identity of the author and the relationship of that author to the Crown.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the fact that a work is published \u201cby or under the direction or control\u201d of the Crown is not the end of the s.\u00a012 analysis. Once a court is satisfied that a work was \u201cprepared or published by or under the direction or control\u201d of the Crown, it must then consider whether, at the time of preparation or publication, the work is a \u201cgovernment work\u201d. A government work is a work that serves a public purpose and in which vesting copyright in the Crown furthers that purpose. These will be works in which the government has an important interest concerning their accuracy, integrity, and dissemination \u2014 the mere fact that the government has a work prepared or published is not itself conclusive that the work serves a public purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The plans of survey in the instant case are made available to the public and are therefore both \u201cpublished by\u201d Ontario and published by Teranet under Ontario\u2019s direction or control, since Ontario makes the plans available in the land registry office, and Teranet makes the plans available to subscribers of its platforms. Furthermore, the plans of survey at issue in this case are clearly government works. They have a clear public character, as they define and illustrate the legal boundaries of land within Ontario, clarifying land ownership, and allowing landowners and users to govern their affairs accordingly. People rely on the accuracy of survey plans for determining their interest in property and facilitating land transactions. By holding copyright in the plans, the Crown can restrict the ability of a surveyor or other private party to make alterations to the plans and then sell or distribute them privately. By asserting Crown copyright, the government can ensure that survey plans obtained from the land registry office or from Teranet are accurate. As well, because survey plans are so widely relied upon, it is important to ensure wide public availability so that whomever requires access to them can obtain it. As the registered and deposited plans of survey are government works when they are \u201cpublished by or under the direction or control\u201d of Ontario, copyright in them is vested in the Crown under s.\u00a012, and not in the original surveyors.By C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 APPEAL and CROSS\u2011APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal (Doherty, Brown and Miller JJ.A.), 2017 ONCA 748, 418 D.L.R.

        "summary": "<strong>Ontario has copyright in plans of survey filed in the province\u2019s land  registry, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     Copyright protects original works of writing, theatre, music, or art. A  person who has copyright in something has the exclusive right to produce, copy,  publish, or perform it. Canadian copyright law tries to balance two goals. The  first is to reward the people who create new works. The second is to make sure  that the public has access to new ideas and works. There are special rules in the <em>Copyright  Act </em>for when the Crown can own copyright. (\u201cThe Crown\u201d is a legal term that  basically means \u201cthe government.\u201d) Section 12 of the <em>Copyright Act</em>, which is over a century old,says the Crown has copyright in what it prepares (creates) or  publishes. It also says the government has copyright where it directs or  controls what someone <em>else</em> prepares  or publishes. Ontario has an electronic land registry system. The land registry is a  database about all properties in the province. It says who owns (or has other  rights to) each one. The database contains many kinds of documents,  including plans of survey. Plans of survey show information about a  specific property (like its size and shape), like an official map of the  property. Even though the land registry is electronic, plans of survey still  have to be physically brought to a land registry office to be scanned.  The  electronic land registry system is run by a company called Teranet, which  helped create it. Teranet paid independent surveyors to help build the database  and provide plans of survey. A regulation says that all plans added to the land  registry become property of the Crown (that is, of the Ontario government). Surveyors  bring plans of survey to the land registry office to be included. When they do,  Teranet makes copies of the plans available electronically. Teranet does all of  this on Ontario\u2019s behalf. Keatley Surveying, a land survey company, launched a class action in  2007. A class action is a special kind of lawsuit when a group of people  with the same kind of problem get together to sue. The class action was  on behalf of land surveyors who provided plans of survey to the land registry. It  said the surveyors (not the Crown) had copyright in the plans of survey they  had created. It said Teranet was therefore infringing the land surveyors\u2019  copyright by storing and copying plans of survey. It said  the Crown should only get copyright in works that it created itself (or where  it ordered or controlled creation by someone else). Teranet argued that the  Crown should get copyright in everything it published. In 2016, a judge said  Ontario owned the copyright and said Keatley Surveying\u2019s class action couldn\u2019t  go forward. The Court of Appeal agreed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Ontario owned the copyright in the  plans of survey.  The  majority said the plans of survey were in a narrow category of documents that  fell under Crown copyright. Crown copyright protects the public interest by  giving the Crown copyright in things whose creation or publication it very much  directed or controlled. This case was about publication, not creation, since  the Crown didn\u2019t create the plans of survey itself. A number of laws set out how  the land registry system worked, the requirements for plans of survey, and how  Ontario could use the plans. The government directed and controlled every  aspect of the publication of the plans of survey. The laws also gave Ontario  the exclusive right to make changes to them, and make them available to the  public. This amount of control meant the Crown owned the copyright, and could  allow Teranet to make copies of the plans of survey on the government\u2019s behalf.  There have been many changes in Canada\u2019s approach to copyright law in the last  hundred years, and the majority took them into account when interpreting section  12.  Section 12 of the <em>Copyright  Act</em>, which deals with Crown copyright, is over a century old. This is the  first time the Supreme Court has looked at this section."

        "summary": "<strong>This case is about language education rights for French speakers in  British Columbia. The Supreme Court has to decide what school services B.C. must  have for its French-speaking community.</strong>  The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> is part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Section 23 deals with the right to  minority-language education. This is the right to go to school in French or English  when it\u2019s not the main language of the province or territory you live in. Section  23 covers citizens whose first language is French or English. It also covers  citizens who went to primary school in that language, even if it's not their  first language. It says they have the right to send their children to school in that  language. But it also says there have to be enough children to justify paying  for schooling in that language. The services needed could be different,  depending on the number of children. The  Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique is B.C.\u2019s  French-language school board. It said the province had to do more for  French-language education throughout the province. It wanted B.C. to give more  money to French-language schools and fix school buildings and property. It said  B.C. should pay for not spending enough on French-language schools in the past.  The school board said B.C.\u2019s laws and policies breached the French-speaking  community\u2019s language education rights. B.C. said it couldn\u2019t provide all the  services the school board wanted because it would cost too much. It said there weren\u2019t  enough students to justify it. The  trial judge said the province breached the French-speaking community\u2019s rights  under section 23 of the <em>Charter</em> in  several areas of B.C. This was because of the way the province decided how to  fund minority-language education. But she said this didn\u2019t mean the province  had to build new schools and facilities, which would cost over $300 million,  right away. She did say that B.C. should have paid more for school bus  transportation. Not doing so breached section 23. She said the school board  should get $6 million in damages for this.  The  Court of Appeal said courts needed to be practical when looking at section 23.  Giving the school board what it wanted would cost over $300 million. It said  section 23 of the <em>Charter</em> didn\u2019t mean  the province had to provide all the school facilities right away. It also said  the trial judge was wrong to say B.C. had to pay $6 million for transportation.  This was because the policy wasn\u2019t unconstitutional at the time. It was only  found unconstitutional when the trial judge said so. People don\u2019t usually have  to pay for damages caused by laws or policies that are only found  unconstitutional later. The school board appealed. The  Supreme Court will have to decide how courts should deal with minority language  rights under section 23 of the <em>Charter</em>.  This case raises many different issues. One issue is what governments have to  do when there aren\u2019t enough students to justify offering full school services  in the minority language. Another is whether courts should look at costs when  deciding whether a breach of section 23 can be allowed. (Section 1 of the <em>Charter</em> says that certain rights can be  limited, but only if the limit is reasonable and can be justified in a free and  democratic society.)Still another is  whether the province should have to pay damages to the school board in this  situation. This decision could affect many  other minority-language communities across Canada. Many organizations applied  to be \u201cinterveners\u201d in this case. Interveners are people or groups who get the  court\u2019s permission to give their point of view, even though the case doesn\u2019t  directly affect them. They submit arguments in writing. Some are also allowed  to make short arguments in person at the hearing. They help the judges see  different angles and make a better decision. "

        "summary": "<strong>This case is about the right to a criminal trial in a reasonable time. The  Supreme Court has to decide if the time a judge takes to decide a case should count  when deciding if a trial is taking too long.</strong>\r\n   The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>is  part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Section 11(b) says that anyone charged with a  crime has the right to a trial in a reasonable time. The right is about  fairness, but it doesn\u2019t just benefit the person charged with the crime. Long  trials cause suffering and frustration for everyone involved. People accused of  crimes don\u2019t know what is going to happen to them in the future. They often  wait in jail while waiting for their trial. Victims and their families are left  waiting for a final decision. The public doesn\u2019t see justice done. The  right to a trial in a reasonable time is important. It is so important that, if  the trial doesn\u2019t happen fast enough, the trial might be stopped and the  charges suspended. This is called a \u201cstay of proceedings,\u201d and it\u2019s usually  permanent. In 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada decided an important appeal, <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do\">R. v.  Jordan</a></em>. It set out rules to decide how long is too long for a  criminal case. It said certain charges should normally be dealt with within 18  months. Other charges should normally be decided within 30 months. Anything  longer would be unfair, unless there was something unusual to justify it. A  trial that takes too long will be stopped, and the charges will be \u201cstayed.\u201d  That means there will be no verdict of not guilty or guilty. No one wants to  see people accused of crimes go free without a trial. But it is crucial to our  democracy that people can get justice in a reasonable time. K.G.K.  was charged with sexual interference (touching someone under 16 in a sexual  way). He was also charged with invitation to sexual touching (asking someone  under 16 to touch someone else in a sexual way). These charges should have been  decided within 30 months. The day before the judge found him guilty, K.G.K.  asked for the trial to be stopped. He said it had taken too long. It had taken over  42 months from the time police charged him to the judge\u2019s decision. It took the  judge nine months to decide the case and give the decision. K.G.K. said this  was longer than the 30-month maximum, and there was nothing unusual in his case  that could justify it. The Crown (the prosecution) argued that the time taken  was justified. It said the judge\u2019s decision-making time didn\u2019t count toward the  time limit. The  motions judge said the trial didn\u2019t take too long. A majority of the Court of  Appeal agreed, but one judge dissented (disagreed). She said the decision-making  time should count, so the trial was unfair and K.G.K. should go free. K.G.K.  appealed. The  Supreme Court needs to give permission to hear appeals in most cases. One  exception is when a Court of Appeal judge dissents on a legal issue in a  criminal case. That\u2019s what happened in this case, so K.G.K. had a right to  appeal without permission. This is called an appeal \u201cas of right.\u201d  Appeals as of right exist so the Court can clarify where there may be confusion  about the law. The  Supreme Court will have to decide if the time a judge takes to make and write a  decision should count when deciding if a trial is taking too long. During the  hearing, the judges will listen to arguments from each side and ask questions.  The judges could decide right away, or give their decision in writing later. This case has a \u201cpublication  ban.\u201d A publication ban means no one is allowed to publish certain things.  \u201cPublication\u201d includes posting information online, like on a personal social  media profile. In this case, no one can publish <em>anything</em> that might reveal who any complainants or witnesses are. The  courts used K.G.K.\u2019s initials because saying who he is could indirectly reveal the  identities of other people involved in the case. The punishment for breaking  the publication ban could be jail, a fine, or both. Publication bans are often  used in sexual assault cases and cases involving young people, like this one.  People can publish things about the case, as long as they don\u2019t reveal  identities of people protected by the ban. They can also still watch the  hearing and talk about it."

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, who manufacture Optical Disc Drives (\u201cODDs\u201d) and ODD products, conspired to fix prices of ODDs and ODD products between 2004 and 2010 (\u201cclass period\u201d). He advances various causes of action based on that alleged conduct. They include a cause of action under s.\u00a036(1)(a) of the Competition Act, which allows for the recovery of damages or loss that resulted from conduct contrary to Part VI of the Competition Act, as well as common law and equitable claims. The plaintiff seeks to bring the proposed class proceeding on behalf of all British Columbia residents who purchased an ODD or an ODD product during the class period. The proposed class consists of direct purchasers, indirect purchasers, and umbrella purchasers, that is, purchasers whose ODD or ODD product was manufactured and supplied by a non\u2011defendant. Although the action against most of the defendants was filed within two years of the end of the class period, the action against a subset of the defendants (\u201cPioneer defendants\u201d) was filed more than two years after the end of the class period.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The certification judge certified the action as a class proceeding, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. He was not satisfied that it was plain and obvious that the action against the Pioneer defendants was barred by the two\u2011year limitation period set out in s.\u00a036(4) of the Competition Act. He also held that the umbrella purchasers had a cause of action against the defendants under s.\u00a036(1)(a) of the Competition Act, that a breach of the Competition Act could represent the unlawfulness element of the various causes of action advanced by the plaintiff, thereby affirming the availability of those common law and equitable actions, and that the plaintiff\u2019s proposed questions in relation to loss suffered by the class were certifiable as common questions. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals brought by the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. dissenting in part): The appeals should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Brown, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: It is not plain and obvious that the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the Pioneer defendants will fail on the basis that it was commenced after the two\u2011year limitation period in s.\u00a036(4)(a)(i) of the Competition Act because the discoverability rule applies to extend the limitation period. As for the inclusion of umbrella purchasers, the pleadings against all the defendants disclose a cause of action for them under s.\u00a036(1)(a) of the Competition Act, thereby satisfying the conditions under s.\u00a04(1)(a) of the Class Proceedings Act for certification. Also, as s.\u00a036(1) of the Competition Act does not bar common law or equitable claims, it is not plain and obvious that the plaintiff\u2019s other claims cannot succeed. Furthermore, the certification judge identified the correct standard to certify commonality of loss as a common issue and there is no basis to interfere with his certification of these loss\u2011related questions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where a limitation period is subject to the rule of discoverability, a cause of action will not accrue for the purposes of the running of the limitation period until the material facts on which the cause of action is based have been discovered or ought to have been discovered by the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable diligence. The discoverability rule is not a universally applicable rule of limitations, but a rule of construction to aid in the interpretation of statutory limitation periods. It can therefore be displaced by clear legislative language. In determining whether discoverability applies, substance, not form, is to prevail: even where the statute does not explicitly state that the limitation period runs from \u201cthe accrual of the cause of action\u201d, discoverability applies if it is evident that the operation of a limitation period is conditioned upon accrual of a cause of action or knowledge of an injury. Discoverability will apply where the event triggering the limitation period is an element of the cause of action because, in such cases, the legislature has shown its intention that the limitation period be linked to the cause of action\u2019s accrual.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The discoverability rule applies to extend the two\u2011year limitation period in s.\u00a036(4)(a)(i) of the Competition Act, such that it begins to run only when the material facts on which the cause of action granted by s.\u00a036(1)(a) of the Competition Act is based are discovered or ought to have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence. The event triggering this particular limitation period is the occurrence of an element of the underlying cause of action \u2014 specifically, conduct contrary to Part VI of the Competition Act. Consideration of the rationales for limitation periods affirms the application of the discoverability rule to this provision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, it is not plain and obvious that the doctrine of fraudulent concealment could not delay the running of the limitation period. Fraudulent concealment is a form of equitable fraud that arises so as to delay the running of a limitation period when it would be, for any reason, unconscionable for the defendant to rely on the advantage gained by having concealed the existence of a cause of action. The inquiry is not into the relationship within which the conduct occurred, but into the unconscionability of the conduct itself. Its application is therefore not conditioned upon a special relationship between the parties.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Umbrella purchasers have a cause of action under s.\u00a036(1)(a) of the Competition Act. Under the theory of umbrella pricing, the entire market for the subject product is affected because anti\u2011competitive cartel activity causes non\u2011cartel manufacturers to also raise their prices. The text of s.\u00a036(1)(a), which provides a cause of action to \u201c[a]ny person who has suffered loss or damage as a result of\u201d conduct contrary to s.\u00a045 of the Competition Act, supports the view that umbrella purchasers have a cause of action thereunder. Parliament\u2019s use of the words \u201c[a]ny person\u201d empowers any claimant who can demonstrate that loss or damage was incurred as a result of a defendant\u2019s conduct to bring a claim. Also, interpreting s.\u00a036(1)(a) so as to permit umbrella purchaser actions furthers the purpose of the Competition Act set out in s.\u00a01.1, which is to \u201cmaintain and encourage competition in Canada\u201d with a view to providing consumers with \u201ccompetitive prices and product choices\u201d. This interpretation also furthers two other objectives of the Competition Act: it furthers the objective of deterrence because it increases the potential liability falling upon those who engage in anti\u2011competitive behaviour, and it furthers the objective of compensation because it affords umbrella purchasers recourse to recover from loss arising from what is assumed to have been anti\u2011competitive conduct. Moreover, departmental and parliamentary statements fortify the view that Parliament intended that the cause of action in s.\u00a036(1)(a) be broadly available to anyone who suffers a loss from anti\u2011competitive behaviour.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Recognizing that umbrella purchasers have a cause of action under s.\u00a036(1)(a) does not risk exposing defendants to indeterminate liability. Firstly, liability of defendants is limited by the class period, and by the specific products whose prices are alleged to have been fixed. Also, in order for cartel members to profit from a conspiracy, the entire market price has to increase \u2014 the umbrella effect is therefore an intended consequence of the anti-competitive behaviour. Intended results are not indeterminate, but rather pre-determined. Secondly, as s.\u00a036(1)(a) limits recovery to only those purchasers who can show that they suffered a loss or damage \u201cas a result of\u201d a defendant\u2019s conspiratorial conduct, recovery is limited to claimants with a loss that is not too remote from the conduct and umbrella purchasers will have to demonstrate that they suffered such loss or damage. Thirdly, the elements of the wrongful conduct outlined in the text of s.\u00a045(1) in force at the relevant time limit the reach of liability to those who, at a minimum, specifically intend to agree upon anti-competitive conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 36(1) of the Competition Act does not bar common law or equitable claims, such as claims in civil conspiracy. Prior to the enactment of the cause of action contained in what is now s.\u00a036(1) of the Competition Act, a breach of s.\u00a045(1) of the Competition Act was, as it still is, able to satisfy the \u201cunlawful means\u201d element of the tort of civil conspiracy. The enactment of the statutory cause of action in s.\u00a036(1) of the Competition Act did not oust common law and equitable actions by its express terms or by necessary implication. Section 36(1) is not duplicative of the tort of civil conspiracy, it does not provide a new and superior remedy, nor does it represent a comprehensive and exclusive code regarding claims for anti-competitive conspiratorial conduct. In addition, s.\u00a062 of the Competition Act contemplates the subsistence of common law and equitable rights of action. It is therefore not plain and obvious that the plaintiff is precluded from bringing common law and equitable causes of action alongside his s. 36(1)(a) claim.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In order for loss-related questions to be certified as common issues, a plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s methodology need only be sufficiently credible or plausible to establish that loss reached the requisite purchaser level. It is not necessary that it establish that each and every class member suffered a loss nor must it be able to identify those class members who suffered no loss so as to distinguish them from those who did. In Pro-Sys Consultants Ltd. v. Microsoft Corporation, 2013 SCC 57, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 477, the Court directed that, for a court to certify loss-related questions as common issues in a price-fixing class proceeding, it must be satisfied that the plaintiff has shown a plausible methodology to establish that loss reached one or more claimants at the purchaser level. For indirect purchasers, this would involve demonstrating that the direct purchasers passed on the overcharge. Additionally, showing that loss reached the indirect purchaser level satisfies the criteria for certifying a common issue, since it will significantly advance the litigation, is a prerequisite to imposing liability upon the defendants and will result in common success. Showing loss reached the requisite purchaser level will advance the claims of all the purchasers at that level, because a common issues trial will either determine liability or terminate the litigation, with either scenario advancing the litigation toward resolution. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Aggregate damages under s.\u00a029(1)(b) of the Class Proceedings Act are purely remedial, and available only after all other common issues have been determined, including liability. Irrespective, then, of whether aggregate damages are certified as a common issue, it is for the trial judge to determine, following the common issues trial, whether the statutory criteria are met such that the aggregate damages provisions can be applied to award damages. Aggregate damages provisions cannot be used to establish liability. In order for individual class members to participate in the award of damages, the trial judge must be satisfied that each has actually suffered a loss where proof of loss is essential to a finding of liability (as it is for liability under s.\u00a036 of the Competition Act). Whether a plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s methodology is sufficient for the purposes of establishing a defendant\u2019s liability to all class members will depend on the findings of the trial judge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting in part): Both appeals should be allowed in part. The Pioneer defendants have not demonstrated that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for recovery under s.\u00a036(1) of the Competition Act is time-barred by the limitation period in s.\u00a036(4)(a)(i). While the discoverability rule does not apply to toll the limitation period, it is not plain and obvious that the fraudulent concealment doctrine has no application in this case. There is agreement with the majority, though for different reasons, that the existence of the statutory cause of action in s.\u00a036(1) of the Competition Act does not preclude the plaintiff from advancing claims at common law or in equity based on the same conduct prohibited by Part VI. However, there is disagreement that the umbrella purchasers have a claim against the defendants under s.\u00a036(1) of the Competition Act. There is also disagreement that the certification judge identified the correct standard for certifying loss as a common issue pursuant to s.\u00a04(1)(c) of the Class Proceedings Act and therefore that the plaintiff\u2019s methodology met the correct standard in the present case. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The discoverability rule does not apply to toll the limitation period in s.\u00a036(4)(a)(i) of the Competition Act that is applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for recovery under s.\u00a036(1) of that statute. Discoverability is a judge-made rule of statutory interpretation that assists in determining whether the event triggering the commencement of a limitation period depends upon the state of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge. This rule applies only where a legislature provides that the limitation period runs from the accrual of the cause of action (or wording to that effect) or from the occurrence of some event that is related to the state of the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge. Conversely, where a legislature provides that a limitation period is triggered by an event that occurs without regard to the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind, courts cannot apply the discoverability rule to postpone the commencement of the limitation period until such time as the plaintiff discovered that the event had taken place. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Statutory language referring to the occurrence of an element of the cause of action cannot be equated with language referring to the accrual or arising of the cause of action in its entirety such that the discoverability rule automatically applies in the former case. This would expand the scope of the discoverability rule in a manner that is neither consistent with precedent nor justifiable in principle and would create an arbitrary distinction between triggering events that are related to the cause of action and those that are not, even though both may occur independently of the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind. A preferable approach is instead one that considers each statutory limitation clause on its own terms, recognizing that a triggering event that relates to a cause of action can, but need not, be dependent on the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The limitation period in s.\u00a036(4)(a)(i) commences on the day on which the conduct contrary to Part VI of the Competition Act actually takes place and not the day on which a potential claimant discovers that it took place. There is simply no link between the triggering event and the plaintiff\u2019s state of mind. The provision does not contain wording to the same effect as accrual of the s.\u00a036 cause of action. Applying discoverability would make the limitation period chosen by Parliament virtually meaningless and create uncertainty around the likelihood and timing of significant litigation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A special relationship between the parties \u2014 one that is based on trust and confidence \u2014 is not always a prerequisite or a necessary element for the operation of the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. This doctrine operates to prevent a limitation clause from being used as an instrument of injustice in circumstances where a defendant conceals the facts giving rise to a potential cause of action from a plaintiff. In such circumstances, equity suspends the running of the limitation clock until the injured party can reasonably discover the cause of action. Fraud in equity is broader than it is at common law and what constitutes unconscionable conduct will vary from case to case and depend in part on the connection between the parties. Based on this understanding of the fraudulent concealment doctrine, it is not plain and obvious that equity can intervene to toll the applicable limitation period only in cases where there exists a special relationship; it may be that it can also intervene in cases \u2014 at least in the commercial context, as here \u2014 where the plaintiff can demonstrate something commensurate with or tantamount to a special relationship. However, simply establishing the existence of the conspiracy will not suffice for the fraudulent concealment doctrine to toll the applicable limitation period. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is plain and obvious that the claims by umbrella purchasers \u2014 those class members who purchased from a non-defendant a product that was not manufactured or supplied by a defendant \u2014 under s.\u00a036(1)(a) of the Competition Act cannot succeed. While on its face, s.\u00a036(1) appears to be worded broadly enough to capture umbrella purchaser claims, so long as they can prove that they suffered loss or damage as a result of the conduct specified in para. (a) or (b) of subs. (1), this statutory provision must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the principles of indeterminacy and remoteness that limit the extent of liability at common law. Indeterminacy is a policy consideration that negates the imposition of a duty of care in negligence where it would expose the defendant to liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class and remoteness limits the scope of liability in negligence where the harm is too unrelated to the wrongful conduct to hold the defendant fairly liable. Although these principles relate primarily to liability in negligence, they can inform the analysis of claims under s. 36 for pure economic loss. Section 36(1) should not be interpreted in a manner that would permit claimants to recover from defendants for any losses that in some way flowed from the alleged price\u2011fixing conspiracy as it would expose defendants to liability that is potentially limitless in scope for loss and damage that are too remote from any price-fixing that occurred. Consistent with the principles underlying indeterminacy and remoteness, the cause of action in s.\u00a036(1) should be read as limiting the scope of liability of defendants to loss and damage flowing from their own pricing decisions, not those of third parties. Any overcharges the umbrella purchasers may have incurred in the present case were the direct result of pricing decisions made by non-defendant manufacturers and suppliers of ODDs, regardless of whether those choices were influenced by broader market trends. The defendants have control over their own business decisions but not over those of third parties. For this reason, it would be unfair to hold the defendants liable to the umbrella purchasers where they had no control over such liability. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is not plain and obvious that s.\u00a036(1) bars a plaintiff from alleging common law and equitable causes of action in respect of conduct that breaches the prohibitions in Part VI of the Competition Act. The coexistence of statutory and common law or equitable claims arising from conduct contrary to Part VI of the Competition Act is contemplated by s.\u00a062 of that statute. The inclusion of s.\u00a062 in the statutory framework suggests that Parliament did not intend the provisions of the Competition Act to intrude upon the provinces\u2019 jurisdiction over civil rights and liberties. That s.\u00a062 applies only to Part VI of the Competition Act is not consequential as the cause of action created by s.\u00a036(1)(a) is expressly tied to conduct that would constitute an offence under that part. When the words of s.\u00a062 are read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme and object of the act and the intention of Parliament, this provision has the effect of preserving all civil rights of action that a claimant may have in respect of anti-competitive conduct contemplated under Part VI of that Act. Section 62 would be meaningless if s.\u00a036(1) were interpreted as exhaustive in respect of civil claims for such conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For questions to be certified as common issues under s.\u00a04(1)(c) of the Class Proceedings Act, the representative plaintiff must show there is some basis in fact for the commonality requirement \u2014 that is, that the questions be capable of resolution on a class-wide basis. What the \u201csome basis in fact\u201d standard requires in any given case depends on what it is that the proposed questions ask; different questions will impose different requirements. In class actions where loss is an essential element of liability, loss-related questions can be certified as common issues only if the representative plaintiff\u2019s expert methodology will be able to actually identify which class members suffered a loss at trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, in order for loss-related questions to be certified as common issues among indirect purchasers pursuant to s. 4(1)(c) of the Class Proceedings Act, the representative plaintiff\u2019s proposed methodology must be capable of establishing at trial that at least some identifiable indirect purchasers actually suffered a loss. The plaintiff has not met the required standard in the present case because his methodology is only capable of establishing at trial that loss was occasioned somewhere at the indirect purchaser level of the distribution chain. Such a methodology will not enable the common issues trial judge to determine which class members actually suffered a loss \u2014 an essential element of the causes of action pleaded, and necessary for the purpose of making determinations as to liability. The proposed loss-related questions will therefore not be capable of resolution on a class\u2011wide or common basis. What is required of the plaintiff in this case is a methodology capable of answering the loss-related questions on an individualized basis, either by showing that all of the indirect purchasers suffered a loss or at least by identifying those who did and separating them from those who did not. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Pro\u2011Sys Consultants Ltd. v.

        "summary": "<strong>When companies fix prices, even people who bought from other companies can sue them, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\u201cOptical  disc drives\u201d include CD, DVD, and Blu-ray drives. Pioneer, Toshiba, and other  companies made and sold these drives. They also made other products that  contained them. Mr.  Godfrey said these companies agreed to sell these drives and products at higher  prices. This is called \u201cprice fixing.\u201d It is illegal under the federal <em>Competition Act</em>. He said that between  2004 and 2010, consumers paid higher prices because of this. He said the real  market price would have been lower. Mr. Godfrey launched a \u201cclass action\u201d in British  Columbia. A class action is a special  kind of lawsuit when a group of people with the same kind of problem get  together to sue. In the phrase \u201cclass action,\u201d the \u201cclass\u201d is the group and the  \u201caction\u201d is the lawsuit. Class actions can affect many people and their legal  rights. People can be affected even if they don\u2019t actively take part in the  lawsuit. A judge has to give permission for a class action to go ahead. A  \u201crepresentative plaintiff\u201d stands in for the group. Mr. Godfrey was the  representative plaintiff in this case.  Mr. Godfrey said the \u201cclass\u201d should include everyone in B.C. who bought  Pioneer and Toshiba drives. He also said it should include people who bought  drives made and sold by other companies. He said those companies charged higher  prices because Pioneer and Toshiba did. The federal Competition Act said a lawsuit like Mr.  Godfrey\u2019s had to be launched within two years. Pioneer said the claim against  it was too late. This was because the period Mr. Godfrey was suing for ended in  2010 and the class action against Pioneer was launched in 2013. Pioneer and  Toshiba also said they weren\u2019t responsible for what other companies did. They  said the class couldn\u2019t include people who bought products made and sold by  others. The certification judge gave Mr. Godfrey permission to  go ahead with the class action. The Court of Appeal agreed. The majority at the Supreme Court of Canada also said  the class action could go ahead. It said consumers who bought from other  companies besides Pioneer and Toshiba could be part of the class. That\u2019s  because Mr. Godfrey planned to show that Pioneer\u2019s and Toshiba\u2019s actions  affected the entire market. Since Pioneer\u2019s and Toshiba\u2019s prices were higher,  other companies also charged higher prices. People were harmed because they  paid more than they should have. Pioneer and Toshiba made more money as a  result. To get any kind of compensation, though, people who bought from other  companies would have to specifically show that they were harmed.  The  majority also said the two-year deadline to file a lawsuit could be extended if  the person couldn\u2019t really have known about the problem before. It didn\u2019t  actually decide whether Mr. Godfrey was too late to sue Pioneer. It said the  trial judge would have to decide this later. The majority said these kinds of  deadlines have three purposes. The first is to give people certainty, so they  won\u2019t be surprised by lawsuits for things they did long ago. The second is to  make sure the evidence is still available and usable. The third is to encourage  people to take action quickly when they are harmed. In this case, Mr. Godfrey  said Pioneer and Toshiba hid what they were doing so he and the other consumers  couldn\u2019t find out. The majority said it wouldn\u2019t make sense that people could  lose the right to sue before they had any way of even finding out they were  harmed. The  majority also said Mr. Godfrey and the class could sue Pioneer and Toshiba for  two legal reasons. First, they could sue based on the <em>Competition Act</em>, because it said price-fixing was illegal. Second,  they could sue based on rules in the common law (law based on court cases, made  by judges). Different rules applied to each one, and they didn\u2019t exclude each  other. This case didn\u2019t  decide whether Pioneer and Toshiba did anything wrong. It only decided that the  class action could go forward and both sides could present their case. The  Supreme Court of Canada recently dealt with class actions in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37722-eng.aspx\">TELUS  Communications Inc. v. Wellman</a></em> and <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37855-eng.aspx\">L\u2019Oratoire  Saint Joseph du Mont Royal v. J.J.</a></em>"

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0defendant should have been allowed to ask limited questions about a  complainant\u2019s sexual history, but in this case it wouldn\u2019t have changed the  verdict, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong> A  fifteen year-old girl was camping with her family one Canada Day weekend. She  said her 20 year-old cousin, R.V., sexually assaulted her. She didn\u2019t tell  anyone at the time, but later found out she was pregnant. Her doctor said she  became pregnant around the end of June or early July. The girl ended the  pregnancy so there was no DNA evidence available to prove who got her  pregnant. R.V. was later charged with sexual assault and sexual interference  (touching someone under 16 in a sexual way).  At R.V.\u2019s trial, the Crown (the prosecution) said the girl was a  virgin before that weekend. It said she became pregnant around the time she  said she was assaulted. It used this evidence to support the charge that R.V.  sexually assaulted her. But R.V. denied this. He said someone else must have  made her pregnant. He wanted to ask the girl whether she had sex with anyone else.  A person who accuses someone else of a  crime (like the girl in this case) is a \u201ccomplainant.\u201d In sexual assault  cases, there are rules in the <em>Criminal  Code </em>about what anyone can say about a complainant\u2019s sexual  history. Trials are supposed to get to the truth. But some people believe myths  and stereotypes about women and their sexual history. These get in the way of  the truth. The rules are there to protect the trial process, and help judges  and juries get to the truth. Evidence about a complainant\u2019s sexual history will  only be allowed if it meets very strict conditions. In this case, the Crown introduced the evidence about the girl\u2019s  virginity and pregnancy. R.V. wanted to challenge it. He wanted to ask questions  about whether someone else could have made her pregnant. He said if he wasn\u2019t  allowed to challenge what she said, he wouldn\u2019t be able to defend himself  properly.  R.V. had to ask a judge whether he was allowed to ask these questions,  because they were about sexual history. The judge said R.V. was allowed to ask whether  the girl  was telling the truth about being a virgin at the time, and what she thought  \u201cvirginity\u201d meant. But he wasn\u2019t allowed to ask whether anyone else could have made  her pregnant.  The trial judge found R.V. guilty and sentenced him to four years in prison.  The Court of Appeal said it was unfair that the Crown could rely on the  pregnancy but R.V. wasn\u2019t allowed to challenge the suggestion that he caused  it. It ordered a new trial. The majority at the Supreme Court agreed that R.V. should have been allowed  to ask the girl whether someone else could have made her pregnant. But it  said it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. He still would have been found guilty.  It said the guilty verdict should stand. The majority said that the presumption of innocence is vital to our criminal  law. Part of the presumption of innocence is being able to defend yourself.  That meant R.V. had to be able to challenge the evidence against him by asking  questions. While the pregnancy was evidence that some kind of sexual activity  had happened, it wasn\u2019t evidence of who caused the pregnancy or when. These  questions were important to getting to the truth. But the Court noted that the  questions would have been limited, under the <em>Criminal Code </em>rules, to protect the girl\u2019s  dignity and privacy. The majority said that in rare cases like this one, even  if R.V. had been allowed to ask his questions differently, it wouldn\u2019t have  changed the result. During R.V.\u2019s trial, the girl said she was a virgin at the time  and there was nothing to suggest she was lying. The majority said a judge should have decided what could be said about  sexual history, and how R.V. could challenge it, even before the Crown  introduced the evidence. The majority noted that judges have to make sure any questions  that are allowed don\u2019t go too far in invading the complainant\u2019s privacy. Judges  can also change rulings about these kinds of questions if things change during  the trial.The Court recently dealt  with a complainant\u2019s sexual history in <em><a href=\"38270-eng.aspx\">R. v.  Goldfinch</a></em> and <em><a href=\"37769-eng.aspx\">R. v. Barton</a></em>.\r\n  "

Before various standing courts martial, all but one of the accused persons unsuccessfully asserted their right to a trial by jury under s.\u00a011(f) of the Charter; maintained that the military exception found in that provision was not engaged in their circumstances; and claimed that, since s.\u00a0130(1)(a) brought them within the military justice system (which does not provide for a trial by jury), it is inconsistent with their s.\u00a011(f) right. The appeals to the Court Martial Appeal Court resulted in two conflicting judgments: the accused persons\u2019 appeals in R. v. D\u00e9ry, 2017 CMAC 2, 391 C.R.R. (2d) 156 (\u201cStillman\u201d), were dismissed on the basis of horizontal stare decisis, and the appeal in R. v. Beaudry, 2018 CMAC 4, 430 D.L.R. (4th) 557, was allowed, resulting in a declaration that s.\u00a0130(1)(a) is inconsistent with s.\u00a011(f) of the Charter and is of no force or effect in its application to any civil offence for which the maximum sentence is imprisonment for five years or more (\u201cserious civil offence\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Karakatsanis and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeals in Stillman should be dismissed. The appeal in Beaudry should be allowed, the declaration that s.\u00a0130(1)(a) of the NDA is of no force or effect in its application to any serious civil offence should be set aside, and the conviction restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The inclusion of this military exception in s.\u00a011(f) shows that the Charter contemplates a parallel system of military justice designed to foster discipline, efficiency, and morale in the military. Canada\u2019s military justice system has always been separate from the civilian justice system, and is designed to meet the unique needs of the military. It has evolved from a command-centric disciplinary model that provided weak procedural safeguards, to a parallel system of justice that largely mirrors the civilian justice system. The foundation of Canada\u2019s military justice system is the Code of Service Discipline (\u201cCSD\u201d), which is contained in Part III of the NDA, and includes s.\u00a0130(1)(a). It defines the standard of conduct to which military personnel are subject and provides for a set of military tribunals to discipline breaches of that standard. Section 130(1)(a) of the NDA transforms most ordinary civil offences that take place in Canada into service offences, thereby giving service tribunals concurrent jurisdiction over such offences when committed by a person who is subject to the CSD. This provision has appeared in the NDA since its enactment, and similar provisions have long existed in the United Kingdom.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Military members charged with civilian crimes don\u2019t have the right to be tried by a jury if they are tried in the  military justice system, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>In  Canada, the military justice system has always been separate from the civilian  justice system. This is because the military has unique needs, like discipline,  efficiency, and morale. The <em>National  Defence Act</em> sets out the rules for the military justice system. It says  that when a military member commits a crime under a federal law (such as the <em>Criminal Code</em>), that is a \u201cservice  offence.\u201d Service offences can be tried in the military justice system.  Several  military members were accused of serious crimes, like sexual assault and  forgery. They wanted to be tried by jury. But the military justice system,  unlike the civilian system, has never had juries. Trials can take place before  a judge and a military panel, but a panel isn\u2019t the same as a jury. While a  jury is made up of twelve people from all parts of Canadian society, a military  panel is made up of only five people, all from the military.  The  accused military members argued that the <em>National  Defence Act</em>breached their constitutional right to be tried  by a jury. They said this was guaranteed under section 11(f) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Section 11(f) says people charged with crimes have  the right to be tried by a jury if they could go to jail for five years or  more. But there is an exception: the right does not apply to crimes under  military law tried before military courts. This is called the \u201cmilitary  exception.\u201d The accused military members argued that this exception applied  only to \u201cpure\u201d military crimes, like spying or mutiny. They said it didn\u2019t  apply to civilian crimes that any Canadian (military member or not) could be  charged with. The military prosecutors, on the other hand, said the exception  applied to <em>all</em> service offences, including  civilian crimes by military members. All but one of the  challenges failed, and appeals followed. In the first  appeal (<em>Stillman</em>), the Court Martial  Appeal Court of Canada (a military court) ruled that they didn\u2019t have a right  to be tried by a jury. But in the second appeal (<em>Beaudry</em>), the same court reached the opposite result. This meant there  were conflicting rulings. The  majority at the Supreme Court said military members could be tried for civilian  crimes without juries. The Constitution gives Parliament power over the  military. This includes the power to pass a law saying that civilian crimes committed  by military members are service offences. This makes them offences under  military law. The majority noted that when a military member commits a civilian  crime (even in a non-military setting), that has an impact on discipline,  efficiency, and morale. Because of all this, the majority concluded that when a  military member is charged with a civilian crime, the military exception under  section 11(f) of the <em>Charter</em> applies.  That means there is no right to be tried by a jury. Juries have been part of the common law system  for  over 900 years. They  are meant to protect the individual from the heavy powers of the state (or, in  older times, the king or queen). They are also meant to inform the public about  the law and how the legal system works, and apply community standards to trial  verdicts. Juries  play an important role in the justice system, but the <em>Charter </em>makes clear that the right to a jury has an exception. "

The officer swore that there were reasonable grounds to fear P would commit a serious personal injury offence upon his release. Days before the end of his prison sentence, P was brought to court to respond to the Information, at which time a date was set for the hearing to determine whether the fear sworn to in the Information was reasonably held. However, the hearing was scheduled to take place after P\u2019s release from prison. Wishing to avoid P\u2019s unconditional release in the interim period, the Crown sought to show cause why P ought to be detained or required to abide by certain conditions pending the hearing. In denying the Crown\u2019s request, the provincial court judge held that he did not have jurisdiction to subject P to a show cause hearing, concluding that the judicial interim release (\u201cJIR\u201d) provisions of the Criminal Code do not apply to peace bond proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Crown sought judicial review of the provincial court judge\u2019s decision. Prior to the application being heard, P voluntarily entered a recognizance with conditions at his peace bond merits hearing. Though the issue was moot, the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador granted declaratory relief accepting that a judge can compel a defendant\u2019s initial appearance by issuing a warrant of arrest and thus, that the JIR provisions must apply to provide a procedure by which the defendant could subsequently be released. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed P\u2019s appeal and restored the provincial court judge\u2019s ruling.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the Court of Appeal quashed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The arrest and JIR provisions of the Criminal Code apply, with necessary modifications, to peace bond proceedings under s.\u00a0810.2 of the Criminal Code and to all other peace bond proceedings. The appearance of a defendant to a peace bond Information may be compelled by a summons or a warrant of arrest. A judge or justice of the peace also has jurisdiction to subject a person to a show cause hearing when he or she has been arrested in relation to a peace bond Information and brought before the court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 810.2(2) states that a provincial court judge who receives information under s.\u00a0810.2(1) \u201cmay cause the parties to appear before a provincial court judge\u201d. However, there is no internal mechanism provided by Parliament within s.\u00a0810.2 by which a judge could compel the appearance of either party. Rather, the procedures for compelling attendance are found in Part XVI of the Criminal Code (\u201cCompelling Appearance of Accused Before a Justice and Interim Release\u201d). Instead of reproducing those procedures in the peace bond provisions, Parliament has chosen to apply the relevant Part XVI provisions to the peace bond scheme via a series of incorporating provisions. First, each peace bond provision (except for s.\u00a0810.02) expressly incorporates s.\u00a0810(5). Then, s.\u00a0810(5) incorporates all provisions of Part XXVII (\u201cSummary Convictions\u201d), including s.\u00a0795, into peace bond proceedings. Section 795, in turn, incorporates provisions of Part XVI into Part XXVII. Therefore, ss.\u00a0810.2(8), 810(5), and 795 operate together to incorporate the provisions of Part XVI, which houses the summons, arrest, and JIR provisions, into Part XXVII, which houses the peace bond provisions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, s.\u00a0795 does not import Part XVI wholesale into Part XXVII, but rather, its wording limits its application: the provisions of Part XVI apply \u201cin so far as they are not inconsistent with\u201d Part XXVII, and \u201cwith any necessary modifications\u201d. Accordingly, whether Part XVI applies to peace bond proceedings depends on the proper interpretation of the statutory language in s.\u00a0795. When that language is properly interpreted, it is clear that Parliament intended the arrest and JIR provisions under Part XVI to apply to peace bond proceedings. The provisions of Part XVI, with respect to compelling appearance, are not inconsistent with the peace bond provisions. To the contrary, they are necessary for the proper functioning of the scheme. Parliament would not have sought to create a scheme where a judge may hold a hearing to determine whether to order a defendant to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace, but make no provision whereby a judge can ensure the defendant attends the hearing. The application of the JIR provisions flows from the power of arrest under s.\u00a0507 of the Criminal Code. Where a defendant is arrested and detained, it follows that the judicial interim release scheme applies in order to release the defendant from custody. When applied with regard to the context and purpose of the peace bond scheme, the arrest and JIR provisions are a consistent and appropriate interim measure and necessary to the function and integrity of the peace bond proceedings. Furthermore, the arrest and JIR provisions apply to peace bond proceedings with simple modifications that do not amount to substantive change in the law. Accordingly, Parliament intended the arrest and JIR provisions under Part XVI to apply to peace bond proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The proper application of the arrest and JIR provisions in the context of peace bond proceedings must be guided by the policy objectives of timely and effective justice, and minimal impairment of liberty. To begin, when exercising the discretion whether to hold a hearing, the justice must consider whether the fear sworn to in the Information is reasonably held. Initiating a s.\u00a0810.2 peace bond proceeding upon a person\u2019s release from prison risks a further deprivation of liberty after the completion of a sentence already determined to be proportionate. Without further evidence that the feared conduct will occur, a fear based solely on the offence for which a defendant is serving a sentence will not be sufficient. Where the justice exercises his or her discretion to cause the parties to appear, he or she will proceed to Part XVI of the Criminal Code which creates a ladder of increasingly coercive measures to compel appearance of a defendant before a court. At the low end of the ladder is a summons or an appearance notice issued by a peace officer which is the default process for compelling attendance. Where a defendant appears before a justice pursuant to a summons and the hearing is adjourned, the justice has no jurisdiction to impose interim conditions pending the merits hearing. If new information comes to light after the issuance of a summons, including at the initial hearing, which information raises concerns regarding the risk the defendant poses to the public or the likelihood of his or her attendance at the proceeding, an arrest warrant may be sought at that time.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Higher up the ladder is arrest, and release by an officer in charge on an undertaking or recognizance. Where an Information is laid before a justice and he or she finds that there are \u201creasonable grounds to believe that it is necessary in the public interest\u201d, he or she may issue a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest. This phrase must be interpreted in light of the context (where the subject is not suspected of having committed a criminal offence) and the purpose (to bring the subject forward to a hearing) of the provision operating within the peace bond scheme. Accordingly, it will only be necessary in the public interest to issue an arrest warrant where a case has been made out that the defendant will not otherwise attend court or that the defendant poses an imminent risk to the public. While placing a person under arrest inherently infringes his or her liberty, the infringement should be minimized to the extent possible.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Higher still up the ladder is detention and judicial interim release. In the rare case where a peace bond defendant is arrested and held over for bail, the JIR provisions under s.\u00a0515 provide the mechanism to release the defendant from custody. These provisions must be applied with due regard to ensuring the attendance of the accused at the peace bond hearing, and the ultimate goal of the peace bond scheme: to place the defendant under recognizance where an informant has a reasonably held fear that the defendant will commit certain harms. It would be inconsistent with the peace bond provisions to impose conditions aimed at protecting against a risk to the public that surpass the conditions that could be placed on a defendant at the conclusion of a hearing on the merits of the peace bond application. The default is release on the giving of an undertaking without conditions, unless the prosecutor (or the informant) can show cause why an order for more stringent release conditions should be made. For a condition to be reasonable, it must have a nexus with either ensuring the defendant\u2019s attendance in court, or with the feared conduct sworn to in the Information. Under most circumstances, the final rung of the ladder would be a recognizance without sureties with reasonable conditions in the circumstances. The circumstances where detention is justified in the peace bond context must also mirror the possible outcomes provided for in the peace bond provisions. A judge has authority to order detention following a peace bond hearing only where the defendant fails or refuses to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Accordingly, the rare case where detention may be justified will likely only arise where a defendant refuses to sign a recognizance and therefore refuses to be bound by conditions related to ensuring attendance at the peace bond hearing, and/or to addressing in the interim the fear sworn to in the Information.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Overruled: MacAusland v.

        "citation": "2019 SCC 39",
        "summary": "<strong>Judges can give bail conditions to people not charged with crimes while  they wait for a peace-bond hearing, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>\r\n     Mr.  Penunsi was in prison. A police officer thought he might hurt someone once he  was freed and asked a judge for a \u201cpeace bond.\u201d A peace bond is a promise to  the court to keep the peace, behave, and follow certain conditions. It is meant  to prevent crime. Having a peace bond against you is different than being  charged with a crime, but breaking the promise to the court is a crime. The  judge put out an arrest warrant to make Mr. Penunsi come to court to respond to  the request. But he was already in prison, so he wasn\u2019t arrested. A court date  was scheduled for after he would be freed. The Crown (the prosecution) was  afraid he might hurt someone in the meantime. It said Mr. Penunsi should either  have to stay in jail or follow certain conditions until then. It asked for a  bail hearing so a judge could decide what to do. Mr.  Penunsi argued that bail rules didn\u2019t apply to peace bonds. He said bail was  only for people charged with crimes, and he wasn\u2019t being charged with anything.  The provincial court judge agreed that bail rules didn\u2019t apply to peace bonds.  Because of this, he said he didn't have the power to hold a bail hearing.  The Crown asked a superior court judge to review the provincial court  judge\u2019s decision. (The superior court that handles trials in Newfoundland and  Labrador is called the \u201cSupreme Court.\u201d) That judge said bail rules applied to peace  bonds. The Court of Appeal, however, said they didn\u2019t. This was because someone  waiting for a peace-bond hearing isn\u2019t charged with a crime.  The  issue was moot before the superior court judge heard it. \u201cMoot\u201d means the  judge\u2019s decision didn\u2019t matter for practical purposes because the problem was  already solved. Mr. Penunsi had willingly agreed to follow certain  conditions after he left prison. But the issue was important, so the judge  decided to hear the case anyway. Courts in other parts of Canada also couldn\u2019t  agree on what to do in situations like Mr. Penunsi\u2019s. It depended on how  parts of the <em>Criminal Code</em> were  interpreted. The law wasn\u2019t clear. The  Supreme Court of Canada unanimously said that arrest and bail rules applied to  peace bonds. But it said the rules applied in a unique way, so they had to be  modified. This was to make sure they were appropriate for <em>preventing</em> crime, rather than dealing with someone already accused  of one. The Court looked at the text, context, and purpose of parts of the <em>Criminal Code</em> dealing with peace bonds,  arrest, and bail.  The  Court said that judges can get people to appear in court to answer to peace  bonds in two ways. The usual way is by an order to come to court, called a \u201csummons.\u201d  Sometimes, though, an arrest warrant is appropriate. If the person is arrested,  a judge can order a bail hearing. At the bail hearing, the judge can put  conditions on them while they wait for their peace-bond hearing. The conditions  should only deal with making sure the person shows up for court and protecting the  public before the hearing. If the person is not arrested (for example, if they  get a summons), the judge can\u2019t put conditions on them before the peace-bond  hearing.  Mr.  Penunsi wasn\u2019t arrested according to the law. When someone is arrested, they  have to be told why and have a chance to get a lawyer. This didn\u2019t happen for  Mr. Penunsi. Since he wasn\u2019t arrested, the bail rules didn\u2019t apply. That meant  the judge couldn\u2019t put conditions on him before his peace-bond hearing.  The  Court also said judges had to be careful not to set peace-bond defendants up to  fail. Often, judges order people to stay away from drugs and alcohol as a bail condition.  This can be very hard for people with addictions. Like a peace bond, being on  bail is not a crime. But breaking a bail condition is. Judges should be very  careful not to turn people into criminals for something they can\u2019t control. Keeping someone in  jail should be a last resort. When a person isn\u2019t charged with a crime, it  should only happen if they refuse to promise to follow conditions while waiting  for their peace-bond hearing. The Supreme Court of Canada recently dealt with  bail in <em><a href=\"37869-eng.aspx\">R. v. Myers</a></em>.\r\n  "

The two remained friends and the complainant would occasionally come to the accused\u2019s house and stay overnight. At trial, the accused requested a voir dire to determine if evidence that he and the complainant were in a sexual relationship \u2014 \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d \u2014 at the time of the alleged assault was admissible under s.\u00a0276 of the Criminal Code. He argued that the sexual nature of the relationship provided important context without which the jury would be left with the artificial impression that he and the complainant had a platonic relationship. The accused also advanced that he did not intend to rely on this evidence to support the twin\u2011myth inferences that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity or was less worthy of belief. The trial judge admitted the evidence, concluding that keeping this \u201crelatively benign\u201d evidence from the jury would lend an element of artificiality to the proceedings and harm the accused\u2019s right to make full answer and defence. At trial, both sides led evidence regarding the frequency of the sexual contact between the complainant and the accused. The jury found the accused not guilty. A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge had erred in admitting the evidence. In its view, the only inferences to be drawn from the evidence were those relying on the twin myths and limiting instructions could not cure the fact that the jury had heard inadmissible evidence for which there was no permissible use. The accused appeals as of right to the Court on the issue of whether the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence was admissible.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Brown J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Karakatsanis, Gascon and Martin JJ.: The evidence in this case did not meet the requirements of s.\u00a0276 of the Criminal Code and admitting it was a reversible error of law which might reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on the acquittal. A new trial is required.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Canadian justice system strives to protect the ability of triers of fact to get at the truth. In cases of sexual assault, evidence of a complainant\u2019s prior sexual history \u2014 if relied upon to suggest that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity in question or is generally less worthy of belief \u2014 undermines this truth\u2011seeking function and threatens the equality, privacy and security rights of complainants. Section 276 was enacted to mitigate these harms, balancing a number of trial fairness considerations and seeking to exclude evidence known to distort the fact\u2011finding process. It protects the integrity of the trial process by safeguarding both the dignity and privacy of complainants and the right of accused persons to make full answer and defence. It is designed to exclude irrelevant information that is more prejudicial to the administration of justice than it is probative.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Sections 276(1) and (2) operate together to achieve these objectives. Section 276(1) sets out an absolute bar against introducing evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior sexual activity for the purpose of drawing twin\u2011myth inferences. When an accused seeks to introduce such evidence for some other purpose, that evidence is presumptively inadmissible unless the accused satisfies s.\u00a0276(2). To do so, the accused must demonstrate that the evidence is of specific instances of sexual activity, is relevant to an issue at trial, and has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice. The accused must identify the evidence and its purpose with sufficient precision to allow the judge to apply s.\u00a0276(2) and weigh the factors set out in s.\u00a0276(3), which include the accused\u2019s right to make full answer and defence, the need to remove discriminatory beliefs or biases from the fact\u2011finding process, the potential prejudice to the complainant\u2019s dignity and privacy, and the right of every individual to the full protection and benefit of the law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Evidence of a relationship that implies sexual activity clearly engages s.\u00a0276(1), and, to be admissible, must satisfy the requirements of s.\u00a0276(2). The risk that evidence of a relationship which implies sexual activity may be used to support twin\u2011myth reasoning is clear. Even relatively benign relationship evidence must be scrutinized and handled with care. If the accused cannot point to a relevant use of the evidence other than the twin myths, mere assurances that the evidence will not be used for those purposes are insufficient.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the evidence was barred by s.\u00a0276(1) because it served no purpose other than to support the inference that because the complainant had consented in the past, she was more likely to have consented on the night in question. Nor did the evidence satisfy the conditions of admissibility under s.\u00a0276(2).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As to the first condition, the accused successfully demonstrated that the evidence was of specific instances of sexual activity. The words \u201cspecific instances of sexual activity\u201d in s.\u00a0276(2)(a) must be read in light of the scheme and broader purpose of s. 276. Evidence of a relationship that implies sexual activity inherently encompasses specific instances of sexual activity. To satisfy s.\u00a0276(2)(a), the accused must point to identifiable activity, but the degree of specificity required in a particular case will depend on the nature of the evidence, how the accused intends to use it, and its potential to prejudice the administration of justice. Here, the accused specified the parties to the relationship, the nature of that relationship and the relevant time period. Requiring further details would have unnecessarily invaded the complainant\u2019s privacy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the accused failed to fulfill the second condition by establishing that the evidence was relevant to an issue at trial as required by s.\u00a0276(2)(b). The accused must identify, with precision, how the evidence is relevant to a specific issue at trial. The relevant issue cannot be one of the twin myths prohibited by s.\u00a0276(1), and generic references to credibility of the accused or the complainant, narrative or context will not suffice. While the case law provides examples of how evidence of previous sexual activity between an accused and a complainant may be relevant to an issue at trial, none of them apply in this case. There are circumstances in which evidence of a sexual relationship may be fundamental to the coherence of an accused\u2019s narrative, and by extension, credibility, but here there was nothing about the accused\u2019s testimony that cast him in an unfavourable light or rendered his narrative untenable absent the information that he and the complainant were friends with benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As for the third condition \u2014 which requires balancing a number of factors to determine whether the evidence has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice \u2014 the accused\u2019s right to make full answer and defence would not have been compromised by excluding the sexual nature of his relationship with the complainant. Indeed, the evidence was not relevant to an issue at trial and therefore had no probative value.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Admitting the evidence was a reversible error of law which might reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on the acquittal and a new trial is therefore required. The improper admission of the evidence as \u201ccontext\u201d risked infecting the trial with the precise prejudicial assumptions s.\u00a0276 was designed to weed out. The jury should not have been privy to particulars regarding the frequency of the sexual contact or the accused\u2019s testimony characterizing the evening as \u201ctypical\u201d or \u201croutine\u201d. That evidence clearly engaged twin\u2011myth reasoning by suggesting that because the complainant had \u201ctypically\u201d consented to sex with the accused in the past, she was more likely to have done so on that \u201croutine\u201d occasion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver and Rowe JJ.: The trial judge erred in admitting the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence under s.\u00a0276 of the Criminal Code, having particular regard to the manifest deficiencies in the accused\u2019s application to introduce this evidence. The improper admission of the evidence for the broad purpose of providing \u201ccontext\u201d led to a significant and highly prejudicial broadening of the sexual activity evidence at trial, which might reasonably have had a material bearing on the accused\u2019s acquittal. Accordingly, a new trial is warranted, and the appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The s.\u00a0276 regime is designed to respect and preserve the rights of both complainants and accused persons by excluding evidence which would undermine the legitimacy of our criminal justice system and inhibit the search for truth, while allowing for the admission of evidence which would enhance the legitimacy of our criminal justice system and promote the search for truth. In this way, the regime seeks to promote the integrity of the trial process as a whole \u2014 a concept that is essential to the public\u2019s faith in the criminal justice system. In pursuing this objective, the s.\u00a0276 regime operates in a step\u2011by\u2011step manner. From the accused\u2019s initial application under s.\u00a0276.1 to the final limiting instruction required by s.\u00a0276.4, the s.\u00a0276 regime establishes a rigorous, multistep process through which sexual activity evidence adduced by or on behalf of the accused must be carefully vetted and winnowed down to its essentials. To make its way into evidence at trial, such evidence must withstand careful scrutiny at each stage of the process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 276(1) prohibits the use of sexual activity evidence to support one of the twin myths identified in R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577. In doing so, it gives effect to the principle that these myths are simply not relevant at trial and can severely distort the trial process. Accordingly, if the sole purpose for which sexual activity evidence is being proffered is to support either of the twin myths, it will be ruled inadmissible under s.\u00a0276(1).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But that does not mean sexual activity evidence will always be ruled inadmissible. While sexual activity evidence adduced by or on behalf of the accused is presumptively inadmissible, such evidence may be admitted where it satisfies a three\u2011part test under s.\u00a0276(2). Before sexual activity evidence can be admitted under this provision, the accused must file a written application under s.\u00a0276.1. If the judge is not satisfied that certain requirements have been met (e.g., the application is deficient), then he or she may dismiss the application without more. On the other hand, if the accused\u2019s written application survives scrutiny, then the process moves to the voir dire stage and the court\u2019s attention shifts to s.\u00a0276(2).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The first requirement of s.\u00a0276(2) is that the evidence be of specific instances of sexual activity. As stated in R. v. L.S., 2017 ONCA 685, 40 C.R. (7th) 351, the content of the \u201cspecific instances\u201d requirement is linked to the nature of the evidence sought to be adduced. Where the accused seeks to introduce evidence of an individual instance of sexual activity, he must identify that instance with specificity. By contrast, where the accused seeks to introduce general evidence that describes the nature of the relationship between the accused and the complainant, the specificity requirement speaks to factors relevant to identifying the relationship and its nature and not to details of specific sexual encounters. These factors will include the parties to the relationship, the relevant time period, and the nature of the relationship.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second requirement of s.\u00a0276(2) is that the evidence be \u201crelevant to an issue at trial\u201d. To satisfy this requirement, the accused must demonstrate that the evidence goes to a legitimate aspect of his defence and is integral to his ability to make full answer and defence. This requires that the accused be able to identify specific facts or issues relating to his defence that can be properly understood and resolved by the trier of fact only if reference is made to the sexual activity evidence in question. In articulating these specific facts or issues, simply citing the need to provide greater \u201ccontext\u201d or a fuller \u201cnarrative\u201d will not suffice. Similarly, bare invocations of credibility will not be enough. Furthermore, the requirement that the evidence be \u201cintegral\u201d to the accused\u2019s ability to make full answer and defence means that even if the evidence can be linked to specific facts or issues relating to the accused\u2019s defence, admission is not guaranteed. There may be cases in which the evidence, while relevant to specific facts or issues relating to the accused\u2019s defence, bears only marginally on it. In such cases, the trial judge may, in his or her discretion, exclude the evidence on the basis that countervailing considerations, such as the need to protect the privacy rights and dignity of the complainant, outweigh the tenuous connection the evidence has to the accused\u2019s ability to make full answer and defence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The third requirement of s.\u00a0276(2) is that the evidence have significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice. As explained in R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, the requirement of significant probative value serves to exclude evidence of trifling relevance that, even though not used to support the two forbidden inferences, would still endanger the proper administration of justice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In undertaking the analysis required by s.\u00a0276(2), which is designed to ensure that any admissible sexual activity evidence is limited in scope and that its legitimate purpose is identified and weighed against countervailing considerations, the trial judge must take into account the factors listed in s.\u00a0276(3). To the extent sexual activity evidence is ultimately admitted, the trial judge must explain to the jury, in clear and precise terms, the uses for which the evidence may \u2014 and may not \u2014 be used. Finally, all trial participants \u2014 including the trial judge, Crown and defence counsel, and witnesses \u2014 must hew to the specific, legitimate purpose for which the evidence has been admitted, without expanding the scope of the ruling or using the admissible evidence for inadmissible purposes. This is essential to preserving not only the rights of the accused and the complainant, but also the integrity of the trial process as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence could, on its face, potentially be used to support the first of the twin myths \u2014 the myth that because the complainant consented to have sex with the accused in the past, she was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity forming the subject\u2011matter of the sexual assault charge. However, s.\u00a0276(1) takes this potential use off the table. As such, unless the accused could point to some legitimate use of the sexual activity evidence that would justify admission under s.\u00a0276(2), that evidence was inadmissible.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although the accused\u2019s application under s.\u00a0276.1 satisfied the specificity requirement under s.\u00a0276(2)(a), it failed to satisfy the relevance requirement under s.\u00a0276(2)(b). The accused argued that the threshold for relevance was met because the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence: (1) was necessary to avoid an erroneous misapprehension on the part of the jury that he and the complainant were platonic friends at the time of the alleged sexual assault; and (2) provided \u201ccontext\u201d to the issues at trial. However, the accused did not explain why it was necessary to correct any potential misapprehension as to the sexual nature of his relationship with the complainant. In addition, the accused failed to identify a specific, legitimate purpose for putting the evidence before the jury \u2014 he did not link the evidence to specific facts or issues relating to his defence that could be properly understood and resolved only if reference could be made to the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The evidence was also incapable of satisfying the third requirement under s.\u00a0276(2). Because the evidence was not relevant to an issue at trial based on the application presented to the trial judge, it was necessarily incapable of possessing any probative value.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the possibility that the presiding judge at the new trial might, if presented with a properly framed s.\u00a0276.1 application, admit the evidence after applying the test and weighing the factors in s.\u00a0276(2) and (3) should not be foreclosed. Without reaching any final decision on the matter, there was at least one specific issue that the accused could have referred to in his application that might have properly supported admission of the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence: the jury\u2019s assessment of his testimony that he mouthed the words \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you\u201d to the complainant. If the jury lacked the knowledge that the two were in a sexual relationship at the time, that statement might have seemed bizarre or even menacing. Furthermore, the accused\u2019s testimony that he made that statement to the complainant may itself have seemed implausible. In this way, withholding the sexual nature of the accused\u2019s relationship with the complainant could have had an adverse impact on the jury\u2019s assessment of his credibility, potentially infringing upon his right to make full answer and defence. Had the accused referenced this aspect of his anticipated testimony in his s.\u00a0276.1 application, the trial judge would have been better equipped to engage in the balancing exercise required by s.\u00a0276(2) and (3) and may have properly determined that the evidence was admissible for the narrow purpose of allowing the jury to assess the accused\u2019s testimony on this point.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A new trial is required. A number of errors occurred at trial as a result of the trial judge\u2019s improper s.\u00a0276 ruling, which allowed for the admission of sexual activity evidence under the broad banner of \u201ccontext\u201d. Grounded in this ruling, the trial judge\u2019s flawed limiting instructions failed to delineate how the sexual activity evidence was capable of assisting the jury to resolve specific facts or issues relating to the accused\u2019s defence. This flawed instruction\u2019s distorting effect was compounded when additional sexual activity evidence was admitted at trial which was not the subject of its own admissibility determination or limiting instruction. The cumulative impact of these errors can reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on the accused\u2019s acquittal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown J. (dissenting): The evidence was admissible. The trial judge applied the correct legal principles in her evidentiary ruling and the jury rendered its verdict after being properly instructed on how to do so. The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence did not derive its relevance solely from twin\u2011myth reasoning and should therefore have filtered through s.\u00a0276(1). The test for exclusion under s.\u00a0276(1) is whether the evidence derives its relevance solely from twin\u2011myth reasoning and not whether it merely engages that type of reasoning. Were engagement the test for categorical exclusion under s.\u00a0276(1), it would risk exclusion of all relationship evidence, or at the very least all evidence of relationships which also involve sexual activity, since that, too, would conceivably engage twin\u2011myth reasoning. Such an approach would resurrect the creation of pre\u2011determined categories of admissibility which was rejected in R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, and would downplay the text and purpose of statutory provisions like s.\u00a0276.4, which recognizes that evidence may be admissible for certain purposes yet inadmissible for others, and makes a limiting instruction mandatory where any evidence of other sexual activity is introduced, even if it only refers to other sexual activity indirectly or implicitly, to cure prejudice and to warn the jury of the impermissible uses of that evidence. Rather, relationship evidence should typically be filtered via the inquiry contemplated by s.\u00a0276(2)(b), being whether the evidence is relevant to an identifiable issue at trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the Crown failed to explain why evidence of the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d relationship was objectionable, while evidence of other types of relationships which regularly pass through the filter of s.\u00a0276(1), and yet which might also suggest previous sexual activity, is not. Evidence of relationships that involve sexual activity, but which lack the expectation or desire of a more formal relationship, may also give important context to the non\u2011sexual interactions between the parties to the relationship, which may be, as it was in this case, necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence. Evidence of a \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d relationship will, in certain cases, and without engaging in prohibited lines of reasoning, explain to a jury how two people know each other, consistent with how other relationships are presented to juries. The trial judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling treated the relationship between the accused and the complainant consistently with other relationships in society.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, the \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d evidence met the relevance test under s.\u00a0276(2)(b) because it was relevant to the accused\u2019s ability to make full answer and defence. Indeed, it was necessary for the jury to assess the credibility of the accused\u2019s evidence, which was the most relevant and material issue with which the jury would have had to grapple. To deny the accused the ability to point to his relationship would in these circumstances disable the jury from meaningfully performing its central function of finding facts and seeking out the truth, and would force the accused to tell an incomplete story \u2014 a story which includes an account of the act but no explanation for how he and the complainant \u201cgot there\u201d and why he said what he said and did what he did. Without the evidence, the accused\u2019s actions will have appeared to have arisen out of nowhere, and the accused\u2019s right to make full answer and defence would be reduced to painting a picture of himself as (at best) crude and reckless, or (at worst) predatory.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Ordering a new trial is unfair, given that the Crown\u2019s theory of the case drew directly from the sexual nature of the relationship and that it was the Crown, and not the accused, who contravened the trial judge\u2019s evidentiary ruling and explored both the details and the frequency of the sexual activity. A successful Crown appeal from acquittal in this case inevitably lowers the bar which the Crown must overcome to show that a legal error had a material bearing on the acquittal so as to secure a new trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0jury shouldn\u2019t have heard that an accused person and a complainant in  a sexual assault case were \u201cfriends with benefits,\u201d the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>\r\n   Mr.  Goldfinch dated and lived with a woman for a while. She ended the relationship,  but they later got back in touch. They considered their relationship to be  \u201cfriends with benefits.\u201d\r\n   One  evening in 2014, the woman was at Mr. Goldfinch\u2019s place. They had drinks with  Mr. Goldfinch\u2019s roommate. The woman said she told Mr. Goldfinch that sex wasn\u2019t  going to happen that night, but Mr. Goldfinch said he didn\u2019t hear this. They  kissed on the couch, and Mr. Goldfinch said they should go to bed. After that,  their stories became very different. Mr.  Goldfinch said he followed her to his bedroom. He said they each took off their  own clothes, and then had sex. He said he fell asleep and she woke him up  later, saying he hit her on the head in his sleep. He said he was annoyed and  told her to leave.  The  woman said she told Mr. Goldfinch she didn\u2019t want to have sex. She said he  dragged her to the bedroom, and it was like something \u201cjust snapped\u201d in him.  She said he pushed her onto the bed, hit her, and forced her to have sex.  Mr. Goldfinch was charged with sexual assault. He  wanted to tell the jury that he and the woman were \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d. He  said this was important context for jury members to know. He said if the jury  thought the relationship was not a sexual relationship, he wouldn\u2019t be able to  properly defend himself. He wanted the jury to know specifically that, as  \u201cfriends with benefits,\u201d they had sex from time to time. The Crown (the  prosecution) agreed to tell the jury they had dated and lived together and  that, sometimes, the woman would stay the night at his house.  A  person who accuses someone else of a crime (like the woman in this case) is a  \u201ccomplainant.\u201d In sexual assault cases, there are rules in the <em>Criminal Code </em>about what the defence and  Crown can say about a complainant\u2019s sexual history. Trials are supposed to get  to the truth. But some people believe myths and stereotypes about women and their  sexual history. These get in the way of the truth. One myth is that a person  who agreed to sex in the past is more likely to agree again. Evidence that might  support this myth is not allowed at trial, except where it\u2019s relevant and  useful for <em>other</em> important reasons. The trial judge said Mr. Goldfinch was allowed to tell  the jury that he and the complainant were \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d because this  was important \u201ccontext\u201d to understand their relationship. The jury found him  not guilty. The Crown appealed. The Court of Appeal said the evidence shouldn\u2019t  have been allowed. Just saying the evidence was \u201ccontext\u201d wasn\u2019t enough to  outweigh the risk that the jury would make its decision based on a myth. (That  is, the myth that because a woman has said yes in the past, she was more likely  to say yes this time.) The  majority at the Supreme Court agreed that the evidence shouldn\u2019t have been  allowed. While Mr.  Goldfinch said the evidence was for \u201ccontext,\u201d it didn\u2019t add anything useful to  help the jury decide his guilt. In this case, telling the jury he and the woman  had a sexual relationship was only useful for one reason. That was to suggest she  had agreed to have sex in the past, and so was more likely to agree that night,  too. This is wrong because agreeing to sexual acts (consent) doesn\u2019t carry over  from one time to the next.  Consent has to be given, and communicated, at the time of each act. By letting the jury hear the  evidence, the judge made a legal mistake. The judge should  have made Mr. Goldfinch show that the evidence was useful for some other  important reason. The  majority said there should be a new trial where the rules about using the  complainant\u2019s sexual history would be followed. This case came to the Supreme  Court as an appeal \u201cas of right.\u201d That means there is an automatic right to  appeal. The person doesn\u2019t need the Court\u2019s permission. The right is automatic  in criminal cases when a Court of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees) on a point  of law, as happened here. The Court previously dealt with sexual history  evidence in <em><a href=\"37769-eng.aspx\">R. v. Barton</a></em>. "

The ARQ sent a formal demand for information and documents pursuant to s.\u00a039 of the Quebec Tax Administration Act (\u201cDemand\u201d) to a branch of the National Bank of Canada in Calgary as part of an audit of DGGMC Bitton Trust (\u201cTrust\u201d), which maintains a bank account at the Calgary branch. The ARQ was seeking to ascertain the residence of the Trust and determine if the Trust owed taxes in Quebec. It sent the Demand to the Calgary branch rather than to National Bank in Quebec in order to conform to the requirements of s.\u00a0462(2) of the Bank Act, which directs that certain documents pertaining to bank customers be sent to the branch of account. The sole trustee of the Trust, 1068754 Alberta Ltd. (\u201cAlberta Ltd.\u201d), objected to the Demand as beyond the ARQ\u2019s authority. In Alberta Ltd.\u2019s submission, ss.\u00a0462(1) and 462(2) of the Bank Act require treating the branch as distinct from the bank as a whole. Thus, it argues that in sending the Demand out of province, the ARQ acted outside its jurisdiction. The Superior Court dismissed the trustee\u2019s motion to quash the Demand. It found that the Demand falls under s.\u00a0462(2) of the Bank Act and that any extraterritorial effect that the Demand may have had was merely incidental to Quebec\u2019s power to tax within the province. The Court of Appeal dismissed the trustee\u2019s appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Demand was validly issued to the National Bank. The ARQ was required by s.\u00a0462(2) of the Bank Act to send the Demand to the Calgary branch. Complying with this requirement of the Bank Act did not render the ARQ\u2019s actions extraterritorial and, accordingly, they were not ultra vires.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 462(2) of the Bank Act applies to the Demand. It provides requirements by which documents that pertain to a particular customer \u2014 other than those enumerated in s.\u00a0462(1) and (3) \u2014 are to be communicated to a bank, in order for the bank to be considered to have notice of the documents sent. It is a residual provision. The use of the word \u201cnotification\u201d in s.\u00a0462(2) contemplates not only documents that serve a notification function, but also documents that impose positive obligations on a bank. The proposal to add the predecessor to s.\u00a0462(2) was based on a practical concern that the affected bank branch actually receive notice of the bank\u2019s obligations before the obligations are considered binding. From its inception, s.\u00a0462(2) was concerned with documents that could impose obligations on recipient banks. Thus, the Demand, which compels the production of documents and information, comes within the scope of s.\u00a0462(2). It is consistent with s.\u00a0462(2)\u2019s concern with practical convenience for the ARQ to send the Demand to the Calgary branch where some of the requested documents are located.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, s.\u00a0462(1) of the Bank Act has no application to the Demand. The purpose of s.\u00a0462(1) is to set out the preconditions for binding customer property held by the bank, either in the form of valuable assets or bank account debt. This provides certainty and thereby protection to banks from the risk of double liability in dealing with claims to customer property. The Demand is neither among the enumerated documents in s.\u00a0462(1)(a) to (d) nor does it seek to \u201cbin[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. property belonging to a person and in the possession of a bank\u201d, or \u201cmoney owing to a person by reason of a deposit account in a bank\u201d, as stipulated in s.\u00a0462(1). Thus, s.\u00a0462(1) does not apply to the Demand, and so it follows that the application of s.\u00a0462(1) could not have rendered the Demand extraterritorial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The bank, as a corporation, is a single entity; its branches are treated as distinct only for limited and specific purposes. Branches of a bank are only regarded as distinct where practical exigencies require it. There is no basis in the text of s.\u00a0462(2), in the underlying policy, or in the practicality of bank operations, to regard a branch as distinct in order to make a formal demand on the bank. The purpose of s.\u00a0462(2) is to provide a practical means by which the bank as a whole is fixed with notice. It is to the bank that the Demand is made. One is not required to conceptualize the bank and its branches as separate entities to achieve this purpose. Instead, s.\u00a0462(2) is premised on the idea that a branch is part of the bank. This is exemplified by the fact that nothing further is required from a branch upon receiving a document under s.\u00a0462(2) for the bank to be fixed with notice; the entities are one and the same.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In sending the Demand to the Calgary branch as required by s.\u00a0462(2), the ARQ did not act extraterritorially. The fact that the exercise of the ARQ\u2019s power has some impact outside Quebec does not ipso facto render such action impermissible or extraterritorial. In this case, the determinative point in characterizing the exercise of the coercive power is the place where enforcement of the Demand may be sought. There is no dispute that National Bank operates in Quebec. It would be absurd if the procedural requirements imposed by s.\u00a0462(2) of the Bank Act were understood to affect the ARQ\u2019s authority to issue a formal demand to a bank that operates within its territorial jurisdiction. There is no interference with Alberta\u2019s territorial sovereignty in communicating a formal demand to National Bank through one of the bank\u2019s branches in Alberta. Nor is there any unfairness in subjecting a corporation that operates in multiple jurisdictions in Canada to a formal demand from a jurisdiction in which it operates. If the ARQ, in the absence of s.\u00a0462(2), would have authority to issue the Demand, the application of s.\u00a0462(2) does not detract from this.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Distinguished: Royal Bank, Re (2002), 25 O.S.C.B. 1855; considered: Woodland v.

        "summary": "<strong>Quebec tax officials were allowed to send a letter  demanding information to a bank branch in Alberta, the Supreme Court has  unanimously ruled.</strong>\r\n     Under the Constitution, provinces have the power to  tax on their territories. Whether someone pays tax depends on where they  \u201creside.\u201d A person\u2019s place of residence is usually where they live. For a trust  (which is a \u201clegal\u201d person), it is usually where the trust is managed. Figuring  out residence can be complicated. Quebec collects its own income taxes, unlike  other provinces. The province\u2019s tax officials can demand information to enforce  tax laws. Anyone who doesn\u2019t agree to provide the information can be fined or  sent to prison. Bitton Trust was set up in Alberta by a Quebec family in  2003. The trust had a bank account with National Bank in Calgary. But Quebec  tax officials thought the trust might actually reside in Quebec. If so, the  trust would have to pay taxes there. In 2014, Quebec tax officials asked for  some information and documents about the trust that would help them figure this  out. They sent a formal demand letter to the branch where the account was (in  Calgary). Quebec tax officials said that this is what a federal law, the <em>Bank Act</em>, said they had to do. The <em>Bank Act </em>said that any demand had to go  to the branch where the account was located.  The trust said that Quebec officials didn\u2019t have the  power to do this. That\u2019s  because under Quebec\u2019s <em>Tax Administration  Act</em>, they had power only in Quebec. It said that any action the tax officials  took outside the province would be \u201cextraterritorial\u201d (outside the place where  they had power). That meant sending the demand letter to the Calgary branch  would be outside their power, even if the <em>Bank  Act </em>required it. The trust asked the Quebec courts to quash (cancel) the  demand. Everyone  agreed that without the federal law, the <em>Bank  Act, </em>the officials could send the demand to National Bank in Quebec. The  issue was whether the Quebec tax officials could send the demand outside Quebec  to the Calgary branch, as the <em>Bank Act </em>required.  The  motions judge said that the tax officials could send the demand to the Calgary  branch, and the Court of Appeal agreed.All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed with  the lower courts. They said that the Quebec tax officials had the power to send  the demand to National Bank\u2019s Calgary branch. This was because National Bank  operated in Quebec. Quebec tax officials had power over anyone operating in the  province\u2019s territory. All the <em>Bank Act</em> did was say how the officials had to communicate their demand to National Bank.  Specifically, it said they had to send their demand directly to the branch where  the account was located. In this case, the branch happened to be in a different  province. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that the Quebec tax officials had  power over National Bank. The tax officials weren\u2019t trying to exercise power in  Alberta just because they sent the demand there. Whatever action they were  going to take against National Bank if it didn\u2019t comply would happen in Quebec.  So the demand wasn\u2019t \u201cextraterritorial.\u201d The tax officials were allowed to  demand the information in the way that they did, and National Bank had to give  it to them, or face the consequences. However, the judges noted it might be  different if National Bank didn\u2019t operate in Quebec. The Supreme Court didn\u2019t decide  where Bitton Trust should pay taxes. It only decided that the Quebec tax officials  could get the information it demanded to decide whether the trust had to pay in  Quebec. \r\n  "

He applied for authorization to institute a class action on behalf of victims of sexual assaults that were alleged to have been committed in various institutions in Quebec by brothers and fathers who were members of that religious community. As defendants, J designated Province canadienne de la Congr\u00e9gation de Sainte-Croix (\u201cCongregation\u201d) and Oratoire Saint\u2011Joseph du Mont-Royal (\u201cOratory\u201d). The Congregation contested the application for authorization on the basis that it could not be held liable for acts that were for the most part alleged to have been committed before it was incorporated, and the Oratory did so on the basis that it had no connection with the religious community known as the Congregation of Holy Cross. In addition, both the Congregation and the Oratory were of the view that J\u2019s personal action was irreparably forfeit as a result of art.\u00a02926.1 para.\u00a02 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d). The Superior Court found that none of the conditions for authorization set out in art.\u00a0575 of the Code of Civil Procedure (\u201cC.C.P.\u201d) were met and refused to authorize the institution of the class action.

The judgment in which the Superior Court denied authorization to institute a class action against both the Congregation and the Oratory is tainted by numerous errors, of fact and of law, in relation to all the conditions of art.\u00a0575 C.C.P. It was therefore open to the Court of Appeal to intervene and to substitute its own assessment with regard to those conditions for that of the Superior Court judge. Finally, Gascon J.\u2019s analysis on the subject of art. 2926.1 C.C.Q. is agreed with: J\u2019s personal action is neither forfeit nor prescribed. The second paragraph of that article does not create a term for forfeiture (d\u00e9lai de d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article 571 para.\u00a01 C.C.P.\u00a0defines the class action as a procedural means enabling a person who is a member of a class of persons to sue on behalf of all the members of the class and to represent the class. Article\u00a0574 para.\u00a01 C.C.P. provides that prior authorization of a court is required for a person to institute a class action. At the authorization stage, the court plays a screening role and must simply ensure that the applicant meets the four conditions of art.\u00a0575 C.C.P.\u00a0If the conditions are met, the class action must be authorized. The court will consider the merits of the case later. This means that the application judge is ruling on a purely procedural question. The Court has given a broad interpretation and application to the conditions of art.\u00a0575 C.C.P.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal\u2019s power to intervene is limited when it hears an appeal from a decision on an application for authorization to institute a class action, and it must show deference to the application judge\u2019s decision. The Court of Appeal will therefore intervene only if the application judge erred in law or if the judge\u2019s assessment with respect to the conditions of art.\u00a0575 C.C.P.\u00a0is clearly wrong. If the application judge has made such an error with respect to any of the four conditions, the Court of Appeal can substitute its own assessment, but only for that condition and not for the others. Moreover, the application judge\u2019s role is limited at the authorization stage. An application judge who oversteps the bounds of his or her screening role and imposes an excessive evidentiary threshold requirement on the applicant or considers the merits of the case makes an error of law warranting the Court of Appeal\u2019s intervention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, given the numerous errors made by the Superior Court judge with respect to all the conditions of art.\u00a0575 C.C.P., the Court of Appeal was right to substitute its own assessment for that of the application judge with respect to all those conditions. The Superior Court judge had erred in law in considering the condition of commonality of issues set out in art.\u00a0575(1) by emphasizing the differences between the class members rather than acknowledging that there was at least one common question stemming from the fact that all the class members were alleged to be victims of members of the Congregation. On the condition of sufficiency of the alleged facts set out in art.\u00a0575(2), when the judge found that no specific, tangible facts were alleged in the application and discounted certain of the exhibits in the record, he clearly overstepped the bounds of his screening role by considering the merits of the case. As for the condition of J\u2019s status as representative plaintiff set out in art.\u00a0575(4), the judge clearly erred in concluding that the leading role played by J\u2019s lawyers in bringing the application for authorization was inconsistent with his status as representative plaintiff. The judge also erred in faulting J for not personally having taken any steps to verify the institutions where assaults were alleged to have taken place and the number of people in the proposed class. What is more, this error influenced the judge\u2019s analysis with respect to other conditions such as that of the composition of the class set out in art.\u00a0575(3).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Next, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to authorize the class action against both the Congregation and the Oratory is not tainted by an error that justifies a review with respect to the conditions of commonality of issues (art.\u00a0575(1)) and sufficiency of the alleged facts (art.\u00a0575(2)), the only ones the Oratory contests in the Court. As for the Congregation, there is agreement with Gascon J., who dismisses the Congregation\u2019s appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article 575(1) C.C.P.\u00a0provides that a class action cannot be authorized unless the court finds that \u201cthe claims of the members of the class raise identical, similar or related issues of law or fact\u201d. This is the condition of commonality of issues. There is no requirement of a fundamental identity of the individual claims of the proposed class\u2019s members: a single identical, similar or related question of law would be sufficient to meet this condition provided that it is significant enough to affect the outcome of the class action. The fact that the situations of all members of the class are not perfectly identical does not mean that the class does not exist or is not uniform. Nor is it necessary for each member of the class to have a personal cause of action against each of the defendants.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This condition is met in this case: there are similar or related issues. J\u2019s personal cause of action against the Oratory is primarily based on it being directly liable for assaults allegedly committed at the Oratory. All the common issues identified by J actually related to the question whether the Oratory and the Congregation were negligent toward sexual assault victims. J alleges, among other things, that the Oratory knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the issue of sexual abuse by members of the Congregation at the Oratory. For a legal person such as the Oratory, to be aware of sexual abuse can mean only one thing: the Oratory\u2019s directors were aware of the abuse. Given that the Oratory\u2019s affairs were managed in whole or in part by the Congregation\u2019s members, the allegations relating to direct liability of the Oratory are actually allegations relating to faults of members of the Congregation acting as directors of the Oratory.\u00a0The question of faults allegedly committed by the Congregation\u2019s members is undeniably one that is common to all the members of the class.\u00a0This means that any finding of direct liability of the Oratory will advance the action of each member of the class, particularly in that it will tend to establish the existence of systemic negligence within the Congregation in relation to the alleged sexual abuse of children by its members.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article 575(2) C.C.P.\u00a0provides that the facts alleged in the application must \u201cappear to justify\u201d the conclusions being sought. This is the condition of sufficiency of the alleged facts. At the authorization stage, the role of the judge is to screen out only those applications which are frivolous, clearly unfounded or untenable. The applicant\u2019s burden is to establish an arguable case in light of the facts and the applicable law. This is a low threshold. The legal threshold requirement is a simple burden of demonstration that the proposed legal syllogism is tenable: the applicant must establish a good colour of right. The evidentiary threshold requirement falls comfortably below the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities. The applicant is not required to show that the claim has a sufficient basis in fact.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, at the authorization stage, the facts alleged in the application are assumed to be true, so long as the allegations of fact are sufficiently precise. Where the allegations are not sufficiently precise, they must absolutely be accompanied by some evidence in order to form an arguable case. It is in fact possible for the evidence submitted in support of the application to contain concrete, specific or tangible facts that could be used to establish an arguable case even though the allegations in the application seem to be vague, general or imprecise. A court that must determine whether an applicant has shown an arguable case must consider the allegations in the application in light of all the evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, J has met the evidentiary and the legal threshold requirements under art.\u00a0575(2) C.C.P. The seeming vagueness, generality or imprecision of J\u2019s allegations in the application must be assessed in light of the context of the application and the evidence presented in support of it. That context involves incidents that occurred when J was a child. The fact that nothing was reported at the time of the events explains why no concrete, specific or tangible allegations of fact are made in the application itself. What is more, J\u2019s seemingly general allegations of fault against the Oratory are not being made in the abstract, but are supported by some evidence. His personal cause of action is founded on the Oratory\u2019s direct liability for assaults that are alleged to have been committed at that place by a member of the Congregation whom the Oratory had made one of the essential players in one of the central activities for which the Oratory was responsible. In addition, the Oratory\u2019s directors, who themselves were all members of the Congregation, knew or ought to have known about the assaults that are alleged to have been committed at the Oratory by members of the Congregation. The Congregation is hidden behind the Oratory, and this is definitely something that may be taken into consideration in law in order to impute direct liability to the Oratory. In light of some evidence that has been produced, an argument that the Oratory may have breached its duty to protect its altar boys is not frivolous, clearly unfounded or untenable. The allegations made against the Oratory and those made against the Congregation in J\u2019s application and the exhibits filed in support of it simply cannot be distinguished in any way that would be legally relevant. Lastly, the fact that other defendants could possibly have been sued but were not cannot release the Oratory from its liability for assaults allegedly committed at the Oratory.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9 J. (dissenting): The appeal of Province canadienne de la Congr\u00e9gation de Sainte\u2011Croix (\u201cProvince canadienne\u201d) should be allowed because the Court of Appeal did not show that the application judge\u2019s assessment of the condition for authorization set out in art.\u00a0575(2) C.C.P. was clearly wrong. The appeal of Oratoire Saint\u2011Joseph du Mont\u2011Royal (\u201cOratory\u201d) should also be allowed for the reasons given by Gascon\u00a0J. The application judge\u2019s decision dismissing the application for authorization to institute a class action should therefore be restored in relation to both Province canadienne and the Oratory. However, for different reasons than those given by Gascon\u00a0J., J\u2019s right of action is neither forfeited nor prescribed under the second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An application for authorization to institute a class action will be granted if it meets four cumulative conditions set out in art.\u00a0575 C.C.P. This authorization mechanism must not be reduced to a mere formality. In particular, under art.\u00a0575(2) C.C.P., the judge must ensure that \u201cthe facts alleged appear to justify the conclusions sought\u201d. The burden on the applicant is to show an arguable case, which is equivalent to a good colour of right, and not only to establish that the application is not frivolous or clearly unfounded.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The application judge must be able to infer the proposed legal syllogism from the facts alleged in the application. The legal syllogism must be clear, complete and rigorous. Vague, general or imprecise allegations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as well as mere statements of a legal nature, opinions or assumptions \u2014 cannot suffice to establish an arguable case. No evidence can cure the absence of specific factual allegations regarding an essential element of the cause of action. The application judge should confine himself or herself to the facts that are alleged, without trying to complete them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, it was certainly open to the application judge to conclude that J had not met his burden of demonstrating an arguable case. The facts alleged disclose no cause of action \u2014 no legal relationship \u2014 between him and Province canadienne. The uncontested evidence adduced by J himself clearly establishes that Province canadienne, as a distinct legal person, did not exist at the time of the alleged events. It was constituted on January\u00a01, 2008 under the Religious Corporations Act and has not been amalgamated or continued. J\u2019s two alleged aggressors died in 2001 and 2004 and thus were never members of Province canadienne. Even if the facts are assumed to be true and the evidence adduced is considered, the application for authorization does not indicate the basis on which Province canadienne could be liable \u2014 whether for its own fault or for that of another person \u2014 for acts or omissions that occurred before it was constituted. The legal syllogism is flawed or clearly incomplete, if not absent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fact that Province canadienne has a religious mission does not allow its juridical personality to be disregarded. Being one of the legal vehicles of a religious community whose history dates back to well before 2008 cannot make it liable per\u00a0se for acts and omissions committed before it was constituted by members of that community or by other legal entities that may have been connected to that community. The fact that two corporations may be constituted by the same members or by the same religious community is not in itself of any legal consequence. In the instant case, the application for authorization contains no factual allegations relating to fraud, abuse of right or contravention of public order that could possibly justify disregarding or ignoring Province canadienne\u2019s juridical personality under art.\u00a0317 C.C.Q. Moreover, even if such allegations had been made, it is by no means clear that an arguable case could have been established on that basis given that Province canadienne did not exist at the relevant time. It therefore could not have taken part in the alleged acts and omissions and, for this reason, be liable for them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A class action cannot be authorized in relation to a defendant solely on the basis of its close connections with other entities. In addition, in the case at bar, the application for authorization says practically nothing about the corporate identity of Province canadienne and the Oratory and nothing at all about their possible connections with other entities. The fact that Province canadienne took up the defence of other entities for their actions in another case relating to sexual aggressions has little legal significance. The settlement reached in that other case was clearly entered into without prejudice and without any admission, and it suggests that, if faults were committed, entities other than Province canadienne are liable for them. The Superior Court authorized the class action against Province canadienne in that other case solely for the purposes of the settlement; its decision rested on a laconic analysis carried out essentially as a matter of form, which could not be binding on the application judge in the present case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Province canadienne and the Oratory have not shown that the period established by the second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 C.C.Q. is a term for forfeiture. Prescription is based first and foremost on the idea of sanctioning failure to act by a person who has a right to exercise, which explains why there are mechanisms like suspension and interruption that mitigate the rigours of prescription. By contrast, forfeiture is meant to quickly put an end, for all purposes, to the possibility of performing a particular act. Forfeiture is exceptional in nature: it automatically entails the loss of a right even though its holder has done nothing wrong. The legislature has therefore enacted an interpretative provision, the second paragraph of art.\u00a02878 C.C.Q., which states that \u201cforfeiture is never presumed; it results only where expressly provided for in a text\u201d. Although no set formula is necessary, a term for forfeiture can be found to exist only where the legislature has spoken in a precise, clear and unambiguous manner.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 states that the shortened period of three years \u201cruns from the date of death\u201d. The wording is clear and explicit: the death of the victim or the author of the act marks a starting point that differs from the one provided for in the first paragraph. The first paragraph codifies the judge\u2011made rule that prescription does not run against a victim of sexual aggression who is not aware of the connection between that act and the injury suffered. It provides that an action \u201cis prescribed .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the date the victim becomes aware\u201d of that connection. It cannot be found from the wording of the second paragraph that the death simply has the effect of shortening the 10\u2011 or 30\u2011year period provided for in the first paragraph. The expressions \u201cfrom the date\u201d in the first paragraph and \u201cfrom the date of death\u201d in the second paragraph are equivalent, and they both indicate the starting point for prescription. Words used by the legislature are presumed to have the same meaning throughout the same statute. This interpretation is also the most coherent. If the death was not a new starting point but simply had the effect of shortening the period, an action by the victim\u2019s succession might be imprescriptible in some circumstances. The solution the legislature seems to have chosen is a three\u2011year period that runs from the date of death of the victim or the author of the act, regardless of whether, before that date, the victim made the connection between the act and the injury suffered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fact that the three\u2011year period under the second paragraph is linked to a specific, objective fact that is fixed in time, namely the death of the victim or the author of the act, provides a strong indication of forfeiture. The link to the death suggests that the period in question, unlike a prescriptive period, is not intended to sanction the victim\u2019s negligence. However, it is difficult to argue that the wording of the second paragraph makes no reference to prescription. The French version refers to the \u201cd\u00e9lai applicable\u201d, which is the 10\u2011 or 30\u2011year prescriptive period under the first paragraph. The English version is even more explicit: \u201cthe prescriptive period, if not already expired, is reduced to three years\u201d. Therefore, it cannot be concluded from the wording of the provision that the legislature expressed an intention to create a term for forfeiture, rather than a prescriptive period, in a sufficiently precise, clear and unambiguous manner.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Absent an express provision to the contrary, the general provisions dealing with the suspension of prescription\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including the provision on impossibility in fact to act (art.\u00a02904 C.C.Q.)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0apply to the period provided for in the second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 C.C.Q., subject to the following exception. Given that the second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 C.C.Q. sets a different starting point for prescription, separate from the one established by the first paragraph, lack of awareness of the connection between the alleged act and the injury suffered cannot suspend the period provided for in the second paragraph. The opposite interpretation would frustrate the legislature\u2019s intention that the period run from the date of death, and no longer from the date the victim becomes aware of the connection.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 C.C.Q. applies to all actions for damages for bodily injury resulting from sexual aggression. The wording of the provision draws no distinction between the author of the act and third parties who might also be liable for their own fault or for the act or omission of another person. The purpose of this provision is to address the legislature\u2019s concerns about the preservation of evidence and, more broadly, the integrity of the adversarial process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The starting point under the second paragraph, the date of death, does not have retroactive effect, regardless of whether the period is a term for forfeiture or a prescriptive period. The introduction of a new period does not retroactively extinguish an existing right of action unless such an intention is clearly expressed. This is not the case here. First of all, the amending Act specifically mentions only prescription and contains no transitional provision that could apply to the starting point of a term for forfeiture. Second, if the second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 C.C.Q. simply provides for a prescriptive period, s.\u00a013 of the amending Act does not give it any retroactive effect, because the new starting point set on the date of death is not declaratory in nature. The legislature stated in s.\u00a013 that the provisions concerning the starting point for prescription are \u201cdeclaratory\u201d. A declaratory provision has retroactive effect insofar as it interprets existing law\u00a0in the way that a judicial decision would. The starting point under the second paragraph, unlike the first paragraph, can hardly be characterized as declaratory given that it is entirely new law that is not meant to settle or clarify existing law. Therefore, the legislature did not express an intention to give it retroactive effect. If there is any doubt in this regard, the interpretation that limits the scope of provisions that are explicitly retroactive or declaratory is to be preferred. Accordingly, whatever the nature of the period under the second paragraph of art.\u00a02926.1 C.C.Q., it would not have begun to run, in relation to existing juridical situations, before the coming into force of the amending Act. As a result, the introduction of a new starting point set on the date of death would not affect J\u2019s right of action in the instant case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Vivendi Canada Inc. v.

        "citation": "2019 SCC 35",
        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0class-action lawsuit against a religious group (and an institution it  ran) for sexual abuse can go forward, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     JJ said he was sexually abused by both his teacher and a priest in the 1950s.  Both were members of the Congr\u00e9gation de Sainte-Croix. He said the teacher  abused him at school. He said the priest abused him at the Oratoire  Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal, where JJ was an altar boy.The priest died in  2001 and the teacher died in 2004.  JJ  didn\u2019t tell anyone about the abuse for decades. He said he had nightmares and  flashbacks for years. He believed there were other victims like him, so he  decided to launch a \u201cclass action\u201d in Quebec in 2013.  A  class action is a special kind of lawsuit when a group of people with the same kind of  problem get together to sue. In the phrase \u201cclass action,\u201d the \u201cclass\u201d is the  group and the \u201caction\u201d is the lawsuit. Class actions can affect many people and  their legal rights, even if they aren\u2019t actively involved. A judge has to give  permission for (authorize) a class action to go ahead. The judge is just  supposed to look at whether the class action meets the conditions to go to  court, not whether it will succeed. They have to assume the facts are true unless  they are clearly wrong or unlikely. A \u201crepresentative plaintiff\u201d represents the  group and asks for permission to launch the class action by applying to the  court. JJ wanted to be the representative plaintiff in this case. JJ said the Congr\u00e9gation and the Oratoire were directly  responsible for what happened to him by their own acts. He said they knew (or  should have known) about the abuse but didn\u2019t stop it, and even covered it up.  He said they were also responsible for the acts of the teacher and the priest,  because they assigned them to work with children.  The Congr\u00e9gation and the Oratoire  said the class action shouldn\u2019t be allowed. They said the class members didn\u2019t  have similar issues because the abuse happened in different places. They said JJ  waited too long after the men he said abused him died. They said JJ didn\u2019t show  enough facts that anything happened. The Oratoire said it couldn\u2019t be  responsible just because abuse might have happened on its property. The  judge agreed with the Congr\u00e9gation and the Oratoire that the class action  couldn\u2019t go forward. But the Court of Appeal disagreed. It unanimously said the  class action against the Congr\u00e9gation could go forward. The majority said the  class action against the Oratoire could go forward as well. <br/>\r\n     All  the judges of the Supreme Court agreed it wasn\u2019t too late for JJ to sue. They  noted that Quebec had a new three-year time limit to sue if the abuser or  victim died. But most judges said the rule didn\u2019t apply to a lawsuit against third  parties like the Congr\u00e9gation and the Oratoire. It only applied to lawsuits brought  against the abuser\u2019s succession (estate), or brought by the victim\u2019s succession,  after they died. Just because the men JJ said abused him died didn\u2019t mean he  couldn\u2019t sue the Congr\u00e9gation and the Oratoire for their own failures to  prevent or stop the abuse. In any case, most judges said the time limit started  when a victim realized that the abuse was responsible for their injury. This  could be long after the abuser died. Most judges noted that the changes to the  law were meant to make it easier for victims of sexual abuse to get justice,  not harder. Most  judges said the class action could go forward against the Congr\u00e9gation. The  majority said all the class members had a similar issue. They wanted to know whether  the Congr\u00e9gation was responsible for sexual assaults on children by members  assigned to work with those children. The majority said that just because the  children didn\u2019t report the abuse at the time didn\u2019t mean that the Congr\u00e9gation  didn\u2019t know what was happening. The  majority said the class action could go forward against the Oratoire as well.  It wasn\u2019t being sued because it was the location of some of the assaults. It  was being sued because of its close connection to the Congr\u00e9gation, and because  its directors\u2014who were all Congr\u00e9gation members\u2014failed to stop (or covered up)  the abuse. This case doesn\u2019t  mean that JJ won the class-action lawsuit. It only means that a court can now  hear all the arguments and make a decision."

The young men appeared to be doing nothing wrong. They were just talking. Two officers entered the backyard, without a warrant or consent. They immediately questioned the young men and requested documentary proof of their identities. The third officer patrolled the perimeter of the property, then stepped over the low fence enclosing the backyard and directed one of the men to keep his hands where he could see them. One officer questioned the accused, demanding that he produce identification and asking him what was in the satchel he was carrying. At that point, the accused fled, was pursued and arrested, and found to be in possession of a firearm, drugs and cash. At his trial, the accused sought the exclusion of this evidence under s.\u00a024(2) of the Charter on the basis that the police had infringed his constitutional rights to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and from arbitrary detention, contrary to ss.\u00a08 and 9 of the Charter. In convicting the accused, the trial judge held that he lacked standing to advance a s.\u00a08 claim, that he was detained only when the officer asked him about the contents of his bag, that the detention was not arbitrary, and that had a breach of Charter rights occurred, the evidence would be admissible. A majority at the Court of Appeal agreed and dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal from his convictions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner C.J. and Moldaver\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the evidence excluded, the convictions set aside and acquittals entered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis, Brown and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The circumstances of the police entry into the backyard effected a detention that was both immediate and arbitrary. This was serious Charter\u2011infringing police misconduct, with a correspondingly high impact on the accused\u2019s protected interests. It was precisely this sort of police conduct that the Charter was intended to abolish. On balance, the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Since the appeal can be disposed on the basis of ss.\u00a09 and 24(2) of the Charter, there is no need to resolve the s.\u00a08 issue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The prohibition of arbitrary detention in s.\u00a09 of the Charter is meant to protect individual liberty against unjustified state interference. It limits the state\u2019s ability to impose intimidating and coercive pressure on citizens without adequate justification. Not every police\u2011citizen interaction is a detention within the meaning of s.\u00a09; a detention requires significant physical or psychological restraint. Psychological detention by the police can arise in two ways: (1)\u00a0the claimant is legally required to comply with a direction or demand by the police; or (2)\u00a0a claimant is not under a legal obligation to comply with a direction or demand, but a reasonable person in the subject\u2019s position would feel so obligated, and conclude that they were not free to go. Therefore, even absent a legal obligation to comply with a police demand or direction, and even absent physical restraint by the state, a detention exists in situations where a reasonable person in the accused\u2019s shoes would feel obligated to comply with a police direction or demand and that they are not free to leave.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In determining the point of detention for the purposes of s.\u00a09 of the Charter, it is essential to consider all of the circumstances of the police encounter. The Court in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, adopted three non\u2011exhaustive factors that can aid in the analysis. In the instant case, each of these factors support the conclusion that the accused\u2019s detention began the moment the police entered the backyard and made contact with the young men.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The first factor \u2014 the circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they would reasonably be perceived by the individual \u2014 supports a finding of detention arising prior to the officer\u2019s inquiry about the contents of the accused\u2019s satchel. The conduct of the police exceeded the norms of community policing, there was no obvious cause for any police presence in the backyard, the police never expressly communicated to the young men why they were there, they immediately started questioning them, and the height of the fence allowed full interaction without entry. Therefore, a reasonable person would not perceive the police entry into the backyard as merely assisting in meeting needs or maintaining basic order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second factor \u2014 the nature of the police conduct \u2014 supports the conclusion that a detention arose as soon as the police officers entered the backyard and started asking questions. Many considerations influence the analysis under this factor. When the police enter a private residence as trespassers, as they did here, it both colours what happens subsequently and strongly supports a finding of detention at that point in time. The actions of the police and the language used may show that the police are immediately taking control of a situation. Here, the contemporaneous actions of the police and the language employed illustrate they were exerting dominion over the individuals in the backyard from the time of entry. There was physical proximity and the officers positioned themselves in a way to question specific young men apart from the others, in a manner to block the exit. Furthermore, with respect to the place where the interaction occurred and the mode of entry, the nature of any police intrusion into a home or backyard is reasonably experienced as more forceful, coercive and threatening than when similar state action occurs in public. Coming over the fence to enter a private residence conveys a show of force. Living in a less affluent neighbourhood in no way detracts from the fact that a person\u2019s residence is a private and protected place. The reputation of a particular community or the frequency of police contact with its residents does not in any way license police to enter a private residence more readily or intrusively than they would in a community with higher fences or lower rates of crime. Here, there was a tactical element to the encounter and the mode of entry involving three uniformed officers suddenly occupying a backyard and taking control over the people in it late at night would be seen as coercive and intimidating by a reasonable person. The police conduct towards others would also likely have an impact on how a reasonable person in the accused\u2019s shoes would perceive the unfolding situation. Witnessing a repeated sequence of command and compliance would lead a reasonable person to believe that they are not free to leave and that even their physical movements are subject to police control. In addition, the overall duration of an encounter may contribute to the conclusion that a detention occurred, although a detention can occur within a matter of seconds, depending on the circumstances. What the accused in this case saw occurring to others likely increased the perception and reality of coercion, as the others simply did what the police told them to do. Although the interaction lasted less than a minute, the impact of the police conduct in that short space of time would lead any reasonable person to conclude that it was necessary to comply with police directions and commands, and that it was impossible to leave or walk away without the permission of the police once they entered the backyard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With respect to the third factor \u2014 the particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual \u2014, a reasonable person imbued with the experiences that accompany the accused\u2019s particular circumstances would conclude that there was a detention from the moment the officers entered the backyard and started asking questions. Courts must appreciate that individuals in some communities may have different experiences and relationships with police than others and such may impact upon their reasonable perceptions of whether and when they are being detained. At the detention stage, the analysis takes into consideration the larger, historic and social context of race relations between the police and the various racial groups and individuals in our society. The reasonable person in the shoes of the accused is presumed to be aware of this broader racial context. Evidence about race relations that may inform whether there has been a detention under s.\u00a09, like all social context evidence, can be proved in legal proceedings by direct evidence, admissions, or by the taking of judicial notice. Because the focus is on how the combination of a racialized context and minority status would affect the perceptions of a reasonable person in the shoes of the accused and not on what motivated the officers to act as they did, a finding that there has been no racial profiling has therefore little bearing. While the accused\u2019s level of sophistication could also bear on the timing of a detention, merely because an individual has had repeated interactions with the police does not mean that the individual has acquired a level of sophistication in dealing with the police. A reasonable person who has been stopped by the police on multiple prior occasions would more likely perceive that it is necessary to simply submit to police demands. What a reasonable person may perceive may also be influenced by age and the knowledge, life experience and discernment associated with that age group.\u00a0The focus of the s.\u00a09 analysis should not be on what was in the accused\u2019s mind at a particular moment in time, but rather on how the police behaved and, considering the totality of the circumstances, how such behavior would be reasonably perceived by a person imbued with the experiences that accompany the accused\u2019s particular circumstances. In this case, the documented history of the relations between police and racialized communities would have had an impact on the perceptions of a reasonable person in the shoes of the accused. Research studies have established that racial minorities are both treated differently by the police and that such differential treatment does not go unnoticed by them. We have arrived at a place where the research now shows disproportionate policing of racialized and low\u2011income communities. Indeed, it is in this larger social context that the police entry into the backyard and questioning of the accused and his friends must be approached. It was another example of a common and shared experience of racialized young men: being frequently targeted, stopped, and subjected to pointed and familiar questions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where a detention is established, a court must consider whether the detention is arbitrary. The detention must be authorized by law, the authorizing law must not be arbitrary, and the manner in which the detention is carried out must be reasonable. Since no statutory or common law power authorized the accused\u2019s detention at the moment the police entered the backyard and made contact with the young men, it was an arbitrary detention that infringed the accused\u2019s Charter right. First, the police were trespassers. The implied licence doctrine, which allows the police, or any member of the public, on legitimate business to proceed from the street to the door of a house so as to permit convenient communication with the occupant of the dwelling, does not apply to excuse the police presence in the backyard because even if communication was the officers\u2019 purpose, it did not necessitate their entry onto private property. The police also had a subsidiary purpose \u2014 a speculative criminal investigation \u2014, which exceeds the authorizing limits of the implied licence doctrine. Second, the police had no legal authority to detain the accused. No statute authorized the police officers to detain anyone in the backyard, and the common law power to detain for investigative purposes could not be invoked. The latter only allows the police to detain an individual for investigative purposes where, in the totality of circumstances, there are reasonable grounds to suspect a clear nexus between the individual and a recent or still unfolding crime. A suspect\u2019s presence in a so\u2011called high crime area is not by itself a basis for detention and the mere presence of non\u2011suspects in an area frequented days or weeks earlier by a person of interest cannot furnish such a basis. The receipt of general information about contraband in relation to an address does not, without more specificity, give rise to reasonable suspicion in relation to recent or ongoing criminal activity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where evidence is obtained in a manner that infringes a Charter right or freedom, s.\u00a024(2) provides that such evidence must be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. While the exclusion of evidence may provoke immediate criticism, the focus is on the overall repute of the justice system, viewed in the long term by a reasonable person, informed of all relevant circumstances and of the importance of Charter rights, and not on the impact of state misconduct upon the criminal trial.\u00a0It is the sum, and not the average, of the seriousness of the Charter\u2011infringing conduct and the impact of the breach on the Charter\u2011protected interests of the accused that determines the pull towards exclusion. The more serious the state\u2011infringing conduct and the greater the impact on the Charter\u2011protected interests, the stronger the case for exclusion. Where these inquiries, taken together, make a strong case for exclusion, society\u2019s interest in an adjudication of the case on its merits will seldom if ever tip the balance in favour of admissibility.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When considering the first line of inquiry \u2014 the seriousness of the Charter\u2011infringing conduct \u2014, for state misconduct to be excused as a good faith (and, therefore, minor) infringement of Charter rights, the state must show that the police conducted themselves in a manner consistent with what they subjectively, reasonably and non\u2011negligently believed to be the law. Here, good faith cannot be ascribed to these police officers\u2019 conduct. Their own evidence makes clear that they fully understood the limitations upon their ability to enter the backyard to investigate individuals. This was serious police misconduct and weighs heavily in favour of a finding that admission of the resulting evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second line of inquiry \u2014 the impact on the Charter\u2011protected interests of the accused \u2014 entails asking whether and to what extent, in the totality of the circumstances, the Charter breach actually undermined the interests protected by the right infringed. Here, when weighed against the absence of justification to investigate the young men at all, the impact of this police misconduct is heightened considerably. The discovery of the evidence was only possible because of the serious s.\u00a09 breach in this case. This line of inquiry also strongly favours a finding that admission of the evidence in this case would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The third line of inquiry \u2014 society\u2019s interest in adjudication of the case on its merits \u2014 typically pulls toward inclusion of the evidence. Courts must be careful to dissociate themselves and their trial processes from the violation of longstanding constitutional norms reflected in the Court\u2019s Charter jurisprudence that has emphasized the importance of individuals\u2019 liberty interests. On balance, in this case, this line of inquiry provides support for admitting the highly reliable evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, in view of the application of the three Grant lines of inquiry, admission of the fruits of the police conduct would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and as such, the evidence must be excluded.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The police entry into the backyard was unlawful. The police were trespassers from the moment they set foot on the property, given that the implied licence doctrine could not apply in the present case. This doctrine, which allows police officers and other members of the public, on lawful business, to enter onto private property and approach the door of the residence in order to speak with the owner or occupier, could not apply for the sole reason that the police could readily make contact with the potential owner/occupier from outside the property. Nonetheless, the trial judge\u2019s finding that the police had legitimate investigatory purposes for entering the backyard is entitled to deference. Even if the police were not justified in entering the backyard in order to investigate whether the young men were trespassers, two valid investigatory objectives remained: (1)\u00a0to investigate whether any of the young men were a known suspect or knew the whereabouts of another known suspect; and (2)\u00a0to investigate potential drug trafficking in relation to the property.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The appeal can be disposed of without finally deciding whether the unlawful entry by the police into the backyard resulted in a breach of the appellant\u2019s s.\u00a08 Charter rights. That said, it is doubtful that the appellant\u2019s s.\u00a08 argument could withstand scrutiny, as there is no compelling basis on which to conclude that his informational privacy interests were engaged to any significant degree, and the Court\u2019s decisions in R. v. Edwards, 1996 CanLII 255 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, and R. v. Belnavis, 1997 CanLII 320 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 341, cast serious doubt on his territorial privacy argument. Even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that his s.\u00a08 rights were breached, any such breach was both inadvertent and insignificant in terms of its impact, thereby making it inconsequential from a s.\u00a024(2) perspective.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 9 of the Charter protects the right to be free from arbitrary detention or imprisonment. Detention under s.\u00a09 refers to a suspension of the individual\u2019s liberty interest by a significant physical or psychological restraint. Whether a psychological detention has occurred is determined objectively, having regard to all the circumstances. The onus is on the applicant to show that in the circumstances, he or she was effectively deprived of his or her liberty to choose whether to stay or leave. While the test is objective, the individual\u2019s particular circumstances and perceptions at the time may be relevant in determining whether a reasonable person in the circumstances would perceive himself or herself as not being free to go. The factors in determining whether and when a psychological detention has occurred include the circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they would reasonably be perceived by the individual, the nature of the police conduct, and the particular characteristics or circumstances of the individual where relevant. The determination of whether and when a detention has occurred based on a trial judge\u2019s underlying findings of fact is a question of law subject to the standard of correctness.\u00a0In the present case, it is not disputed that a detention occurred; the question is one of timing.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying the relevant factors with a view to determining the point at which the appellant was detained, beginning with the circumstances giving rise to the encounter, the trial judge found that the police had at least two valid investigatory purposes; the police encounter in the backyard therefore took place in the context of a legitimate police investigation and the young men had no reason to believe otherwise. The trial judge\u2019s findings make clear that this was not a fishing expedition, and it is not open to an appellate court to substitute its views for the views of the trial judge according to what the appellate court thinks the evidence establishes. The interaction began with a series of general inquiries, rather than an attempt by the police to single out any particular individual for focused investigation. This militates against the conclusion that the detention was immediate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Turning to the nature of the police conduct, the following principles expressed by the majority are endorsed: if it can be shown that the police conduct at issue was aggressive, then that would be a significant factor in the analysis; police conduct towards third parties can influence how a reasonable person in the claimant\u2019s shoes would perceive his or her own freedom of movement; the setting in which the police interaction takes place is a relevant consideration \u2014 in particular, a police intrusion into a private space may reasonably be perceived as communicating some measure of control over the occupants; the duration of the police encounter is a relevant consideration; and an unlawful police entry can generally be expected to have an intimidating effect and may therefore cause a reasonable person to be less inclined to believe he or she is free to walk away.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the trial judge was presented with two strikingly different accounts of what occurred on the night in question. He accepted the account provided by the police and rejected that of the appellant and his friends. Thus, on the trial judge\u2019s findings, this was not a shakedown, an instance of racial profiling, or a mere fishing expedition. Rather, it was a legitimate investigation performed by the police, and there was no finding of bad faith. In concluding that the police were aggressive, that they were engaged in a fishing expedition, and that their conduct demonstrated that they were exerting dominion over the individuals in the backyard from the time of entry, the majority has recast the record in a manner that is inconsistent with the positive findings of fact that the trial judge made in favour of the police. It is not open to an appellate court to recharacterize police conduct based on its own appreciation of the evidence to arrive at its own view of how a reasonable person in the circumstances would perceive that conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Turning to the particular characteristics and circumstances of the individual, there is agreement with the majority on a number of points, including the following: a person may experience a police interaction differently depending on his or her age, race, life experience, and other personal characteristics, and these factors should be taken into account in the s.\u00a09 analysis; the judicially constructed reasonable person must reflect and respect racial diversity, as well as the broader state of relations between the police and various racial groups; credible reports, studies, and other materials on race relations may assist courts in understanding how racialized persons may experience police interactions differently, and while it is generally preferable that all relevant materials be placed before the trial judge and made the subject of submissions from the parties, courts may take judicial notice of such materials where the test set out in R. v. Spence, 2005 SCC 71, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 458, is met; and a young person of small physical stature like the appellant may reasonably perceive a greater power imbalance vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis the police, as compared to how a larger, more mature person might perceive the situation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The appellant is an Asian\u2011Canadian man of slight build who was 20 years old at the time of the incident. The trial judge expressly anchored his analysis in the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the appellant, and he took into account the visible minority status of the appellant and his friends. The appellant testified that he considered himself free to go until the police engaged him directly. The claimant\u2019s own perception of whether and when he or she was detained is not determinative, but it may be a relevant consideration. Here, the appellant\u2019s testimony suggests that a reasonable person in the circumstances would not have considered himself detained from the moment the police set foot in the backyard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, in determining the timing of the appellant\u2019s detention, the Court\u2019s decisions in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, and R. v. Suberu, 2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, make clear that as a general rule, only when the police move from general questioning to focussed interrogation will a detention result. General neighbourhood policing and preliminary or exploratory questioning are generally insufficient to effect a detention. In the case at hand, at the initial stage of the interaction, the police officers were simply orienting themselves to the situation and engaging in pre\u2011detention exploratory interaction. While it can be difficult to ascertain with any degree of certainty the point at which a psychological detention occurred, it could reasonably be said that the appellant was detained, at the earliest, when the third officer entered the backyard and directed one of the young men to keep his hands in front of him, an order which he complied with immediately. In all the circumstances, upon seeing this clear exercise of police authority and his friend\u2019s immediate compliance, it is realistic to conclude that a reasonable person in the appellant\u2019s circumstances would have considered himself effectively deprived of his liberty of choice, even though he did not consider himself to be detained at this point.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The detention in this case was arbitrary. At the moment when the appellant was detained, the police had not yet developed reasonable grounds to suspect he was armed \u2014 a prerequisite to a lawful investigative detention. This resulted in a breach of the appellant\u2019s s.\u00a09 Charter rights. However, the arbitrary detention was momentary, lasting mere seconds before the police developed reasonable grounds to suspect the appellant was armed, thereby transforming the arbitrary detention into a lawful one.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Since the conclusion on the Charter breach issues differs from that of the trial judge, a fresh s.\u00a024(2) analysis must be undertaken, accepting the trial judge\u2019s underlying factual findings absent any suggestion that they were tainted by a palpable and overriding error. The first line of inquiry to be considered is the seriousness of the Charter\u2011infringing state conduct. This involves a consideration of whether admission of the evidence would send a message to the public that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice, effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law. The court must fix the police misconduct on a spectrum ranging from the minor and inadvertent to the wilful or reckless.\u00a0As an appellate court, the Court cannot simply substitute its own view of the police conduct for that of the trial judge or recharacterize the evidence. Here, the trial judge concluded that there was no evidence suggesting that the officers were engaged in racial profiling. Nor were the police abusing their powers in any other manner. On the trial judge\u2019s findings, it is clear that any breach of the appellant\u2019s Charter rights was technical and inadvertent, and there was no finding of bad faith on the part of the police. Although the police trespassed, they did not do so wilfully or deliberately. Rather, the trespass was inadvertent and committed in the course of performing legitimate investigatory duties. The s.\u00a09 breach was far from egregious. The seriousness of the Charter\u2011infringing conduct falls on the low end of the spectrum. Admission of the evidence would not send the message that the justice system condones serious state misconduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second line of inquiry focuses on the impact of the Charter breaches on the Charter\u2011protected interests of the applicant. The impact of a Charter breach may range from fleeting and technical to profoundly intrusive. The more serious the impact, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence may signal to the public that Charter rights are of little avail, thereby bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. In addition, the discoverability of the evidence is a relevant consideration in assessing the impact on the individual\u2019s Charter\u2011protected interests. The impact of the s.\u00a09 breach on the appellant\u2019s liberty, dignity, bodily integrity, and autonomy was reduced in terms of its significance because the arbitrary detention was fleeting in duration, did not result in any physical detention, and did not involve any aggressive or demeaning conduct on the part of the police. On the other hand, with respect to the discoverability of the evidence, the s.\u00a09 breach set in motion a series of events that led to the discovery of the evidence. This is a consideration that must be weighed in the balance. However, that factor alone cannot be allowed to overwhelm the analysis and require near\u2011automatic exclusion of the evidence. Moreover, the impact on the appellant\u2019s Charter\u2011protected interests should be considered in light of the fact that no evidence was obtained during the momentary arbitrary detention; rather, it was discovered only after the police had the grounds needed to perform an investigative detention, and only after the appellant decided to run from the police. In light of all the circumstances, the impact on the appellant\u2019s Charter\u2011protected interests was not so great as to clearly overwhelm competing considerations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The third line of inquiry considers society\u2019s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. Society generally expects that a criminal allegation will be adjudicated on its merits, and it has a collective interest in ensuring that those who transgress the law are brought to trial and dealt with according to the law. The third Grant line of inquiry asks whether the truth\u2011seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or by its exclusion. The reliability of the evidence, its importance to the Crown\u2019s case, and the seriousness of the offences are all factors to be considered. Here, society\u2019s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits is exceedingly high. The fact that a fully loaded, semi\u2011automatic handgun is implicated is no minor consideration. It is essential to both the rule of law and the attainment of the rights enshrined in the Charter that Canadians feel safe and secure in their communities. The reality that many Canadians live under the constant threat of gun violence and the evils of drug trafficking and look to the police for protection must not be lost in the s.\u00a024(2) analysis. The evidence in this case is real, reliable, and essential evidence of very serious criminal offences. Exclusion of the evidence would gut the Crown\u2019s case. This line of inquiry pulls strongly in favour of admission.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, considering all the circumstances, it is clear what must be done to maintain the good repute of the administration of justice: the evidence must be admitted. Given that the seriousness of the Charter\u2011infringing conduct falls on the low end of the spectrum and society\u2019s interest in an adjudication on the merits is exceedingly high, the impact on the appellant\u2019s Charter\u2011protected interests is insufficient to tip the scale in favour of exclusion. The majority\u2019s approach does nothing to recognize that the three police officers, in the course of carrying out a legitimate investigation, put their lives on the line for the good of the community. The chambered bullet in the appellant\u2019s semi\u2011automatic handgun could have ended the life of an innocent bystander or one of the police officers as they struggled to wrest control of the bag containing the weapon from the appellant. Reasonable and well\u2011informed members of the public would regard a decision to exclude the evidence as intolerable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Evidence found on a young racialized man who was detained by police  without reasonable suspicion can\u2019t be used against him in court, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   One  evening in 2012, Mr. Le and four friends were hanging out in a backyard  talking. Three police officers saw them. The officers hadn\u2019t been called there  for any specific reason. They didn\u2019t have a warrant. They had just been told  that this was a \u201cproblem address\u201d for drug dealing and that a wanted suspect  sometimes hung out there. They didn\u2019t see the men doing anything wrong. Even  so, the officers came into the yard without asking permission. They questioned  the men, told one of them to keep his hands visible, and asked for ID. Mr.  Le said he didn\u2019t have ID with him. The officer asked what was in the bag he  was carrying. At that point, Mr. Le ran away. He was arrested and found to have  a gun, drugs, and cash. He was charged with ten crimes related to these items.  At his trial, Mr. Le said the items found on him  couldn\u2019t be used as evidence against him. He said the police breached his  rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms</em>. The <em>Charter</em> is part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Section 9 says that \u201ceveryone has the right not  to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.\u201d This means that police can\u2019t detain people,  or put them in jail, without a legal reason. Section 24(2) says that evidence  taken by breaching someone\u2019s rights  can\u2019t be used if it \u201cwould bring the administration  of justice into disrepute.\u201d That means it can\u2019t be used if admitting it could make  people lose faith in the justice system and the laws meant to protect them. Everyone  agreed that the police had no legal authority to make Mr. Le and his friends  answer questions, follow directions, or show ID. Everyone agreed that Mr. Le  was detained at some point. The question was exactly when, and whether there  was a legal reason for it. The  trial judge said Mr. Le wasn\u2019t detained until he was asked about his bag. He  said the detention was legal because the officers had reasonable suspicion of a  crime by that point (they thought Mr. Le might have a gun). He found Mr. Le  guilty. A majority of the Court of Appeal agreed.  The  majority at the Supreme Court said the detention was illegal. It said the  police actions were so shocking that the items they found by detaining Mr. Le couldn\u2019t  be used against him in court.  The majority said someone is \u201cdetained\u201d when an  ordinary person in the same situation would think that they weren\u2019t free to  leave and had to comply with police demands. Mr. Le was a member of a  racialized community in a low-income area. Members of racial minorities and  people living in low-income areas often have more negative police contacts than  other people do. An ordinary person stopped by the police many times before  would think they had to do what the police said. The majority said Mr. Le was  detained as soon as the officers entered the backyard. The  majority noted that the officers came in without warning and without any reasonable  suspicion of a crime. (Someone just <em>saying</em> that drug dealing was happening wasn\u2019t enough.) Since they didn\u2019t have  reasonable suspicion, what they did was illegal. The majority said this was  exactly the kind of thing the <em>Charter </em>was  meant to protect people from. The  police got the evidence against Mr. Le by walking into a backyard and detaining  him without a legal reason. If this were allowed, the majority said, people  would lose faith in the justice system. Police  have to follow the <em>Charter </em>in all  neighbourhoods and for all people, no matter what their racial background or  income. This helps people trust the law and the police, and makes our  communities safer. The majority said the evidence the police found on Mr. Le couldn\u2019t  be used against him. It entered not-guilty verdicts for the charges. This result  wasn\u2019t because the <em>Charter</em> doesn\u2019t  care about violence, drugs, or community safety. It was because the illegal  police actions were so serious. This case came to  the Supreme Court as an appeal \u201cas of right.\u201d That means there is an automatic  right to appeal. The person doesn\u2019t need the Court\u2019s permission. The right is  automatic in criminal cases when a Court of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees)  on a point of law, as happened here."

The cause of death was\ndetermined to be loss of blood due to an 11 cm wound in her vaginal wall. The\nCrown\u2019s theory was that during the course of commercial sexual activities while\nthe deceased was incapacitated by alcohol, the accused cut the inside of her\nvagina with a sharp object with intent to seriously harm or kill her.\nAlternatively, the Crown took the position that if the accused did not murder\nthe deceased, he committed the lesser and included offence of unlawful act\nmanslaughter, by causing her death in the course of a sexual assault. The\naccused, however, maintained his innocence. He testified that he and the\ndeceased engaged in similar consensual sexual activity on both the night\nleading up to her death and the previous night, and that on both occasions, he\npenetrated her vagina with his fingers and thrusted repeatedly. He claimed that\nshe started to bleed unexpectedly on the second night, bringing the sexual\nactivity to a halt, and he awoke the next morning to find her dead in the\nbathtub. He then left the hotel in a panic, returned, called 911, and\nfabricated different versions of a false story. Although he admitted that he\ncaused her death, he claimed that it was a non-culpable accident. He denied\nusing a sharp object and asserted that the deceased consented to the sexual\nactivities in question \u2014 or at least he honestly believed that she did.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In its opening address to the\njury, the Crown referred to the deceased as a prostitute and explained that she\nand the accused struck up a working relationship on the night before her death.\nIn addition, without having submitted an application under ss.\u00a0276.1(1) and\n276.1(2) of the Criminal Code to adduce evidence of the deceased\u2019s prior\nsexual activity, the accused testified at length about his previous sexual\nactivity with the deceased. The Crown did not object, nor did the trial judge\norder a separate hearing to consider the admissibility and permissible uses of\nthis evidence. The jury acquitted the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the\nCrown\u2019s appeal, set aside the accused\u2019s acquittal, and ordered a new trial on\nfirst degree murder.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner C.J. and Abella and Karakatsanis\nJJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part and a new trial\non unlawful act manslaughter ordered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe JJ.: The\ntrial judge erred in failing to comply with the mandatory requirements set\nout in s.\u00a0276 of the Criminal Code. That error had ripple effects,\nmost acutely in the instructions on the defence of honest but mistaken belief\nin communicated consent, upon which the accused relied. In particular, non\u2011compliance\nwith the s.\u00a0276 regime translated into a failure to expose and properly\naddress misleading evidence and mistakes of law arising from the accused\u2019s\ndefence. This resulted in a reversible error warranting a new trial. However,\nthe new trial should be restricted to the offence of unlawful act manslaughter,\nas it has not been demonstrated that the acquittal on murder was tainted by\nreversible error.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 276 of the Criminal\nCode governs the\nadmissibility of evidence about a complainant\u2019s prior sexual activities and the\nuses to which that evidence may be put. The\nanimating purposes behind the s.\u00a0276 regime are to protect the integrity\nof the trial by excluding irrelevant and misleading evidence, protect the\naccused\u2019s right to a fair trial, and encourage the reporting of sexual offences\nby protecting the security and privacy of complainants. Section 276(1) provides\nthat in proceedings in respect of certain listed offences, evidence of a\ncomplainant\u2019s prior sexual activity is not admissible to support an inference\nthat, by reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the complainant is more\nlikely to have consented to the sexual activity in question or is less worthy\nof belief. This section is categorical in nature and applies irrespective of\nwhich party led the evidence. Section 276(2) provides that evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior sexual\nactivity adduced by or on behalf of the accused is presumptively inadmissible\nunless, after certain procedures have been followed, the trial judge rules to\nthe contrary. The s.\u00a0276 regime applies to any\nproceeding in which an offence listed in s.\u00a0276(1) has some connection to\nthe offence charged, even if no listed offence was particularized in the\ncharging document. Crown\u2011led prior sexual activity evidence is subject to\nthe common law principles articulated in R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An accused may respond to a charge\nof sexual assault by relying on the defence of honest but mistaken belief in\ncommunicated consent. Consent is defined in s.\u00a0273.1(1) of the Criminal\nCode as the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual\nactivity in question. For purposes of the actus reus, consent means that\nthe complainant in her mind wanted the sexual touching to take place. At this\nstage, the focus is placed squarely on the complainant\u2019s state of mind, and the\naccused\u2019s perception of that state of mind is irrelevant. For purposes of the mens\nrea, and specifically for the purposes of the defence of honest but\nmistaken belief in communicated consent, consent means that the complainant had\naffirmatively communicated by words or conduct her agreement to engage in the\nsexual activity with the accused. Hence, the focus at this stage shifts to the\nmental state of the accused, and the question becomes whether the accused\nhonestly believed the complainant effectively said \u201cyes\u201d through her words and\nactions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While the jurisprudence has\nconsistently referred to the relevant defence as being premised on an honest\nbut mistaken belief in consent, it is clear that in order to make out this\ndefence, the accused must have an honest but mistaken belief that the\ncomplainant actually communicated consent, whether by words or conduct. It is\ntherefore appropriate to refine the judicial lexicon and refer to the defence\nmore accurately as an \u201chonest but mistaken belief in communicated\nconsent\u201d. This refinement is intended to focus all justice system participants\non the crucial question of communication of consent and avoid inadvertently\nstraying into the forbidden territory of assumed or implied consent. In seeking\nto rely on the complainant\u2019s prior sexual activities in support of a defence of\nhonest but mistaken belief in communicated consent, the accused must be able to\nexplain how and why that evidence informed his honest but mistaken belief that\nthe complainant communicated consent to the sexual activity in question at the\ntime it occurred. The accused cannot rest his defence on the false logic that\nthe complainant\u2019s prior sexual activities, by reason of their sexual nature,\nmade her more likely to have consented to the sexual activity in question, and\non this basis he believed that she consented.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Honest but mistaken belief in communicated\nconsent is a mistake of fact defence, which operates where the accused\nmistakenly perceived facts that negate, or raise a reasonable doubt about, the\nfault element of the offence. By contrast, as a general rule, mistakes of law\noffer no excuse. Therefore, to the extent an accused\u2019s defence of honest but\nmistaken belief in communicated consent rests on a mistake of law \u2014 including\nwhat counts as consent from a legal perspective \u2014 rather than a mistake of fact,\nthe defence is of no avail. For example, it is an error of law \u2014 not fact \u2014 to\nassume that unless and until a woman says \u201cno\u201d, she has implicitly given her\nconsent to any and all sexual activity. Implied consent, which rests on the\nassumption that unless a woman protests or resists, she should be deemed to\nconsent, has no place in Canadian law. In addition, a belief that the\ncomplainant gave broad advance consent to sexual activity of an undefined scope\nwill afford the accused no defence, as that belief is also premised on a\nmistake of law, not fact. As a further example, an accused\u2019s belief that the\ncomplainant\u2019s prior sexual activities, by reason of their sexual nature, made\nit more likely that she was consenting to the sexual activity in question is again\na mistake of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The availability of the defence of honest\nbut mistaken belief in communicated consent is not unlimited. The reasonable\nsteps requirement under s.\u00a0273.2(b) of the Criminal Code imposes a\nprecondition to this defence. This requirement, which rejects the outmoded idea that women can be taken to\nbe consenting unless they say \u201cno\u201d, has both objective and subjective dimensions: the accused must take steps\nto ascertain consent that are objectively reasonable, and the reasonableness of\nthose steps must be assessed in light of the circumstances known to the accused\nat the time. The reasonable steps inquiry is highly fact\u2011specific. Trial\njudges and juries should take a purposive approach, keeping in mind that the\nreasonable steps requirement reaffirms that the accused cannot equate silence,\npassivity, or ambiguity with the communication of consent. Trial judges and\njuries should also be guided by the need to protect and preserve every person\u2019s\nbodily integrity, sexual autonomy, and human dignity. Steps based on rape myths or stereotypical assumptions\nabout women and consent cannot constitute reasonable steps.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The concept of reasonable steps to ascertain\nconsent under s.\u00a0273.2(b) of the Criminal Code must be\ndistinguished from the concept of reasonable grounds to support an honest\nbelief in consent under s.\u00a0265(4). Where the accused is charged with some form of\nassault, the presence or absence of reasonable grounds is simply a factor to be\nconsidered in assessing the honesty of the accused\u2019s asserted belief in consent\nin accordance with s.\u00a0265(4). By contrast, where the accused is charged\nwith a sexual offence under ss.\u00a0271, 272, or 273, a failure to take\nreasonable steps is fatal to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in\ncommunicated consent by virtue of s.\u00a0273.2(b). In the context of a charge under ss.\u00a0271, 272,\nor 273 where the accused asserts an honest but mistaken belief in communicated\nconsent, if either there is no evidence upon which the trier of fact could find\nthat the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain consent or the Crown proves\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the accused failed to take reasonable steps to\nascertain consent, then there would be no reason to consider the presence or\nabsence of reasonable grounds to support an honest belief in consent under\ns.\u00a0265(4), since the accused would be legally barred from raising the\ndefence due to the operation of s.\u00a0273.2(b).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An accused who wishes to rely on\nthe defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent must first demonstrate\nthat there is an air of reality to the defence. If there is no evidence upon\nwhich the trier of fact could find that the accused took reasonable steps to\nascertain consent, then the defence of honest but mistaken belief in\ncommunicated consent has no air of reality and must not be left with the jury.\nBy contrast, if there is an air of reality to the defence of honest but\nmistaken belief in communicated consent, including the reasonable steps\nrequirement, then the defence should be left with the jury. The onus would then shift to the Crown to\nnegative the defence, which could be achieved by proving beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the accused failed to take reasonable steps. Where the Crown does not prove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the accused failed to take reasonable steps, that does not lead\nautomatically to an acquittal. In those circumstances, the trial judge should\ninstruct the jury that they are required, as a matter of law, to go on to\nconsider whether the Crown has nonetheless proven beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the accused did not have an honest but mistaken belief in communicated\nconsent. This requirement flows from the fact that the defence is ultimately\none of an honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent, not one of reasonable\nsteps. Ultimately, if the Crown fails to disprove the defence beyond a\nreasonable doubt, then the accused would be entitled to an acquittal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, while the Crown did not\nobject to the accused\u2019s testimony about the deceased\u2019s prior sexual activity,\nits failure to do so was not fatal. The ultimate responsibility for enforcing\ncompliance with the mandatory s.\u00a0276 regime lies squarely with the trial\njudge, not with the Crown. It is also plain that the proceeding implicated an\noffence listed in s.\u00a0276(1) because the offence charged in this case,\nfirst degree murder, was premised on sexual assault with a weapon, which is an\noffence listed in s.\u00a0276(1). It follows that the s.\u00a0276 regime was\nengaged. Furthermore, the limited information conveyed in the Crown\u2019s opening\naddress did not exclude the application of s.\u00a0276(2) to the accused\u2019s\ndetailed testimony about the deceased\u2019s sexual activity on the night before her\ndeath, which went well beyond the basic narrative recounted by the Crown.\nTherefore, before adducing evidence of the deceased\u2019s sexual activity on the\nnight before her death, the procedural requirements under s.\u00a0276 should\nhave been observed, and if any\nof the evidence was deemed admissible, a careful limiting instruction by the trial judge was essential to\ninstruct the jury on the permissible and impermissible uses of that evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At trial, the accused relied on\nthe defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent, and his\ntestimony about the deceased\u2019s prior sexual activities featured prominently in\nhis defence. The trial judge erred by failing to inoculate the jury against\nmistakes of law masquerading as mistakes of fact, as the accused\u2019s defence\nraised the spectre of several mistakes of law: a belief that the absence of\nsigns of disagreement could be substituted for affirmative communication of\nconsent; a belief that prior similar sexual activities between the accused and\nthe deceased, the deceased\u2019s status as a sex worker, or the accused\u2019s own\nspeculation about what was going through the deceased\u2019s mind could be\nsubstituted for communicated consent to the sexual activity in question at the\ntime; a belief that the deceased could give broad advance consent to whatever\nthe accused wanted to do to her; and the inference that the deceased\u2019s past\nsexual activities, by reason of their sexual nature, may make it more likely that\nshe consented to the sexual activity in question. It was incumbent on the trial\njudge to caution the jury against acting on these mistakes of law. The absence\nof such an instruction had an immediate impact on the defence of honest but\nmistaken belief in communicated consent, as it allowed the defence to proceed\nwhile these mistakes of law were left unaddressed, thereby leaving the jurors\nwithout the necessary tools to engage in a proper analysis. This error was\ninextricably linked to the failure to hold a s.\u00a0276 hearing, which would\nhave subjected the admissibility and permissible uses of the evidence of the\ndeceased\u2019s prior sexual history to rigorous scrutiny and assisted in filtering\nout the mistakes of law raised by the accused\u2019s defence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where motive does not form an\nessential element of the offence, the necessity of charging a jury on the\nsubject depends upon the course of the trial and the nature and\nprobative value of the evidence adduced. In this case, motive was a relevant consideration\nbearing upon whether the accused intended to seriously harm or kill the\ndeceased, which would go to the fault element for murder. However, the Crown\nled no evidence of motive. Since there was neither a proven motive nor a proven\nabsence of motive, it fell within the trial judge\u2019s substantial discretion to\ncharge on motive. Further, the charge was not so unbalanced as to amount to\nmisdirection.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fault element of unlawful act manslaughter\nconsists of objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm which is\nneither trivial nor transitory, in the context of a dangerous act. At trial,\nthe defence conceded that the act in question was dangerous, and the Crown accepted\nthat it would be appropriate to instruct the jury that if they were satisfied\nthat the accused committed an unlawful act, then it was implicit that the act\nwas dangerous. In addition, the Crown agreed to the request of the defence that\nthe language of objectively foreseeable bodily harm be removed from the charge.\nOn appeal, the Crown reversed its position, arguing that the instructions on\ndangerousness were deficient and the trial judge\u2019s failure to refer to the\nobjective fault element of unlawful act manslaughter unfairly minimized its\nexpert evidence. The Court of Appeal accepted the Crown\u2019s position on appeal.\nHowever, it should not have done so, as the Crown had to live with the decision\nit made at trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In light of procedural fairness\nconcerns \u2014 namely, the Crown\u2019s limited right to appeal an acquittal and the\nrequirements that must be observed by appellate courts when raising new issues\n\u2014 the Court of Appeal should not have ordered a new trial on the issue of after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct evidence. The Crown was actively involved in drafting the jury charge,\nand at no point did it request a specific instruction directing the jury to\nconsider the accused\u2019s after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct in assessing his\ncredibility. Further, although the Court of Appeal notified the parties at the\noutset of the hearing that it would raise new issues, it did not specify the\nprecise nature of those issues or indicate whether one or more could result in\nthe accused\u2019s acquittal being set aside. It also allowed the Crown to advance certain arguments on\nafter\u2011the\u2011fact conduct for the first time in reply submissions, and\nat the end of the hearing the court indicated that there was no need for\nfurther written argument.\nLastly, though it is not necessary to finally decide the issue, there is reason\nto be skeptical of the Crown\u2019s argument that the trial judge\u2019s instructions on\nafter-the-fact conduct were so defective as to amount to reversible error. When\nread fairly and as a whole, the trial judge\u2019s charge on after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct adequately, albeit imperfectly, conveyed to the jury that they could\nconsider the accused\u2019s after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct in assessing guilt\nand equipped them to do so.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The term \u201caccident\u201d is used to signal one or both of the\nfollowing: (1)\u00a0that the act in question was involuntary (i.e., non\u2011volitional),\nthereby negating the actus reus of the offence; or (2)\u00a0that the\naccused did not have the requisite mens rea. In assessing whether a\nclaim of \u201caccident\u201d may negate mens rea in any particular case, it is\nobviously essential to consider what the relevant mens rea requirement\nis in the first place. In carrying out this inquiry, it must be kept in mind\nthat mens rea requirements vary and include, for example: (1)\u00a0a\nsubjective intention to bring about a prohibited consequence; (2)\u00a0a\nsubjective awareness of prohibited circumstances; and (3)\u00a0objective fault.\nWhere the offence charged requires proof of subjective intent to bring about a\nparticular consequence, the claim that the accused did not intend to bring\nabout that consequence, making it a mere accident, is legally relevant, as it\ncould negate the mens rea required for a conviction. By contrast, where\nthe offence only requires a subjective awareness of particular circumstances,\nan accused\u2019s claim that the consequences of his act were unintentional and\nunexpected, making those consequences a mere accident, is naturally of no\nassistance. Finally, if the offence requires proof of objective fault \u2014 for\ninstance, that the prohibited consequence was objectively foreseeable \u2014 then a\nclaim of accident could negate that fault element if the prohibited\nconsequence was such a chance occurrence that the trier of fact is left in a\nstate of reasonable doubt as to whether, objectively, it was foreseeable. To\navoid confusion in future cases, trial judges should focus on the questions of\nvoluntariness and/or negation of mens rea, as appropriate, when\ninstructing jurors on the so\u2011called \u201cdefence\u201d of \u201caccident\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is no denying that\nIndigenous people \u2014 in particular Indigenous women, girls, and sex workers \u2014\nhave endured serious injustices, including high rates of sexual violence. Furthermore, the Court has acknowledged on\nseveral occasions the detrimental effects of widespread racism against\nIndigenous people within our criminal justice system. With this in mind, our criminal justice system and\nall participants within it should take reasonable steps to address systemic\nbiases, prejudices, and stereotypes against Indigenous women and sex workers.\nAs an additional safeguard going forward, in sexual assault cases where the\ncomplainant is an Indigenous woman or girl, trial judges would be well advised to provide an\nexpress instruction aimed at countering prejudice against Indigenous women and\ngirls. However, any such instruction must not privilege the rights of the\ncomplainant over those of the accused. The objective would be to identify\nspecific biases, prejudices, and stereotypes that may reasonably be expected to\narise in the particular case and attempt to remove them from the jury\u2019s\ndeliberative process in a fair, balanced way, without prejudicing the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying the test set out in R.\nv. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, a new trial on unlawful act manslaughter is warranted. The failure\nto implement the s.\u00a0276 regime carried a significant risk that the jury\nwould, whether consciously or unconsciously, engage in impermissible forms of\nreasoning on the central questions of whether the deceased subjectively\nconsented to the sexual activity in question and, if not, whether the accused\nhonestly but mistakenly believed she communicated her consent to that sexual\nactivity at the time it occurred. The trial judge\u2019s failure to implement the\ns.\u00a0276 regime was exacerbated by, and was inseparable from, the failure to\ncaution the jury against mistakes of law masquerading as mistakes of fact when\nconsidering the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent.\nIt can reasonably be thought that the trial judge\u2019s errors had a material\nbearing on the accused\u2019s acquittal for unlawful act manslaughter, and therefore\na new trial should be ordered on that offence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, a new trial on first\ndegree murder is not warranted. The Crown\u2019s case on first degree murder turned\nprimarily on its expert evidence that the deceased\u2019s fatal wound was a cut.\nEvidently, the jury was not persuaded. Moreover, the Crown provided no\nplausible explanation for how the jury could have used prior sexual activity\nevidence to improperly reason its way through the first degree murder charge.\nFurthermore, the Crown acknowledged in the court below that the only ground of\nappeal implicating the murder charge was the motive issue. However, the motive\ninstructions were not tainted by reversible error. Finally, there was a simple\nand obvious explanation for why the jury unanimously acquitted the accused of murder\nthat does not require the Court to speculate about the potential influence of\nconscious or unconscious bias: the Crown\u2019s theory simply did not hold up under\nscrutiny.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella and Karakatsanis\nJJ. (dissenting in part): Section 276 makes evidence of\na complainant\u2019s prior sexual activity inadmissible unless the accused complies\nwith the criteria and procedures set out in ss.\u00a0276, 276.1 and 276.2. In\nthis case, the trial judge permitted the accused to lead such evidence without\nfollowing the procedure required by s.\u00a0276, thereby allowing him to make\nunrestricted reference to the victim\u2019s sexual history. He also failed to give\nthe jurors any kind of limiting instruction to advise them that such evidence\ncould not be used to show that the victim was more likely to have consented.\nAll of this was compounded by the fact that the trial judge permitted, on\ndozens of occasions, the deceased to be referred to as a Native prostitute\nwithout providing any instruction to guard against potential prejudicial\nreasoning based on these descriptions. There was thus no filter for the\nvictim\u2019s prior sexual history and no specific warning to the jury to avoid\ndrawing prejudicial and stereotypical assumptions about Indigenous women\nworking in the sex trade. This left the jury with an essentially unchallenged\nversion of the accused\u2019s interactions with the victim. The trial judge failed\nto appreciate that the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct, occupation and race\nrequired the jury to be specifically alerted to the dangers of discriminatory\nattitudes toward Indigenous women, particularly those working in the sex trade.\nHe provided no specific instructions crafted to confront the operative social\nand racial bias potentially at work. This rendered the whole trial unfair.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ndevastatingly prejudicial effects of this error cannot be said to be confined\nto the included offence of manslaughter, but may also have had a material\nbearing on the jury\u2019s reasoning on the charge of first degree murder. The\nprejudicial impact of the accused\u2019s detailed testimony \u2014 without either the\nscreening required by s.\u00a0276 or any limiting instructions \u2014 necessarily\ninfected the whole trial and the entirety of the jury\u2019s fact\u2011finding\nprocess. Indeed, the jury\u2019s portrait of the victim was painted almost\nexclusively through the accused\u2019s testimony, which meant that there was a\nsignificant possibility that the jury\u2019s entire deliberations would have been\nbased on fundamentally flawed \u2014 and prohibited \u2014 legal premises.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\npotential for prejudicial reasoning was further exacerbated by the repeated\ndescription of the victim as a \u201cprostitute\u201d, and as a \u201cNative\u201d, without any\nlimiting instruction from the trial judge. Specific safeguards are required in\njury trials to prevent the systemic biases that can affect jury deliberations. Trial judges have an important role to play\nin instructing juries so that they can recognize and set aside racial and other\nbiases, including those against Indigenous peoples and sex trade workers.\nAcknowledging, as this Court has for the last two decades, that racial\nprejudice is a social fact not capable of reasonable dispute, is not an insult\nto the jury system, it is a wake-up call to trial judges to be acutely\nattentive to the undisputed reality of pervasive prejudice and to provide the\njury instructions required by law. Not only did that not happen here, the\nopposite occurred: inflammatory terminology was frequent, and was gratuitously\nused without any corrective intervention by the trial judge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nsummary, the trial judge\u2019s failure to apply the requirements in s.\u00a0276\ncreated a significant risk that the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual\nconduct not only tainted the jury\u2019s perception of her character and conduct,\nbut also fundamentally affected the factual foundation upon which their deliberations\nwere based. This error permeated the entire trial and may have had a material\nbearing on the jury\u2019s deliberations, affecting their verdicts for both murder\nand manslaughter. Given the prejudicial impact of these references, and the\nrisk that they would affect the jury\u2019s assessment of the victim and the\naccused\u2019s credibility, it is difficult to see how it is realistically possible\nto conclude that their effect was confined to the jury\u2019s verdict on\nmanslaughter. The risk of harmful effects on the jury\u2019s deliberations on murder\nwould have been no less profound. When a trial with intimately connected\nissues, such as this one, is riddled with highly prejudicial testimony, it\naffects the very foundations of a jury\u2019s fact\u2011finding function and\ndecision making.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\naddition, the trial judge\u2019s error in the instruction on after\u2011the\u2011fact\u2011conduct\nis significant. In his own testimony, the accused admitted to lying, disposing\nof evidence and providing contradictory exculpatory explanations to numerous\npeople after the victim\u2019s death. It was open to the jury to conclude that\nadditional incriminating after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence came from\nthe hotel video camera footage, physical evidence found by the police, and the\ntestimony of numerous individuals. The accused did not call 911 immediately\nafter finding the victim in the bathtub. Instead there was evidence that he\nattempted to erase his link to the scene by attempting to clean the bathroom,\nre\u2011arranging the bedding, putting his belongings in his van, checking out\nof the hotel room, and that he attempted to conceal and destroy evidence by\nthrowing the bloody towel he had used to wipe the victim\u2019s blood from his feet\nand the bathroom floor into a garbage can in the parking lot of the hotel. He\nalso concocted and fabricated multiple stories and excuses. There is a strong\npossibility that, properly instructed, it would have had a material bearing on\nthe jury\u2019s assessment of the accused\u2019s testimony and, ultimately, its verdict.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Instead,\nthe jury was given contradictory and confusing directions. In effect, the trial\njudge did not leave it open to the jury to consider the impact of the after\u2011the-fact\nconduct evidence, such as the admitted exculpatory lies the accused told after\nthe victim\u2019s death, except when such evidence favoured an acquittal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Juries,\nalthough expected to apply common sense, are above all expected to follow the\ninstructions given by the trial judge. Where those instructions are confusing\nand contradictory, there is no roadmap for common sense to follow.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>NOTE:</strong><em>\u00a0 </em>this document contains details that may be upsetting  to some readers.<strong>A man found not guilty of killing an Indigenous  woman must be re-tried for manslaughter because trial rules for dealing with  sexual history weren\u2019t followed, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong>\r\n   In  2011, Ms. Gladue bled to death from a wound inside her vagina. Mr. Barton was charged  with first-degree murder, the most serious kind. In this case, it was  considered so serious because the Crown (the prosecution) said Mr. Barton  murdered Ms. Gladue while sexually assaulting her with a weapon. It said he cut  her with a sharp object while she was very drunk, and that he wanted to  seriously harm or kill her.  The  Crown said even if Mr. Barton wasn\u2019t guilty of murder, he was guilty of \u201cunlawful  act manslaughter.\u201d This is when someone causes another person to die while  doing something dangerous and illegal that they should have known might cause serious  harm. Unlawful act manslaughter is \u201cincluded\u201d in the charge of first-degree  murder. A person can be found guilty of an included offence even if they aren\u2019t  found guilty of the more serious crime. \u00a0 Mr.  Barton said he hired Ms. Gladue to have sex two nights in a row. On the first  night, he said, he put his hand in her vagina and thrust a few minutes before  having sex. On the second night, he said, he did the same thing, but thrust  deeper and harder. This time, he said, there was blood. He said she went to the  bathroom to clean up, and he fell asleep. He said he found her dead the next  morning.  Mr.  Barton said he didn\u2019t cut Ms. Gladue with a sharp object, and that her death  was an accident. He said she agreed to the thrusting, so there was no sexual  assault\u2014meaning there was no illegal act to turn what happened into first-degree  murder or unlawful act manslaughter. Or, at least, he said he honestly <em>believed</em> she agreed to it. What he  honestly believed was important, because in sexual assault cases a person might  have a defence if they honestly believe the other person agreed to the acts.  The defence has to be based on facts and law. A person can\u2019t rely on a defence  if they get the law wrong.  The  jury found Mr. Barton not guilty. But the Crown said the judge made mistakes,  and there should be a new trial. The Court of Appeal agreed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that the trial judge made mistakes. The  law says defences to sexual assault can\u2019t rely on things that support myths  about women or sexual consent. That means these myths can\u2019t be used to help  decide if someone agreed to a sexual act (or if the person charged honestly <em>believed </em>they did). The first myth is  that women who have had sex before are more likely to agree to sex. The second  is that such women might not be telling the truth.  These  are myths because they are false. The law puts rules in place to prevent these  myths from affecting jury decisions. But the rules weren\u2019t followed in this  case. Mr. Barton didn\u2019t ask the court for permission to tell the jury about Ms.  Gladue\u2019s sexual history from the first night. The trial judge didn\u2019t decide  which evidence was allowed or tell the jury how that evidence could be used in  its decision. The jury didn\u2019t have the legal instructions it needed. The  mistakes were serious enough that the judges said a new trial should take  place. The  majority said a new trial should only be for unlawful act manslaughter, not  first-degree murder. This was because the trial judge\u2019s mistakes didn\u2019t affect  the murder charge. That charge was based on the argument that Mr. Barton cut  Ms. Gladue with a sharp object. The jury did not believe that happened. The  majority said the jury\u2019s decision on the murder charge should stand. The  majority also said that Mr. Barton had to believe Ms. Gladue <em>communicated</em> that she agreed, not just  that she agreed to the sexual act. This case raised the  issue of myths and prejudices about women, sex workers, and Indigenous people,  like Ms. Gladue. Everyone  has an equal right to dignity and respect. Everyone has the  right to make sexual choices about their own body. It doesn\u2019t matter who they  are, or what their reputation is, or what they\u2019ve done in the past. That\u2019s the  law. If someone else doesn\u2019t respect those choices, it\u2019s a crime."

        "summary": "<strong>Anyone charged with a provincial offence in BC has the right to a trial  in either English or French (just like for a criminal trial), the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>\r\n     The federal government has the power to make laws on  crimes. These are mostly found in the <em>Criminal  Code</em>, and include things like murder. The <em>Criminal Code </em>also explains the rules for how criminal trials  should take place.  Provinces  and territories have powers to make laws about \u201cquasi-crimes\u201d (which are kind  of like crimes, but usually aren\u2019t as serious). These are called provincial (or  territorial) offences, and include things like not wearing a seatbelt. BC has an <em>Offence Act </em>that explains the rules  for how provincial offences trials should take place. Mr.  Bessette was charged with a provincial offence in BC. He asked for his trial to  be in French. If  he had been charged with a crime under the <em>Criminal  Code</em>, Mr. Bessette would have had the right to have his trial in either English  or French. The right isn\u2019t just about fair trials. It\u2019s about the person\u2019s  linguistic and cultural identity. All courts in Canada that deal with criminal  matters already hold criminal trials in both official languages. This includes  the BC Provincial Court, where Mr. Bessette\u2019s trial was taking place. Mr.  Bessette\u2019s provincial offence wasn\u2019t a crime, so the <em>Criminal Code </em>didn\u2019t apply \u2013 at least not directly. But the BC <em>Offence Act </em>didn\u2019t say anything about  trial language. It did say the <em>Criminal  Code</em>could be used to fill in any gaps in the <em>Offence Act</em>. Mr. Bessette said that meant the parts of the <em>Criminal Code</em> that talked about language  applied. He said he should get to choose to have his trial in either French or  English. The Crown (the prosecution)  disagreed. It said trials for provincial offences had to be in English. This  was because an 18th-century English law said so. This law was part  of BC law because BC adopted all the English criminal laws that existed while  it was an English colony. The Provincial Court judge agreed with the Crown. Mr.  Bessette challenged the decision but the higher courts in BC didn\u2019t look at his  arguments. They said he should wait to raise them on appeal if he were found  guilty. There is a general rule  that criminal and quasi-criminal trials shouldn\u2019t be stopped in the middle to  deal with side issues. That\u2019s because it\u2019s important to get trials done  quickly. Mr. Bessette said language rights were too important to be just a side  issue. He said the higher courts in BC should have cancelled the Provincial  Court\u2019s decision to run his trial in English. The Supreme Court of Canada  unanimously agreed that Mr. Bessette had the right to a trial in French. It  said the BC Supreme Court judge was wrong to make him wait to appeal if he were  found guilty. It looked at how the <em>Offence  Act</em>, <em>Criminal Code</em>, and 18th-century  English law worked together. It said that when someone is charged with a  provincial offence, the <em>Offence Act</em> applies first. The only exception is if another, more specialized law has  priority. In this case, the specialized law (the <em>Motor Vehicle Act</em>)didn\u2019t  say anything about trial language. That meant the <em>Offence Act </em>still applied \u2013 except it didn\u2019t say anything about  trial language, either. But it did say the <em>Criminal  Code</em> could fill in any gaps. The <em>Criminal  Code</em> said Mr. Bessette could have his trial in either language. The Court  said this overrode the 18th-century English law.  Because  the law said Mr. Bessette had a choice, the Provincial Court didn\u2019t have the  power to make him have his trial in English. Any decision on his case would  have no legal effect because it wouldn\u2019t respect his trial language rights. If  he lost this (English) trial, he could have appealed about the trial language  issue. But he would likely have to go through a second (French) trial once the  appeal court saw the mistake. If he won his (English) trial, he would never  have a chance to have his language rights respected, because you can\u2019t appeal  when you win.This case wasn\u2019t about Mr.  Bessette\u2019s language rights under the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. It was about what all the laws that applied  to his trial, taken together, said about what language he could be tried in. The Supreme Court of  Canada previously dealt with language rights during hearings in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/37642-eng.aspx\">Mazraani v.  Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc.</a></em>\n"

Immigration\nofficials reviewed C\u2019s detention on a monthly basis, each time upholding the\ndecision that he should be detained. After 13 months in detention, C filed an\napplication for habeas corpus on the ground that his detention was\nunlawful both because it had become lengthy and indeterminate and because the\nconditions of his detention were inappropriate, thus breaching his rights under\nss.\u00a07 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights\nand Freedoms. The chambers judge declined\njurisdiction to consider C\u2019s application on the basis that the scheme set out\nin the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIRPA\u201d) satisfied\none of the two limited exceptions to the availability of habeas corpus,\nas the legislator had put in place a complete, comprehensive and expert\nstatutory scheme which provides for a review at least as broad as that\navailable by way of habeas corpus and no less advantageous (the Peiroo\nexception). The Court of Appeal allowed C\u2019s appeal, holding that the\nexception did not apply and that the chambers judge should have exercised his\ndiscretion to hear the application.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Abella\u00a0J.\ndissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, C\u00f4t\u00e9\nand Brown\u00a0JJ.: The IRPA does not provide a review procedure\nthat is at least as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus regarding\nthe specific challenges to the legality of the detention raised by C\u2019s habeas\ncorpus application. Accordingly, C was entitled to have his application\nheard by the chambers judge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nwrit of habeas corpus is an ancient legal remedy that remains\nfundamental to liberty and the rule of law. Entrenched in s.\u00a010(c)\nof the Charter, the right to habeas corpus permits those\nin detention to go before a provincial superior court and demand to know\nwhether the detention is justified in law. A limited exception to this right\narises where the legislator has put in place a complete, comprehensive and\nexpert statutory scheme which provides for a review at least as broad as that\navailable by way of habeas corpus and no less advantageous. However,\nexceptions to the availability of habeas corpus must be interpreted\nrestrictively. The determination of whether a scheme is as broad and\nadvantageous as habeas corpus must be considered with respect to the\nparticular basis upon which the lawfulness of the detention is challenged in\nthe habeas corpus application. It is necessary to ask upon what basis\nthe legality of the detention is being challenged, and whether there is a\ncomplete, comprehensive and expert scheme that is as broad and advantageous as habeas\ncorpus in relation to the specific grounds in the application. The scheme\nwill not be as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus if it fails\nentirely to include the grounds set out in the application, or if it provides\nfor review on the grounds in the application but the review process is not as\nbroad and advantageous as that available through habeas corpus,\nconsidering both the nature of the process and any advantages each procedural\nvehicle may offer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying\nthis framework to C\u2019s case reveals that the statutory scheme set out in the IRPA\nis unable to effectively address the challenge raised by his application in\na manner that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus. The IRPA\nprovides a detailed scheme to deal with the review of detention in the\nimmigration context. Once an initial detention order has been made, the IRPA\nreview process provides for periodic internal review of detention, for judicial\nreview of those decisions by the Federal Court, and for appeals to the Federal\nCourt of Appeal. Immigration officials are experts in applying their statutory\nmandates, and the Federal Court contributes an additional layer of immigration\u2011related\nexpertise. The grounds for ordering or continuing detention are clear. However,\nIRPA proceedings do not provide for review as broad and advantageous as habeas\ncorpus with respect to the specific basis upon which C has challenged the\nlegality of his detention \u2014 that is, the length, uncertain duration and\nconditions of his detention. Once the Minister has established grounds for detention,\nimmigration officers must consider factors which may weigh in favour of\nrelease, which include: the reason for detention; the length of time in\ndetention; whether detention is likely to continue and, if so, how long; any\nunexplained delays or unexplained lack of diligence; alternatives to detention;\nand, the principles applicable to s.\u00a07 of the Charter. Although the\nlength and likely duration of detention can be reviewed under the IRPA\nscheme, that review is not as broad and advantageous as that available through habeas\ncorpus. The IRPA scheme falls short in at least three important\nways: the onus in detention review is less advantageous to detainees than in habeas\ncorpus proceedings; the scope of immigration detention review before the\nfederal courts is narrower than that of a superior court\u2019s consideration of a habeas\ncorpus application; and habeas corpus provides a more timely remedy\nthan that afforded by judicial review. The IRPA scheme therefore fails\nto provide relief that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus in\nresponse to C\u2019s challenge to the legality of the length and uncertain duration\nof his detention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nAbella\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. The superior\ncourt properly declined to exercise its habeas corpus jurisdiction in\nfavour of the complete, comprehensive and expert scheme to which C was entitled\nunder the IRPA. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nshould be assertive and rigorous scrutiny of the lawfulness of any deprivation\nof liberty. That is why the IRPA should be interpreted in a way that\nguarantees the fullest possible range of scrutiny for detention, including the\nconditions of detention. Nothing in the language of the IRPA precludes\nsuch a comprehensive review. Rather, the basis for the entire scheme in the IRPA\nrequires it. Excluding the possibility of reviewing all aspects of immigration\ndetention, including its conditions and lawfulness, essentially and\ninappropriately reads out the detention review process in the IRPA and\nelevates habeas corpus into the only meaningful route offering detainees\na full review of their detention. The better approach is to continue to read\nthe language of the IRPA in a manner that is as broad and advantageous\nas habeas corpus and that ensures the complete, comprehensive and expert\nreview of immigration detention, as all of the Court\u2019s previous jurisprudence\nhas done. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Habeas\ncorpus has historic roots which have spawned a variety of statutory\nremedies whose goal is to preserve the same protections. These can be found in\nthe IRPA. Their legitimacy as a genuine alternative to habeas corpus\nwas judicially considered and endorsed in Pringle v. Fraser, 1972 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1972]\nS.C.R. 821, Peiroo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)\n(1989), 1989 CanLII 184 (ON CA), 69 O.R. (2d) 253, Reza v. Canada, 1994 CanLII 91 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394, and May\nv. Ferndale Institution, 2005 SCC 82 (CanLII), [2005] 3 S.C.R. 809. Each of these decisions\nemphasized that the habeas corpus\u2011like remedies available in the IRPA\nscheme are as broad as or broader than the traditional scope of review by way\nof habeas corpus. The IRPA scheme was intended to provide the\nsame fulsome, Charter\u2011compliant review of immigration detention as\nhabeas corpus. The Charter informs the interpretation of the IRPA\nin a manner that allows for the fullest possible review of a detainee\u2019s loss of\nliberty. The IRPA must therefore be interpreted in a way that gives it\nthe widest possible scope for implementing its objectives. The suggestion that\na full review of detention can only occur under habeas corpus departs\nfrom a long-standing jurisprudential consensus. There is no principled reason\nto abandon the sound logic in Pringle, Peiroo, Reza and May.\nThe Court has consistently endorsed the exception limiting the availability of habeas\ncorpus review for immigration matters. Disturbing this jurisprudence will\nlead to forum shopping, inconsistent decision\u2011making, and multiplicity of\nproceedings. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nothing\nin the language of the statutory scheme restricts the scope of IRPA\ndetention review to a partial review which must be supplemented by habeas\ncorpus. On the contrary, the IRPA scheme is structured to provide\ndetainees with at least the same rights they would receive on habeas corpus\nreview. All detentions must be reviewed regularly, and review hearings are\nstructured to be expeditious and accessible. Immigration officers are\nresponsible for bringing the detainee before the Immigration Division for all\nreview hearings. The Immigration Division can require the parties to appear,\nand may order the continued detention of a detainee, their unconditional\nrelease, or their release on conditions. A detainee may also apply for leave\nand judicial review to the Federal Court. In addition, no onus is placed on the\ndetainee, unlike in the case of habeas corpus applications. The IRPA\nscheme must be interpreted harmoniously with the Charter values that\nshape the contours of its application and the scheme must be applied in a\nmanner that is at least as rigorous and fair as habeas corpus review.\nThe Immigration Division must weigh the purposes served by immigration\ndetention against the detained individual\u2019s ss.\u00a07, 9 and 12 Charter\nrights. That necessarily includes consideration of the conditions of detention,\nand it ensures the protection of Charter rights.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section\n248 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations requires the\nImmigration Division to consider factors to determine if detention should\ncontinue. The factors ensure that extended periods of detention do not violate\nthe Charter. The Immigration Division must weigh the state\u2019s immigration\nobjectives against the detained individual\u2019s right to be free from arbitrary or\nindefinite restraints on liberty. A prior, fact\u2011driven determination that the individual\nconstitutes a flight risk or a danger to the public is entitled to deference. The justification for continued detention decreases as the length\nof time in detention increases, and the evidentiary burden on the detaining\nauthority increases as the length of detention increases. The Immigration\nDivision must consider conditions of and alternatives to detention, including\nrelease. Delays or lack of diligence on the part of the immigration authorities\nmust be considered. The anticipated future length of detention must also be\nconsidered, which requires an estimation of how long detention is likely to\ncontinue. The Immigration Division is better positioned to assess and address\nthis factor than the superior courts on habeas corpus. The process of\nreview demands that the Immigration Division consider at least the same\nconsiderations that superior courts weigh on habeas corpus review.\nProperly interpreted, therefore, the IRPA scheme provides for the\nfullest possible review of immigration detention, and, where detention is said\nto violate ss.\u00a07, 9 and 12 of the Charter, the review process\nallows for at least the same substantive assessment as that undertaken by\nsuperior courts on habeas corpus review. Since the Court has repeatedly\naffirmed that habeas corpus will not lie if the statutory alternative\nprovides a remedy that is at least as favourable, the superior court properly\ndeclined to exercise its habeas corpus jurisdiction.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Distinguished:\nPeiroo v.

        "summary": "<strong>Everyone has a right to the strongest protections to make sure they  aren\u2019t held in custody against the law, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Mr. Chhina  came to Canada in 2006 and got refugee status two years later. In 2012, he was  ordered to leave Canada for lying on his refugee application and committing  crimes. He was held in custody for a while, but released with conditions while  he waited for his travel documents. Mr. Chhina disappeared and was only found by  the police a year later. He was then held in maximum security and kept on  lockdown for all but 90 minutes a day.  Mr.  Chhina said that his treatment was illegal under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, part of Canada\u2019s  constitution. He argued that he had been there over a year and no one could  tell him how much longer he would be held. He also said the lockdown conditions  were not appropriate. He applied for <em>habeas  corpus</em> (pronounced \u201cHAY-bee-us KOR-pus\u201d) in 2016.  <em>Habeas corpus</em> is an old and  important legal concept, dating back many centuries. It means \u201cproduce the  body\u201d in Latin. Taking someone\u2019s freedom away should be a last resort, and <em>habeas corpus</em> guarantees it won\u2019t happen  illegally. Section 10(c) of the <em>Charter</em> says that \u201c[e]veryone has the  right on arrest or detention\u2026 to have the validity of the detention determined  by way of <em>habeas corpus </em>and to be  released if the detention is not lawful.\u201d This means a person can ask a court  to decide if they are being held illegally. If the authorities  can\u2019t show enough of a reason, the court will order them to let the person go. <em>Habeas corpus </em>is so important that  courts have rules to hear these applications quickly and give them priority  over other court business. There are  only two exceptions where a person can\u2019t use <em>habeas corpus</em>. The first is when they try to challenge being found  guilty or challenge their punishment. (They can challenge these by appealing  the decision to a higher court instead.) The second is when there is another  process in place that is as good as, or better than, <em>habeas corpus</em>.  The judge  decided not to hear Mr. Chhina\u2019s application. He said the process under the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em> was  just as good as <em>habeas corpus</em>, so it  fell under that exception. The Court of Appeal said this wasn\u2019t the case. It  said the judge should have heard Mr. Chhina\u2019s application. Everyone  agreed that the review process under the Act worked in general. The question  was whether it worked as well as <em>habeas  corpus</em> for Mr. Chhina\u2019s specific situation. The majority  at the Supreme Court said that it didn\u2019t. This was for several reasons. One  reason had to do with the kind of review that happened. Decision-makers would  review someone\u2019s detention every 30 days under the Act, but they usually based  their decision on what was decided before. Under <em>habeas corpus</em>, a judge would give the situation a fresh and  independent look. Another reason had to do with the power to change things.  Under the Act, a judge could only look at a specific decision from a  decision-maker. Because of the first reason, the judge was limited to a decision  that was usually based on a previous decision. Under <em>habeas corpus</em>, a judge could look at the whole situation, not just  what the decision-maker looked at. A third reason had to do with what each side  had to show or prove. Under the Act, a detained person had to show why they  should be released. Under <em>habeas corpus</em>,  it was up to the authorities to show why the person should be held. This put  less of a burden on the person to prove their case, so <em>habeas corpus</em> was better for them. A fourth reason was time. The  process under the Act took weeks, and so by the time it got to a judge it was  often too late. <em>Habeas corpus</em> could  happen quickly, and a judge could order the person released right away if they  were being held illegally, which was obviously better for them. The majority said  the judge should have heard Mr. Chhina\u2019s application. This case was \u201cmoot\u201d by the time it reached the  Supreme Court, meaning it didn\u2019t matter for practical purposes. This was  because Mr. Chhina had already been deported and wasn\u2019t detained anymore. The  Court decided to hear the case anyway because the issues were so important."

The Decree sets out minimum\nstandards in the workplace, including wages, hours of work, holidays and\novertime, and is governed by the Act respecting collective agreement decrees.\nThe Act makes the Comit\u00e9 paritaire de l\u2019entretien d\u2019\u00e9difices publics de la\nr\u00e9gion de Qu\u00e9bec (\u201cCommittee\u201d) responsible for overseeing compliance with the\nDecree, and it can therefore take any necessary action arising from the Decree\non behalf of employees.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\n2014, the Committee commenced proceedings against Modern Cleaning Concept Inc.,\nclaiming $9,219.32 in unpaid wages and other benefits in relation to cleaning\nservices performed by B. Modern provides cleaning and maintenance services in\nthe Quebec region through a network of franchises. It negotiates master\ncleaning contracts with clients, and assigns them for specific locations to its\nfranchisees, who perform the cleaning and maintenance work. B became a\nfranchisee in January 2014, agreeing to perform cleaning services exclusively\nthrough the franchise relationship. After five months of working within the\nModern network, B terminated his franchise agreement. The Committee\ninvestigated the relationship between B and Modern. It was of the view that the\nlanguage of the franchise agreement was not determinative of the reality of the\nrelationship between B and Modern, and that B was in fact an \u201cemployee\u201d as\ndefined by the Act, not an independent contractor. He was therefore entitled to\nbe paid the mandatory wages and benefits set out in the Decree.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ntrial judge concluded that there was a common intention that B would be an\nindependent contractor, not an employee. Accordingly, B was not entitled to the\namount claimed by the Committee on his behalf. Allowing the appeal, a majority\nin the Court of Appeal was of the view that the trial judge made a palpable and\noverriding error in failing to consider the nature of the assignments of the\ncleaning contracts from Modern to B, and that by failing to recognize that\nModern remained contractually liable to its clients, the trial judge erred in\nhis analysis of whether B was an employee or an independent contractor. The\nmajority concluded that B was an employee and ordered Modern to pay the\n$9,219.32 claimed by the Committee on behalf of B.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon and Martin JJ.: The\ntrial judge\u2019s failure to consider the tripartite nature of Modern\u2019s business\nmodel was a palpable and overriding error warranting appellate intervention.\nThis error caused the trial judge to err in his assessment of whether B was an\nemployee or an independent contractor. B is an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of\nthe Act and Modern is correspondingly a \u201cprofessional employer\u201d. The mandatory\nprovisions of the Act and Decree therefore govern the relationship between\nModern and B, and B is entitled to the wages and benefits claimed on his behalf\nby the Committee.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nDecree can apply to any contract in which one can conclude that an\nindividual is in a relationship determined to be that of \u201cemployee\u201d within the\nmeaning of the Act. Workers may be considered employees for the purposes of the\nAct and Decree even if they would not be considered employees pursuant\nto other laws of Quebec. The fact that the franchise agreement\nidentifies B as a franchisee is not determinative. Nor is the fact that he is\nidentified as an independent contractor with Modern. The Decree can\napply to relationships other than those governed by employment contracts. The\npresence of a franchise agreement cannot function to disguise the true nature\nof the relationship between an employee and professional employer as those\nterms are defined in the Act. To the extent that the reality of the\nrelationship between the parties reveals that a franchisee did not in fact assume\nthe business risk and had no meaningful opportunity to make a profit, he or she\nis an employee and that relationship is subject to the Decree.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Modern\u2019s\nbusiness structure must be examined as a whole to determine who assumed the\nbusiness risk and attendant prospect of making a profit. The business\nrelationship in this case was tripartite: the client requesting cleaning\nservices, the franchisor Modern who guarantees the quality and provision of\nservices, and the franchisee who actually performs them. In the cleaning\nservice agreements between Modern and its clients, the clients consented in\nadvance to the assignment of the cleaning contracts to franchisees, but Modern\nremained liable to its clients if the cleaning services were not delivered in\naccordance with the contract between Modern and its client. By failing to\nconsider the tripartite relationship, the trial judge did not consider the\nbusiness as a whole, and, as a result, improperly concluded that B bore the\nbusiness risk and was therefore not an employee. Because of its tripartite\nbusiness model and ongoing liability to its clients, Modern placed extensive\ncontrols on B. B did not assume the business risk and therefore it cannot be\nsaid that he was an independent contractor, making him an employee under the\nAct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe JJ.\n(dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the trial judge\u2019s decision\nrestored. The trial judge made no reviewable error in concluding that B was not\nan employee within the meaning of the Act, because the fact that the\nassignments of contracts between Modern and B were imperfect did not\nsignificantly affect the business risk assumed by B. Furthermore, even if it\nwere assumed that B was an employee, Modern could not have been considered to\nbe his professional employer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ndetermination of B\u2019s status under the Act raises a question of mixed fact and\nlaw, since it involves applying a legal test\u00a0\u2014 specifically the business\nrisk test\u00a0\u2014 to the facts of the case. Unless an exception applies, the\nstandard for intervention in respect of questions of mixed fact and law is that\nof palpable and overriding error, which is a highly deferential standard. If no\npalpable and overriding error is properly established, this Court must restore\nthe trial judge\u2019s decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nAct provides for the juridical extension of a collective agreement, by means of\na government decree, so that it binds all employees and employers working in a\nspecific field of activity. The Act\u2019s purpose is to guarantee minimum\nconditions of employment and to prevent abuses in the industries concerned.\nWhether the conditions provided for in a decree apply to a worker must be\ndetermined by first considering (1)\u00a0whether the worker is an employee\nwithin the meaning of the Act and, if so, (2)\u00a0whether he or she is within\nthe scope determined in the decree. It is then necessary to identify a debtor\nbound by the decree, that is, a professional employer that employs the employee\ncovered by the scope of application of the decree.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nconcept of employee in the Act is broader than it is under the Civil Code\nbecause of the inclusion of the term \u201cartisan\u201d in the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d\nin the Act. Unlike an employee within the meaning of the Civil Code, an\nartisan is not, in any true sense, subordinate to an employer in the performance\nof his or her work. Generally speaking, an artisan is a natural person who does\nmanual work on his or her own account, alone or with the help of family\nmembers, journeypersons, workers or apprentices. An artisan will generally be a\ncontractor in the civil law. The legal subordination that distinguishes a\ncontract of employment and a contract of enterprise within the meaning of the Civil\nCode is not essential to the status of employee under the Act. An artisan\nwho is a contractor \u2014 and not an employee \u2014 within the meaning of the Civil\nCode may therefore be considered to be an employee to whom the Act applies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However,\nnot every contractor who personally, on his or her own account, performs manual\nwork to which a decree applies is necessarily an artisan within the meaning of\nthe Act. There are some contractors who prima facie fit the definition\nof an artisan but to whom the Act does not apply because their activities are\norganized with a view to making a profit and, as a corollary, involve a business\nrisk. This business risk must go beyond the risk that any artisan assumes, such\nas the risk of defective work tools or inefficient work methods. Further, the\ncourt must ask whether the worker intended \u2014 in fact and in light of the\nevidence \u2014 to accept a real business risk in order to make a profit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nassessing the business risk test, the court must consider a series of factors.\nThe relevant secondary factors include ownership of the work tools, the method\nof remuneration and the degree of freedom in the performance of the work, to\nthe extent that these factors reflect the risk assumed. The terms of the\ncontracts entered into by the worker and his or her clients or business\npartners are relevant but not in themselves determinative. The business risk test\nremains the same regardless of whether the contractual relationship in issue is\nbipartite or tripartite in nature, including in the context of a franchise\nagreement. In each case, the purpose of the analysis is simply to determine\nwhether the worker assumes a business risk. It is not a matter of establishing\nwhich party to a contract assumes the business risk, as if there could\nbe only one risk. The parties each incur such risks at the same time.\nFundamentally, the level of risk assumed by the party performing the work is\nwhat determines whether that party can be characterized as an artisan within\nthe meaning of the Act, regardless of the fact that another party also incurs a\nbusiness risk, for example by assuming liability for the same contractual obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nfact that the assignments of contracts were imperfect affected B\u2019s business\nrisk only to a limited extent, if at all. In the instant case, failure to deal\nwith this aspect was not a palpable and overriding error. In the absence of\nsuch an error, the conclusions reached by the trial judge cannot be called into\nquestion. Despite the tripartite relationship among Modern, B and their\nclients, it was open to the trial judge to find that B had assumed a business\nrisk in order to make a profit and that he was not an \u201cemployee\u201d for the\npurposes of the Act. That conclusion is entitled to deference.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nfranchise agreement cannot function to disguise the reality of a relationship\nbetween an employee and an employer, as those terms are defined in the Act. The\ntrial judge shared this concern in the instant case. Far from relying blindly\non the terms of the agreement, he rendered his decision on the basis of\nextensive evidence concerning the reality of the relationship between B and\nModern.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore,\nnot every person who has work to which a decree applies done by an \u201cemployee\u201d\ncan, on that basis alone, be treated as a professional employer and be required\nto assume the obligations that flow from that status. There are \u201cemployees\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the Act who quite simply do not have a professional\nemployer. For a \u201cprofessional employer\u201d to be required to meet the obligations\nprovided for in a decree, the work must be done in the context of a\nrelationship that is sufficiently similar to an employment relationship within\nthe meaning of the Civil Code, which is to say that a certain degree of\ncontrol or economic dependence is required. Here, even if it is assumed that\nthe concept of \u201cprofessional employer\u201d has a meaning broader than that of an\nemployer under the Civil Code, the franchise agreement does not readily\nsupport a conclusion that Modern was subject to the Decree, since the\nsupervision it exercised did not suffice to characterize it as a professional\nemployer. Modern\u2019s powers as a franchisor cannot be confused with the\nrelationship of subordination that characterizes a contract of employment.

        "summary": "<strong>The actual relationship\u2014not the words in a contract\u2014will  determine whether someone is an employee, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Modern Cleaning Concept offered  cleaning services. It signed contracts with clients and managed the business,  but hired cleaners (which it called \u201cfranchisees\u201d) to do the actual cleaning. Clients  got bills from Modern Cleaning Concept, not from the cleaners. Mr. Bourque had his own  part-time cleaning business in the Quebec City area. His spouse helped him with  cleaning jobs. In 2014, he became one of Modern Cleaning Concept\u2019s cleaners.  The agreement said Mr. Bourque was an independent contractor and had full  control over his business. But it also said Modern Cleaning Concept had a lot  of control over him. Mr. Bourque had to report any complaints right away, and  fire an employee if the company or a client asked. He had to report any new possibilities  for cleaning contracts, so the company could sign the client. Modern Cleaning  Concept paid Mr. Bourque directly, and would deduct amounts he owed under the agreement.  This could be up to 43% of what he earned. After five months, Mr.  Bourque left because he couldn\u2019t build his business or make profits. He ended the  agreement and went back to his own business. In the Quebec City area,  employees cleaning public buildings are covered by a collective agreement. This  is called the <em>Decree respecting building  service employees in the Qu\u00e9bec region</em>. \u201cEmployee\u201d is defined in the <em>Act respecting collective agreement decrees</em>.  It doesn\u2019t include independent contractors. The <em>Comit\u00e9 paritaire de l\u2019entretien d\u2019\u00e9difices publics de la r\u00e9gion de  Qu\u00e9bec</em> (the Committee) makes sure the Decree is followed.  The Committee looked at Mr.  Bourque\u2019s situation. His agreement with Modern Cleaning Concept said he was an  independent contractor. But the Committee thought he was really an employee. This  would mean the company owed Mr. Bourque and his spouse over $9,000 in unpaid  wages and benefits. It took the claim to court on their behalf. The trial judge said Mr.  Bourque was an independent contractor. But the majority at the Court of Appeal  said he was an employee. It said the trial judge should have thought more about  the company\u2019s business model. It said the way three different parties (Modern  Cleaning Concept, its clients, and Mr. Bourque) were tied together was  important to deciding this case. The majority at the Supreme Court agreed with the  Court of Appeal. It said that to  decide if someone is an independent contractor or an employee really depends on  the specific facts. Independent contractors are more like businesses. They take  on business risks in order to make profits. Employees don\u2019t. Looking at the  contract with the client and the agreement with Mr. Bourque, it was clear that Modern  Cleaning Concept kept the risk and the chance to profit. It was responsible to  its clients for making sure the work got done. It was rewarded for taking this  risk, with up to 43% of Mr. Bourque\u2019s earnings. It controlled him closely with  the conditions set out in its agreement with him. Because of these  restrictions, Mr. Bourque couldn\u2019t really build his business or make a profit.  That meant he was an employee.  In  this case, a person was found to be an employee under a specific law (the <em>Act respecting collective agreement decrees</em>).  Someone can be considered an employee under one law (for example, the Act) but  not another (for example, employment insurance legislation). Each situation  depends on its own facts."

        "summary": "<strong>If someone has sexual conversations with a child they  don\u2019t know online, they can\u2019t expect their messages to stay private from the  police, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   In 2012, a police officer created fake Facebook and  Hotmail accounts pretending to be \u201cLeann,\u201d a 14-year-old girl. Mr. Mills  contacted \u201cLeann.\u201d He was 32, but pretended to be 23. Over the next two months,  he sent \u201cLeann\u201d several messages and emails, including a photo of his penis.  Police used software to take screenshots of all the communications. Eventually,  Mr. Mills asked to meet \u201cLeann\u201d in a public park. He was arrested and charged  with child luring. This is the crime of talking to an underage person online (or  using a cellphone) to try to take advantage of them sexually. During his trial, Mr. Mills argued that police weren\u2019t  allowed to run the undercover operation that led to his arrest. He said they  needed a judge\u2019s permission. He said they breached his <em>Charter </em>right to privacy because they didn\u2019t have permission.  Because of the breach, he said the evidence shouldn\u2019t be allowed in court. This  would mean his conversations with \u201cLeann\u201d couldn\u2019t be looked at. Privacy rights are found in Section 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter  is part of Canada\u2019s Constitution</em>. Section 8 says that \u201ceveryone has  the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\u201d This means the  state can\u2019t search or take something private without permission. To show a  breach of privacy rights, a person has to show that they should have been able  to expect something would be kept private. This is called a \u201creasonable  expectation of privacy.\u201d Part of this is subjective (that is, the person  actually thinks the thing should be private). Part of it is objective (that is,  most other people would agree it should be private). The state can still search  or take something someone reasonably expects to be private. But it has to have  permission. Permission can be from a judge (like a warrant). It can also be  given if the law directly says so. \u00a0  In this case, the police said it wasn\u2019t reasonable  for Mr. Mills to expect his conversations with \u201cLeann\u201d would be kept private. They  said they didn\u2019t need permission to run the undercover operation or to  screen-capture the conversations. The trial judge agreed with Mr. Mills that police  should have had a judge\u2019s permission to do some things. The judge said it was okay  for the police officer who posed as \u201cLeann\u201d to capture their conversations on  Facebook and Hotmail. But using software to save screen-caps of the  conversation was an additional step. They should have gotten permission to do  this. But the judge said the evidence should be allowed anyway, and Mr. Mills  was found guilty. The Court of Appeal said the police didn\u2019t need a judge\u2019s  permission. It said Mr. Mills couldn\u2019t expect privacy when he was messaging a  child he didn\u2019t know.  All the  judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Mr. Mills should be found guilty.  The majority said that Mr. Mills didn\u2019t have a  reasonable expectation of privacy. He couldn\u2019t have expected that his messages  would be kept private when he was talking to a child he didn\u2019t know. (If he did  know the child, then the conversations might be private.) In this case, the  police knew for sure Mr. Mills didn\u2019t know \u201cLeann,\u201d because they invented her.  That meant there was no chance of a privacy breach. There was no reason a judge  shouldn\u2019t look at the messages Mr. Mills sent to \u201cLeann\u201d to decide if he was  guilty. This case involved online messages, but the majority said text messages  would also be treated the same when it comes to privacy rights. All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed courts shouldn\u2019t  just look at whether something is <em>actually </em>private. (Just because something is exposed doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t private  anymore.) Instead, they should look at what a person<em> ought</em> to be able to expect to be private in our society. Most  judges agreed it isn\u2019t reasonable to expect this kind of conversation would be  kept private. The Court decided  two other cases involving privacy rights in the months before this one: <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/37676-eng.aspx\">R. v. Reeves</a></em> in December 2018 and <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37833-eng.aspx\">R.  v. Jarvis</a></em> in February 2019. It decided another case about child  luring, <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37687-eng.aspx\">R. v. Morrison</a></em>,  in March 2019. "

W was entitled to two\nlevels of internal review, both of which were unsuccessful. Having exhausted\nhis internal remedies, W brought a Request for Directions (\u201cRFD\u201d) to a\nsupervising judge, pursuant to the Agreement. The supervising judge found\nerrors in the adjudicator\u2019s interpretation of the IAP warranting judicial\nintervention and remitted W\u2019s claim for re\u2011adjudication. A\nreconsideration adjudicator allowed W\u2019s claim, and awarded him compensation.\nBefore the reconsideration decision was implemented, Canada appealed the\nsupervising judge\u2019s decision.

This does not permit a court to imply a term which is contrary to the\nparties\u2019 clearly expressed intentions. Straining to find a gap in the Agreement\nso as to open space for judicial recourse where the parties clearly intended to\npreclude it defeats the intentions of the parties and undermines the integrity\nof the process that they settled upon. Merely because the Agreement does not\ncontain certain terms does not mean that there is a gap waiting to be filled by\njudges. There is a difference between failing to grant authority and deciding\nnot to grant such authority. A review of the Agreement reveals that the absence\nof a term authorizing the Chief Adjudicator to reopen claims clearly represents\nan instance of the latter. In addition, the Chief Adjudicator\u2019s concession in\nthis case does not expose any gap in the Agreement, much less any basis for\njudicial intervention to fill it. In any event, the Chief Adjudicator did not\nclearly agree that such a gap existed here. The denial of compensation to W was\nnot the result of any gap which required judicial recourse so as to reopen the\nclaim; instead, it resulted from the Chief Adjudicator failing to properly\ndischarge his final review obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Explained:\nR. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0judge had the power to step in when a man\u2019s claim was wrongly denied  under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Canada is  still coming to terms with a terrible part of its history. From the 1860s to  the 1990s, over 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis children were taken  from their homes. They were put in boarding schools called \u201cIndian Residential  Schools.\u201d The schools were set up and run by the federal government and  churches together. Many students were physically, sexually, and  psychologically abused there.  Years  later, many of these former students sued for the harms they suffered. They  sued the federal government, churches, and others. The Indian Residential  Schools Settlement Agreement, signed in 2006, settled the lawsuits. This  agreement did many things. It set out a way toward national healing, education,  and reconciliation through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. It also set  out ways for people who were harmed to ask for compensation. One of these ways  was through the Independent Assessment Process (IAP).  The IAP  decides what kind of compensation someone should get for specific harm that  they suffered. IAP decisions are made by adjudicators (decision-makers who  aren\u2019t judges). Each province and territory has a \u201csupervising judge\u201d to  oversee how the Settlement Agreement is applied. This is to make sure people get  the compensation and benefits they bargained for. The issue in this case was  whether a judge was allowed to intervene in an adjudicator\u2019s decision. JW went  to a residential school as a young boy. While he was waiting to have a shower,  a nun grabbed his private parts over his clothes. He asked for compensation for  this harm through the IAP. But the decision-maker denied his claim. She said JW  had to prove the nun meant her touch to be sexual. JW asked two IAP  reviewers to look at the decision. They both agreed with the first decision-maker\u2019s  conclusion. JW asked  the supervising judge in Manitoba to look at his case. The judge agreed with JW  that the reviewers had failed to apply the agreement, and said the case should  be heard again by a new decision-maker. This new decision-maker agreed with JW  that he had been sexually abused and said he should be compensated. But before JW  was paid, the federal government appealed the judge\u2019s decision. It said the judge  didn\u2019t have the power to give his own interpretation of the Settlement  Agreement. The Court of Appeal agreed, saying the judge only had the power to look  at whether the IAP decision-maker considered the correct parts of the agreement.  It restored the original decision, which denied JW\u2019s claim. The seven  judges who heard this case at the Supreme Court split three ways. Five judges came  to the same conclusion, but for different reasons. They agreed that JW should  get the benefits the Settlement Agreement promised him. They said that the new  decision-maker\u2019s decision should stand, and JW should receive compensation. The Settlement  Agreement is meant to help Canada come to terms with the damage caused by the  Indian Residential Schools policy. Resolving cases like JW\u2019s is an important  part of this process.

        "summary": "<strong>In  Ontario, businesses can\u2019t get out of arbitration agreements by joining class  action lawsuits with consumers, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   When a large group of people have the same legal  problem, they might decide to get together and sue as a group. This is called a  \u201cclass action\u201d lawsuit. (The \u201cclass\u201d is the group, so it\u2019s a group action.) A  class action lets the whole group get their complaint dealt with in court at  once. Otherwise, each person would have to go to court on their own. Before a  class action can go ahead, a court needs to \u201ccertify\u201d (approve) it. Mr. Wellman had a cellphone contract with TELUS. He  said that, for a certain time, TELUS rounded up calls to the next minute  without telling customers. He said customers were overcharged and not given  their full number of minutes. He asked the court to certify a class action  against TELUS on behalf of himself and about two million other customers in  Ontario. About 1.4 million of these customers were consumers (who bought cell  services for personal use). The rest were business customers (who bought  services for business use). Mr. Wellman was asking for over $500 million in  damages on behalf of the group. All of TELUS\u2019s customers agreed to standard terms and  conditions when they signed up. One of these terms was that billing disagreements  had to be decided in \u201carbitration.\u201d Arbitration is when a neutral third party (other  than a judge or a court) decides a legal dispute. Businesses often use it  because it can be more efficient and less costly than going to court. In Ontario, arbitration rules are set out in the <em>Arbitration Act</em>. One of the Act\u2019s main  principles is that people who agree to go to arbitration should have to live up  to their agreement. There are some exceptions, like when the agreement isn\u2019t valid. One exception is for consumers. The Ontario <em>Consumer Protection Act</em> says consumers can  join a class action like Mr. Wellman\u2019s even if they agreed to arbitration.  Because of this, everyone agreed that the consumers could ask for compensation  in court. But business customers weren\u2019t covered by the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em>. TELUS said this meant they should be held  to their agreement to go to arbitration. It asked the court to \u201cstay\u201d the  claims of the business customers, or stop them from going forward in court. The main issue in this case was how to interpret section  7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em>. Mr.  Wellman said the section meant courts could decide to let a claim go to court,  even if it was covered by an arbitration agreement. He said this could happen  if it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to separate claims covered by the agreement (like  the business customer claims) from claims that weren\u2019t (like the consumer  claims). For him, that meant that <em>both</em> groups should be allowed to ask for compensation in court. TELUS, on the other  hand, said courts <em>had to</em> stay claims covered  by valid arbitration agreements. It said courts could let claims <em>not</em> covered by an agreement go to court.  But claims that <em>were</em> covered (in this  case, the business customer claims) had to be stayed.  Both the motions judge and the Court of Appeal agreed  with Mr. Wellman. They said the business customers could join the class action. The majority at the Supreme Court disagreed. It said section  7(5) didn\u2019t allow the court to refuse to stay claims dealt with in a valid  arbitration agreement. Otherwise, the principle that people should respect  their agreements would be weakened. People would be able to avoid their agreements  just by piggybacking on, or joining their claims to, those of people who <em>weren\u2019t</em> bound to go to arbitration. The  majority noted that the only dispute in this class action was about billing. All  customers agreed this would be dealt with through arbitration. Normally, this  would mean everyone\u2019s claims in the class action would be stayed. It would not  be heard in court at all. But because of the exception in the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em>, consumers were  protected from a stay. Their claims could still be heard. Business customers  weren\u2019t covered by the exception, so they had to respect their agreement. Their  claims were stayed, and they would have to go to arbitration instead. This decision didn\u2019t  deal with Mr. Wellman\u2019s claim that TELUS overbilled its customers. It only  decided that the business customers weren\u2019t allowed to go to court to argue  that."

He sought bail for the first time in\nrespect of these charges on November\u00a09,\u00a02016, but his application was\ndismissed, as the judge was not satisfied that any terms of release would\nadequately address the risk that M would, if released, commit other offences or\ninterfere with the administration of justice. Later that month, M sought a review\nof his detention order under s.\u00a0520 of the Criminal Code, which was\ndenied on the basis that the judge saw no significant change that would justify\nreleasing M. In March 2017, Crown counsel asked the defence whether M wished to\npursue a 90\u2011day bail review under s.\u00a0525 of the Criminal Code.\nGiven the existence of competing lines of authority, the British Columbia\nSupreme Court heard submissions from both parties on the correct approach to\nthe review under s.\u00a0525. It concluded that the correct test at a s.\u00a0525\nhearing involves a two\u2011step process: the accused must first convince the\nreviewing judge either that there has been an unreasonable delay in the\nproceedings on the Crown\u2019s part or that the passage of time has had a material\nimpact on the initial basis for detaining the accused, and, if either of these\nthresholds is met, the judge must then determine whether the detention of the\naccused remains justified within the meaning of s.\u00a0515(10) of the Criminal\nCode. Because of the formulation of the test, M made no submissions and his\ndetention order was confirmed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 M pled guilty on January\u00a029,\n2018 to reduced charges and was sentenced to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment. Since M\nis no longer in pre\u2011trial custody, his appeal to the Court is moot;\nhowever, as guidance is needed to establish the correct approach to a detention\nreview hearing under s.\u00a0525 of the Criminal Code, the Court\nexercised its discretion to hear the appeal on the merits.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the Court must apply\nthe principles of statutory interpretation to determine the correct approach to\na detention review under s.\u00a0525, and to explain the place of such a review\nwithin the larger context of pre\u2011trial custody in Canada. In Canadian\nlaw, the pre\u2011trial release of accused persons is the cardinal rule and\ndetention, the exception. Yet practices vary widely in terms of when\ns.\u00a0525 detention review hearings happen, whether they are mandatory, what\nfactors are considered and which test is applied.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The purpose of the s.\u00a0525\nhearing is to prevent accused persons from languishing in pre\u2011trial\ncustody and to ensure a prompt trial. Parliament sought to achieve this purpose\nby subjecting lengthy pre\u2011trial detentions to judicial oversight at set\npoints in time, by affording an opportunity to have a judge consider whether\nthe continued detention of an accused person is justified, and by conferring on\nthe judge a discretion to expedite the trial of an individual in pre\u2011trial\ndetention. The right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause, which\nis enshrined in s.\u00a011(e) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms, operates as a key organizing principle of Part XVI of the Criminal\nCode. Release is favoured at the earliest reasonable opportunity and on the\nleast onerous grounds. The experience of pre\u2011trial detention can have\nserious detrimental impacts on an accused person\u2019s ability to raise a defence.\nIt also comes at a significant cost in terms of their loss of liberty, the\nimpact on their mental and physical well\u2011being and on their families, and\nthe loss of their livelihoods. Parliament intended s.\u00a0525 to operate as a\nsafeguard. This section imposes an independent responsibility on the reviewing\njudge to consider whether the continued detention of the accused is justified,\nand establishes a discretionary mechanism designed to prevent unreasonable\ndelay and to expedite the trials of individuals in remand.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The correct approach to the\ns.\u00a0525 detention review is as follows. First, the jailer has an obligation\nto apply for the detention review hearing immediately upon the expiration of 90\ndays following the day on which the accused was initially taken before a\njustice under s.\u00a0503 of the Criminal Code. Where there is an\nintervening detention order under s.\u00a0520, 521 or 524 of the Criminal\nCode following the initial appearance of the accused and before the end of\nthe 90\u2011day period, the 90\u2011day period begins again. Accused persons\nwho have not had a full bail hearing are also entitled to a review under\ns.\u00a0525, since the fundamental purpose of s.\u00a0525 is to afford an\nopportunity to have a judge scrutinize the detention itself, and these\nindividuals should not be denied that safeguard. Upon receiving the application\nfrom the jailer, the judge must fix a date and give notice for the hearing. The\ns.\u00a0525 hearing is an automatic procedure, and the mandatory obligations to\nmake the application and to fix a date lie with the jailer and the judge\nrespectively. Form letters that place the burden on the accused to pursue a\ns.\u00a0525 hearing are inconsistent with the law. The hearing must be held at\nthe earliest opportunity. At the hearing, the reviewing judge may refer to the\ntranscript, exhibits and reasons from any initial judicial interim release\nhearing and from any subsequent review hearings, and should show respect for\nany findings of fact made by the first\u2011level decision maker if there is\nno cause to interfere with them. Both parties are also entitled to make\nsubmissions on the basis of any additional credible or trustworthy information\nwhich is relevant or material to the judge\u2019s analysis, and pre\u2011existing\nmaterial is subject to the criteria of due diligence and relevance.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the hearing, unreasonable delay\nis not a threshold that must be met before the detention of the accused is\nreviewed. Parliament did not intend to restrict the court\u2019s ability to review\nthe detention of an accused at a s.\u00a0525 hearing to situations in which\nthere has already been an unreasonable delay. The overarching question is only\nwhether the continued detention of the accused in custody is justified within\nthe meaning of s.\u00a0515(10), which sets out three possible grounds on which\nthe detention of an accused in custody may be justified: where it is necessary\nin order to ensure the attendance of the accused in court; where it is necessary\nfor the protection or safety of the public; and where it is necessary in order\nto maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. In determining\nwhether the detention of the accused is still justified, the reviewing judge\nmay consider any new evidence or change in the circumstances of the accused,\nthe impact of the passage of time and any unreasonable delay on the\nproportionality of the detention, and the rationale offered for the original\ndetention order, if one was made. If there was no initial bail hearing, the\ns.\u00a0525 judge is responsible for conducting one, taking into account the\ntime the accused has already spent in pre\u2011trial custody. Ultimately,\ns.\u00a0525 requires a reviewing judge to provide accused persons with reasons\nwhy their continued detention is \u2014 or is not \u2014 justified. Finally, the judge\nshould make use of his or her discretion under ss.\u00a0525(9) and 526 to give\ndirections for expediting the trial and related proceedings where it is\nappropriate to do so. Directions should be given with a view to mitigating the\nrisk of unconstitutional delay and expediting the trials of accused persons who\nare subject to lengthy pre\u2011trial detention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Judges have to make sure that people put in jail while  they wait for trial really need to be there, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     When someone is charged with a crime, they are presumed innocent until  proven guilty in court. This is why after an arrest, an accused person is  normally released on bail to wait for their trial. However, in special  situations, a judge may decide to keep the person in jail after their arrest.  This is called \u201cremand\u201d or \u201cpre-trial detention.\u201d A person can be put in  pre-trial detention because it\u2019s the only way to make sure they show up for  court, to keep the public safe, or to protect public confidence in the justice  system. Even if a person is eventually found guilty, the presumption of  innocence means that pre-trial detention is supposed to be a last resort. In Canada, many people are kept in jail while waiting for their trials.  On any given day, about half of people in jail in Canada are waiting for their  trial and have not been found guilty. Being in jail makes it harder for them to  defend themselves. People kept in jail before trial may be more likely to plead  guilty. Being in jail also affects their mental and physical well-being, family  life, and jobs. A judge is supposed to look at the situation 90 days after the  person was ordered to go to pre-trial detention. Mr. Myers was arrested in January 2016 and charged  with several crimes, including some firearms crimes. He had been found guilty  of other crimes before, and was on probation when he was arrested. He stayed in  jail to finish that previous sentence. But by October, the only reason he was  in custody was because of his new charges from January. He asked for bail for  the first time in November 2016. The bail judge didn\u2019t think the conditions  suggested by Mr. Myers\u2019 lawyer were enough to protect the public, and said no. Mr.  Myers was supposed to get a detention review after 90 days, but waited many  months longer. The new judge said he could only release Mr. Myers if there was  unreasonable delay or some change in his situation. Mr. Myers didn\u2019t make any  arguments in response, so he wasn\u2019t released. But he appealed, saying the judge\u2019s  approach to the law was wrong. (Most cases get appealed to a court of appeal,  but courts of appeal don\u2019t have the power to look at bail review decisions. So  Mr. Myers had to appeal directly to the Supreme Court of Canada.) The problem was that courts across Canada didn\u2019t agree how 90-day detention  reviews worked. Some said a person could only be released if their case was  taking too long (if there was an \u201cunreasonable delay\u201d). Others said someone  could be released even if there wasn\u2019t an unreasonable delay. Some people  thought that anyone who didn\u2019t have a bail hearing when they were first  arrested didn\u2019t have a right to a review. Others said everyone should get a review,  no matter how they came to be in custody.  The Supreme Court unanimously said these detention reviews are  automatic. The jail or the prosecutor must apply for a hearing 90 days after the  last order putting (or keeping) the person in custody. The judge then has to  schedule a review hearing as soon as possible. The only question the judge has  to decide is whether keeping the person in jail is legally necessary to make  sure they attend trial, to keep the public safe, or to protect public  confidence in the justice system. Delay is just one thing a judge can look at. But  delays don\u2019t necessarily have to be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d What matters is the effect keeping  the person in jail would have on them, now or in the future. For example, a judge  should consider whether the person will spend longer in pre-trial detention than  their sentence would be if they were found guilty. After hearing from both sides,  the judge has to give the person a decision about why they have to stay in jail  (or why they can leave, with or without conditions).  The Court said that judges have special obligations to  make sure detention is justified and that trials are on track. Many accused  people don\u2019t have lawyers, and so judges have to take extra care to make sure  things are fair. Judges can make orders to speed up trials, especially when  people are held in pre-trial detention. "

        "summary": "<strong>Part of the <em>Criminal Code</em> section dealing with child luring is  unconstitutional because it violates the presumption of innocence, the Supreme  Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>        It\u2019s a crime to talk to an underage person online (or  using a cellphone) to try to take advantage of them sexually. It\u2019s also a crime  if you <em>believe</em> they\u2019re underage, even  if they\u2019re actually not. This is called \u201cchild luring.\u201d  Mr. Morrison posted an ad online. Part of the ad\u2019s  title was \u201cDaddy  looking for his little girl.\u201d A police officer pretending to be a 14-year-old  girl named \u201cMia\u201d responded. Mr. Morrison and \u201cMia\u201d had sexual conversations online  for over two months. He asked \u201cMia\u201d to touch herself sexually. He also said she  should skip school so they could meet and engage in sexual acts. He was charged  with child luring. During  his trial, Mr. Morrison said he thought he was talking to an adult woman who  was just pretending to be 14. He also argued that three important points in the  child luring section of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> violated his rights under the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. (The <em>Charter </em>is part of Canada\u2019s constitution.) First, the <em>Criminal Code</em> said that if someone told someone else they were  underage, the law presumed the person believed it. The only exception was if  there was evidence that the person <em>didn\u2019t</em> believe it. Mr. Morrison said this violated his right to be presumed innocent.  Before anyone can be found guilty of a crime, a judge or jury has to believe  that the person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The right to be presumed  innocent is violated whenever a law lets someone be found guilty even though  there is a reasonable doubt. The law presumed Mr. Morrison believed \u201cMia\u201d when  she said she was 14, even though there could be other explanations. Second, the <em>Criminal  Code </em>said a person <em>wouldn\u2019t</em> be  found guilty if they honestly believed that the other person was of legal age,  even if that belief was wrong. But they could only use this as a defence if  they took \u201creasonable steps\u201d to find out how old the other person really was. Mr.  Morrison said this violated basic principles of justice. This was because he  could be found guilty simply for not taking \u201creasonable steps\u201d to find out \u201cMia\u2019s\u201d  real age. Third, for the most serious cases, the <em>Criminal Code </em>set out a \u201cmandatory  minimum sentence\u201d of one year. The judge couldn\u2019t lower it, even if it would be  too harsh in the circumstances. Mr. Morrison said this violated his right to be  free from cruel and unusual punishment. The  trial judge agreed that the first point violated Mr. Morrison\u2019s right to be  presumed innocent. But he found Mr. Morrison guilty anyway, because he didn\u2019t  take reasonable steps to find out how old \u201cMia\u201d really was. He agreed, though,  that the mandatory minimum sentence violated the <em>Charter</em>, and ordered a shorter sentence. The Court of Appeal  agreed. All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that the first  point violated the right to be presumed innocent. Just because someone is told  something online doesn\u2019t mean they believe it. People don\u2019t always tell the truth.  Yet the law\u2019s presumption meant that someone could be found guilty even if the  judge or jury had a reasonable doubt about whether they believed the other  person was underage. This violated the presumption of innocence. Most of the judges agreed that the \u201creasonable steps\u201d requirement  didn\u2019t violate the <em>Charter</em>. But they  said the lower courts misinterpreted it. Mr. Morrison could try to defend  himself by saying he honestly believed \u201cMia\u201d was of legal age. To succeed,  though, he had to show evidence that he took reasonable steps to find out how  old she really was. But simply proving Mr. Morrison didn\u2019t take reasonable  steps wasn\u2019t, on its own, enough to find him guilty. The Crown (the  prosecution) still had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Morrison <em>believed</em> \u201cMia\u201d was underage. The majority didn\u2019t decide either way whether the  mandatory minimum sentence violated the <em>Charter</em>.  The lower courts misunderstood how the law worked, and this misunderstanding  wasn\u2019t a good basis to decide this.  Most of the judges agreed there should be a new trial  because of the trial judge\u2019s mistakes. Two previous Supreme  Court cases dealt with the child luring section of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. But this was the first time the Court looked at whether  it violated the <em>Charter</em>."

Over the course of those four years, the lawyer\nrepeatedly endorsed the recommended advisor as a financial advisor and\nencouraged his clients to make and retain investments with the investment firm.\nIn 2007, the recommended advisor and his associate disappeared with the savings\nof around 100 investors, including those of the lawyer\u2019s clients. The\nclients instituted legal proceedings, claiming that the lawyer and his law firm\nwere professionally negligent in two ways: first by breaching their duty to\nadvise them and second, by disregarding their duty of loyalty to them. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ntrial judge dismissed the claim. The Court of Appeal concluded that the\ntrial judge had made reviewable errors, and it reversed her judgment. In its\nopinion, the trial judge had viewed the lawyer\u2019s acts and their consequences\nthrough a distorting lens which had led her to erroneously assess the evidence\nin isolated silos, without the insight provided by a global analysis. The Court\nof Appeal ordered the lawyer and his law firm solidarily to fully compensate\nthe clients for their losses. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be\ndismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon, Brown,\nRowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The Court of Appeal had a sufficient basis for\nintervening and reversing the trial judge\u2019s decision. It properly applied the\nstandards of appellate review, as imposed by Housen v. Nikolaisen,\n2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. The professional liability of the lawyer and\nthe law firm for the clients\u2019 losses has been established.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Findings with respect to fault involve questions of mixed fact and\nlaw and findings with respect to causation, questions\nof fact. In both situations, absent a palpable and overriding error, an appellate\ncourt must defer to the conclusions reached by the trial judge. It can only\nintervene if there is an obvious error in the trial decision that is\ndeterminative of the outcome of the case. The fact that an alternative factual\nfinding could be reached based on a different ascription of weight does not\nmean that a palpable and overriding error has been made. An appellate court\nmust identify a crucial flaw in the lower court\u2019s decision, and a\ndistorting lens, that is, a lens through which a trial judge assessed the\nevidence and that had a distorting effect, cannot be invoked as a substitute\nfor identifying a reviewable error or to mask the fact that an error identified\nby an appellate court does not meet the high standard imposed by Housen.\nIn the case at bar, the Court of Appeal held that the\ndistorting lens through which the trial judge has viewed the evidence \u2014 in this\ncase a narrow, siloed approach \u2014 had led her to make precisely identified\npalpable and overriding errors. The notion of a distorting lens was nothing\nmore than a metaphor the Court of Appeal used to explain why the standard of\nappellate review established in Housen was met; it was not used to mask\nan absence of palpable and overriding errors. The Court of Appeal did not err\nby employing the notion of a distorting lens in determining whether the trial\njudge had made palpable and overriding errors.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where\nthe first court of appeal has justifiably intervened in the trial judgment and\ndisagreed with the trial judge, the Court will intervene only if its own\ndisagreement stems from a clear satisfaction that an error has occurred in the\nfirst appellate court\u2019s assessment of the facts. The focal point of the\nanalysis that the Court \u2014 as the second and final court of appeal \u2014 has\nto perform in applying the Housen standards of review is the decision of\nthe first court of appeal, not that of the trial judge. The\nonus is on the appellants to demonstrate an error in the court of appeal\u2019s\ndecision. Here, the appellants did not satisfy their onus. The Court of Appeal\ndid not err by concluding that the trial judge had made palpable and overriding\nerrors, by interfering with the trial judge\u2019s findings relating to the lawyer\u2019s\nduty to advise and duty of loyalty, nor by interfering with the trial\njudge\u2019s findings that the lawyer\u2019s fault had not caused the clients\u2019 losses. There is no reason for the Court to interfere with the Court of\nAppeal\u2019s findings.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nrelationship between lawyers and their clients can usually be characterized as\na contract of mandate. Although lawyers, as mandataries, do not guarantee the\nservices rendered by professionals or advisors to whom they refer their client,\nthey must nevertheless act competently, prudently and diligently in making such\nreferrals, which must be based on reasonable knowledge of the professionals or\nadvisors in questions. Lawyers who refer clients to other professionals or\nadvisors have an obligation of means, not one of result. They must be convinced\nthat the professionals or advisors to whom they refer clients are sufficiently\ncompetent to fulfill the contemplated mandates. Referral is not a guarantee of\nthe services rendered by the professional or advisor to whom the client is\nreferred, but it is also not a shield against liability for other wrongful acts\ncommitted by the referring lawyer. In the instant case, the lawyer had done far\nmore than merely make a referral. It was the entirety of his conduct that led\nthe Court of Appeal to hold the lawyer and his law firm liable in the\ncircumstances. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision did not broaden the basis of\nliability for lawyers who refer clients to other professionals or advisors. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nlawyer\u2019s duty to advise is threefold, encompassing duties to inform, to\nexplain, and to advise in the strict sense. It is inherent in the legal\nprofession and exists regardless of the nature of the mandate. Its exact scope\ndepends on the circumstances, including the object of the mandate, the client\u2019s\ncharacteristics and the expertise the lawyer claims to have in the field in\nquestion. When lawyers do provide advice, they must always act in their clients\u2019\nbest interests and meet the standard of the competent, prudent and diligent\nlawyer in the same circumstances. Any advice lawyers give that exceeds their mandate may, if wrongful,\nengage their liability. Here, the Court of Appeal had sufficient basis to\nintervene and find that the lawyer had failed to advise his clients as a\ncompetent, prudent and diligent lawyer would have done. It properly and\nprecisely identified palpable and overriding errors made by the trial judge in\nher assessment of the parties\u2019 relationships, which had a direct impact on her\nfindings regarding the scope of any wrongful advice given. When properly\nassessed as a whole, as the Court of Appeal did, the evidence reveals that the\nlawyer\u2019s advice and reassurances were all part of a single continuum, and that\nplacing them in separate silos would be artificial. The lawyer breached his\nduty to advise by recommending a non-diversified investment in offshore hedge\nfunds to clients whose primary goal was to preserve the capital, by\nrecommending financial products without performing due diligence and by\nrepeatedly reassuring his clients that their investments gave them security of\ncapital. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As\nmandataries, lawyers also have a duty to avoid placing themselves in situations\nin which their personal interests are in conflict with those of their clients.\nThe duty to avoid conflicts of interest is a salient aspect of the duty of\nloyalty they owe to their clients. The duty of loyalty shields the performance\nof the lawyer\u2019s duty to advise clients from the taint of undue interference. In\nthe instant case, the Court of Appeal was justified in finding that the lawyer\u2019s\npersonal and financial relationship with the recommended advisor had placed him\nin a conflict of interest and that he had neglected his clients\u2019 interests. The\ntrial judge adopted an unduly restrictive approach in analyzing the principles\nrelating to conflicts of interest, which tainted her entire analysis concerning\nthe breach of the lawyer\u2019s duty of loyalty. A proper consideration of the\nevidence as a whole leads to the conclusion that this very close relationship\naffected the lawyer\u2019s objectivity in advising his clients. The lawyer\u2019s\ndivided loyalties led him to neglect his clients\u2019 interests: he disregarded his\nduty of confidentiality regarding his communications with them and teamed up\nwith the recommended advisor in an attempt to convince them not to withdraw\ntheir investments. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 More\nthan one fault can cause a single injury so long as each of the faults is a\ntrue cause, and not a mere condition, of the injury. A fault is a true cause of\nits logical, immediate and direct consequences. This characterization is\nlargely a factual matter, which depends on all the circumstances of the case. A\nperson who commits a fault is not liable for the consequences of a new event\nthat the person had nothing to do with and that has no relationship to the\ninitial fault. Two conditions must be met for the principle of novus actus\ninterveniens to apply. First, the causal link between the fault and the\ninjury must be completely broken. Second, there must be a causal link between\nthat new event and the injury. A client\u2019s ability to rely on advice given by\nhis or her lawyer is central to the lawyer-client relationship and a client\u2019s\nacceptance of a lawyer\u2019s negligent advice cannot shield the lawyer from\nliability. Fraud committed by a third party also does not shield from liability\npersons who failed to take required precautions. Where the risk of a decline in\nmarket prices or fraud by a third party materialize, and where lawyers have\nfailed to abide by the standards of professional conduct that are meant to\nprotect their clients against these very risks, they may be liable for their\nclients\u2019 investment losses. Here, the trial judge\u2019s findings\nregarding the extent of the faults committed by the lawyer no doubt had an\nimpact on her causation analysis. Assessing the evidence in separate silos\nbased on the timing of the events and the specific funds that had been\nrecommended was artificial. The trial judge\u2019s causation analysis was also\ndistorted by her erroneous finding that the lawyer had not breached his duty of\nloyalty. Taken together, the lawyer\u2019s faults with respect to both his duty to\nadvise and his duty of loyalty were a true cause of the losses suffered by his\nclients. The fraud did not break the chain of causation \u2014 no losses\nwould have been suffered without the faults first committed by the lawyer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nC\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. The Court\nof Appeal should not have substituted its own view of the case for that of the\ntrial judge as there were no palpable and overriding errors in her key\nfindings. The Court of Appeal wrongly intervened on the basis of mere\ndifferences of opinion regarding the assessment of the evidence, which is\nclearly inconsistent with the role of an appellate court. When a first\nappellate court interferes with a trial judge\u2019s findings in the absence of\nreviewable errors, it is the Court\u2019s role to step in and to restore the trial\njudge\u2019s decision. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 On\nquestions of fact or of mixed fact and law, an appellate court cannot make its\nown findings and draw its own inferences unless the trial judge is shown to\nhave committed a palpable and overriding error. As a precondition to\nintervening in a trial judge\u2019s decision, the appellate court must point to a\nspecific and identifiable error that amounts to more than a divergence of\nopinion and that error must be shown to be determinative of the outcome of the\ncase. The identification of a palpable and overriding error does not require a\nreview of the evidence as a whole. The focus of the review is the trial judge\u2019s\nreasons and, if need be, specific pieces of evidence to which the appellant\ndraws the attention of the appellate court to show that a given finding is\nunsupported by the evidence. It would be inappropriate for the appellate court\nto conduct its own assessment of the evidence and then to take note of points\nof disagreement with the trial judge\u2019s findings and hold that those findings\nresult from palpable and overriding errors in order to justify intervening.\nAppellate courts are, in comparison to trial judges, ill-equipped for the task\nof fact-finding and must thus leave the task to trial judges. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ndistorting lens metaphor does not dispense with the requirement of identifying\nreviewable errors in accordance with the standards articulated in Housen. A\n\u201cdistorting lens\u201d cannot justify a wide-ranging review of the entire record\nunless adopting the lens is shown to be, in itself, a reviewable error. The\ndistorting lens metaphor may arguably be useful to illustrate how certain\npalpable errors taint the analysis of the evidence to the point of having an\noverriding effect, but a metaphor is not a full explanation. The appellate\ncourt must explain why the trial judge erred by viewing the case through the\nimpugned \u201cdistorting lens\u201d, why that error amounts to more than a mere\ndivergence in opinion, and precisely how it distorted the trial judge\u2019s\nanalysis and affected the outcome of the case. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Part\nof the Court\u2019s role as a second and final court of appeal is to ensure that a\ntrial judge\u2019s findings of fact or of mixed fact and law remain undisturbed\nunless a palpable and overriding error is established. Although the focal point\nof the Court is the first appellate court\u2019s decision, not that of the trial\njudge, the Court must inevitably return to the trial judge\u2019s reasons in order\nto determine whether the first appellate court correctly identified reviewable\nerrors. In that regard, the Court should not defer to the first appellate court\nwith respect to the identification of reviewable errors. When the Court reviews\na decision in which the first appellate court has substituted its own findings\nof fact or of mixed fact and law for those of the trial judge, it must first\ninquire into whether the first appellate court correctly identified reviewable\nerrors. If it did not, the trial judge\u2019s findings must be restored regardless\nof the merits of the first appellate court\u2019s findings. If, however, the Court\nagrees that the intervention was warranted, it must ask whether the first\nappellate court has erred in making its own independent assessment of the\nrelevant evidence. It is only at this step that the Court will show a certain\ndeference and will therefore avoid intervening unless clearly satisfied that\nthe first appellate court\u2019s findings are erroneous. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe instant case, the trial judge did not make a palpable and overriding error\nwith respect to fault and causation. The Court of Appeal merely preferred a\ndifferent \u201clens\u201d than the one used by the trial judge. Further, it relied on a\nbroad reassessment of the evidence in order to identify the purported errors,\nwhich is at odds with Housen and its progeny. The Court of Appeal\u2019s\nintervention was unwarranted and the Court must intervene to restore the trial\njudge\u2019s findings. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Whenever\nlawyers recommend other professionals, or express confidence in them, they must\nmeet the standard of a reasonably competent, prudent and diligent lawyer in the\nsame circumstances. Lawyers should make such inquiries as will enable them to\nacquire reasonable knowledge of professionals they recommend unless they\nalready have relevant experience dealing with them. Not every professional\nerror made in making such inquiries \u2014 or in failing to make them \u2014 will amount\nto a fault if the lawyer\u2019s conduct does not depart from the standard expected,\nand courts must be careful not to assess recommendations in light of facts\ndiscovered subsequently. Moreover, referring lawyers are not required to\nmonitor the advice given by the professionals they recommended, as this would\ndefeat the purpose of referral. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe instant case, the Court of Appeal did not identify a specific reviewable\nerror in the trial judge\u2019s reasons in relation to the lawyer\u2019s initial\nrecommendation and later expressions of confidence. The lawyer did not commit a\nfault in recommending the investment firm and the financial advisor and in\nexpressing confidence in them. While the lawyer had a duty to advise both his\nclients and a duty of loyalty to both of them, those duties were largely\ncircumscribed by the very nature and scope of his mandates. The precise scope\nof a mandate does not always limit a lawyer\u2019s duties, but it is certainly one\nof the main considerations for a judge when assessing professional liability.\nIn the present case, as the lawyer had had no specific mandate with regard to\nthe clients\u2019 investments, it was appropriate for the trial judge to eschew an\noverly broad approach to liability. The lawyer\u2019s confidence in the competence\nand probity of the investment firm and the recommended advisor was based on\nreasonable knowledge. He therefore acted as a reasonably competent, prudent and\ndiligent lawyer in the circumstances. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nlawyer\u2019s duty to advise generally includes obligations to inform the client of\nthe relevant facts, to explain available options and their implications, and to\nrecommend a course of action. Yet, the precise content of that duty is highly\ndependent on the circumstances, including the scope of the mandate, the\nobligations assumed by the lawyer and his or her areas of expertise. In this\ncase, there is no palpable and overriding error in the trial judge\u2019s finding\nthat the lawyer\u2019s only fault relating to his duty to advise was to recommend\nspecific investment products. As the trial judge concluded, the lawyer failed\nto act as a reasonably competent, prudent and diligent lawyer in recommending\nspecific investment products and in volunteering investment advice even though\nsuch advice fell outside of the limits of his mandates. In so doing, he\nbreached his duty to advise. Indeed, to the extent that a lawyer does provide\nadvice, he must meet the standard of a reasonably competent, prudent and\ndiligent lawyer in the same circumstances irrespective of the scope of his\nmandate. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nCourt of Appeal had some basis for concluding that the lawyer had committed the\nsame faults in respect of both his clients, but even if this error is assumed\nto be palpable, it did not affect the outcome of the case. This error did not\njustify the Court of Appeal\u2019s conducting a broad reassessment of the evidence\nfor the purpose of finding other potential errors. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nanalysis of an alleged fault related to the duty of loyalty involves a question\nof mixed fact and law and, unless a pure question of law can be extricated, the\nappropriate standard is that of palpable and overriding error. An extricable\nquestion of law generally concerns a mischaracterization of the applicable\nlegal test or a failure to consider a required element of that test. The\nanalysis of an alleged conflict of interest is inherently fact-based and\nalleged conflicts must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Not every potential\nviolation of the duty of loyalty will give rise to an action in civil\nliability. The court must analyze the nature and the circumstances of the\nalleged conflict for the purpose of characterizing the violation and, if\nwarranted, determining the appropriate remedy. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\ntrial judge does not have to discuss in detail every single fact alleged by the\nparties or every piece of evidence and declining to draw an inference falls\nsquarely within its purview. The question is not whether the trial judge\nbrushed aside elements that the court of appeal deemed important, but whether\nthose omissions might have affected the conclusion. Here, the Court of Appeal\nerred in interfering with the trial judge\u2019s finding that the lawyer had not\nbreached his duty of loyalty to his clients. It proceeded to revisit the issue\nof conflict of interests by applying the standard of correctness, as if a\nquestion of law had been identified. Yet, the Court of Appeal has not suggested\nthat the trial judge failed to identify the correct legal principles applicable\nto the alleged fault related to the duty of loyalty or that there is an error\nin the trial judge\u2019s characterization of the applicable legal test. The Court\nof Appeal failed to identify a palpable and overriding error and impermissibly\nreassessed the evidence as a whole on the basis of a disagreement over the\nweight to be given to the evidence. The fact that the Court of Appeal would\nhave weighed the evidence differently, or drawn different inferences, does not\njustify its intervention. Even if the trial judge did not address certain\naspects of the professional relationship between the lawyer and the recommended\nadvisor, especially the disclosure by the former of communications with his\nclient and the fact that he had cooperated extensively with the recommended\nadvisor and the investment firm on at least one occasion, those omissions did\nnot affect her conclusions. The trial judge properly considered the factors\nthat could have cast doubt on the lawyer\u2019s undivided loyalty and commitment to\nhis clients, that is, his friendship with the recommended advisor and their\nfinancial relationship, including the gifts or commissions he had received. The\nconclusion that these factors were not enough to have placed the lawyer in a\nposition where his personal interest conflicted with that of his clients was\nopen to her, and is entitled to deference. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\nfundamental principle of civil liability is that a person is liable only for\ninjury caused by his or her own fault. A true cause is established when the\nplaintiff proves that the injury is a logical, immediate and direct consequence\nof the fault. It does not suffice to show that the fault increased the\nlikelihood of the injury occurring if there is no evidence that the fault\ndirectly caused the injury either in whole or in part. The analysis of\ncausation remains a context-based exercise which does not lend itself to legal\ntheorizing. It is up to the trier of fact to draw a line, or identify a breaking\npoint, between the consequences that flow directly and immediately from the\nfault and the others. Proving breaches of a lawyer\u2019s professional duties does\nnot suffice to establish civil liability in the absence of a causal link to an\ninjury. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe instant case, the Court of Appeal should not have completely reassessed the\nevidence and interfered with the trial judge\u2019s conclusions regarding causation\nof the basis of the distorting lens metaphor. It was open to the trial judge to\nfind that the fraud was the only true cause of the losses and that the\nrecommendation of the investment firm and financial advisor was not close\nenough to the injury to qualify as a logical, direct and immediate cause. With\nrespect to the duties of loyalty and confidentiality, it is unclear how the\nalleged breaches might have caused the losses. Moreover, even if the lawyer did\ncommit additional faults related to his duty to advise and his duties of\nloyalty and confidentiality after he had become aware of a news article raising\ndoubts about the firm\u2019s practices, the outcome would be the same as the funds\nwere no longer recoverable by that time.

        "citation": "2019 SCC 14",
        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0lawyer who repeatedly recommended that his clients  invest money in funds promoted by his friend\u2019s firm was responsible for the  clients\u2019 losses when it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>\r\n   People hire lawyers to help them make important  decisions. They have to be able to trust them. That means trusting they are  capable, careful, and will act in the client's interests, not anyone else's. To  help guarantee this trust, lawyers have certain ethical and professional  duties. In Quebec, two of these are the \u201cduty to advise\u201d and the \u201cduty of  loyalty.\u201d\r\n   The duty  to advise means several things. It means the lawyer has to tell the client all  the relevant facts. They have to explain the possible consequences of an  action. And they have to recommend what the client should do. How far this duty  goes depends on a few things. These include the client\u2019s experience and  knowledge, the reason the lawyer was hired, and what expertise the lawyer says  they have. The duty of loyalty means the lawyer has to be loyal to the client.  Lawyers can\u2019t put themselves in situations where things they want might go  against things their clients want. Mr. Salomon was a lawyer. He  had been the lawyer for some of the Thompsons\u2019 businesses for many years. In  2003, Ms. Matte-Thompson asked him for advice. Mr. Thompson had died and left  her money in trust. She wanted to live off the interest only and save the rest  for the children. Mr. Salomon introduced Ms. Matte-Thompson to his personal friend,  Mr. Papadopoulos, and recommended the services of his firm, Triglobal Capital Management.  He said investing in one of the funds promoted by Mr. Papadopoulos\u2019s firm would  help Ms. Matte-Thompson achieve her goals.  With Mr. Salomon\u2019s  encouragement, Ms. Matte-Thompson and the company she owned invested with  Triglobal and kept their investments there. Over the years, they invested over  $7.5 million in two funds. In 2006, Ms. Matte-Thompson told Mr. Salomon she was  worried about the investments. He reassured her and told her to keep investing.  He also told Mr. Papadopoulos to reassure her. In 2007, Mr. Papadopoulos and  his business partner disappeared with almost $100 million. This included over  $5 million invested by Ms. Matte-Thompson and her company. Later, Ms.  Matte-Thompson found out Mr. Papadopoulos had paid Mr. Salomon almost $40,000  during the years he advised her and her company. In 2008, Ms. Matte-Thompson and  her company sued Mr. Salomon and his law firm. She said Mr. Salomon had failed  in his duty to advise. This was because he recommended, endorsed, and  encouraged inappropriate investments. She also said he disregarded his duty of  loyalty. This was because he put himself in a conflict of interest, which  caused him to ignore the risks.     The trial judge said Mr.  Papadopoulos and his partner were responsible for the losses. But she said Mr.  Salomon was not. The Court of Appeal said the trial judge made important mistakes.  It said Mr. Salomon was responsible, and reversed the trial judge\u2019s decision. The  majority at the Supreme Court said the Court of Appeal was right to intervene. The  trial judge failed to look at Mr. Salomon\u2019s actions as a whole from 2003 to  2007. It agreed with the Court of Appeal that Mr. Salomon failed in his duty to  advise Ms. Matte-Thompson and her company. This was because he encouraged Ms.  Matte-Thompson to invest and keep her money (and the company\u2019s money) in the  funds over many years, even though they didn\u2019t meet her goals. He never looked  into the funds he was recommending, but kept telling her the investments were  safe. The majority agreed that Ms. Matte-Thompson would have never invested in  Triglobal funds if Mr. Salomon hadn\u2019t failed in his duty to advise. It also agreed  that Mr. Salomon disregarded his duty of loyalty. His friendship and investments  with Mr. Papadopoulos put him in a conflict of interest. He even told Mr.  Papadopoulos about Ms. Matte-Thompson\u2019s private fears and concerns. Mr.  Papadopoulos also paid Mr. Salomon while he was advising Ms. Matte-Thompson and  her company. It was wrong for him to advise them in this situation.  This case was about  what lawyers are responsible for when they go beyond just referring clients to  another professional. The decision doesn\u2019t mean lawyers take on more risk  recommending someone now than they did before. Lawyers can refer their clients  to others. They just have to follow their professional and ethical duties when  they do so."

The suit was brought by Knight, a\nUtah-based company, which claimed that BEC had a balance owing under a contract\nbetween them. Knight argued that B had fraudulently misrepresented that the\ndefendants would pay a certain amount, that the corporate veil of the two\ncompanies should be lifted, and that the defendants had been unjustly enriched.\nB brought a motion to have the claim against him dismissed on a preliminary\nbasis, raising that: (1)\u00a0Knight\u2019s claim for fraudulent misrepresentation\nwas barred at law; (2)\u00a0the Utah court did not have jurisdiction over him personally;\nand (3)\u00a0Knight had failed to show that the corporate veil should be\nlifted. The Utah court dismissed B\u2019s motion and a default judgment was\neventually rendered against all three defendants. Knight then sought to have\nthat decision recognized in Quebec and declared enforceable against B. The\nSuperior Court ruled that the Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction could be recognized on\nthree possible grounds. Two of them related to the contract between Knight and\nBEC and the promise to pay allegedly made by B. However, the main ground for\nrecognizing the Utah decision was the fact that B had submitted to the Utah court\u2019s\njurisdiction. The Court of Appeal dismissed B\u2019s appeal. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J.\ndissenting): The\nappeal should be dismissed. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon,\nRowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The Utah decision should be\nrecognized and enforced against B in Quebec. B submitted to the Utah court\u2019s\njurisdiction in accordance with art.\u00a03168(6) of the Civil Code of\nQu\u00e9bec (\u201cC.C.Q.\u201d) by presenting substantive arguments in his\nmotion to dismiss that, if accepted, would have resolved all or part of the\ndispute. This submission suffices to recognize the\njurisdiction of the Utah court under the Quebec rules of indirect international\njurisdiction. Given that the dispute has a substantial connection with Utah in\nlight of B\u2019s submission to the jurisdiction, art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. does\nnot bar the recognition of the Utah court\u2019s judgment against him.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\naccordance with the aim of facilitating the free flow of international trade,\nart.\u00a03155 C.C.Q. establishes the principle that a decision rendered\noutside Quebec will generally be recognized and declared enforceable in the\nprovince. This provision lists six exceptions that allow Quebec courts to\ndepart from that general principle and refuse to recognize a foreign decision,\nthe first being where a judgment is rendered by an authority that had no\njurisdiction over the dispute under the C.C.Q. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to this first exception, Title Four of Book Ten of the C.C.Q.\nspecifies the circumstances in which Quebec courts will recognize foreign\njurisdiction. The purpose of these rules is to determine whether it is\nappropriate to integrate specific decisions rendered outside Quebec into the\nprovince\u2019s legal system. Such recognition of a foreign authority\u2019s jurisdiction\nby local courts in accordance with the rules prescribed by local law has been\nreferred to as the indirect international jurisdiction of the foreign\nauthority. In personal actions of a patrimonial nature, art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q.\nlists six situations where Quebec courts may find that a foreign authority has\nindirect international jurisdiction. The use of the word \u201conly\u201d in the opening\nsentence of art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. signals that the grounds enumerated\nare exhaustive, and the presence of a single ground will suffice to recognize\njurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Quebec\ncourts must ascertain that the foreign authority had jurisdiction over the\nmatter under the rules of the C.C.Q. This requires them to make a\npositive finding of jurisdiction; they cannot limit themselves to determining\nwhether the party opposing recognition has satisfactorily proved lack of\njurisdiction. An application for recognition and enforcement is a\njudicial demand giving rise to an adversarial relationship to which the general\nrules of civil procedure apply. In this context, parties are not exempted from the\nrequirement imposed by art.\u00a02803 C.C.Q. of proving the facts on which the right to recognition and\nenforcement is based. The foreign authority\u2019s jurisdiction is one such fact,\nand the onus is on the party seeking recognition to establish that fact and\nthus, to prove the facts upon which the foreign authority\u2019s indirect\ninternational jurisdiction is based. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\njurisdiction of the Utah court in the instant case cannot be\nestablished under art.\u00a03168(3) or (4) C.C.Q. Article\u00a03168(3)\u00a0C.C.Q.\nprovides that the jurisdiction of a foreign authority is recognized in Quebec\nif both the injury and the fault that gave rise to the injury occurred in the state\nwhere the decision was rendered. For its part, art.\u00a03168(4)\u00a0C.C.Q.\nstates that a foreign authority\u2019s jurisdiction is recognized where its decision\nconcerns obligations arising from a contract that were to be performed in that\nstate. In this case, the exhibits filed by Knight before the Superior Court\nwere essentially limited to documents reflecting the progress of the proceedings\nin Utah. Knight could not rely on the allegations in its own proceedings before\nthe Utah court in order to establish that court\u2019s jurisdiction over B according\nto the rules of the C.C.Q. It had to adduce evidence before the Quebec\nenforcing court to meet its burden of establishing the grounds for recognition\nupon which it was relying. Knight failed to provide any evidence with regard to\neither art.\u00a03168(3) or (4) insofar as B was personally concerned. Accordingly,\nthe Superior Court could not, on this record, recognize the Utah court\u2019s\njurisdiction under either of those subparagraphs. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However,\nthe lower courts were justified to conclude that the ground for recognition\nunder art.\u00a03168(6) C.C.Q., submission to jurisdiction, was met in\nthis case. Contrary to the grounds under art.\u00a03168(3)\nand (4), the procedural facts underlying the claim\nunder art.\u00a03168(6) C.C.Q. are all supported by the exhibits filed. Submission has long been recognized in Quebec case law as a basis\nfor a court\u2019s jurisdiction, and is now expressly provided for in art. 3168(6). The question of whether the defendant has\nsubmitted to the jurisdiction of the foreign authority is\nassessed in light of the rules of indirect international jurisdiction set out in the C.C.Q. Under Quebec law, submission\nto jurisdiction can be either\nexplicit or implicit, but it must be clear. After having\nsubmitted to the jurisdiction of an authority, a defendant cannot withdraw its\nconsent. The orderly administration of justice requires that, once jurisdiction\nhas been validly established, the case proceed in the same forum regardless of\nthe changing whims of the parties. Submission to jurisdiction is a question of\nmixed fact and law, as it involves applying a legal standard to a set of facts,\nweighing these facts and drawing inferences. Such a determination is not to be\noverturned absent palpable and overriding error, provided no extricable legal\nquestions have been identified.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\ndefendant submits to jurisdiction when it presents\nsubstantive arguments which, if accepted, would resolve the dispute \u2014 or part\nof the dispute \u2014 on its merits. Parties who choose to\nadvance substantive arguments to further their positions in a forum consent to\nthe jurisdiction of that authority. The \u201csave your skin\u201d approach to submission to\njurisdiction, whereby a defendant who presents a\ndefence on the merits at the same time as its jurisdictional arguments will not\nbe taken to have submitted to jurisdiction, should be rejected. In this case, B\npresented at least one argument pertaining to the merits of the action against\nhim in his motion to dismiss, which, if accepted, would have led to a final\nconclusion in his favour. The argument that Knight\u2019s fraudulent\nmisrepresentation claim was barred at law could have led the Utah court to\nconclusively dismiss that claim. Such a ruling would have attracted the\nauthority of res judicata and precluded Knight from asserting that claim\nin another jurisdiction. B\u2019s argument was thus akin to a defence on the merits\nfor the purposes of submitting to the Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction. B has also failed\nto establish that, as a result of Utah procedural law, he had to proceed as he\ndid and present all of his preliminary exceptions together. None of the\nevidence he adduced before the Superior Court supports that claim, and thus the\nlatter made no palpable and overriding error in determining that submission to\njurisdiction was established on the record.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 B\u2019s\nsubmission to jurisdiction under art.\u00a03168(6) C.C.Q. clearly\nestablishes a substantial connection between the dispute and the Utah court. The substantial connection test is set out in\nart.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. and establishes the\ngeneral principle for recognition of foreign authorities\u2019 jurisdiction. It is\nnot necessary to resolve in this case the issue of\nwhether the establishment of a ground for recognition of the foreign authority\u2019s jurisdiction under art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. always\nsatisfies the requirement for a substantial connection between the dispute and\nthe forum under art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. Here, the fact that\nB participated in the legal proceedings in Utah to the extent of submitting to\nthe Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction suffices amply and raises no question as to\nwhether the dispute is substantially connected with Utah and the Utah court. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown\u00a0J.:\nThere is agreement with the majority that the\nappeal should be dismissed, but for different reasons. B has not submitted to the\njurisdiction of the Utah court within the meaning of\nart.\u00a03168(6) C.C.Q.; rather, the jurisdiction of the Utah court has been established\nunder arts.\u00a03168(4), 3164 and 3139 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When\ndeciding whether to recognize a foreign decision, Quebec courts must review the\nevidence submitted to ensure that the foreign authority had jurisdiction under\nthe rules of the C.C.Q. The record placed in the\ninstant case is sufficient to decide whether art.\u00a03168(4) C.C.Q. can support a finding of the\nUtah court\u2019s jurisdiction. The causes of action asserted by Knight against the three defendants are\nall so closely connected that they represent different aspects of a single\ncontractual dispute over which the Utah court had jurisdiction pursuant to\nart.\u00a03168(4) C.C.Q. Article 3168(4) C.C.Q.\ndeals with jurisdiction based on connections with the subject-matter of the\ndispute, and not with jurisdiction based on connections with the\ndefendant. All co-defendants are connected to the subject-matter of the\ndispute, which is contractual by nature, and which falls squarely within the\njurisdiction of the Utah court under art.\u00a03168(4) C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fact that B is not a party to the contract does not preclude art.\u00a03168(4) C.C.Q.\u2019s\napplication, insofar as other\nprovisions of the C.C.Q., such as arts.\u00a03164 and 3139, confirm that\nthe Utah court had jurisdiction against B personally. Restricting the\napplication of art.\u00a03168(4) C.C.Q. in such a way would have the impermissible effect\nof imposing upon a plaintiff the burden of proving, before a Quebec court, its\nallegations of alter ego or fraud in order to justify the lifting of the\ncorporate veil pursuant to art.\u00a0317 C.C.Q. This is impermissible because the question of whether to lift the corporate veil is a substantive legal\nissue, not a jurisdictional one. Quebec courts cannot review the merits of a case or retry parts thereof\nunder Quebec\u2019s recognition procedure (art.\u00a03158 C.C.Q.). Thus, a defendant should not be able\nto resist recognition and enforcement on the ground that the foreign authority\nshould not have lifted the corporate veil. Further, such a\nnarrow interpretation of art.\u00a03168(4) is incompatible with the\nrecent decision of Lapointe Rosenstein Marchand Melan\u00e7on LLP v. Cassels Brock\n& Blackwell LLP, 2016 SCC 30, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 851, in\nwhich the Court stated that a connection between a claim\nand a contract does not necessarily require that a defendant be a party to the\ncontract. In support of this\nconclusion, the Court referred by analogy to art.\u00a03139 C.C.Q., the\nprovision granting jurisdiction to Quebec courts for reasons of administrative\nconvenience. Article 3139 C.C.Q. provides that if a\nQuebec authority has jurisdiction to rule on the principal\ndemand, it also has jurisdiction to rule on an\nincidental demand. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Courts\nmust interpret Quebec\u2019s private international law rules as a coherent whole, in\naccordance with the general principles of interpretation of the C.C.Q. and\nthe principles of comity, order and fairness which inspire the interpretation\nof these rules. Answering the question of whether and on what\nconditions art.\u00a03139 C.C.Q. can be invoked to establish the jurisdiction\nof a foreign authority against a particular co-defendant requires interpreting art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. The scope of these provisions, and\ntheir relationship with art.\u00a03168(4), cannot be determined in isolation. According\nto art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q., the recognized grounds for establishing the jurisdiction\nof a foreign authority are essentially those available to Quebec courts as\nlisted under Title Three. This is referred to as the principle of jurisdictional\nreciprocity, or the mirror principle. Title Three is divided into two Chapters:\nChapter\u00a0I (\u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d) and Chapter\u00a0II (\u201cSpecial\nProvisions\u201d). The jurisdiction of a foreign court should be assessed by looking\nto both Chapters. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 By\nreferring generally to Title Three, art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. authorizes a\nQuebec court to recognize the jurisdiction of a foreign authority on the basis\nof one of the \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d situated in Chapter I of that Title, such as\nthe provision granting jurisdiction for reasons of administrative convenience\n(art.\u00a03139 C.C.Q.). Consequently, in\npersonal actions of a patrimonial nature, satisfying the jurisdictional requirement of art. 3168 C.C.Q. may not always be necessary\nfor the purposes of recognition under Quebec law. Though the exclusive\nlanguage of art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. may appear to suggest otherwise, it\nshould not be overstated. Absent the use of the word \u201conly\u201d under\nart.\u00a03168 C.C.Q., the mirror effect of art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q.\nwould direct Quebec courts to decide the jurisdiction of a foreign authority by\napplying one of the subparagraphs of art.\u00a03148 para. 1 C.C.Q. The\nexclusive language in art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. indicates that, notwithstanding\nthe mirror principle, art.\u00a03148 C.C.Q. cannot be relied upon to\ndetermine the jurisdiction of the foreign authority in such circumstances.\nTherefore, art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. does not preclude a Quebec court from\nrecognizing the jurisdiction of a foreign authority on the basis of one of the\n\u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d situated in Chapter I of Title Three. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However,\nart.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. does not authorize a Quebec court to apply the\nrequirement of a substantial connection between the dispute and the foreign\nauthority so as to reject a foreign court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction even where\none of art.\u00a03168\u2019s jurisdictional criteria is\nsatisfied. Book Ten of the C.C.Q., stating as it does the private\ninternational law of Quebec, encapsulates the requirement of a real and\nsubstantial connection. Thus, a real and substantial connection does not\noperate as an additional condition to those contained in art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q.;\nit is rather given expression by the scheme contained within Book Ten. The view\nthat art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. requires a substantial connection between the\ndispute and the forum, even where one of the conditions for jurisdiction of a\nforeign authority is established under art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q., finds no\nsupport and is inconsistent with the text of art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. Any\nconcern for a substantial connection under this provision arises only where the\njurisdiction of a foreign authority is established on the provisions of Title\nThree. Furthermore, art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. is more restrictive than the mirror provision of art.\u00a03148 C.C.Q. precisely in\norder to ensure the existence of a substantial connection. However, Quebec\ncourts must still conduct an independent inquiry into the existence of a\nsubstantial connection between the dispute and the foreign authority where the\ncourt bases its finding of jurisdiction on one of the \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d in\nChapter I of Title Three. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article\n3139 C.C.Q. is a jurisdiction-granting provision that ensures the\nefficient use of judicial resources and efficiency in the administration of\njustice by fostering the joinder of proceedings. The term\n\u201cincidental demand\u201d in art.\u00a03139 C.C.Q. should be read as including\na related or connected claim. Thus, in personal\nactions of a patrimonial nature, the jurisdiction of a foreign authority over a\nparticular co-defendant can be established in accordance with art.\u00a03139 C.C.Q.,\neven where that co-defendant is not a party to the contract upon which the\nforeign authority\u2019s jurisdiction is grounded, if (a) that foreign authority has\njurisdiction over the main contractual dispute pursuant to art.\u00a03168(4) C.C.Q.;\n(b) the claim against the co-defendant is connected to the contract; and (c)\nthere is a substantial connection between the dispute and the foreign authority\u2019s\nstate pursuant to art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. In this case, the Utah court had\njurisdiction over the main contractual dispute between Knight and BEC under art.\u00a03168(4)\nC.C.Q., and the claims of alter ego and fraud made against B personally\nwere clearly connected to the contract. B participated\nin the legal proceedings in Utah and admitted to having had a key role in\ndealing with Knight for the performance of a contract to be executed in Utah.\nFurthermore, the alter ego claim made against B personally is governed by Utah\nlaw. Accordingly, there is a substantial\nconnection between Utah and both the object of the dispute and the parties for\nthe purposes of satisfying art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. It is in the interests\nof justice to have connected\nclaims decided together by one forum. The\nUtah court chose to assert its jurisdiction over all aspects of the case. This\nchoice was open to it, and should be respected in light of the principle of\ninternational comity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting):\nThe appeal should be allowed. The Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot be\nestablished under art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. and the dispute is not\nsubstantially connected with Utah as required by art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. As\na result, the decision cannot be recognized against B.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nis agreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Knight did not meet its burden\nof establishing the Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction over B insofar as arts.\u00a03168(3)\nand (4) are concerned. Contrary to cases where a Quebec court\nis considering its own jurisdiction, in an application to recognize a\nforeign decision, the general rules of evidence apply, meaning that the\nallegations will not be accepted as averred and a prima facie showing\nwill not be sufficient. Along with its application, Knight filed documentary\nevidence that essentially consisted of the pleadings and decisions from the proceedings\nbefore the Utah court. None of the documents submitted offered any evidence\nwith regard to a fault committed by B in Utah or a contractual obligation to be\nperformed by him in that state. The alleged promise to pay and the alter ego\nallegations against B have yet to be proven in court. B\nexpressly denied those allegations, and no evidence of the alleged promise to\npay, its content or its acceptance was adduced at any other time in the Utah\nproceedings. The decisions of the Utah court filed as evidence are default\njudgments and contain no findings of fact that may be relied on in the Quebec\nproceedings to conclude that the foreign authority had jurisdiction. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Given\nthat B is not himself a party\nto the contract at issue, Knight could not rely on art.\u00a03168(4)\nC.C.Q. absent evidence that would have allowed the corporate veil to be\npierced under Quebec law. Article 3168(4) C.C.Q. cannot be relied on to establish\njurisdiction against anyone remotely associated with a contract regardless\nof whether they are a party to that contract. This\nprovision requires a connection not only with the object of the\ndispute (i.e. the contract), but also with the defendant (i.e. the person\nliable for the contractual obligations). Holding otherwise would render this\nconnecting factor indeterminate and diffuse, such that it would become\ndifficult for litigants to predict with reasonable certainty whether a foreign decision\nrendered against them may be recognized in Quebec. Thus, where the\ndefendant is not a party to the contract at issue, the plaintiff cannot rely on\nart.\u00a03168(4) C.C.Q. unless it is shown that the\ndefendant is otherwise personally responsible for the contractual obligations\nunder Quebec law. In practice, it would be insufficient to show that BEC\nwas B\u2019s alter ego. Knight would have also had to present evidence establishing\nthat B invoked BEC\u2019s juridical personality \u201cso as to dissemble\nfraud, abuse of right or contravention of a rule of public order\u201d within the\nmeaning of art.\u00a0317 C.C.Q. The nature and scope of a\nconnecting factor codified in the C.C.Q. such as the obligations\narising from a contract must be determined according to the law of\nQuebec. In this case, there is no evidence\nthat would justify piercing the corporate veil for jurisdictional purposes.\nRequiring such evidence does not amount to an impermissible review of the\nmerits of the case, but rather serves to verify whether the requirements for\nrecognition are met.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Superior Court erred in law in finding that B submitted to the Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to art.\u00a03168(6)\nsimply by raising substantive arguments in his motion to dismiss. The test set out by the majority is too strict. It ignores\nthe fact that the defendant\u2019s subjective\nintent must be taken into account. A more flexible approach should\nbe adopted, one that allows a defendant wishing to contest the jurisdiction of\na foreign authority to argue why the authority lacks\njurisdiction without risking being found to have submitted to that\njurisdiction. A defendant must be permitted to raise arguments and considerations\ncapable of convincing a foreign authority that it should not assume\njurisdiction, and it is unreasonable to suggest that\nany defendant who does so necessarily submits to the foreign authority\u2019s\njurisdiction. This would leave defendants in a \u201ccatch-22\u201d situation. If they\nattempt to challenge the jurisdiction of a foreign authority, they risk being\nfound by a Quebec court to have submitted to that jurisdiction. If they do not,\nthey will likely be faced with a foreign default judgment which could seriously\nlimit their ability to conduct business (or any other activities) in the\nforeign jurisdiction. The practical implications are real and serious. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 On\nthe facts of this case, there is little support for the inference that B submitted\nto the jurisdiction of the Utah court. While B did make some substantive\narguments, they were presented alongside jurisdictional arguments. Submission\nto jurisdiction can be either explicit or implicit, but it must be clear. In\nalleging that the Utah court had jurisdiction over B, Knight\nbore the burden of proving that B had a choice under\nUtah procedural law not to proceed as he did when he presented substantive arguments\nin his motion to dismiss. This is consistent with the well-established\nprinciple that in Quebec, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the facts\nupon which the court\u2019s jurisdiction is based. Knight has not met its burden in\nthis regard. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that B had the\nprocedural choice not to raise certain substantive arguments at the stage of\nobjecting to jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As\nnone of the connecting factors under art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. is present,\nthere is no need to consider whether the dispute is substantially connected\nwith the foreign state under art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. The wording of art.\u00a03168\nC.C.Q. makes clear that in personal actions of a\npatrimonial nature, the jurisdiction of foreign authorities is recognized only where\none of the listed factors is present. However, had it been found that B submitted to the Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction, there\nwould still be no substantial connection between the dispute\nand Utah under art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nwill be exceptional circumstances in which a substantial connection will\nneed to be demonstrated under art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q.\neven where one of the connecting factors in art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. has\nbeen met. Evidence of one of the factors in art.\u00a03168\nC.C.Q. being present will generally be\nsufficient to demonstrate a substantial connection and thus to establish\njurisdiction. Nevertheless, this will not always be the case. Requiring that a\nsubstantial connection between the dispute and the foreign state be\ndemonstrated even where art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q. is engaged is consistent\nwith the language, context and purpose of art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q., as well\nas with the principle of comity and the values of order and fairness underlying\nthe rules of private international law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article\n3164 C.C.Q. is the first article and key provision of the chapter of the\nC.C.Q. that sets out the rules applicable to the jurisdiction of foreign\nauthorities. It establishes the general principle of reciprocity, or mirror\nprinciple, whereby the jurisdiction of foreign authorities\nis established in accordance with the rules on jurisdiction applicable to Quebec\nauthorities under Title Three. To that general principle of reciprocity, art.\u00a03164\nC.C.Q. adds the further requirement that a dispute\nbe substantially connected with the foreign state whose authority is seized of\nthe matter. The reference to Title Three is not meant to limit the\napplication of that fundamental requirement, but simply to express the\nreciprocity principle which serves as the foundation for Title Four. As such,\nthe subsequent provisions of Title Four, which include art.\u00a03168 C.C.Q., do not displace, or entirely subsume, the requirement of a\nsubstantial connection. The substantial connection requirement is meant to\nprevent Quebec courts from recognizing a foreign decision where the connection\nis so weak that recognition would be inappropriate. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This\nis one of the exceptional cases in which a separate substantial\nconnection analysis would have been warranted. Specifically,\nwhere a defendant is found to have submitted to the\njurisdiction of a foreign authority pursuant to art.\u00a03168(6) C.C.Q.,\nfurther evidence may be required to establish a substantial connection\nbetween the dispute and the forum. This will be the\ncase where submission has been reluctant and largely involuntary, and where the\ndefendant has not presented a defence on the merits but has merely challenged\nthe foreign authority\u2019s jurisdiction. Submission does not in itself establish\nan actual connection between the underlying dispute and the foreign state, as\nit is more properly understood as a distinct ground for\njurisdiction. Unless there is extensive participation in foreign proceedings, other factors should be considered to determine whether\na substantial connection exists. In the present case, the\nmere fact that B made substantive arguments in his motion\nto dismiss does not establish a substantial connection between the dispute and\nUtah. Nor does B\u2019s involvement as President of BEC, or the\nfact that Utah law may have applied to certain\nclaims made against him personally. Further, a substantial connection cannot be presumed on the mere basis that\nit appears more convenient to recognize a foreign decision in a given situation,\nfor instance by having a single forum decide\nrelated claims. Convenience is not an independent ground for\njurisdiction. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally,\nand even if we are to assume that art.\u00a03139 C.C.Q.\nmay be relied upon to recognize a foreign decision through the mirror\neffect of art.\u00a03164 C.C.Q., it could not be\napplied in the instant case. The action against B is a\nprincipal demand, not an incidental demand. Additionally, art.\u00a03139 C.C.Q. cannot be relied\nupon to extend jurisdiction over any related claim.\nSuch a broad interpretation would be inconsistent with the text of the\nprovision.

        "citation": "2019 SCC 13",
        "summary": "<strong>It\u2019s contradictory for Quebec residents to argue that a foreign court  doesn\u2019t have the power to decide a lawsuit against them, while bringing up  points the court could use to resolve the dispute in their favour, the Supreme  Court has ruled. </strong>\r\n   Laws are local. A law passed in one place doesn\u2019t  automatically apply somewhere else. This means you can\u2019t take a court judgment  from one place (e.g., where you live) and get it automatically enforced in  another (e.g., where someone who owes you money lives). Because laws are local,  courts only have \u201cjurisdiction\u201d (power) in their own territories. But life and  business today cross borders, so there are rules about how to deal with foreign  court decisions fairly and efficiently. These rules are part of a branch of law  known as \u201cprivate international law\u201d or \u201cconflict of laws.\u201d  For  a foreign decision to be enforced in Quebec, a Quebec court must decide to accept  (or \u201crecognize\u201d) it in the province. This doesn\u2019t mean looking at all the facts  and arguments again. It just means the Quebec court will apply Quebec rules to decide  if the foreign court had jurisdiction over the Quebec resident. Foreign court  decisions will usually be recognized, with some exceptions. One way a foreign court\u2019s decision can be accepted and enforced in  Quebec is if the Quebec resident has recognized the foreign court\u2019s authority.  In legal terms, this is called \u201csubmitting to the jurisdiction.\u201d If the Quebec  resident didn\u2019t submit, the Quebec court may decide not to enforce the foreign  judgment. In such a case, the person suing the Quebec resident won\u2019t be able to  be paid in Quebec, even though the foreign court has ordered it. That means it\u2019s  important to know whether a Quebec resident who is sued abroad has submitted to  the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction. But this  isn\u2019t always clear. You can submit explicitly by saying so, but you can also  submit implicitly by your actions. Judges and legal thinkers have disagreed about  which actions will be considered signs of submission. In particular, they\u2019ve  disagreed about whether someone <em>really </em>submits  when they argue about the \u201cmerits\u201d to avoid a bad outcome while also saying the  foreign court doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction. (The \u201cmerits\u201d are the facts and legal  substance of the case.) This was the issue in Mr. Barer\u2019s  case. Mr. Barer was a Quebec resident. He was president of two companies, one  based in Montreal and one based in the US state of Vermont. Knight Brothers was  based in the US state of Utah, where the Vermont-based company was involved in  a project. After a contract dispute over the project, Knight Brothers sued Mr.  Barer and both of his companies in a Utah court. Mr. Barer asked the Utah court to summarily dismiss the lawsuit against him (that is,  to dismiss it without a full hearing). He said the court didn\u2019t have  jurisdiction, but also argued that there were legal reasons why Knight  Brothers\u2019 claim couldn\u2019t succeed. The judge rejected his motion to dismiss and Mr.  Barer didn\u2019t defend himself any more. The Utah court eventually ruled for  Knight Brothers. Because Mr. Barer lived (and had assets) in Quebec, Knight  Brothers asked a Quebec court to recognize the decision.  The trial judge said the decision  could be recognized in Quebec. It said Mr. Barer had submitted to the Utah  court\u2019s jurisdiction by arguing the merits of the case in his motion to dismiss.  The judge said Mr. Barer had to pay Knight Brothers over $1.2 million. The Court  of Appeal dismissed his appeal. The majority at  the Supreme Court agreed that the Utah judgment should be recognized in Quebec.  It said defendants submit to a court\u2019s jurisdiction when they make arguments  that (if accepted) would resolve the dispute \u2013 or part of the dispute \u2013 on its  merits. It would be unfair and inefficient if someone could try to convince a  foreign court on the merits while still being able to challenge jurisdiction at  home if they didn\u2019t like the result. When Mr. Barer argued the merits of the  case in his motion to dismiss, he submitted to the Utah court\u2019s jurisdiction  under Quebec law. If the Utah court had accepted  this argument, it would have decided in his favour on that issue and Knight  Brothers would have had to accept it. Mr. Barer made a strategic choice, and he  had to accept the consequences.This case was  specific to Quebec law, found in Quebec\u2019s <em>Civil  Code</em>. The <em>Civil Code</em> applies to  non-criminal legal issues in Quebec.\r\n  "

He used a camera concealed inside a pen to make surreptitious video recordings of female students while they were engaged in ordinary school-related activities in common areas of the school. Most of the videos focused on the faces, upper bodies and breasts of female students. The students were not aware that they were being recorded by the accused, nor did they consent to the recordings. A school board policy in effect at the relevant time prohibited the type of conduct engaged in by the accused.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The accused was charged with voyeurism under s.\u00a0162(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. That offence is committed where a person surreptitiously observes or makes a visual recording of another person who is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, if the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose. At trial, the accused admitted he had surreptitiously made the video recordings. As a result, only two questions remained: whether the students the accused had recorded were in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, and whether the accused made the recordings for a sexual purpose. While the trial judge answered the first question in the affirmative, he acquitted the accused because he was not satisfied that the recordings were made for a sexual purpose. The Court of Appeal unanimously concluded that the trial judge had erred in law in failing to find that the accused made the recordings for a sexual purpose. Nevertheless, a majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the accused\u2019s acquittal on the basis that the trial judge had also erred in finding that the students were in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The Crown appeals to the Court as of right on the issue of whether the students recorded by the accused were in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and a conviction entered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Gascon and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The students recorded by the accused were in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy for the purposes of s. 162(1) of the Criminal Code. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy for the purposes of s.\u00a0162(1) of the Criminal Code are circumstances in which a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred. The inquiry should take into account the entire context in which the impugned observation or recording took place. Relevant considerations may include (1)\u00a0the location the person was in when she was observed or recorded, (2)\u00a0the nature of the impugned conduct (whether it consisted of observation or recording), (3)\u00a0awareness of or consent to potential observation or recording, (4)\u00a0the manner in which the observation or recording was done, (5)\u00a0the subject matter or content of the observation or recording, (6)\u00a0any rules, regulations or policies that governed the observation or recording in question, (7)\u00a0the relationship between the person who was observed or recorded and the person who did the observing or recording, (8)\u00a0the purpose for which the observation or recording was done, and (9) the personal attributes of the person who was observed or recorded. This list of considerations is not exhaustive and not every consideration will be relevant in every case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fact that it is an element of the offence in s.\u00a0162(1)(c) that observation or recording be done for a sexual purpose does not make it inappropriate to consider the purpose of the observation or recording in assessing whether it was done in breach of a reasonable expectation of privacy. In some cases, observation or recording may not breach expectations of privacy despite having a sexual purpose. In other cases, observation or recording may be an obvious breach of privacy regardless of its purpose and it can ground a conviction under s.\u00a0162(1) if the other elements of the offence are made out. Similarly, although the surreptitiousness of the observation or recording is an element of the offence in s.\u00a0162(1), this does not mean that it can never be considered in assessing whether the person who was observed or recorded had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cPrivacy\u201d, as ordinarily understood, is not an all-or-nothing concept, and being in a public or semi-public space does not automatically negate all expectations of privacy with respect to observation or recording. Rather, whether observation or recording would generally be regarded as an invasion of privacy depends on a variety of factors, which may include a person\u2019s location, the form of the alleged invasion of privacy, the nature of the observation or recording, the activity in which a person is engaged when observed or recorded and the part of a person\u2019s body that is the focus of the recording. The fact that a variety of factors may influence whether a person would expect not to be observed or recorded is also consistent with Parliament\u2019s choice to express the element of the offence by reference to the \u201ccircumstances\u201d that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. Had Parliament intended to limit the types of circumstances that can be considered, it would have done so expressly. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The immediate statutory context of the words \u201ccircumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d lends further support to the view that this element of the offence is not governed solely or primarily by a person\u2019s physical location and does not limit the commission of the offence to traditionally private spaces. Paragraph (a) of s.\u00a0162(1) expressly circumscribes the scope of the prohibited observation or recording by reference to location and it would be incongruous with that paragraph to read the requirement that the person who is observed or recorded be in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy as also being governed by location. Furthermore, the inclusion of paras. (b) and (c) in s.\u00a0162(1) indicates that Parliament understood that a person could have a reasonable expectation of privacy somewhere other than in a place where nudity or explicit sexual activity can reasonably be expected or is in fact taking place.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Parliament\u2019s object in enacting the voyeurism offence was to protect individuals\u2019 privacy and sexual integrity, particularly from new threats posed by the abuse of evolving technologies. Reading the expression \u201ccircumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d narrowly would undermine Parliament\u2019s intention that the offence prohibit surreptitious observation or visual recording that amounts to sexual exploitation or that represents the most egregious breaches of privacy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The jurisprudence pertaining to s.\u00a08 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is also instructive in interpreting s.\u00a0162(1). Parliament must be understood has having chosen the words \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d in s.\u00a0162(1) purposefully and with the intention that the existing jurisprudence on this concept would inform the content and meaning of those words. In addition, the s.\u00a08 case law represents a rich body of judicial thought on the meaning of privacy in our society. Far from being unmoored from our ordinary perceptions of when privacy can be expected, judgments about privacy expectations in the s.\u00a08 context are informed by our fundamental shared ideals about privacy as well as our everyday experiences.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, when the entire context is considered, there can be no doubt that the students\u2019 circumstances give rise to a reasonable expectation that they would not be recorded in the manner they were. In particular, the subjects of the video recordings were teenage students at a high school. They were recorded by their teacher in breach of the relationship of trust that exists between teachers and students as well as in contravention of a formal school board policy that prohibited such recording. Significantly, the videos had as their predominant focus the bodies of students, particularly their breasts. In recording these videos, the accused acted contrary to the reasonable expectations of privacy that would be held by persons in the circumstances of the students when they were recorded.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ.:\u00a0 There is agreement that the students in this case were in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy for the purposes of s. 162(1) of the Criminal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, s.\u00a08 Charter jurisprudence should not inform the interpretation of s.\u00a0162(1). First, the conceptual framework for defining Charter rights should remain distinct from that used to define the scope of Criminal Code offences. To interpret the wording in s.\u00a0162(1) by reference to the s.\u00a08 jurisprudence would put the judiciary in the position of creating new common law offences, despite their abolition by s.\u00a09(a) of the Criminal Code. Section 8 Charter jurisprudence evolves but the meaning in s.\u00a0162(1) is intended to remain fixed as of the time of its enactment. Second, the purpose and function of s.\u00a08 and s.\u00a0162(1) are fundamentally at odds. The power imbalance of the police as agents of the state vis-\u00e0-vis a citizen that is at the heart of the preoccupation under s.\u00a08 is not present under s.\u00a0162(1), as that provision protects invasions of privacy perpetrated by one individual against another. Third, the interests protected by s.\u00a08 of the Charter include personal privacy, territorial privacy and informational privacy, whereas the reasonable expectation of privacy under s.\u00a0162(1) relates only to the protection of one\u2019s physical image. Finally, Charter values are a legitimate interpretive aid only in cases of ambiguity, and in this case, s.\u00a0162(1) is not legally ambiguous. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A multi-factored test to decide whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in the context of s.\u00a0162(1) should not be adopted. The offence of voyeurism is an extension of the criminal law to protect well-established interests of privacy, autonomy and sexual integrity in light of threats posed by new technologies that encroach upon them. Because voyeurism is a sexual offence, a reasonable expectation of privacy in the context of s.\u00a0162(1) should be interpreted in light of the harms contemplated in related provisions in the scheme for sexual offences in Part V of the Criminal Code. In the context of the voyeurism offence, \u201cprivacy\u201d should be interpreted with regard to personal autonomy and sexual integrity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An individual\u2019s privacy interest under s.\u00a0162(1) can only be infringed if they are recorded or observed in a way that both causes them to lose control over their image and also infringes their sexual integrity. This conjunctive test accords with what Parliament sought to protect by creating the offence. The ability to maintain control over what personal visual information is shared, and with whom, is a facet of privacy linked to personal autonomy. While the surreptitiousness of the observation or recording may signal circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, the two elements remain distinct. The surreptitiousness of the observation or recording improperly removes the individual\u2019s ability to maintain control over how they are observed, and, because of its permanence, a recording compounds the denial of the subject\u2019s autonomy by giving the voyeur repeated access to the observations. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Whether the observation or recording is sexual in nature such that it infringes the sexual integrity of the subject should be decided on an objective standard and considered in light of all the circumstances. While the intent of the perpetrator may be relevant, it is not determinative. The sexual purpose inquiry under para. (c) of s.\u00a0162(1) is distinct from the determination of a violation of sexual integrity under the reasonable expectation of privacy analysis. An observation or recording will be done for a sexual purpose where the subject of the observation or recording is reasonably perceived as intended to cause sexual stimulation in the observer. An interpretation of sexual purpose that includes sexual gratification is consistent with the interpretation of the same phrase in other sections of the Criminal Code. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the students had a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding how their bodies would be observed in the classrooms and hallways of their school. The visual information was subject to their limitation and control, and the technology used by the accused allowed him to take videos of the clothed breasts of his students \u2014 for extended periods of time \u2014 in angles and in proximity that went beyond the access that the students allowed in this setting, thus infringing their autonomy. The recordings were also objectively sexual in nature. The focus of the recordings was on the young women\u2019s intimate body parts, at close range. In addition, and while not determinative, the recordings were made for a sexual purpose. The combination of these factors leads to the conclusion that by surreptitiously recording images of their breasts, the accused infringed the sexual integrity of the students.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0teacher who recorded students with a hidden camera is guilty of  voyeurism, the Supreme Court has ruled. Students doing normal activities at  school don\u2019t give up their privacy rights even though technology makes it  easier to record them.</strong>\r\n   Voyeurism  became a crime in the <em>Criminal Code</em> in 2005. It is when someone secretly watches or records someone else who reasonably  expects privacy, in one of three specific situations. One of the situations is  where the watching or recording is done for a sexual purpose. Every  crime in the <em>Criminal Code</em> has  specific requirements or \u201celements\u201d that are part of that crime\u2019s definition.  When someone is found \u201cguilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d it means that each  element of the crime has been proven against them beyond a reasonable doubt.  For the crime of voyeurism, there are three elements. They are (1) the secret watching  or recording, (2) the reasonable expectation of privacy of the person being  watched or recorded, and (3) the specific situation (e.g., the sexual purpose). Mr.  Jarvis was a high school teacher. He used a camera hidden inside a pen to  record female students doing ordinary school activities in classrooms,  hallways, and other common areas. Most of the videos focused on female students\u2019  faces and upper bodies, especially their chests. The students didn\u2019t know they  were being recorded. The videos were of high quality and could be downloaded  onto a computer. The  trial judge looked at the evidence and said the students had a reasonable  expectation of privacy. But he wasn\u2019t convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that  Mr. Jarvis made the recordings for a sexual purpose. He found Mr. Jarvis not  guilty because of this. The majority of the Court of Appeal said there was  proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Jarvis <em>had</em> made the videos for a sexual purpose. But it didn\u2019t think the  students had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time. It also said Mr.  Jarvis was not guilty. The  Supreme Court had to decide one question. This was whether students could have  reasonably expected privacy\u2014specifically, privacy from the type of secret  recording Mr. Jarvis did\u2014in the common areas of their school. All of the other  elements had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Mr. Jarvis should be found guilty. They  said the students reasonably expected not to be recorded by a teacher\u2019s hidden camera  at school. To determine when someone should be reasonably able to expect  privacy, the majority said courts need to look at the entire situation. This  could include where the watching or recording happened, how it was done, and  any rules or policies in place. It could also include whether the person was  just watching or was recording (because a recording can capture more detail, is  permanent, and can be easily viewed, edited, and shared). It could also include  looking at the relationship between the parties. The majority also looked at  the way privacy has been defined in <em>Charter</em> cases. Technology has made it much easier to get, store, and share information  about others. But the majority said that doesn\u2019t mean people have to give up  their right to privacy just because there is a risk it can be violated. Technology  may make it easier to violate someone\u2019s privacy, but that doesn\u2019t mean a person  should have to accept it.  In  this case, the majority noted the students were recorded in a school. The  recording violated school board policy, as well as the relationship of trust  between a teacher and a student. The videos targeted particular female  students, often focusing on their breasts. The students would never expect to  be recorded in such a way, by a teacher, in their school. They clearly had a  reasonable expectation of privacy.  This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal \u201cas  of right.\u201d That means there is an automatic right to appeal, and the Court\u2019s  permission isn\u2019t needed. The right is automatic in criminal cases when a Court  of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees) on a point of law, as happened here. Both  the person charged and the Crown (the prosecution) can appeal when this  happens. In this case, the Crown appealed. This was the first time the elements  of the crime of voyeurism in s. 162(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> were considered by the Court."

Pursuant\nto s.\u00a0134.1(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (\u201cCCRA\u201d),\nthe Parole Board imposed a residency condition as part of B\u2019s long\u2011term\nsupervision order (\u201cLTSO\u201d). This condition required that he reside at a\ncommunity correctional centre, community residential facility or other\nresidential facility approved by the Correctional Service of Canada. B was\nplaced in Oskana Centre, a community correctional centre. Less than a month\nafter his long\u2011term supervision commenced, B left Oskana Centre and did\nnot return. He was eventually apprehended and charged with having breached the\nresidency condition of his LTSO.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 B\ndefended the charge at trial on the basis that the residency condition of his\nLTSO was not within the Board\u2019s statutory authority and violated his right to\nliberty under s.\u00a07 of the Charter. The trial judge agreed and\nacquitted B, finding that the residency condition was invalid. The Court of\nAppeal rejected this finding, set aside B\u2019s acquittal, entered a conviction on\nthe charge and remitted the matter for sentencing. B appeals, renewing his s.\u00a07\nCharter attack on the residency condition and raising for the first time\nthat the condition violates his Charter rights under ss.\u00a09 and 11(h).\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held:\nThe appeal should be dismissed. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ.: B was not\npermitted to collaterally attack the residency condition of his LTSO. Thus, it\nis unnecessary to consider whether the residency condition violates his Charter\nrights.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nR. v. Consolidated Maybrun Mines Ltd., 1998 CanLII 820 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 706, and in the\ncompanion case, R. v. Al Klippert Ltd., 1998 CanLII 821 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 737, the Court\ndeveloped a distinct approach for determining whether a person who is charged\ncriminally with breaching an administrative order can collaterally attack that\norder. This determination is made by focussing on the legislature\u2019s intention:\nthe court must inquire into whether the legislature intended to permit\ncollateral attacks on the order, or intended instead that a person should\nchallenge the order by way of other review mechanisms. In focussing on the\nlegislature\u2019s intention, the Maybrun framework balances two principles:\n(1)\u00a0ensuring that the legislature\u2019s decision to assign decision\u2011making\npowers to administrative bodies is not undermined and (2)\u00a0ensuring that\nindividuals have an effective means available to them to challenge administrative\norders, particularly when these orders are challenged on the basis that they\nare not Charter compliant. In the Charter context, this means\nthat the person challenging an order must be able to receive an effective\nremedy that will vindicate his or her Charter rights. Where no such\nremedies are available, it must be inferred that the intention of the\nlegislature is to permit a collateral attack. To determine the legislator\u2019s\nintention as to the appropriate forum for challenging the validity of an\nadministrative order, Maybrun identifies five non\u2011exhaustive\nfactors that may be considered by a court: (1)\u00a0the wording of the statute\nunder the authority of which the order was issued; (2)\u00a0the purpose of the\nlegislation; (3)\u00a0the existence of a right of appeal; (4)\u00a0the kind of\ncollateral attack in light of the expertise or raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the\nadministrative appeal tribunal; and (5)\u00a0the penalty on a conviction for\nfailing to comply with the order. The factors are not independent and absolute\ncriteria, but important clues, among others, for determining the legislature\u2019s\nintention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 On\nbalance, with the exception of the final Maybrun factor, the other\nfactors strongly indicate that Parliament did not intend to permit collateral\nattacks in circumstances like those existing in this case. With respect to the\nfirst two factors, it would undermine the purposes of long\u2011term\nsupervision if offenders were allowed to take a \u201cbreach first, challenge later\u201d\napproach to the conditions of their LTSOs. The conditions of an LTSO are\nimposed to reduce to an acceptable level the elevated risk posed by long\u2011term\noffenders and dangerous offenders in the community. When offenders breach these\nconditions, they expose the public to this risk. Permitting a \u201cbreach first,\nchallenge later\u201d approach in this context undermines not only the community\u2019s\ninterests, but also those of the offenders, by compromising the offender\u2019s\nrehabilitative prospects. This outcome is inconsistent with the objectives of\nthe long\u2011term supervision regime. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nthird factor permits a court to consider not only the existence of a right of\nappeal to an administrative appeal tribunal, but also the existence of other\neffective mechanisms or forums for challenging the order at issue. Although there\nis no right of appeal under the CCRA from a decision of the Board\nconcerning the conditions of an LTSO, the record indicates that there were\nmechanisms available to B that would have provided him with an effective means\nto challenge the residency condition. He could have written to the Board to ask\nit to vary or remove the condition; he could have applied for judicial review\nin the Federal Court; and he could have applied to the provincial superior\ncourt for habeas corpus, a remedy that offers simplified procedures that\npromote greater accessibility by self\u2011represented litigants and persons\nwith limited means. Accordingly, B was not denied the ability to fully defend\nagainst the charge of breaching the residency condition, because he had the\nopportunity to challenge the Board\u2019s order through these mechanisms. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nfourth factor permits a court to consider the nature of a collateral attack in\nlight of the expertise or raison d\u2019\u00eatre of other mechanisms or forums\nfor challenging the order. Where the nature of the collateral attack involves\nconsiderations that fall squarely within the expertise or raison d\u2019\u00eatre\nof a particular administrative body or other forum, this may be taken as an\nindication that Parliament wanted that body to decide the question, as opposed\nto permitting a collateral attack. In the instant case, s.\u00a0134.1(2) of the\nCCRA gives the Board broad discretionary power to impose whichever\nconditions on long\u2011term supervision it deems \u201creasonable and necessary to\nprotect society and ensure the successful integration of the offender into\nsociety\u201d. This provision demonstrates Parliament\u2019s intention to rely on the\nexpertise and experience of the Board in determining which conditions are\nneeded in an LTSO to achieve the balance between public safety and the\nsuccessful reintegration of the offender. Therefore, if B asked the Board to\nreconsider its decision to impose the residency condition, the Board would\nconsider matters that fall squarely within its expertise. The fact that B\u2019s\nchallenge to the residency condition raises constitutional issues does not mean\nthat it raises considerations foreign to the Board\u2019s experience and expertise. These\nissues would also not be unfamiliar to the Federal Court or to provincial\nsuperior courts hearing habeas corpus applications. Consequently, this\nfactor indicates a legislative intention to have B resort to these mechanisms.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Lastly,\nthe penalty for breaching a condition of an LTSO is significant. However, this final\nfactor is not determinative. When it is viewed not in isolation, but in\nconjunction with the other factors, it is clear that it is not decisive of\nParliament\u2019s intention that B be permitted to collaterally attack the Board\u2019s\norder. Given that permitting a \u201cbreach first, challenge later\u201d approach in this\ncontext would pose a real risk to public safety and that effective review\nmechanisms were available to B, Parliament did not intend that B should be able\nto circumvent these mechanisms and instead, challenge the residency condition\nonly after breaching it. Rather, Parliament intended that these offenders would\nask the Board to vary or remove the condition and/or, if judicial review in the\nFederal Court would not provide an effective remedy, apply for habeas corpus.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis,\nGascon and Martin\u00a0JJ.: B\u2019s constitutional challenge to his LTSO\nresidency condition should have been permitted at his trial for breach of that\ncondition. Nevertheless, once permitted, B\u2019s claim under s.\u00a07 of the Charter\nshould fail. B\u2019s appeal should therefore be dismissed and his conviction\nupheld. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nis agreement with the majority that the factors set out in Maybrun\nshould be applied; however, there is disagreement on their application. Unlike\nthe collateral attacks in Maybrun and Klippert, B\u2019s collateral\nattack puts his Charter rights in issue in light of the very real\npossibility of significant imprisonment. When these constitutional and carceral\ndimensions of B\u2019s cases are examined, it is revealed that Parliament did not\nintend to prohibit B from challenging at trial the constitutional validity of a\ncondition whose breach carries a maximum penalty of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to the first and second Maybrun factors, although the broad\nauthority conferred on the Board by s.\u00a0134.1(2) of the CCRA does militate\nagainst collateral attacks on the Board\u2019s LTSO decisions, allowing B\u2019s\ncollateral attack is not at odds with the purpose of the long\u2011term\noffender regime. Permitting B to advance his constitutional challenge to his LTSO\ncondition will not inspire or perpetuate a \u201cbreach first, challenge later\u201d\nattitude among long\u2011term offenders. Framing B\u2019s conduct as \u201cbreaching\nfirst, challenging later\u201d shifts the focus from whether Parliament intended to\nallow long\u2011term offenders to challenge LTSO conditions when charged with\ntheir breach, which is the correct question, to whether Parliament intended to\npermit LTSO breaches committed for the purpose of challenging the conditions\nbreached. Of course Parliament would not intend to make collateral attacks\navailable to those who flout their conditions in order to challenge them. Further,\nand crucially, it is breaches of residency conditions, and not collateral\nattacks on those conditions, that pose a risk to society.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When\nexamining the third factor, the three options available to B for challenging\nthe residency condition identified by the majority do not, either individually\nor in concert, provide effective recourse for adjudicating B\u2019s Charter\nclaim to the point of illustrating a legislative intent to bar B from arguing\nthat the condition for which he faces a criminal charge is unconstitutional. It\ncannot be said that Parliament prescribed any one of the three options as the\nparticular forum for raising a constitutional challenge to an LTSO condition. Given\ntheir shortcomings, neither internal review by the Parole Board nor judicial\nreview can constitute the only prescribed forum for adjudicating constitutional\nchallenges to LTSO conditions. Assuming its availability and Parliament\u2019s\nawareness of it in this context, habeas corpus cannot serve as evidence\nthat Parliament intended to bar collateral attacks on LTSO conditions; like a\ncollateral attack, an application for habeas corpus represents an\nexternal attack on an LTSO residency condition which disregards the\n\u201cadministrative appeal process\u201d contemplated by the CCRA. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to the fifth factor, the penalty upon a conviction under s.\u00a0753.3\nof the Criminal Code is up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. To bar B\u2019s attack\non the constitutionality of the condition is to deny his defence at trial where\nhe is facing a lengthy period of imprisonment. The general rule against\ncollateral attacks flows from rule of law and administration of justice\nconsiderations, namely, that it is improper to bypass adjudicative processes\nestablished by the legislature. However, when criminal defences are barred in\nthe face of severe sanctions, separate aspects of the rule of law and the\nadministration of justice are clearly invoked. The trial judge\u2019s task in cases\nsuch as this is to ask whether full answer and defence considerations and fair\ntrial rights outweigh rigid adherence to administrative structures,\nparticularly where those structures are limited. B\u2019s challenge to his residency\nrequirement is the only defence he advanced. He could go to jail for a significant\nperiod of time without ever having the basis for that sentence \u2014 the residency\ncondition \u2014 reviewed by a court for constitutional validity. The prospect of\nsomeone in a situation like B\u2019s mounting a meritorious Charter claim,\nyet being ineligible for a corresponding remedy because of the forum in which\nthe claim was advanced, is an affront to both the administration of justice and\nthe accused\u2019s Charter\u2011protected right to make full answer and\ndefence. Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily in favour of finding that\nParliament could not have intended a claim like B\u2019s to be barred in these\ncircumstances. B should be allowed to raise his constitutional defence at this\ntime and in this forum. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With\nrespect to B\u2019s Charter claim, an infringement of liberty will be\narbitrary in a manner that infringes s.\u00a07 of the Charter where it\nbears no rational connection to the purpose of the governing law. Long\u2011term\nsupervision is a form of exceptional sentence reserved for individuals who pose\nan ongoing threat to the public and merit enhanced sentences on preventive\ngrounds. The specific objective of long\u2011term supervision is to ensure\nthat the offender does not reoffend and to protect the public during a period\nof supervised reintegration into society. The Parole Board\u2019s broad discretion to\nset LTSO conditions under s.\u00a0134.1(2) of the CCRA is limited only\nby the requirement that the conditions must aim at protecting society or\nfacilitating the long\u2011term offender\u2019s reintegration into society. The text\nof the provision strongly supports the conclusion that the Board is authorized\nto impose residency requirements, and the purposes of the long\u2011term\noffender regime are best achieved by interpreting s.\u00a0134.1(2) as\nauthorizing the Board to order residency where it deems fit, including in a\ncommunity\u2011based residential facility such as Oskana Centre. Oskana\nCentre\u2019s technical status as a \u201cpenitentiary\u201d under the CCRA does not\ndetract from this conclusion, nor do the adjacent CCRA provisions which\nspecifically address residency requirements in other contexts. Accordingly, the\ntext, context, and purpose of s.\u00a0134.1(2) confirm that the Board is\nempowered to set residency conditions like the one imposed on B where they are\nreasonable and necessary to achieve the objects of the long\u2011term offender\nregime.

        "summary": "<strong>An offender should have challenged a long-term supervision order directly, instead of challenging it <em>indirectly</em> after he was charged with violating it, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     Mr.  Bird was a \u201clong-term offender\u201d with over 60 criminal convictions. Long-term  offenders are at higher risk of committing more crimes in the future. Because  of this, they are \u201csupervised\u201d after they finish their prison sentences to make  sure they stay out of trouble. They have to report to corrections officials on  a regular basis. They may have to live in a certain place or be home by a  certain time, or follow other conditions.  Long-term  supervision is meant to protect the public. It is also meant to help long-term  offenders re-enter society. A judge decides the length of a long-term  supervision order. The Parole Board sets the conditions. The Parole Board is an  \u201cadministrative\u201d body (meaning it is set up by Parliament to do things on  behalf of the state\u2014in this case, deal with parole and related matters). This  means a long-term supervision order is an \u201cadministrative\u201d order rather than a  court order. Still, violating one is a crime.The punishment is up to ten years in prison. In  2013, after being convicted on a weapons charge, Mr. Bird was sentenced to a  year in prison. He hoped to return to his First Nation in north central  Saskatchewan and live with his brother after finishing his prison sentence. But  the Parole Board decided he would be too much of a risk to the community. It ordered  him to live in a \u201ccommunity correctional centre\u201d (a halfway house) in Regina  for about six months after his prison sentence. This was a \u201cresidency  condition\u201d of his long-term supervision order. Before  his prison sentence ended, Mr. Bird got a letter from the Parole Board. It said  he could ask the Parole Board to consider changing or removing any of the  conditions of his long-term supervision order. He never did. Less than a month  after his long-term supervision began, Mr. Bird left the halfway house and didn\u2019t  come back. He was arrested over two months later and charged with violating the  order. Mr.  Bird fought the charge. He argued that the residency condition was  unconstitutional. He said the Parole Board didn\u2019t have the power to impose the  condition. He said the condition violated his right to liberty under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  He argued that being forced to live at the halfway house was like being forced  to live in prison. He said long-term supervision orders weren't meant to put  people back in prison after they served their time.  The  trial judge accepted Mr. Bird\u2019s argument. He ruled that the residency condition  was unconstitutional, so Mr. Bird couldn\u2019t be found guilty of violating it. The  Court of Appeal disagreed. It said Mr. Bird wasn\u2019t allowed to launch a  \u201ccollateral attack\u201d on the residency condition. A collateral attack is an <em>indirect</em> attack on an order or decision,  through a new or separate case. In this case, a <em>direct</em> attack would have been doing what the letter said and asking  the Parole Board to think about changing or removing the residency condition. The  Court of Appeal found Mr. Bird guilty of violating the order.  The majority at the Supreme Court agreed that the collateral attack was  not allowed. Because long-term supervision orders are \u201cadministrative\u201d orders, it  had to look at what Parliament intended. The key question was whether Parliament  meant to allow long-term offenders to launch collateral attacks on these  orders. To determine Parliament\u2019s intent, the majority looked at a number of  factors. It looked at the wording and purposes of different laws. It looked at  whether Mr. Bird could have challenged the order in other ways. It looked at  the Parole Board\u2019s expertise in long-term supervision orders. And it looked at the  punishment for violating the order. In the end, the majority said that  Parliament didn\u2019t intend to allow long-term offenders like Mr. Bird to launch  collateral attacks on their long-term supervision orders in criminal  proceedings. It noted that he had several options to challenge the condition.  It said Parliament meant for him to use these rather than indirectly attacking  the condition after he violated it. It sent the case back to the Provincial  Court to decide a sentence. Courts  don\u2019t have to decide every question parties ask them. In this case, the  majority didn\u2019t need to decide whether the residency condition was actually unconstitutional,  because Parliament didn\u2019t intend to allow collateral attacks."

He pled guilty to the\ninterference charge, and was found guilty of second degree murder by a jury.\nThe murder conviction was set aside by the Court of Appeal and a new trial was\nordered on a charge of manslaughter. The majority of the Court of Appeal\nheld that the trial judge had failed to properly instruct the jury on the use\nof evidence of the accused\u2019s after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct, which included\nevidence that the accused had moved, burned, and disposed of his partner\u2019s\nbody, as it related to proof of intent for second degree murder. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Martin\u00a0J.\ndissenting in part and Karakatsanis\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be\nallowed and the accused\u2019s conviction for second degree murder restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, Gascon\nand Rowe\u00a0JJ.: There is agreement with Martin\u00a0J. that the evidence of\nthe accused\u2019s after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct was admissible as\ncircumstantial evidence on both the issue of causation and the mental element\nfor second degree murder. However, there is disagreement with Martin J. on the\nquestion of whether the trial judge was required to provide a limiting\ninstruction against general propensity reasoning. Although the trial judge\ncould have given such an instruction, the fact that he did not do so does not\namount to reversible error. When the trial judge\u2019s charge is considered fairly,\ncontextually, and as a whole, the jury was properly equipped to decide the case\nin the absence of such an instruction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nis agreement with Martin J.\u2019s articulation of the legal principles governing\nthe admissibility of discreditable conduct evidence and its potential for moral\nand reasoning prejudice. However, there is disagreement with her application of\nthose principles to the facts of this case. Allegations of non\u2011direction\namounting to misdirection must be assessed contextually, in line with the facts\nand circumstances of the particular case. At trial, the Crown led relevant and\nadmissible evidence of discreditable conduct on the accused\u2019s part that was\nextrinsic to the offence charged and which can be divided temporally into two\nbroad categories: conduct which preceded the victim\u2019s death and conduct which\nensued it. This evidence did not pose such an elevated risk of propensity\nreasoning that the trial judge was required to provide a limiting instruction\nagainst general propensity reasoning.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First,\nthe risk that the jury would engage in general propensity reasoning based on\nthe evidence of the accused\u2019s after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct was considerably\noffset by the trial judge\u2019s introductory and final jury instructions, which\nwere neutral, fair and balanced. The trial judge\u2019s opening instructions and his\nanswer to a question from the jury insulated the jury from reasoning that the\naccused\u2019s guilty plea to indecent interference with the victim\u2019s remains meant\nit was more likely that he committed second degree murder. Furthermore, when\nthe trial judge\u2019s final instructions are read fully and fairly, it is clear\nthat he properly equipped the jury to make reasonable inferences from the\ncircumstantial evidence without resorting to specious reasoning or speculation.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second,\nexperienced defence counsel, well aware of the issue of potential propensity\nreasoning, did not raise that issue, much less seek a limiting instruction,\nduring the pre\u2011charge conference while vetting the proposed final jury\ninstructions. Defence counsel was in the best position to assess whether, in\nthe concrete reality of the case at hand, a limiting instruction against\ngeneral propensity reasoning was desirable. His failure to object to the\nabsence of limiting instructions may be taken as an indication that he felt\nsuch an instruction would not have been in the accused\u2019s interest and that it\nwas a deliberate tactical decision. These considerations weigh heavily against\nconcluding that the charge was deficient.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Rather\nthan seeking a limiting instruction against general propensity reasoning, the\naccused adopted a strategy of using the discreditable conduct to bolster the\ncredibility of his exculpatory statement and re\u2011enactment, upon which his\ndefence of accidental death rested. That the defence adopted a deliberate\nstrategy to use the discreditable conduct evidence to its own advantage is an\nimportant factor that distinguishes this case from others where the\ndiscreditable conduct evidence plays no part in the defence theory and is\nlittle more than a breeding ground for the moral and reasoning prejudice about\nwhich Martin J. expresses concern. Given the strategy adopted by the defence, a\nlimiting instruction against general propensity reasoning would have risked\nhighlighting the negative impact of the accused\u2019s discreditable conduct on his\ncredibility and thereby unravelling his defence \u2014 a risk which the\ndefence chose not to take. The defence made a legitimate tactical decision at\ntrial and lost and it must live with the consequences of that decision. The\naccused had a fair trial. The jury instructions, which both Crown and defence\ncounsel evidently considered to be fair and balanced, properly equipped the\njury with the tools they needed to decide the case before it and, in\nparticular, adequately guarded against the risk of general propensity\nreasoning. That they could have been more fulsome is not the issue. In the\ncircumstances, the principle of finality must prevail. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nMartin\u00a0J. (dissenting in part): The after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct\nevidence in this case was admissible for the purposes of determining both\ncausation and intent and the jury charge was sufficient to explain the uses\nthat could be made of this after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence and the\npossible general risks that it posed. However, there is disagreement with the\nmajority that the jury instructions adequately guarded against the risk of\npropensity reasoning. The jury ought to have been warned about the specific\nrisks of prohibited propensity reasoning associated with the after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct, as well as other evidence about the accused\u2019s character, conduct and\nlifestyle. The appeal should therefore be allowed in part. The decision of the\nCourt of Appeal to set aside the accused\u2019s second degree murder conviction should\nbe upheld, however, a new trial should be ordered on the charge of second\ndegree murder.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 After\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct encompasses what the accused both said and did after the offence\ncharged in the indictment was allegedly committed and it is highly context and\nfact specific. After\u2011the\u2011fact conduct is circumstantial evidence\nand like other forms of circumstantial evidence, it allows a fact finder to\ndraw particular inferences based on a person\u2019s words or actions. A range of\ninferences may be drawn from the after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence\nbut in order to draw inferences, the decision maker relies on logic, common\nsense, and experience. It will be for the jury or judge to determine which\ninferences they accept and the weight they ascribe to them. When evidence is\nadmissible for one purpose, but not for another, the finder of fact, whether\njudge or jury, needs to be mindful of and respectful of its permissible and\nimpermissible uses. In such cases, a specific instruction to a jury that\ncertain evidence has a limited use or is of no probative value on a particular\nissue is required.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 After\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct evidence may give rise to imprecise reasoning because of its temporal\nelement and may encourage decision makers to jump to questionable conclusions. To\nmeet the general concern that such evidence may be highly ambiguous and\nsusceptible to jury error, the jury must be told to take into account\nalternative explanations for the accused\u2019s behaviour. In this way, jurors are\ninstructed to avoid a mistaken leap from such evidence to a conclusion of guilt\nwhen the conduct may be motivated by and attributable to panic, embarrassment,\nfear of false accusation, or some other innocent explanation. Trial judges\nshould also consider whether any further specific limiting instruction or\ncautions may be required to counter any of the specific reasoning risks\nassociated with the particular after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct at issue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nis no legal impediment to using after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence in\ndetermining the accused\u2019s intent. Whether or not a given instance of after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct has probative value with respect to the accused\u2019s level of culpability\ndepends entirely on the specific nature of the conduct, its relationship to the\nrecord as a whole, and the issues raised at trial. What steps were taken, when\nthey were taken, and at what risk may all be factors to consider when assessing\nthe nature of the conduct in a particular case. Finally, when assessing the\nactions of an accused and the inferences that may be drawn from the after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct at the admissibility or no probative value stage, the trial judge may\ntake into account the disproportionality between the explanation proffered and\nthe conduct at issue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It\nis an error to relegate after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence to a supporting\nor secondary role and there is a need to maintain the distinction between the\nthreshold admissibility of evidence and the separate issue of whether the Crown\nhas met its ultimate burden of establishing guilt of the accused beyond a\nreasonable doubt. The test for the admission of evidence is first focused on\nrelevance and the tendency of the evidence to make the proposition for which it\nis advanced more likely than that proposition would be in the absence of that\nevidence. It is at the end of the case, when all the evidence has been heard,\nthat the fact finder is required to determine how much, if any, weight they\nwill place on this evidence, how it fits with other evidence, and whether,\nbased on the totality of the evidence, the Crown has proved the charges beyond\na reasonable doubt. The absence of supporting physical evidence does not, as a\ngeneral rule, make the inference sought speculative. If the totality of the\nevidence satisfies the chain of reasoning for a particular inference, then that\ninference is available \u2014 regardless of whether supporting physical evidence is\npart of the evidentiary record.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nmere existence of two or more plausible explanations for given after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct does not make that conduct equally consistent with those explanations\nsuch that a proffered inference may lose its probative force. The fact that\nmultiple explanations can be produced for after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct\ndoes not automatically mean that that conduct is equally consistent with\nmultiple offences \u2014 it simply means that alternative explanations exist and are\narguable. As long as the evidence is more capable of supporting the inference\nsought than the alternative inferences, then it is up to the fact finder, after\nconsidering all explanations, to determine what, if any, inference is accepted,\nand the weight, if any, to be provided to a piece of circumstantial evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Here,\nthe nature of the conduct (the accused\u2019s successful destruction of the\ndeceased\u2019s body and with it any evidence of her injuries), its relationship to\nthe evidentiary record (which includes evidence of a relationship fraught with\ndiscord, including violence and threats of suicide), and the issues raised at\ntrial (the Crown\u2019s theory that the accused destroyed the body to hide the\nnature and extent of the injuries) indicate that the evidence was relevant to\nthe accused\u2019s level of culpability. The after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct\nevidence makes the proposition \u2014 that the accused intended to cause the\ndeceased bodily harm knowing that it was likely to cause her death and was\nreckless as to whether death ensued \u2014\u2013 more likely than that proposition would\nbe in the absence of this evidence. It was open to the trial judge to determine\nthat the accused\u2019s attempts to conceal and destroy the deceased\u2019s body were out\nof all proportion to either the claim that this was an accidental death and/or\nto the offence of manslaughter. The relevant, reasonable and rational inference\nthat the jury could draw regarding the accused\u2019s level of culpability, on the\nbasis of the after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence, is that the accused\nconcealed and destroyed the deceased\u2019s body in order to conceal the nature and\nextent of her injuries and the degree of force required to inflict them. His\nsuccessful destruction of this evidence is out of all proportion to the\nexplanation put forward of an accident and could support the inference that the\naccused sought to conceal this evidence and to hide not only the existence of a\ncrime, but its extent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Trial\njudges bear the ultimate responsibility for the content, accuracy and fairness\nof the jury charge, but both Crown and Defence counsel are obliged to assist\nthe trial judge and identify what in their opinion is problematic with the judge\u2019s\ninstructions to the jury. Jury charges do not have to adhere to prescriptive\nformulas \u2014 it is the substance of the charge that matters. There is agreement\nwith the majority that the jury charge in this case adequately guarded against\nthe risks that are generally associated with after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct\nevidence. The jury instructions adequately differentiated between using the\nafter\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence in relation to causation and\nintent. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This\ncase, however, would be very close to the line when it came to determining\nwhether the Crown met its ultimate burden of establishing each constituent\nelement of second degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no\nevidence as to the cause of death other than the accused\u2019s statement and his\nafter\u2011the\u2011fact conduct. The case was based on circumstantial\nevidence and the jury was asked to engage in inferential reasoning and there\nwere reasonable inferences other than murder which could be drawn from the\nevidence. Further, the fine line between innocence and guilt was reflected in\nthe fact that not only were the judges divided on the main legal issues, but\nthe accused was discharged at a preliminary inquiry.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nadmitting the contested after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence, the trial\njudge correctly decided that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its\nprejudicial effects. However, the conclusion that the evidence was more\nprobative than prejudicial did not negate the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to\nmeet and address any specific propensity prejudice of that evidence in the jury\ncharge. Clear instructions to the jury about the uses that they could and could\nnot make of the discreditable conduct evidence were essential. The after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct evidence, while admissible for the purposes of causation and intent,\nbore all the hallmarks of propensity evidence that could, absent proper\nlimiting instructions, import both moral prejudice and reasoning into the\njury\u2019s analysis. The nature of the accused\u2019s after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct\nwas likely to elicit a strong emotional reaction in the jurors. Burning the\ndeceased\u2019s body was morally and viscerally repugnant. The disturbing nature of\nthe conduct was made clear to the jury. The nature of the evidence, while\nadmissible, ushered in a significant risk that the accused would be convicted\nof second degree murder not because the jury had concluded beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that he had killed the deceased, but because his after\u2011the\u2011fact\nconduct had convinced the jurors that he was the sort of person who would kill.\nThere was the further risk of reasoning prejudice. As the jurors assessed\nwhether the totality of the evidence established causation and intent beyond a\nreasonable doubt, they were likely to be experiencing the precise mix of\nrevulsion and condemnation that could deflect them from a rational and\ndispassionate analysis of the evidence. Without an express limiting\ninstruction, jurors cannot be expected to know that at the same time that they\nare being told to use common sense, they are in fact prohibited from engaging\nin what many jurors may also see as just another form of common sense\nreasoning: propensity reasoning. The reason judges caution against propensity\nreasoning is precisely because this form of thinking is recognized as being so\nintuitive and powerful. In this instance, the jurors could not have understood\nthe potentially poisonous nature of propensity evidence, and the manner in\nwhich the law has circumscribed its use, without an express instruction on the\nissue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nfailure of the trial judge to provide a limiting instruction on propensity\nreasoning is best seen here as an error of law under s.\u00a0686(1)(a)(ii) of\nthe Criminal Code. There is an undeniable connection between the\nallegation of an unreasonable verdict and an error of law, because the error of\nlaw meant the jury was not properly instructed and was not, therefore, equipped\nto reach a reasonable verdict. Given that this was an error of law, the Crown\nwould be able to rely on the curative proviso if the legal error was harmless\nor if the evidence against the accused was so overwhelming that a trier of fact\nwould inevitably convict. In this case, however, the legal error was not\nharmless. Even though a jury charge does not have to be perfect, and this was a\nsingle omission in a comprehensive charge, the trial judge\u2019s failure to provide\na limiting instruction on propensity resulted in a jury that was not properly\ninstructed to assess the key piece of evidence supporting the Crown\u2019s theory of\nguilt. Further, the evidence was not such that the jury would inevitably\nconvict on second degree murder. It was open to the jury to conclude that the\nevidence did not establish any criminal culpability. A verdict of not guilty,\nor guilty on manslaughter, rather than murder, was also possible in this case.\nThe reasonableness of any verdict of second degree murder could only be assessed\nif jurors knew they could not reason that because the accused destroyed the\ndeceased\u2019s body in the manner that he did, he was the type of person who would\nhave murdered her. The trial judge\u2019s instructions were not correct in law on\nthis point and the remedy is not an acquittal, but a new trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nis disagreement with the majority that Defence counsel\u2019s failure to request a\nlimiting instruction against general propensity reasoning at the pre\u2011charge\nconference may reasonably be taken as an indication that Defence counsel considered\nthe charge to be satisfactory and that a limiting instruction would not be in\nhis client\u2019s interests. Great caution needs to be used when speculating about\nwhy counsel acted in a particular manner at trial. Whether the Defence\ncounsel\u2019s decisions were tactical or not, a lawyer\u2019s position on the\nappropriate parameters of a jury charge, driven by tactical considerations,\ncannot change the law that a jury that engages in propensity reasoning is a\njury that is not acting judicially.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Lastly,\nthe principle of finality does not come into play in the manner framed by the\nmajority. This is not a case in which the Defence made a legitimate tactical\ndecision at trial and lost. Rather, this is a case in which regardless of the\nDefence counsel\u2019s tactical decisions, the jury was not properly instructed and\nwas therefore unable to reach a reasonable verdict. At stake was nothing less\nthan the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial based on lawful reasoning. Where an\nindividual is at risk of wrongful conviction, the principle of trial fairness\noutweighs that of finality as it is a fundamental principle of justice,\nprotected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that the\ninnocent must not be convicted. In the case at bar, the jury was presented with\nhighly prejudicial conduct evidence and was not adequately instructed on the\nprohibited uses of that evidence. The risk that the jury engaged in propensity\nreasoning is real and directly undermined the accused\u2019s right to be presumed\ninnocent until proven guilty. In such circumstances, the principle of finality\ncannot, and does not, supersede the accused\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis\u00a0J.\n(dissenting): There is agreement with the general principles set out by Martin\u00a0J.\nregarding the admissibility of after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct, but there is\ndisagreement with Martin\u00a0J. and the majority on the application of those\nprinciples to the evidence in this case. The evidence in this case was not\nprobative of intent for murder and a directed verdict of acquittal should have\nbeen granted. The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Evidence\nof after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct is not fundamentally different from other\ntypes of circumstantial evidence and may be used to demonstrate culpability. In\ncertain circumstances, it may also be used to ground an inference with respect\nto an accused\u2019s degree of culpability; that is, whether the accused had the mens\nrea required for a given offence. However, its relevance and probative\nvalue must be assessed on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis. Whether or not\nafter\u2011the\u2011fact conduct is probative with respect to an accused\u2019s\nintent for a specific offence depends entirely on the specific nature of the\nconduct, its relationship to the record as a whole, and the issues raised. To\nbe relevant, such evidence must have some tendency to make the proposition for\nwhich it is advanced more likely than that proposition would be in the absence\nof that evidence. However, if conduct could be equally explained by or equally\nconsistent with two or more offences, it is not probative with respect to\ndetermining guilt as between the offences. Admissibility of evidence as to the\nstate of the accused\u2019s mind at the time of the offence turns on whether the\nafter\u2011the\u2011fact conduct is capable of being more consistent with\nintent for murder than with manslaughter. It falls to the jury to determine\nwhether the conduct was or was not equally consistent with murder and\nmanslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt, if they can do so based on common\nsense, experience and logic, rather than bare speculation. However, a trial\njudge does not usurp a jury\u2019s function, by determining that the conduct could\nnot, in the circumstances of the case, assist in differentiating between second\ndegree murder and manslaughter, and is thus inadmissible as evidence of the\nspecific intent required for second degree murder.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthis case, the accused\u2019s destruction of the deceased\u2019s body was inadmissible as\nevidence of intent for second degree murder. While the accused\u2019s conduct in\ndestroying the body is relevant to the issue of whether he unlawfully caused\nthe deceased\u2019s death and was admissible for that purpose, it cannot assist in\ndistinguishing between manslaughter and second degree murder. The evidence here\ndid not yield any information about the extent of the injuries. Without\nevidence to that effect, an inference regarding mens rea is grounded on\nspeculation about what the evidence might have revealed about the injuries.\nThere is no logical connection linking the after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct\nevidence in this case to an intent for second degree murder that does not\nequally speak to the possibility of manslaughter. It flies in the face of logic\nto suggest that a person would only go to great lengths to cover up an\nintentional homicide, but not an unintentional one. Further, the evidence\nrelating to motive and animus here cannot assist the jury in finding that the\nafter\u2011the\u2011fact conduct makes it more likely the accused had the\nintent for second degree murder rather than manslaughter, because it is equally\nsupportive of both.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nis agreement with Martin\u00a0J. that the failure to provide instructions\nwarning the jury of the dangers of propensity reasoning requires a new trial in\nthis case. Because the after\u2011the\u2011fact conduct evidence was\nadmissible to show culpable homicide but not prove second degree murder, the\njury required strong direction as to the limitations of its use. The evidence\nrelating to the relationship between the accused and the deceased and to the\ncircumstances surrounding the day of the deceased\u2019s death did not provide any\nevidence upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could find the\naccused guilty of second degree murder.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred\nto: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Repeated and extreme attempts to destroy evidence can, in some  circumstances, be used to infer intention to commit murder, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Ms.  Jordan went missing in 2013. Police suspected that her partner, Mr. Calnen,  murdered her. They arrested him. During questioning, Mr. Calnen said Ms. Jordan  died accidentally. He said that she was going to leave him and they argued. He  said Ms. Jordan became physically aggressive. He said she tried to punch him,  but he ducked and she fell down the stairs and died.  Mr.  Calnen said he panicked. He said he\u2019d used crack cocaine on the way home, and  again after Ms. Jordan died. He didn\u2019t want to call police. He said he hid her  body in the woods, but came back to move it a couple of times, and burned it in  two different places. He said he placed Ms. Jordan\u2019s ashes near her family  cottage, because that\u2019s what Ms. Jordan had said she wanted done with her ashes  if she died. He said he put the parts that were not fully burned by the fire in  the lake. Police  found some burned belongings in the woods and unidentifiable bone fragments in  the lake. They also found text messages. Some seemed to suggest Mr. Calnen may  have been abusive toward Ms. Jordan. Others showed her plans to leave him and  steal his property. Mr.  Calnen was charged with second-degree murder (intentionally causing Ms.  Jordan\u2019s death). He was also charged with indecent interference with human  remains (damaging or disrespecting a dead person\u2019s body). He pleaded guilty to  the interference charge at the start of the trial, but said he didn\u2019t kill her.  A jury found him guilty of second-degree murder. The majority of the Court of  Appeal said the trial judge made a mistake in his instructions to the jury. It  overturned the murder conviction. It said that if there were a retrial, it  should be for manslaughter, not murder. Second-degree  murder is more serious than manslaughter. That\u2019s because someone who murders intends  to kill (or at least cause serious harm), while someone who commits  manslaughter doesn\u2019t. Everyone agreed that the jury could use Mr. Calnen\u2019s  attempts to destroy Ms. Jordan\u2019s body to infer he killed her and was guilty of <em>manslaughter</em>. The question was whether  it could use these attempts to infer he intended to <em>murder</em> her. Inferences have to be based on logic, common sense, and  experience. Some can be stronger than others. For example, if there is no other  reasonable explanation, an inference will be strong. Judges can tell juries  what kinds of inferences they are allowed to make. In this case, there was no  direct physical evidence (like blood or video) that Mr. Calnen killed Ms.  Jordan, so proper inferences were important. All  judges at the Supreme Court agreed, in principle, that someone\u2019s actions after  a suspected murder can (in some circumstances) be used to infer their intent to  commit second-degree murder. Most of the judges agreed, in this case, that evidence  about Mr. Calnen\u2019s actions after Ms. Jordan died could be used to infer his  intent for second-degree murder. If Mr. Calnen hadn\u2019t destroyed the body, it  could have showed how she died and revealed something about his intent. For  example, if Ms. Jordan had been stabbed, it would have been obvious her death  wasn\u2019t an accident. It would have been open to the jury to find that Mr. Calnen  intentionally killed her. Inferring that he moved and burned her body to hide  what he had done was common sense. Another  issue in this case was the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. After juries  hear all the evidence, they get instructions from the judge about how to decide  if a person is guilty. These are meant to make sure juries make decisions based  on the law and the evidence (not feelings or hunches). The question was whether  the judge made an error by not specifically telling the jury what inferences it  was allowed to make about Mr. Calnen\u2019s actions after Ms. Jordan died. The  majority said judges have to give <em>proper</em> instructions, not perfect ones, so  the trial judge didn\u2019t make any error. It restored Mr. Calnen\u2019s  second-degree murder conviction. This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal \u201cas  of right.\u201d That means the right to appeal is automatic, and the Court\u2019s  permission isn\u2019t needed. The right was automatic in this case because a Court  of Appeal judge dissented (disagreed) on a point of criminal law."

Under provincial\nlegislation, the Regulator will not grant a licence to extract, process or\ntransport oil and gas in Alberta unless the licensee assumes end\u2011of\u2011life\nresponsibilities for plugging and capping oil wells to prevent leaks,\ndismantling surface structures and restoring the surface to its previous\ncondition. These end\u2011of\u2011life obligations are known as \u201cabandonment\u201d\nand \u201creclamation\u201d. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nLicensee Liability Rating Program is one means by which the Regulator seeks to\nensure that end\u2011of\u2011life obligations will be satisfied by licensees.\nAs part of this program, the Regulator assigns each company a Liability\nManagement Rating (\u201cLMR\u201d), which is the ratio between the aggregate value\nattributed by the Regulator to a company\u2019s licensed assets and the aggregate\nliability attributed by the Regulator to the eventual cost of abandoning and\nreclaiming those assets. For the purpose of calculating the LMR, all the\nlicences held by a given company are treated as a package. A licensee\u2019s LMR is\ncalculated on a monthly basis and, where it dips below the prescribed ratio,\nthe licensee is required to bring its LMR back up to the prescribed level by\npaying a security deposit, performing end\u2011of\u2011life obligations, or\ntransferring licences with the Regulator\u2019s approval. If either the transferor\nor the transferee would have a post\u2011transfer LMR below 1.0, the Regulator\nwill normally refuse to approve the licence transfer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\ninsolvency of an oil and gas company licensed to operate in Alberta engages\nAlberta\u2019s comprehensive licensing regime, which is binding on companies active\nin the oil and gas industry, and the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (\u201cBIA\u201d),\nfederal legislation that governs the administration of a bankrupt\u2019s estate and\nthe orderly and equitable distribution of property among its creditors.\nAlberta\u2019s Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (\u201cEPEA\u201d)\nensures that a licensee\u2019s regulatory obligations will continue to be\nfulfilled when it is subject to insolvency proceedings by including the trustee\nof a licensee in the definition of \u201coperator\u201d for the purposes of the duty to\nreclaim and by providing that an order to perform reclamation work may be\nissued to a trustee. However, it expressly limits a trustee\u2019s liability in\nrelation to such an order to the value of the assets in the bankrupt estate,\nabsent gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Oil and Gas Conservation\nAct (\u201cOGCA\u201d) and the Pipeline Act take a more generic\napproach: they simply include trustees in the definition of \u201clicensee\u201d. As a\nresult, every power which these Acts give the Regulator against a licensee can\ntheoretically also be exercised against a trustee. The Regulator has delegated\nthe authority to abandon and reclaim \u201corphans\u201d \u2014 oil and gas assets and their\nsites left behind in an improperly abandoned or unreclaimed state by defunct\ncompanies at the close of their insolvency proceedings \u2014 to the Orphan Well\nAssociation (\u201cOWA\u201d), an independent non\u2011profit entity. The OWA has no\npower to seek reimbursement of its costs, but it may be reimbursed up to the\nvalue of any security deposit held by the Regulator to the credit of the\nlicensee of the orphans once it has completed its environmental work.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Redwater,\na publicly traded oil and gas company, was first granted licences by the\nRegulator in 2009. Its principal assets are 127 oil and gas assets \u2014 wells,\npipelines and facilities \u2014 and their corresponding licences. A few of its\nlicensed wells are still producing and profitable, but the majority are spent\nand burdened with abandonment and reclamation liabilities that exceed their\nvalue. In 2013, ATB Financial, which had full knowledge of the end\u2011of\u2011life\nobligations associated with Redwater\u2019s assets, advanced funds to Redwater and,\nin return, was granted a security interest in Redwater\u2019s present and after\u2011acquired\nproperty. In mid\u20112014, Redwater began to experience financial\ndifficulties. Grant Thornton Limited (\u201cGTL\u201d) was appointed as its receiver in\n2015. At that time, Redwater owed ATB approximately\u00a0$5.1 million and had 84\nwells, 7 facilities and 36 pipelines, 72 of which were inactive or spent, but,\nsince Redwater\u2019s LMR did not drop below the prescribed ratio until after it\nwent into receivership, it never paid any security deposits to the Regulator.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Upon\nbeing advised of Redwater\u2019s receivership, the Regulator notified GTL that it\nwas legally obligated to fulfill abandonment obligations for all licensed assets\nprior to distributing any funds or finalizing any proposal to creditors. The\nRegulator warned that it would not approve the transfer of any of Redwater\u2019s\nlicences unless it was satisfied that both the transferee and the transferor\nwould be in a position to fulfill all regulatory obligations, and that the\ntransfer would not cause a deterioration in Redwater\u2019s LMR. GTL concluded that\nit could not meet the Regulator\u2019s requirements because the cost of the end\u2011of\u2011life\nobligations for the spent wells would likely exceed the sale proceeds for the\nproductive wells. Based on this assessment, GTL informed the Regulator that it\nwas taking possession and control only of Redwater\u2019s 17 most productive wells,\n3 associated facilities and 12 associated pipelines (\u201cRetained Assets\u201d), and\nthat it was not taking possession or control of any of Redwater\u2019s other\nlicensed assets (\u201cRenounced Assets\u201d). GTL\u2019s position was that it had no\nobligation to fulfill any regulatory requirements associated with the Renounced\nAssets. In response, the Regulator issued orders under the OGCA and the Pipeline\nAct requiring Redwater to suspend and abandon the Renounced Assets\n(\u201cAbandonment Orders\u201d). The Regulator imposed short deadlines, as it considered\nthe Renounced Assets an environmental and safety hazard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nRegulator and the OWA then filed an application for a declaration that GTL\u2019s\nrenunciation of the Renounced Assets was void, and for orders requiring GTL to\ncomply with the Abandonment Orders and to fulfill the end\u2011of\u2011life\nobligations associated with Redwater\u2019s licensed properties. The Regulator did\nnot seek to hold GTL liable for these obligations beyond the assets remaining\nin the Redwater estate. GTL brought a cross\u2011application seeking approval\nto pursue a sales process excluding the Renounced Assets and an order directing\nthat the Regulator could not prevent the transfer of the licences associated\nwith the Retained Assets on the basis of, inter alia, the LMR\nrequirements, failure to comply with the Abandonment Orders, refusal to take\npossession of the Renounced Assets or Redwater\u2019s outstanding debts to the\nRegulator. A bankruptcy order was issued for Redwater and GTL was appointed as\ntrustee. GTL invoked s. 14.06(4)(a)(ii) of the BIA in relation to the\nRenounced Assets. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nchambers judge and a majority of the Court of Appeal agreed with GTL and held\nthat the Regulator\u2019s proposed use of its statutory powers to enforce Redwater\u2019s\ncompliance with abandonment and reclamation obligations during bankruptcy\nconflicted with the BIA in two ways: (1)\u00a0it imposed on GTL the\nobligations of a licensee in relation to the Redwater assets disclaimed by GTL,\ncontrary to s.\u00a014.06(4) of the BIA; and (2)\u00a0it upended the\npriority scheme for the distribution of a bankrupt\u2019s assets established by the BIA\nby requiring that the provable claims of the Regulator, an unsecured creditor,\nbe paid ahead of the claims of Redwater\u2019s secured creditors. The dissenting\njudge in the Court of Appeal would have allowed the Regulator\u2019s appeal on the\nbasis that there was no conflict between Alberta\u2019s environmental legislation\nand the BIA. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held\n(Moldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nWagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis, Gascon and\nBrown\u00a0JJ.: The Regulator\u2019s use of its\nstatutory powers does not create a conflict with the BIA so as to\ntrigger the doctrine of federal paramountcy. Section\u00a014.06(4) of the BIA\nis concerned with the personal liability of trustees, and does not empower\na trustee to walk away from the environmental liabilities of the estate it is\nadministering. Furthermore, the Regulator is not asserting any claims provable\nin the bankruptcy, and the priority scheme in the BIA is not upended.\nThus, no conflict is caused by GTL\u2019s status as a licensee under Alberta\nlegislation. Alberta\u2019s regulatory regime can coexist with and apply alongside\nthe BIA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Bankruptcy\nis not a licence to ignore rules, and insolvency professionals are bound by and\nmust comply with valid provincial laws during bankruptcy. They must, for\nexample, comply with non\u2011monetary obligations that are binding on the\nbankrupt estate, that cannot be reduced to provable claims, and the effects of\nwhich do not conflict with the BIA, notwithstanding the consequences\nthis may have for the bankrupt\u2019s secured creditors. Given the procedural nature\nof the BIA, the bankruptcy regime relies heavily on the continued\noperation of provincial laws but, where there is a genuine conflict between\nprovincial laws concerning property and civil rights and federal bankruptcy\nlegislation, the BIA prevails. The BIA as a whole is intended to\nfurther two purposes: the equitable distribution of the bankrupt\u2019s assets among\nhis or her creditors and the bankrupt\u2019s financial rehabilitation. As Redwater\nis a corporation that will never emerge from bankruptcy, only the former\npurpose is relevant here.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nAbandonment Orders and the LMR requirements are based on valid provincial laws\nof general application \u2014 exactly the kind of valid provincial laws upon which\nthe BIA is built. There is no conflict between the Alberta regulatory\nscheme and s.\u00a014.06 of the BIA, because, under s.\u00a014.06(4), a\ntrustee\u2019s disclaimer of real property when there is an order to remedy any\nenvironmental condition or damage affecting that property protects the trustee\nfrom personal liability, while the ongoing liability of the bankrupt estate is\nunaffected. This interpretation is supported by the plain language of the\nsection, the Hansard evidence, a previous decision of this Court and the French\nversion of the section. The same concept is also found in both\ns.\u00a014.06(1.2) and s.\u00a014.06(2), which also specifically state that the\ntrustee is not personally liable \u2014 it is impossible to coherently read s.\u00a014.06(2)\nas referring to personal liability and yet read s.\u00a014.06(4) as somehow\nreferring to the liability of the bankrupt estate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Even\nassuming that GTL had successfully disclaimed in this case, no operational conflict\nor frustration of purpose would result from the fact that the Regulator requires\nGTL, as a licensee, to expend estate assets on abandoning the Renounced Assets.\nFurthermore, no conflict would be caused by continuing to include the Renounced\nAssets in the calculation of Redwater\u2019s LMR. Finally, given the restraint with\nwhich the doctrine of paramountcy must be applied, and given that the Regulator\nhas not attempted to hold GTL personally liable as a licensee for the costs of\nabandonment, no conflict with s.\u00a014.06(2) or s.\u00a014.06(4) of the BIA\nis caused by the mere theoretical possibility of personal liability under the OGCA\nor the Pipeline Act.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The end\u2011of\u2011life obligations\nbinding on GTL are not claims provable in the Redwater bankruptcy. Not all\nenvironmental obligations enforced by a regulator will be claims provable in\nbankruptcy. The test set out by the Court in Newfoundland and Labrador v.\nAbitibiBowater Inc., 2012 SCC 67, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 443 (\u201cAbitibi\u201d),\nmust be applied to determine whether a particular regulatory obligation amounts\nto a claim provable in bankruptcy: (1)\u00a0there must be a debt, a liability\nor an obligation to a creditor; (2)\u00a0the debt, liability or obligation must\nbe incurred before the debtor becomes bankrupt; and (3)\u00a0it must be\npossible to attach a monetary value to the debt, liability or obligation. Only\nthe first and third parts of the test are at issue in the instant case. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With respect to the first part of\nthe test, Abitibi should not be taken as standing for the proposition\nthat a regulator is always a creditor when it exercises its statutory\nenforcement powers against a debtor. A regulator exercising a power to enforce\na public duty is not a creditor of the individual or corporation subject to\nthat duty. Here, it is not disputed that, in seeking to enforce Redwater\u2019s end\u2011of\u2011life\nobligations, the Regulator is acting in a bona fide regulatory capacity\nand does not stand to benefit financially. It is clear that the Regulator acted\nin the public interest and for the public good in issuing the Abandonment\nOrders and enforcing the LMR requirements and that it is, therefore, not a\ncreditor of Redwater. The public is the beneficiary of those environmental\nobligations; the province does not stand to gain financially from them.\nStrictly speaking, this is sufficient to dispose of this aspect of the appeal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As it may prove helpful in future\ncases, under the third part of the test, a court must determine whether there\nare sufficient facts indicating the existence of an environmental duty that\nwill ripen into a financial liability owed to a regulator. In determining whether a non\u2011monetary regulatory obligation of a bankrupt is\ntoo remote or too speculative to be included in the bankruptcy proceeding, the\ncourt must apply the general rules that apply to future or contingent claims.\nIt must be sufficiently certain that the contingency will come to pass \u2014 in\nother words, that the regulator will enforce the obligation by performing the\nenvironmental work and seeking reimbursement. In the instant case, the\nAbandonment Orders and the LMR requirements fail to satisfy this part of the\ntest. It is not established by the evidence that it is sufficiently certain\nthat the Regulator will perform the abandonments and advance a claim for\nreimbursement. This claim is too remote and speculative to be included in the\nbankruptcy process.\u00a0Furthermore, the Regulator\u2019s refusal to approve\nlicence transfers unless and until the LMR requirements have been satisfied\ndoes not give it a monetary claim against Redwater.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In crafting the priority scheme of\nthe BIA, Parliament intended to permit regulators to place a first\ncharge on real property of a bankrupt affected by an environmental condition or\ndamage in order to fund remediation. Thus, the BIA explicitly\ncontemplates that environmental regulators will extract value from the\nbankrupt\u2019s real property if that property is affected by an environmental\ncondition or damage. Although the nature of property ownership in the Alberta\noil and gas industry meant that s.\u00a014.06(7) was unavailable to the\nRegulator, the Abandonment Orders and the LMR replicate the effect of s.\u00a014.06(7)\nin this case. Furthermore, Redwater\u2019s only substantial assets were affected by\nenvironmental conditions or damage. Accordingly, the Abandonment Orders and LMR\nrequirements did not seek to force Redwater to fulfill end\u2011of\u2011life\nobligations with assets unrelated to the environmental condition or damage. In\nother words, recognizing that the Abandonment Orders and LMR requirements are\nnot provable claims in this case does not interfere with the aims of the BIA\n\u2014 rather, it facilitates them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\nMoldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): GTL and ATB have satisfied\ntheir burden of demonstrating a genuine inconsistency between federal and\nprovincial law under both branches of the paramountcy test, namely operational\nconflict and frustration of purpose. Accordingly, the appeal should be\ndismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Because\nAlberta\u2019s statutory regime does not recognize the disclaimers by trustees of\nassets encumbered by environmental liabilities as lawful by virtue of the fact\nthat receivers and trustees are regulated as licensees who cannot disclaim\nassets, there is an unavoidable conflict between federal and provincial law.\nAlberta\u2019s legislation governing the oil and gas sector should therefore be held\ninoperative to the extent that it does not recognize the legal effect of GTL\u2019s\ndisclaimers. An operational conflict arises where it is impossible to comply\nwith both laws. An operational conflict analysis is an exercise in statutory\ninterpretation: the Court must ascertain the meaning of each competing\nenactment in order to determine whether dual compliance is possible. This\ninterpretation exercise takes place within the guiding confines of cooperative\nfederalism, which operates as a straightforward interpretive presumption\u00a0\u2014\none that supports, rather than supplants, the modern approach to statutory\ninterpretation. Courts should favour an interpretation of the federal\nlegislation that allows the concurrent operation of both laws; however, where\nthe proper meaning of the provision cannot support a harmonious interpretation,\nit is beyond a court\u2019s power to create harmony where Parliament did not intend\nit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nthe instant case, reliance on cooperative federalism must not result in an\ninterpretation of s.\u00a014.06(4) of the BIA that is inconsistent with\nits language, context and purpose. The natural meaning which appears when s.\u00a014.06(4)\nis simply read through is that it assumes and incorporates a pre\u2011existing\ncommon law right to disclaim property in the context of bankruptcy and\ninsolvency. This right is in keeping with the fundamental objective of\ntrustees, which is the maximization of recovery for creditors as a whole by\nrealizing the estate\u2019s valuable assets. It enables trustees to administer the\nestate in the most efficient manner and to avoid significant costs of\nadministration that would reduce creditor recovery. Section\u00a014.06(4)\nexpresses the disclaimer right in unqualified terms and emphasizes that a\ntrustee may not be held liable whenever that right is exercised. Parliament did\nnot intend to condition the right to disclaim property on the actual existence\nof a risk of personal liability. Although the opening words of s.\u00a014.06(4)\nrefer to the personal liability of the trustee, when the words of the provision\nare read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense\nharmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the\nintention of Parliament, their meaning becomes apparent. Avoiding personal\nliability is not the only effect of the appropriate exercise of this power. By\nproperly disclaiming certain properties, the trustee is relieved of any\nliabilities associated with the disclaimed property and loses the ability to\nsell it for the benefit of the estate. The disclaimer right allows the trustee\nnot to realize assets that would provide no value to the estate\u2019s creditors and\nwhose realization would therefore undermine the trustee\u2019s objective of\nmaximizing recovery. However, s.\u00a014.06(4) does not relieve the estate of\nits liabilities or environmental obligations once a trustee exercises the disclaimer\npower. The disclaimed property ultimately reverts to the estate at the\nconclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings, as is the case with unrealized\nassets. Whether the estate has sufficient assets capable of satisfying those\nliabilities at that point in time is a separate question that is unrelated to\nthe underlying fact of ongoing liability. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\naccordance with the predominant and well\u2011established modern approach to\nstatutory interpretation, courts must read statutory provisions in their entire\ncontext, as parts of a coherent whole. In s.\u00a014.06(4) of the BIA,\nParliament has expressly referred to this disclaimer power and spelled out the\nparticular effects flowing from its proper exercise. By doing so, it has\npurposefully incorporated the disclaimer power into its statutory scheme to\nachieve its desired purpose. Courts must read statutory provisions in their\nentire context, and Parliament is presumed to craft sections and subsections of\nlegislation as parts of a coherent whole. The immediate statutory context surrounding\ns.\u00a014.06(4), specifically, ss.\u00a014.06(2), (5), (6) and (7), as well as\nthe Hansard evidence, confirms that a trustee\u2019s right to disclaim property is\nnot limited to protecting itself from personal liability. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\npower to disclaim assets provided to trustees by s.\u00a014.06(4) of the BIA\nwas available to GTL on the facts of this case. The statutory conditions to\nthe exercise of this power were met: the Abandonment Orders clearly relate to\nthe remediation of an environmental condition. Additionally, the right of\ndisclaimer is applicable in the context of the statutory regime governing the\noil and gas industry. In delineating what interests may be disclaimed by a\ntrustee under s.\u00a014.06(4), Parliament used exceptionally broad language: the\ntrustee is permitted to disclaim \u201cany interest\u201d in \u201cany real property\u201d. GTL\nsought to disclaim profits \u00e0 prendre and surface leases, which can be\ncharacterized as real property interests. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nrequirement by the Regulator that GTL satisfy Redwater\u2019s environmental\nliabilities ahead of the estate\u2019s other debts contravenes the BIA\u2019s\npriority scheme. The Province\u2019s licensing scheme therefore should be held\ninoperative under the second prong of the paramountcy test, frustration of\npurpose. Even where dual compliance with both federal and provincial law is,\nstrictly speaking, possible, provincial legislation or provisions will be\nrendered inoperative to the extent that they have the effect of frustrating a\nvalid federal legislative purpose. The focus of the analysis is on the effect\nof the provincial legislation or provision, not its purpose. In the instant\ncase, if the environmental claims asserted by the Regulator (i.e., the\nAbandonment Orders) are provable in bankruptcy, the Regulator will not be\npermitted to assert those claims outside the bankruptcy process and ahead of\nRedwater\u2019s secured creditors because this would frustrate the purpose of the\nfederal priority scheme. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In\nAbitibi, the Court established a three\u2011part test, rooted in the\nlanguage of the BIA, to determine whether a claim is provable in\nbankruptcy. The first prong of the Abitibi test asks whether the debt,\nliability or obligation at issue is owed by a bankrupt entity to a creditor.\nThe language of Abitibi admits of no ambiguity, uncertainty or doubt:\nthe only determination that has to be made is whether the regulatory body has\nexercised its enforcement power against a debtor. Most environmental regulatory\nbodies can be creditors, and government entities cannot systematically evade\nthe priority requirements of federal bankruptcy legislation under the guise of\nenforcing public duties. In the instant case, the first prong is satisfied.\nThere is no doubt that the Regulator exercised its enforcement power against a\ndebtor when it issued orders requiring Redwater to perform the environmental\nwork on the non\u2011producing properties. It is neither appropriate nor\nnecessary in this case to attempt to redefine the first prong of the Abitibi\ntest by narrowing the broad definition of \u201ccreditor\u201d as the majority does. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There\nis no dispute that the second prong of the Abitibi test, which requires\nthat the debt, liability or obligation be incurred before the debtor becomes\nbankrupt, is satisfied. The third prong asks whether it is sufficiently certain\nthat the regulator will perform the work and make a claim for reimbursement. In\nthis case, it is sufficiently certain that either the Regulator or its\ndelegate, the OWA, will ultimately perform the abandonment and reclamation work\nand assert a monetary claim for reimbursement. Therefore, the final prong of\nthe Abitibi test is satisfied. The chambers judge made three critical\nfindings of fact\u00a0that easily support this conclusion. First, he found that\nGTL was not in possession of the disclaimed properties and, in any event, had\nno ability to perform any kind of work on these assets because the\nenvironmental liabilities exceeded the value of the estate itself and Redwater\nhad no working interest participants that would step in to perform the work. As\na result, he concluded that there was no other party who could be compelled to\ncarry out the work. Second, in light of the fact that neither GTL nor\nRedwater\u2019s working interest participants would (or could) undertake this work,\nthe chambers judge found as a fact that the Regulator will ultimately be\nresponsible for the abandonment costs, since it has the power to seek recovery\nof abandonment costs and has actually performed the work on occasion, and has\nexpressly stated an intention to seek reimbursement for the costs of abandoning\nthe renounced assets. Third, the chambers judge found that the Regulator\u2019s only\nrealistic alternative to performing the remediation work itself was to deem the\nrenounced assets to be orphan wells. In this circumstance, he found that the\nlegislation and evidence shows that if the Regulator deems a well an orphan,\nthen the OWA will perform the work. In light of these factual determinations,\nthe chambers judge rightly concluded that the sufficient certainty standard of Abitibi\nwas satisfied because at a minimum, either the Regulator or the OWA will\ncomplete the abandonment work. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The\nmajority elevates form over substance in concluding that the sufficient\ncertainty standard is not satisfied when a regulatory body\u2019s delegate, as\nopposed to the regulatory body itself, performs the work. Considering the\nsalient features of the OWA and its relationship with the Regulator, one must\nconclude that they are inextricably intertwined. When the Regulator exercises\nits statutory powers to declare a property an \u201corphan\u201d under s.\u00a070(2) of\nAlberta\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Act, it effectively delegates the\nabandonment work to the OWA. The majority\u2019s alternative conclusion that it is\nnot sufficiently certain that even the OWA will perform the abandonment work\nwould permit the Regulator to benefit from strategic gamesmanship by\nmanipulating the timing of its intervention in order to escape the insolvency\nregime and strip Redwater of its assets. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Since\nit is sufficiently certain that the Regulator (or the OWA, as its delegate)\nwill complete the abandonment and reclamation work, all three prongs of the Abitibi\ntest are satisfied. The Regulator\u2019s Abandonment Orders constitute \u201cclaims\nprovable in bankruptcy\u201d. It would undermine the BIA\u2019s priority scheme\nand therefore frustrate an essential purpose of the BIA if the Regulator\ncould assert those claims outside the bankruptcy process \u2014 and ahead of the\nestate\u2019s secured creditors\u00a0\u2014 whether by compelling GTL to carry out those\norders or by making the sale of Redwater\u2019s valuable assets conditional on the\nfulfillment of those obligations.Cases CitedBy\nWagner\u00a0C.J. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied:\nPanamericana de Bienes y Servicios S.A. v.

        "summary": "<strong>After going bankrupt, an oil and gas company has to fulfill provincial  environmental obligations before paying anyone it owes money to, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Redwater was an Alberta oil and gas company. It owned over  a hundred wells, pipelines, and facilities when it went bankrupt in 2015.  Bankruptcy is what happens when a person or company  can\u2019t pay debts. Under the <em>Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act </em>(BIA), a trustee manages the process. Anyone who can prove  they are owed money can make a claim, called a \u201cclaim provable in bankruptcy.\u201d Anyone  with a provable claim will get paid in a certain order set out in the BIA. They  won\u2019t get paid, though, if there is no money left. Other claims fall outside of  the payment order. The bankrupt company\u2019s \u201cestate\u201d (its leftover money and  property) is still responsible for them, despite the bankruptcy. Under the  Constitution, only the federal government has power to make laws on bankruptcy,  so the BIA is a federal law. The Constitution also gives provinces power to make  laws in specific areas. These include natural resources and property rights.  Using these powers, Alberta passed laws saying oil and gas companies need a  licence to operate. As part of the licence, companies have to \"abandon\u201d  wells, pipelines, and facilities when they are done. This means permanently taking  these structures down. They also have to \u201creclaim\" the land (by cleaning  it up). Companies can\u2019t transfer licences without permission from the Alberta  Energy Regulator. They won\u2019t get it if they haven\u2019t met their responsibilities. Most of Redwater\u2019s wells were dry when it went  bankrupt. Dismantling the sites and restoring the land would have cost millions  of dollars more than they were worth. To avoid paying these costs, the trustee  decided not to take responsibility for (basically, to disown) the useless wells  and sites. It said it was allowed to do this under the BIA. It wanted to sell  the productive sites to pay people Redwater owed money to. The Regulator said  that this wasn\u2019t allowed under the BIA or provincial law. It ordered the  trustee to dismantle the disowned sites. The trustee said that even if the  Regulator was right, the provincial abandonment orders were provable claims  under the BIA. This meant the money would first go to pay people Redwater owed. The problem was that the federal and  provincial laws seemed to contradict each other. When laws are applied, they  sometimes overlap. This happens even when governments stick to their own areas  under the Constitution. It often comes up in bankruptcy cases. Where a valid provincial law conflicts with a valid federal law, the  federal law will normally apply\u2014as far as the conflict goes. (Federal and  provincial laws should be understood as being in harmony, where possible.) In  constitutional law, this is known as the \u201cdoctrine of paramountcy.\u201d  There were two main legal issues. The first was whether  the BIA said the trustee could simply walk away from sites it didn\u2019t take  responsibility for. The second was whether the provincial orders to remove  structures from the land were provable claims under the BIA. If they were, that  would mean the payment order set up in the BIA applied. Only money left at the  end\u2014if there was any\u2014could be used to pay for taking the sites down. The trial judge said the trustee was allowed to walk  away from the disowned sites and the abandonment costs were provable claims.  The majority at the Court of Appeal agreed. The majority at the Supreme Court said the trustee couldn\u2019t walk away from the disowned sites. It said the BIA was  meant to protect trustees from having to pay for a bankrupt estate\u2019s environmental  claims with their <em>own</em> money. It  didn\u2019t mean Redwater\u2019s estate could avoid its environmental obligations. The  majority also said the abandonment costs were not provable claims. These  costs weren\u2019t <em>debts</em> requiring  payments\u2014they were <em>duties</em> (to the  public and nearby landowners). This put the abandonment costs outside the BIA\u2019s  payment order scheme. That meant there was actually no conflict between the  federal and provincial laws.  In  this case, the trustee had already sold or given up all of Redwater\u2019s assets.  The money from the sales was held \u201cin trust\u201d (that is, by a court) during the  lawsuit. This money must now be used to abandon and reclaim the land before anything  is paid to anyone Redwater owed money to."

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0trust set up for a person with disabilities shouldn\u2019t  disqualify them from their landlord\u2019s rental assistance program, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Ms. A. was living with disabilities and receiving social  assistance (government) benefits. After her father died, some money was put \u201cin  trust\u201d for her in 2012. When something is \u201cin trust,\u201d it means someone (a  \u201ctrustee\u201d) takes care of it for the benefit of someone else. There are many  kinds of trusts to meet many different needs. This kind, called a \u201cHenson  trust,\u201d was designed to let someone put aside money or property for a person  with disabilities. Henson trusts try to do this in a way that still lets the person  get government benefits. Henson trusts aren\u2019t normally counted as \u201cassets\u201d for  programs that require proof of income or assets. This is because the trustee  has full power to decide whether, and how much, to pay the person with  disabilities. The person can\u2019t force the trustee to make any payments. In this  case, Ms. A. and her sister were co-trustees and had to agree on all decisions  together.  Ms. A. lived in an affordable housing complex run by  Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation. To qualify for affordable housing, a  person had to show they had a low income each year. Metro Vancouver Housing  also had a rental assistance program to lower monthly rent payments even more for  tenants with less than $25,000 in assets. But due to the program\u2019s limited  funds, not everyone who was eligible could actually get assistance. Tenants  applied by filling out a form. Ms. A. applied and got assistance when she moved  in in 1992, and got it every year after. Ms. A. applied again in 2015, as she did every year. This  time, Metro Vancouver Housing said the trust counted as an asset, and would be  used to decide if she could still be considered for the program. Ms. A. said  the trust wasn\u2019t an asset that could affect her eligibility, and refused to tell  Metro Vancouver Housing how much it was worth. Metro Vancouver Housing said it  couldn\u2019t process Ms. A.\u2019s application because she didn\u2019t provide the  information. She stopped getting rental assistance as a result. The B.C. Supreme Court and Court of Appeal both said  the trust was an asset that could disqualify Ms. A. from consideration for rental  assistance. The majority at the Supreme Court of Canada disagreed.  It said Metro Vancouver Housing had a duty under contract to consider Ms. A.\u2019s application  for rental assistance. The application and its related agreements (including  the lease) together made up the contract between Ms. A. and Metro Vancouver  Housing. The main issue was the meaning of the word \u201casset\u201d in the application.  The majority looked at what both Ms. A. and Metro Vancouver Housing understood  the word to mean. \u201cAsset\u201d wasn\u2019t defined in any of the documents that were part  of the contract. It was defined in a Metro Vancouver Housing policy, but the  application didn\u2019t refer to the policy. The majority noted that in everyday  use, \u201casset\u201d means some kind of valuable property that a person can actually  use to pay for things. It said it should have this meaning in the rental  assistance application. The majority explained that Ms. A\u2019s Henson trust didn\u2019t  meet this definition of \u201casset.\u201d That\u2019s because she had no control over whether  she\u2019d get any money from the trust, and couldn\u2019t count on it to pay rent. (The  majority said it wasn\u2019t relevant that Ms. A. was a co-trustee, because she had  no right to make any payments to herself on her own. All decisions had to be  unanimous with the other trustee.)  Because the trust wasn\u2019t an \u201casset\u201d under the application,  the majority said it couldn\u2019t disqualify Ms. A from the rental assistance  program. Metro Vancouver Housing didn\u2019t have to give Ms. A. rental assistance\u2014but  it did have a duty to consider her request. It breached this duty by not doing so  when she applied in 2015. The majority sent the case back to the trial judge to  decide how much Ms. A. should receive in compensation. It said the amount should  put her as close as possible to the position she would have been in if Metro  Vancouver Housing hadn\u2019t breached its duty.  This was the first  time the Supreme Court looked at Henson trusts. The majority didn\u2019t say a  Henson trust could <em>never</em> be treated  as an asset, but only that it would depend on the criteria of the specific  program."

The constitutionality of these provisions was\nchallenged by two non\u2011resident Canadian citizens, who applied for a\ndeclaration that their right to vote entrenched in s.\u00a03 of the Charter was\ninfringed, and that the impugned provisions were unconstitutional. The\napplication judge agreed, found that the impugned provisions could not be saved\nunder s.\u00a01 of the Charter, and made an immediate declaration of\ninvalidity. A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Attorney General of\nCanada\u2019s appeal. Although the Attorney General of Canada conceded that the\nimpugned provisions breach s.\u00a03 of the Charter, the violation of s.\u00a03\nwas found to be justified.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and\nBrown\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

The\ndeleterious effect of denying some citizens the right to vote is not\ninsubstantial, but it is tempered by the fact that the restriction is reversible\nrather than permanent, as any adult Canadian citizen can still exercise\nthe right to vote at any point, provided that he or she re\u2011establishes\nresidence in Canada. Thus, the restriction at issue is not a permanent denial\nof the right to vote. Just like the age requirement, it represents a\ndistinction based on the experiential situation of all citizens in that\ncategory; it is not a distinction based on moral worth. The deleterious effects\nof the limit are therefore of less significance, and are outweighed by the salutary\neffects.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.\nOakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103; distinguished: Opitz\nv.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0rule preventing citizens from voting in federal elections if they\u2019ve been  living outside Canada for more than five years is unconstitutional, the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     The <em>Canada  Elections Act</em> sets out the rules for federal elections in Canada. It says  who can vote and how elections are held, while making sure the election process  is fair. The Act says that any citizen age 18 or older can vote if they  normally live in Canada.  One of the rules found in the Act was challenged in  this case. It said that citizens who had been living abroad for less than five  years, and who intended to return to Canada, could also vote in federal  elections. Citizens who had been living abroad longer than five years generally  couldn\u2019t vote. (There were some exceptions, including for members of the  military and government employees posted in other countries.) Over a million Canadian citizens living abroad hadn\u2019t  been allowed to vote because of the rule. Many had strong employment, family,  and social ties to Canada. Some received pensions from or paid taxes to Canada.  Many couldn\u2019t vote anywhere  else in the world.  Two Canadian citizens, Dr. Frank and Mr. Duong, were  not allowed to vote in the Canadian federal election in 2011. This was because  they had been living outside of Canada for more than five years. Both had  strong ties to Canada and hoped to return if they could find suitable jobs.  Both Mr. Duong and Dr. Frank challenged the rule that  prevented them from voting. They said it breached section 3 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> because  it denied them their right to vote, and so was unconstitutional. Section 3 says  (in part) that every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in a federal  election. The Attorney General, on behalf of the federal  government, agreed that the rule breached section 3. However, breaches of <em>Charter</em> rights can be allowed in some  situations. Section 1 of the <em>Charter </em>says  that certain rights can be limited, but only if the limit is reasonable and can  be justified in a free and democratic society. The Attorney General argued that  the rule was reasonable and justified under section 1. The judge who first heard the case said that the rule limiting  the right to vote wasn\u2019t justified. The Court of Appeal disagreed and said the  rule was constitutional. The  majority at the Supreme Court said the rule breached section 3 and wasn\u2019t  justified by section 1, so it struck the rule down. It said Canadian citizens  should be allowed to vote in federal elections, even if they have been living  abroad for longer than five years. The majority noted that section 3 doesn\u2019t say anything about  residence. In our system, residence helps determine <em>where</em> you vote, but not <em>if</em> you can vote.  When deciding  whether a law that breaches the <em>Charter</em> is justified under section 1, courts first look at whether the law has a  \u201cpressing and substantial objective\u201d (an important purpose). If it does, they  then look at whether it is \u201cproportionate\u201d (that is, whether it balances the  law\u2019s purpose with how it is achieved). In this case, the majority said that  fairness to voters living in Canada and fairness in elections were important  goals. But it said the rule wasn\u2019t proportionate. For a rule to be proportionate, it has to  meet three criteria. It must be rationally (or logically) connected to Parliament\u2019s  purpose. Second, it has to limit the <em>Charter </em>right as little as possible. Third, it has to properly balance good and bad  effects. In this case, there was no evidence anyone ever complained about  non-resident voting, so the rule didn\u2019t seem to be rationally connected to the  goal of fair elections. But the majority didn\u2019t need to decide this  specifically, because the rule didn\u2019t meet the other two criteria. It harmed  citizens\u2019 rights more than necessary because it was so broad it denied people  with strong ties to Canada (despite long absences) their right to vote. This  didn\u2019t support the purpose of electoral fairness. Finally, the majority said  the rule\u2019s bad effects outweighed the good ones.This decision confirms that the right to vote is a  basic and important democratic right, not a mere privilege. That means Parliament  can\u2019t limit it easily. The parts of the <em>Canada  Elections Act</em> that limit the voting rights of non-resident citizens are no  longer in force.\r\n  "

Callow Inc. (\u201cCallow\u201d). Pursuant to clause\u00a09 of the winter maintenance contract, Baycrest was entitled to terminate that agreement if Callow failed to give satisfactory service in accordance with its terms. Clause\u00a09 also provided that if, for any other reason, Callow\u2019s services were no longer required, Baycrest could terminate the contract upon giving 10 days\u2019 written notice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In early 2013, Baycrest decided to terminate the winter maintenance agreement but chose not to inform Callow of its decision at that time. Throughout the spring and summer of 2013, Callow had discussions with Baycrest regarding a renewal of the winter maintenance agreement. Following those discussions, Callow thought that it was likely to get a two\u2011year renewal of the winter maintenance contract and that Baycrest was satisfied with its services. During the summer of 2013, Callow performed work above and beyond the summer maintenance contract at no charge, which it hoped would act as an incentive for Baycrest to renew the winter maintenance agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Baycrest informed Callow of its decision to terminate the winter maintenance agreement in September 2013. Callow filed a statement of claim for breach of contract, alleging that Baycrest acted in bad faith. The trial judge held that the organizing principle of good faith performance and the duty of honest performance were engaged. She was satisfied that Baycrest actively deceived Callow from the time the termination decision was made to September 2013, and found that Baycrest acted in bad faith by withholding that information to ensure Callow performed the summer maintenance contract and by continuing to represent that the contract was not in danger despite knowing that Callow was taking on extra tasks to bolster the chances of the winter maintenance contract being renewed. She awarded damages to Callow in order to place it in the same position as if the breach had not occurred. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment at first instance, holding that the trial judge erred by improperly expanding the duty of honest performance beyond the terms of the winter maintenance agreement. Further, it held that any deception in the communications during the summer of 2013 related to a new contract not yet in existence, namely the renewal that Callow hoped to negotiate, and therefore was not directly linked to the performance of the winter contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge reinstated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: The duty to act honestly in the performance of the contract precluded the active deception by Baycrest by which it knowingly misled Callow into believing that the winter maintenance agreement would not be terminated. By exercising the termination clause dishonestly, it breached the duty of honesty on a matter directly linked to the performance of the contract, even if the 10\u2011day notice period was satisfied. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal should not have interfered with the conclusions of the trial judge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The duty of honest performance in contract, formulated in Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 494, applies to all contracts and requires that parties must not lie or otherwise knowingly mislead each other about matters directly linked to the performance of the contract. In determining whether dishonesty is connected to a given contract, the relevant question is whether a right under that contract was exercised, or an obligation under that contract was performed, dishonestly. While the duty of honest performance is not to be equated with a positive obligation of disclosure, in circumstances where a contracting party lies to or knowingly misleads another, a lack of a positive obligation of disclosure does not preclude an obligation to correct a false impression created through that party\u2019s own actions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The organizing principle of good faith recognized in Bhasin is not a free\u2011standing rule, but instead manifests itself through existing good faith doctrines. While the duty of honest performance and the duty to exercise discretionary powers in good faith are distinct, like each of the different manifestations of the organizing principle, they should not be thought of as disconnected from one another. The duty of honest performance shares a common methodology with the duty to exercise contractual discretionary powers in good faith by fixing on the wrongful exercise of a contractual prerogative. Each of the specific legal doctrines derived from the organizing principle rest on a requirement of justice that a contracting party have appropriate regard to the legitimate contractual interests of their counterparty. They need not subvert their own interests to those of the counterparty by acting as a fiduciary or in a selfless manner. This requirement of justice reflects the notion that the bargain, the rights and obligations agreed to, is the first source of fairness between parties to a contract. Those rights and obligations must be exercised and performed honestly and reasonably and not capriciously or arbitrarily where recognized by law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The duty of honesty as contractual doctrine has a limiting function on the exercise of an otherwise complete and clear right since the duty, irrespective of the intention of the parties, applies to the performance of all contracts, and by extension, to all contractual obligations and rights. Instead of constraining the decision to terminate in and of itself, the duty of honest performance attracts damages where the manner in which the right was exercised was dishonest. This focus on the manner in which the termination right was exercised should not be confused with whether the right could be exercised. No contractual right, including a termination right, can be exercised dishonestly and, as such, contrary to the requirements of good faith.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The requirements of honesty in performance can go further than prohibiting outright lies. Whether or not a party has knowingly misled its counterparty is a highly fact\u2011specific determination, and can include lies, half\u2011truths, omissions, and even silence, depending on the circumstances. One can mislead through action, by saying something directly to its counterparty, or through inaction, by failing to correct a misapprehension caused by one\u2019s own misleading conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The duty of honest performance is a contract law doctrine, not a tort and therefore a nexus with the contractual relationship is required. A breach must be directly linked to the performance of the contract. The framework for abuse of rights in Quebec is useful to illustrate the required direct link between dishonesty and performance from Bhasin. Authorities from Quebec serve as persuasive authority and comparison between the common law and civil law as they evolve in Canada is a particularly useful and familiar exercise for the Court. Like in the Quebec civil law, no contractual right may be exercised dishonestly and therefore contrary to the requirements of good faith. The direct link exists when the party performs their obligation or exercises their right under the contract dishonestly. While the duty of honest performance has similarities with civil fraud and estoppel, it is not subsumed by them. Unlike estoppel and civil fraud, the duty of honest performance does not require a defendant to intend that the plaintiff rely on their representation or false statement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The duty of honest performance attracts damages according to the ordinary contractual measure. The ordinary approach is to award contractual damages corresponding to the expectation interest. That is, damages should put the injured party in the position that it would have been in had the duty been performed. Although reliance damages, which are the ordinary measure of damages in tort, and expectation damages will be the same in many if not most cases, they are conceptually distinct, and there is no basis to hold that a breach of the duty of honest performance should in general be compensated by way of reliance damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, Baycrest knowingly misled Callow in the manner in which it exercised clause\u00a09 of the winter maintenance agreement and this wrongful exercise of the termination clause amounts to a breach of contract. Even though Baycrest had what was, on its face, an unfettered right to terminate the winter maintenance agreement on 10\u00a0days\u2019 notice, the right had to be exercised in keeping with the duty to act honestly. Baycrest\u2019s deception was directly linked to this contract, because its exercise of the termination clause was dishonest. It may not have had a free\u2011standing obligation to disclose its intention to terminate, but it nonetheless had an obligation to refrain from misleading Callow in the exercise of that clause. Baycrest had to refrain from false representations in anticipation of the notice period. If someone is led to believe that their counterparty is content with their work and their ongoing contract is likely to be renewed, it is reasonable for that person to infer that the ongoing contract is in good standing and will not be terminated early. Having failed to correct Callow\u2019s misapprehension that arose due to these false representations, Baycrest breached its duty of good faith in the exercise of its right of termination. Damages thus flow for the consequential loss of opportunity. While damages are to be measured against a defendant\u2019s least onerous means of performance, the least onerous means of performance in this case would have been to correct the misrepresentation once Baycrest knew Callow had drawn a false inference. Had it done so, Callow would have had the opportunity to secure another contract for the upcoming winter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ.: As a universally applicable minimum standard, all contracts must be performed honestly. Contracting parties may therefore not lie to, or otherwise knowingly mislead, each other about matters directly linked to performance. If a plaintiff suffers loss in reliance on its counterparty\u2019s misleading conduct, the duty of honest performance serves to make the plaintiff whole. It does not, however, impose a duty of loyalty or of disclosure or require a party to forego advantages flowing from the contract. The dividing line between (1)\u00a0actively misleading conduct, and (2)\u00a0permissible non\u2011disclosure has been clearly demarcated by cases addressing misrepresentation and the same settled principles apply to the duty of honest performance, although it also applies (unlike misrepresentation) to representations made after contract formation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is, in the context of misrepresentation, a rich law accepting that sometimes silence or half\u2011truths amount to a statement. Although contracting parties have no duty to disclose material information, a contracting party may not create a misleading picture about its contractual performance by relying on half\u2011truths or partial disclosure. Representations need not take the form of an express statement. So long as it is clearly communicated, it may comprise other acts or conduct on the part of the defendant. The entire context, which includes the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship, is to be considered in determining, objectively, whether the defendant made a representation to the plaintiff. The question is whether the defendant\u2019s active conduct contributed to a misapprehension that could be corrected only by disclosing additional information. Contracting parties are required to correct representations that are subsequently rendered false, or which the representor later discovers were erroneous. The question of whether a representation has been made is a question of mixed fact and law, subject to appellate review only for palpable and overriding error.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The legal aim in remedying a breach of contract is to give the innocent party the full benefit of the bargain by placing it in the position it would have occupied had the contract been performed. But the justification for awarding expectation damages does not apply to breach of the duty of honest performance. In such cases, the issue is not that the defendant has failed to perform the contract, thereby defeating the plaintiff\u2019s expectations. It is, rather, that the defendant has performed the contract, but has also caused the plaintiff loss by making dishonest extra\u2011contractual misrepresentations concerning that performance, upon which the plaintiff relied to its detriment. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint is not lost value of performance, but detrimental reliance on dishonest misrepresentations. The interest being protected is not an expectation interest, but a reliance interest. And just as these are unrelated interests, an expectation measure of damage is unrelated to the breach of the duty of honest performance.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Much like estoppel and civil fraud, the duty of honest performance vindicates the plaintiff\u2019s reliance interest. A contracting party that breaches this duty will be liable to compensate its counterparty for any foreseeable losses suffered in reliance on the misleading representations. The duty of honest performance is not subsumed by estoppel and civil fraud; rather, it protects the reliance interest in a distinct and broader manner since the defendant may be held liable even where it does not intend for the plaintiff to rely on the misleading representation. Irrespective of the defendant\u2019s intention, all a plaintiff need show is that, but for its reliance on the misleading representation, it would not have sustained the loss.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Disposing of the present case is a simple matter of applying the Court\u2019s decision in Bhasin; Callow\u2019s claim should be resolved by applying only the duty of honest performance. There is no basis for disturbing the trial judge\u2019s conclusions. Baycrest\u2019s conduct did not fall on the side of innocent non\u2011disclosure. The trial judge found that active communications between the parties deceived Callow. Baycrest identifies no palpable and overriding error to justify overturning these conclusions. The proper measure of damages represents the loss Callow suffered in reliance on Baycrest\u2019s misleading representations. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority relies on the civilian concept of \u201cabuse of rights\u201d in its analysis. In so doing, it departs from the Court\u2019s accepted practice in respect of comparative legal analysis. The principles that apply to this appeal are determinative and settled. Canada\u2019s common law and civil law systems have adopted very different approaches to the place of good faith in contract law. The majority\u2019s reliance on the civilian doctrine of abuse of a right distorts the analysis in Bhasin and elides the distinction between honest performance and good faith in the exercise of a contractual discretion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Courts should draw on external legal concepts only where domestic law does not provide an answer or where it is necessary to modify or otherwise develop an existing legal rule. Courts may also look to the experience of other legal systems in considering whether a potential solution to a legal problem will result in negative consequences, or to observe that a domestic legal concept mirrors one found in another system. Even where comparative analysis is appropriate, it must be undertaken with care and circumspection. The golden rule in using concepts from one of Canada\u2019s legal systems to modify the other is that the proposed solution must be able to completely and coherently integrate into the adopting system\u2019s structure.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. Callow\u2019s recourse cannot be based on a breach of the duty of honest performance. Although Baycrest\u2019s conduct may not be laudable, it does not fall within the category of active dishonesty prohibited by that duty.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The duty of honest performance is described in Bhasin as a simple requirement not to lie or knowingly mislead about matters directly linked to performance of the contract. The requirement that parties not lie is straightforward; however, the kind of conduct covered by the requirement that they not otherwise knowingly mislead each other is not. The law imposes neither a duty of loyalty or of disclosure nor a requirement to forego advantages flowing from the contract on a contracting party. Absent a duty to disclose, it is far from obvious when exactly one\u2019s silence will knowingly mislead the other contracting party or at what point a permissible silence turns into a non\u2011permissible silence that may constitute a breach of contract. In any event, the duty of honest performance should remain clear and easy to apply.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The obligations flowing from the duty of honest performance are negative obligations. Extending the duty beyond that scope would detract from certainty in commercial dealings. Therefore, silence cannot be considered dishonest within the meaning of Bhasin unless there is a positive obligation to speak. Such an obligation does not arise simply because a party to a contract realizes that his counterparty is operating under a mistaken belief. Absent a duty of disclosure, a party to a contract has no obligation to correct his counterparty\u2019s mistaken belief unless the party\u2019s active conduct has materially contributed to it. What constitutes a material contribution will obviously depend upon the context, which includes the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship as well as the relevant provisions of the contract. Parties that prefer not to disclose certain information \u2014 which they are entitled not to do \u2014 are not required to adopt a new line of conduct in their contractual relationship simply because they chose silence over speech.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the context of a right to terminate a contract without cause, a party that intends to end an agreement does not have to convey hints in order to alert his counterparty that their business relationship is in danger. No obligation to speak arises when a party becomes aware of his counterparty\u2019s mistaken belief that the contract will not be terminated unless the party has taken positive action that materially contributed to that belief. If one party leads another to believe that their contract will be renewed, it follows that the other party can reasonably expect their business relationship to be extended rather than terminated. But an inference to that effect cannot be drawn in the abstract. In order to infer that one party, through discussions about renewal, led the other party to think that there was no risk their existing agreement would be terminated, the inference\u2011drawing process must obviously take into account the nature of the risk at stake and what was actually communicated during those discussions. Otherwise, the inference would entail a palpable and overriding error that would be subject to appellate review.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, Baycrest bargained for a right to terminate its winter agreement for any reason and at any time upon giving 10 days\u2019 notice. In her assessment of Baycrest\u2019s conduct, the trial judge did not ask herself if Baycrest lied or otherwise knowingly misled Callow about the exercise of its right to terminate the winter agreement for any other reason than unsatisfactory services. She wrongfully insisted on addressing alleged performance issues despite the fact that the winter agreement could be terminated even if Callow\u2019s services were satisfactory. The trial judge also did not consider that the active deception had to be directly linked to the performance of the contract. It is clear that the representations she found had been made by Baycrest were not directly linked to the performance of the winter agreement. The trial judge\u2019s misunderstanding of the applicable legal principles vitiated the fact\u2011finding process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Bhasin v.

        "summary": "<strong>Even when someone is allowed to put an end to a contract, this has to be  done in an honest way, the Supreme Court has decided.</strong>\r\n   Mr.  Callow ran a property maintenance business. In 2010, his company concluded a  contract with some condo corporations. The contract was for things like  clearing away snow and it lasted for two winters. The company made a new  contract with the condo corporations in 2012. It was supposed to last two more  winters. But if the condo corporations weren\u2019t happy, the contract said they  could end it for any reason. They just had to give ten days\u2019 notice. In  the winter of 2012 to 2013, some people complained that snow wasn\u2019t always  removed from their parking spots. Mr. Callow came to a meeting to talk about  the problem. The meeting went well. Everyone seemed happy enough. A few months  later, the condo buildings got a new property manager, Ms. Zollinger. Ms.  Zollinger told the committee in charge of the contract that they should put an end  to it before the next winter. The committee decided to end the contract but no  one told Mr. Callow. Mr.  Callow thought everyone was happy with his services. People from the condo  corporations talked to him and led him to believe that he would probably get  another contract for more winters. He thought this was true. He also had a  summer contract with the condo corporations. During the summer, he did extra  work for free because he wanted to encourage them to renew the winter contract. In  September 2013, the condo corporations told Mr. Callow they were putting an end  to the winter contract. They gave him ten days\u2019 notice. Mr. Callow didn\u2019t think  this was fair. It was too late to find a new contract for the winter. He said  the condo corporations didn\u2019t live up to their \u201cduty of honest performance.\u201d  This duty means that people who make contracts together can\u2019t lie to or mislead  each other on purpose in doing what they have agreed to in the contract. It\u2019s  part of every contract, even if the parties do not want to include it.  Mr.  Callow sued. He asked the court for over $80,000. This was to cover breaking  the contract, not being honest with him, and the extra services he gave the  condo corporations for free. The condo corporations said they had lived up to  their duty. They said not telling Mr. Callow certain things didn\u2019t mean they had  been dishonest with him. The  trial judge said the condo corporations knew they were going to put an end to the  contract. But they actively misled Mr. Callow into thinking it was safe, and  that it would likely get renewed again, by communicating with him in a way that  suggested this. The trial judge said he should be paid for everything except  the free services. The Court of Appeal disagreed, though. It said that the  condo corporations had not been dishonest. It also said anything the condo  corporations did to mislead Mr. Callow was about the next contract (for the  next two winters he hoped to be hired for), not the current one. There was no  duty of honest performance for a contract that didn\u2019t exist yet. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said the condo corporations breached  the contract. The condo corporations had a duty to act honestly toward Mr.  Callow. They were dishonest in how they dealt with putting an end to the  contract. They actively misled Mr. Callow to believe they were happy with his  work and that the contract would not be ended early. The majority said the dishonesty  was about the current contract because the condo corporations acted dishonestly  in putting an end to it. The  majority said the duty of honest performance doesn\u2019t mean one side has to  sacrifice their interests for the other. It didn\u2019t mean the condo corporations  had to tell Mr. Callow that they were going to end the contract early. But it  did mean they couldn\u2019t mislead him about it. They couldn\u2019t pretend it would be  renewed once they knew it would be ended.  Contracts  are agreements that give people rights against each other. The majority said  that no one is allowed to exercise a right under a contract in a dishonest way.  The civil law and  the common law are two Canadian legal traditions. Civil law, historically  related to French law, is used for law about contracts in Quebec. Common law, historically  related to English law, is used in the rest of Canada. Even though this case  was decided under the law of Ontario, the majority looked at civil law sources  from Quebec to help illustrate how the case should be decided in the common law.  The majority said that ideas from the civil law were useful to understand  whether the dishonesty was about the current contract."

(\u201cResolute\u201d) and the Gatineau Power Company (\u201cGatineau Power\u201d) signed a synallagmatic contract of successive performance for the supply of electric power. Article\u00a020 of that contract provided that Resolute would accept any increases in the price of electricity that might result from future increases in taxes or charges levied by the provincial or federal government on electrical energy generated from water power. In the early 1960s, the Quebec government acquired the capital stock of a number of private power production companies, including Gatineau Power, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec. In 1965, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec entered into a bilateral contract with Gatineau Power that was designed to unify that company\u2019s management and operations. This contract provided for the sale of all of Gatineau Power\u2019s movable property to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and the lease to the latter of all of the former\u2019s immovables for a term of 25 years. Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec was to benefit from the revenue derived from Gatineau Power\u2019s power contracts, and was entitled to use the premises leased from the latter as if they were its own. In 1982, Resolute and Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec entered into a contract for the supply of additional power. Between 2005 and 2009, Gatineau Power assigned to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec three power plants that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec had been leasing from it and that had supplied Resolute before the nationalization.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Starting in 2007, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec had two levies imposed on it under provincial legislation: a new amount fixed by s.\u00a032 of the Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec Act (\u201cHQA\u201d) and an amount provided for in s.\u00a068 of the Watercourses Act (\u201cWA\u201d) from which it had previously been exempted. The levied amounts are paid into the Generations Fund, a fund established by the Quebec government in 2006 for the purpose of reducing the public debt. In 2011, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec sent Resolute an electricity bill for over $3 million. Relying on the price adjustment clause in the 1926 contract, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec claimed from Resolute an increase in the price of electricity that resulted from the levies it paid to the Quebec government. Resolute paid this bill under protest and asked the Superior Court to declare that it did not owe the amount being claimed from it to either Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec or Gatineau Power.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Superior Court granted Resolute\u2019s motion to institute proceedings for a declaratory judgment. It declined to find that the effect of the 1965 contract was that Gatineau Power had assigned its rights and obligations under the 1926 contract to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, and declared that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec could not claim payment of the levies from Resolute. The Court of Appeal allowed Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s appeal in part, declaring that the levies in question constituted taxes or charges that were payable by Resolute to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec under the 1926 contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Brown, Martin and Kasirer JJ.:\u00a0The 1965 contract effected an assignment of the 1926 contract. As a result, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec is a party to the 1926 contract and can therefore invoke art.\u00a020 of that contract with respect to Resolute. Because the two levies at issue are a \u201ctax or charge\u201d on electricity generated from water power within the meaning of that same art.\u00a020, the 1926 contract applies to them and they are therefore payable by Resolute to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec under that agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal was justified in intervening in this case. It took note of Resolute\u2019s argument that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power had admitted that no assignment had been made. Observing that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec had framed its arguments differently in its appeal, the court rightly rejected this argument. The trial judge understood Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec to be essentially arguing that it was Resolute\u2019s other contracting party and that the 1926 contract had been assigned. In her analysis, she not only referred to that argument, but also took it into account and formally rejected it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Resolute in fact made specific submissions on the interpretation of the 1965 contract at trial. Moreover, the position of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power has at all times been that art.\u00a020 of the 1926 contract applies and that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec may request a price increase. There is every reason to believe that the trial judge understood that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec had made no concession in this regard. The Court\u2019s role at this stage of the litigation consists in determining whether the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in interpreting the 1965 contract, not whether she made the exact error identified by the Court of Appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is necessary, in interpreting a contract, to seek the common intention of the parties while taking into account the nature of the contract, the circumstances in which it was formed, the interpretation which has already been given to it by the parties or which it may have received, and usage (arts.\u00a01425 and 1426 C.C.Q.). Each clause is to be interpreted in light of the others so that each one is given the meaning derived from the contract as a whole (art.\u00a01427 C.C.Q.). In this case, none of these considerations suggest that Gatineau Power and Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec intended to achieve anything other than the assignment contemplated in the text of the 1965 contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Assignment of contract is known in Quebec civil law. It is firmly rooted in commercial life, and it enables contracting parties to meet complex objectives. It is a business technique with a legitimate malleability that is supported by the principle of autonomy of the will. Assignment of contract \u2014 seen as a transfer to the assignee not merely of rights and obligations but also of the contract itself \u2014 can be achieved in a manner that, while protecting the interests of the assigned party, is compatible with the principles of binding force and relativity of contract. There is thus no conceptual or moral bar to the assignment of a contract, seen as a patrimonial asset in itself, provided that the operation protects the interests of the assigned party. Although, according to the subjective conception of contract, the contract is viewed as a legal relationship, it is also possible to consider the contract from another angle, as being patrimonial in nature. It is this conception that helps to explain the fact that a contract can be assigned.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the key clauses of the 1965 contract have the effect of assigning the 1926\u00a0contract and are incompatible with the very essence of the concepts of mandate and administration of the property of others. It is true that the 1965 contract confers certain powers of administration on Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec; however, Gatineau Power, in selling its movables and leasing its immovables to the state\u2011owned enterprise, transferred legal rights to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec that the latter may exercise in its own interest, which is something that a mandatary or an administrator of the property of others cannot do. What is more, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec took on personal obligations that are incompatible with the functions of a mandatary or an administrator of the property of others, who as a general rule does not give undertakings in his or her own name. This operation means that the 1965 contract is one that could be characterized as a contract of sale, lease, assignment and mandate whose assignment component was necessary in order to achieve the objective of nationalizing electricity stated in the preamble.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the absence of evidence from the time of formation of the 1965 contract that would indicate the common intention of the parties, the preamble to the agreement is particularly important for the purpose of identifying the objectives of the parties to the contract, Gatineau Power and Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec. It is true that a preamble is not generally intended to create obligations, but it is helpful to make connections between the undertakings of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec on the one hand and the expectations of Gatineau Power on the other. The objectives of the parties as stated in the preamble provide insight into the fundamental structure of the contract: Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec undertook to assume liability for Gatineau Power\u2019s obligations and, in return, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec was to control the production of energy under Gatineau Power\u2019s power supply contracts for the term of the agreement and would receive the revenue derived from it. To conclude that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec acts only in Gatineau Power\u2019s name and in its interest in managing its assets and contracts is inconsistent with the objectives stated in the preamble. The contract forms part of the process of nationalization of electricity: it is Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec that is charged with generating, acquiring, selling, transmitting and distributing electric power and energy throughout the province of Quebec, which it does in its own name, in accordance with the law, and not in the name or in the interest of others; it does so by exercising rights it holds, not by exercising powers in Gatineau Power\u2019s interest.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Thus, the 1965 contract does not name Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec mandatary of Gatineau Power in relation to its power contracts. Rather, the entire 1926 contract was assigned by operation of the relevant provisions of the 1965 contract, as interpreted having regard to the objectives stated in the preamble and to the totality of the 1965 contract. If the contract is read as a whole, the interpretation to the effect that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec has managed Gatineau Power\u2019s assets and contracts must be rejected. On the contrary, for the term of the lease, Gatineau Power did not simply confer powers over the 1926\u00a0contract on Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec; rather, it transferred rights and obligations to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, subject to an extinctive term. On entering into the 1965\u00a0contract, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec undertook personally to perform the obligations provided for in the 1926\u00a0contract, including the obligation to supply electricity to Gatineau Power\u2019s customers. At the same time, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec obtained a right to all the advantages of the 1926\u00a0contract, including the right to be paid, personally, for the electricity it is contractually obliged to supply to Resolute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the term imposed by the parties for the 1965 contract does not preclude the existence of an assignment of contract. There is no legal bar to an assignment of contract being limited in time if the parties agree to this, subject to the rules concerning the assigned party\u2019s consent \u2014 the general conditions for validity of a contract apply to an assignment of contract, which is, like any contract, subject to the general provisions of the C.C.Q., including those relating to the term of the contract (arts.\u00a01508 et seq.). Even though an assignment is a translatory act through which rights and obligations are transferred from one patrimony to another, a type of act that is ordinarily absolute, there is nothing in the civil law that precludes the parties from devising a translatory act or an act of alienation whose effects are not permanent. Freedom of contract is key: assignment of contract does not follow a single model but may on the contrary, like any contract, be tailored to the intention of the parties, provided that it is consistent with the rules governing its validity. In this case, the parties were therefore free to limit the translatory effect of the assignment in time so as to tailor it to the business model that was consistent with their objectives. The assignment of the 1926 contract had full translatory effect \u2014 the assignor, Gatineau Power, transferred all of its rights and all of its obligations under this power contract to the assignee, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec \u2014 but only for the term of the agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Factors extrinsic to the 1965 contract also confirm that there was an assignment of the 1926 contract and that that assignment is still in effect. The assignment of the 1926 contract cannot have expired as a result of the sale of the three plants on the Gatineau River given that, despite that sale, the lease provided for in the 1965 contract on which the assignment is based continued to be in effect, because Gatineau Power leased all its immovables to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec. In addition, the 1965 agreement transferred all of Gatineau Power\u2019s claims and obligations without distinguishing contracts on the basis of the plants to which they related. Resolute\u2019s mill is now supplied by Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s integrated network, and it is not possible to say that the electricity it receives comes from a particular plant. The lease remained in effect in 2011, when Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec claimed, as assignee of the 1926 contract, the agreed payment for electricity as increased under art.\u00a020 of that contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Resolute\u2019s consent, which was necessary in order for the assignment of the contract to be valid, was given in the 1926 contract. It is clear from the very words of art.\u00a022 of that contract that the parties consented in advance to any possible assignment of the contract. If the conception of assignment of contract as a whole is adopted, the assigned party\u2019s consent is required. If assignment is seen as the transfer of the contract itself, which implies the transfer of party status to the assignee, the assigned party\u2019s consent is necessary from the standpoint of both relativity of the assignment and binding force of the assigned contract. In order to give effect to the principle of relativity of contract, the transfer of the existing contract to a new contracting party requires the consent of a party on which a new partner is imposed that has characteristics not possessed by the assignor. The principle of binding force of contract also leads to the conclusion that the assignee cannot assert him or herself as a new contracting party of the assigned party without the latter\u2019s consent. The assigned party\u2019s consent is required even where the assignment of contract is imperfect in order to ensure conformity with the general principles of the law of contracts and to protect the assigned party. The assigned party\u2019s consent can, as in this case, be given in advance: because Resolute\u2019s predecessor had consented to the assignment in advance in the 1926 contract, Gatineau Power validly transferred its status as party to the contract to the assignee, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec. Gatineau Power thus serves as a personal surety against any future breach by Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec of its obligations. The fact that the assignment in this case is imperfect does not change the outcome, since it is nonetheless Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec that, as a principal debtor that also has party status, supplies electricity and can therefore raise the price of the electricity under art.\u00a020.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 If consent was given in advance, however, the assignment of a contract cannot be set up against the assigned party if he or she was never informed of the assignment. In the absence of express rules on assignment of contract, the conditions for setting up such an assignment can be clarified by considering the rules with respect to assignment of claim. An assignment of claim may be set up against the assigned party as soon as that party has acquiesced in it or received a copy or a pertinent extract of the act of assignment or any other evidence of the assignment which may be set up against the assignor. In this case, the evidence shows that Resolute\u2019s predecessor and Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec signed a new contract in 1982 for the distribution of power that was in addition to what was provided for in the 1926 contract. Thus, Resolute knew it was doing business with Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec well before the litigation began and had acquiesced in that situation. The assignment may therefore be set up against it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The assignment of the 1926 contract does not violate the rule against making an assignment of claim (and therefore, by extension, an assignment of contract) that is injurious to the rights of the debtor or that renders his or her obligation more onerous (art.\u00a01637 para.\u00a02 C.C.Q.). The increase in the price of electricity resulted not from the assignment of contract, but from legislative changes. The parties to the 1926 contract expressly provided that they would be subject to future provincial laws and that those laws would affect their contractual relationship. The assignment of the 1926 contract therefore had full effect with respect to Resolute, and Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec is entitled, as a party to that contract, to claim payment from it for the taxes and charges contemplated in art.\u00a020.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Article\u00a020 of the 1926 contract applies to the levies provided for in s.\u00a032 of the HQA and s.\u00a068 of the WA, and Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec can therefore claim payment for them from Resolute. First, although Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec is a mandatary of the government, it is nonetheless a separate entity, and the legislature can therefore impose a tax or charge on it. The amounts that are collected differ from the revenues collected by the government when Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec declares dividends, even though all of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s shares are owned by the government; they cannot be lumped together. Next, the amounts payable under s.\u00a068 of the\u00a0WA, like the levy under s.\u00a032 of the HQA, constitute a tax or a charge, and not an allocation of government revenues. The fact that the legislature decided to allocate the collected amounts to the Generations Fund does not change the nature of the levy. The nature of the levy must not be confused with the place where it is to be deposited. Moreover, a reading of the contract suggests that the parties\u2019 intention was to have the price for electricity remain stable, subject to the imposition of new taxes and charges, such that the seller company\u2019s net revenue would remain constant but it would not be penalized if its production costs rose because of an unforeseen tax or charge levied upon electricity. Lastly, no claim for payment of the tax under the WA was extinguished by prescription or tacitly waived.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per\u00a0C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the Superior Court\u2019s decision restored. The trial judge did not make a reviewable error in finding that Gatineau Power had not assigned the 1926 contract to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and that the 1965 contract had instead made Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec a mandatary of Gatineau Power. Gatineau Power\u2019s status as a party to the 1926 contract was therefore not transferred to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, and Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec is a third person in relation to that contract. The relativity of the 1926 contract prevents Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec from invoking the price adjustment clause to pass on the taxes or charges for which it may be liable. As a result, Resolute is not required to pay either the charge under s.\u00a032 HQA or the one under s.\u00a068 WA. The Court of Appeal should not have intervened by analyzing the case from a new angle without regard for the Superior Court\u2019s findings of fact and the judicial contract before it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The characterization of a contract must be considered to be a question of mixed fact and law when it involves the consideration of a multitude of facts, such as the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract and how the parties subsequently applied it. In such a case, the applicable standard for appellate intervention is palpable and overriding error, unless there is an extricable error of law. Appellate courts must take a highly deferential approach to mixed questions, because the answer to such questions is intertwined with the weight assigned to the evidence by the trial judge, who is in a much better position than an appellate court to assess and weigh such matters. To determine whether there is a reviewable error in the trial judge\u2019s reasons in this case, the Court must review the Superior Court\u2019s decision and consider the arguments presented to that court and the manner in which it disposed of them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, the trial judge did not make a reviewable error in rejecting the three arguments made by Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power with respect to assignment. At no time did Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power argue in the Superior Court that the 1965 contract had effected an assignment of the 1926 contract. Rather, they argued that the assignment had occurred either in 1982, when Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Resolute entered into a contract for the supply of additional electric power, or in 1997, when Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec became the exclusive distributor of electricity under the Act respecting the R\u00e9gie de l\u2019\u00e9nergie, or in 2005\u20112006, when Gatineau Power transferred the ownership of its power plants to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec. The trial judge correctly understood that the issue was whether the contract had been assigned either in 1982, in 1997 or in 2005\u20112006. She decided the case as it had been presented to her. She did not make a reviewable error in interpreting the 1982 contract as not effecting an assignment, in not accepting the argument that the coming into force of the Act respecting the R\u00e9gie de l\u2019\u00e9nergie in 1997 had affected the relativity of the 1926 contract, or in rejecting the argument that the transfer of the ownership of the plants in 2005\u20112006 had effected an assignment of the 1926 contract, given the absence of evidence of the setting up of an assignment against Resolute and the fact that a reading of the acts of transfer reveals no so\u2011called assignment of contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, the trial judge did not make a palpable and overriding error in accepting Resolute\u2019s argument\u00a0\u2014\u00a0uncontested before her\u00a0\u2014\u00a0that the 1965 contract had not effected an assignment. The evidence in the record supported such a conclusion, and it was entirely justified for her to give effect to the judicial contract between the parties by accepting Resolute\u2019s uncontested argument after she rejected the three arguments made by Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The parties\u2019 subsequent conduct confirms the trial judge\u2019s conclusion in this regard. Article\u00a01426 of the C.C.Q. calls for consideration of the parties\u2019 subsequent conduct when interpreting a contract. This rule is based on the following premise: it is assumed that the parties seek to perform their obligations rather than to evade them, and that their conduct until the day a dispute arises is an indicator of their common intention crystallized earlier in their contract. The parties\u2019 subsequent conduct takes on even greater importance in the case of long\u2011term contracts, because the more time has elapsed, the more compelling the parties\u2019 subsequent conduct will be as evidence of their original intent. The trial judge relied largely on the facts put before her and did not make a palpable and overriding error in relying on the parties\u2019 subsequent conduct. Indeed, the absence of evidence of the setting up of an assignment against Resolute was in addition to the financial statements making no reference to any assignment, the notices of renewal all addressed to Gatineau Power, the invoices indicating the electricity supplied under the 1926 contract separately from that supplied under the 1982 contract, the testimony of a Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec manager confirming that there had been no assignment, and the opportunistic reinterpretation of the parties\u2019 legal situation in order to treat it as an assignment of the 1926 contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge was also bound by the judicial contract between the parties, in which the characterization of the 1965 contract was not in dispute. Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power, which had the burden of proof, did not dispute the fact that the 1965 contract had made Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec a mandatary and had not assigned the 1926 contract. Rather, their position was that the 1965 contract was a mandate, sale and lease agreement and that the assignment had occurred later, in 1982 at the earliest. Only Resolute discussed how the terms of the 1965 contract should be interpreted, and it did so to establish that the contract had not effected an assignment, despite the fact that it did not have the burden of proof. Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power offered no interpretation of the terms of the 1965 contract that would give it a scope different from that proposed by Resolute. It is justified for a trial judge to accept an uncontested argument and not to undertake a needless interpretation exercise. To require otherwise would undermine the very foundations of the adversarial system. Article\u00a010 of the Code of Civil Procedure reiterates the adversarial nature of the civil justice system. It is the parties who control the course of their case, not the courts (art.\u00a019 para.\u00a01 C.C.P.). Accordingly, the courts cannot base their decisions on arguments or rationales that have not been debated (art.\u00a017 para.\u00a02 C.C.P.). The principle of proportionality and of proper administration of judicial resources requires nothing less of them (art.\u00a018 C.C.P.).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The issues between the parties become joined once both sides have presented their arguments; the judicial contract then reflects the procedural relationship (lien d\u2019instance) between the parties with respect to the questions that are in issue and those that are not in dispute. The trial judge is also bound by this judicial contract. This means that the judge cannot disregard the contract and rule on a ground or an argument that is not in issue. This holds true even when the judicial contract relates to a question of law, unless it is a matter of public order that would allow the judge to go beyond the parties\u2019 consent. Although an admission of law is not, strictly speaking, binding on the courts, they must nonetheless take note of a party\u2019s decision not to contest, and thus to acknowledge, the existence of a legal situation. The judge\u2019s task is primarily to look where the parties ask him or her to look, not to reframe the debate. The role of a court that has to render a declaratory judgment is limited to resolving a genuine problem between the parties with respect to the scope of a specific juridical act; the court must therefore take care to remain within the defined parameters of the debate before it so as to avoid prejudicing the future legal arguments raised by the parties or the interests of third persons who are not parties to the proceeding.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the core of the issue forming the judicial contract between the parties had to do with the assignment at one of the three suggested points in time. The parties\u2019 procedural relationship did not encompass the characterization of the 1965 contract. The trial judge focused her analysis on the core of that issue. After she rejected the arguments of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec and Gatineau Power, all that remained was Resolute\u2019s uncontested argument that the 1965 contract had not effected an assignment either, a legal situation that was confirmed, in her view, by the absence of evidence of the setting up of an assignment against Resolute and by the evidence in the record concerning the parties\u2019 subsequent conduct. As a result, the trial judge did not have to consider the interpretation of the 1965 contract in detail, and it is not appropriate on appeal to engage in an exercise that was not fully before the trial judge by analyzing the 1965 contract at length.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Since the trial judge did not make a reviewable error in finding that the 1926 contract had not been assigned to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec, Gatineau Power did not transfer its status as a party to that contract to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec. As it is not a party to the 1926 contract, Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec cannot increase the price of the electricity supplied to Resolute. This is because status as a party to the 1926 contract is what makes it possible to invoke the price adjustment clause in order to pass on any \u201ctax\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d paid. The principle of relativity of contract means that a contract has effect only between the contracting parties and that it does not affect third persons (art.\u00a01440 C.C.Q.). As a result, third persons cannot rely on the content of a contract for their own benefit, except in a few very limited cases, none of which applies here. The 1926 contract states that the only contracting parties are Resolute and Gatineau Power. The relativity of the 1926 contract therefore prevents Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec from invoking the price adjustment clause in that contract in order to pass on the charges it paid under the HQA and the WA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Uniprix inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec could make a company pay government charges  based on a contract with a power company which was transferred to it, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n  In  1926, the Canadian International Paper Company concluded a contract with the  Gatineau Power Company. The paper company agreed to pay the power company for  electricity to run its mills.  The  contract said the paper company could have to cover any \u201ctaxes or charges\u201d the  power company paid to the Quebec government. The contract also said it would apply  to the \u201csuccessors or assigns\u201d of both companies. That meant anyone who took  over the company\u2019s rights would have to follow it. The  Quebec government created Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec in the 1940s. The government wanted to  nationalize electricity (that is, make it publicly-owned). In the 1960s,  Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec bought most of Gatineau Power\u2019s shares. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec supplied  power to the paper company, and the paper company paid for it, like the 1926  contract said. The paper company concluded a contract with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec for  more power in 1982. That contract referred to the contract with Gatineau Power  in 1926. The paper company\u2019s electricity bills came from Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec from at  least 1999 on.  In  2007, the Government of Quebec started making Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec pay two yearly amounts.  In 2011, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec sent the paper company a bill for $3 million to cover  these amounts.  Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec  said it could do this because of the 1926 contract. It said Gatineau Power  \u201cassigned\u201d (transferred) the contract to Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec in 1965. The paper  company said the 1965 contract made Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec a \u201cmandatary\u201d of Gatineau  Power. That meant Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec was acting on behalf of Gatineau Power, not on  behalf of itself. The paper company said its contract was with Gatineau Power.  It said it didn\u2019t owe Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec anything. Even if this wasn\u2019t the case, it  said assigning the contract wasn\u2019t allowed. It also said the amounts weren\u2019t  \u201ctaxes or charges.\u201d (Everyone agreed the paper company that signed the contract  in 1926 eventually became Resolute FP.)  The  trial judge said Gatineau Power didn\u2019t assign the 1926 contract to Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec.  She said the 1965 contract made Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec a \u201cmandatary\u201d of Gatineau Power.  She also said the amounts owed weren\u2019t \u201ctaxes or charges.\u201d That meant Resolute  FP didn\u2019t have to pay. The Court of Appeal said the 1926 contract <em>was </em>assigned by the 1965 contract. It also  said the amounts <em>were </em>\u201ctaxes or  charges.\u201d  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeal, but  for different reasons. They said the trial judge made important mistakes in  saying the 1965 contract was a \u201cmandate.\u201d (That is, it made Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec a  \u201cmandatary\u201d acting on Gatineau Power\u2019s behalf.) This meant the Court of Appeal could  intervene.  The  majority said Gatineau Power assigned the contract with the paper company to  Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec in 1965. If Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec was acting on <em>behalf</em> of Gatineau Power, like Resolute FP argued, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec  wouldn\u2019t get to keep the profits for itself. And it wouldn\u2019t be responsible for  the debts owed to Resolute FP itself. The  majority said that a party to a contract needs the other party\u2019s permission to  assign it to someone else. In this case, Gatineau Power had the permission in  advance. The 1926 contract said it was allowed. The paper company (which later  became Resolute FP) also knew it was doing business with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec since at  least 1982.  The majority said it didn    \u2019t matter if the amounts  charged by the government were considered \u201ctaxes\u201d or not. That\u2019s because the  1926 contract said the paper company would have to pay increases in \u201ctaxes or  charges.\u201d It also didn\u2019t matter if Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec was owned by the government.  Provinces are allowed to tax or charge Crown corporations (corporations they  own). Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec could ask Resolute FP to cover these taxes or charges  because it was assigned the 1926 contract, and that contract said so. \u00a0The <em>Civil Code  of Qu</em><em>\u00e9bec</em> applies  to most non-criminal legal issues in Quebec. Part of the issue in this case was  that there weren\u2019t explicit rules about assigning contracts in the <em>Civil Code</em>. The Court last looked at a  contract that was assigned in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37813-eng.aspx\">Modern  Cleaning Concept Inc. v. Comit\u00e9 paritaire</a></em>."

Registrants must continue to report in person at least once a year and every time certain information changes. Registrants must comply for 10 years if the maximum sentence for the sexual offence they committed is 10 years or less, or for life, if the maximum sentence is greater than 10 years or if they committed more than one sexual offence. There is some opportunity, based on an individualized assessment, for those found guilty of sexual offences to be removed or exempted from the registry or relieved of their reporting obligations. By contrast, no one found NCRMD of sexual offences can ever be removed from the registry or exempted from reporting, even if they have received an absolute discharge from a review board.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In June 2002, G was found NCRMD of two sexual offences. In August 2003, he was absolutely discharged by the Ontario Review Board on the basis that he no longer represented a significant risk to the safety of the public. Despite this discharge, G was placed on the provincial sex offender registry in August 2004, as required by Christopher\u2019s Law. G brought an application challenging Christopher\u2019s Law as it applies to persons found NCRMD in respect of sexual offences who have been absolutely discharged. He argued that the inability of people in his situation to be granted an exemption or be removed from the provincial registry or relieved of reporting requirements, as compared to those found guilty of the same offences, violates ss.\u00a07 and 15(1) of the Charter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The application judge dismissed G\u2019s application, but the Court of Appeal allowed G\u2019s appeal on the basis of his s.\u00a015(1) claim, and concluded that the s.\u00a015(1) breach was not justified under s.\u00a01 of the Charter. It declared Christopher\u2019s Law to be of no force or effect as it applies to those found NCRMD who were granted an absolute discharge, suspended the declaration of invalidity for 12 months, and exempted G from that suspension by relieving him of further compliance with the legislation and ordering that his information be deleted from the registry immediately. The Attorney General of Ontario appealed to the Court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Christopher\u2019s Law draws discriminatory distinctions between people found guilty and people found NCRMD of sexual offences on the basis of mental disability, contrary to s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter. These discriminatory distinctions cannot be justified in a free and democratic society. The remedy granted by the Court of Appeal was appropriate, and its orders should be upheld.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The first step in determining whether a law infringes s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter asks whether the law, on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds. In the present case, there are clear distinctions drawn based on the enumerated ground of mental disability. Offenders found guilty of sexual offences can be exempted from having to report and register in the first place by receiving a discharge in their sentencing hearing. Convicted registrants can also be removed from the sex offender registry by receiving a free pardon, and can be relieved of the obligation to continue to report upon receipt of a free pardon or record suspension. However, those found NCRMD of the same offences have no such opportunities, even if they have received an absolute discharge. NCRMD individuals are plainly subjected to different treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second step asks whether the challenged law imposes a burden or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating disadvantage, including historical disadvantage. By denying those found NCRMD opportunities for exemption, removal, or relief from the sex offender registry, Christopher\u2019s Law effectively presumes that they are inherently and permanently dangerous. It considers NCRMD individuals a perpetual threat to the public. Christopher\u2019s Law imposes a burden on people found NCRMD in a manner that violates s.\u00a015(1) in two respects: the law itself invokes prejudicial and stereotypical views about persons with mental illnesses; and the law puts those found NCRMD in a worse position than those found guilty. Both effects perpetuate the historical and enduring disadvantage experienced by persons with mental illnesses. The distinctions drawn by Christopher\u2019s Law are thus discriminatory.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The burden of establishing that the infringement of s.\u00a015(1) is justified under s.\u00a01 of the Charter belongs to the Attorney General, on a balance of probabilities. First, there must be a pressing and substantial objective for the infringing measure. Second, the infringing measure must not disproportionately interfere with the s.\u00a015(1) right; it must be rationally connected to the objective, the means chosen must interfere as little as possible with the s.\u00a015(1) right, and the benefits of the infringing measure must outweigh its negative effects. In the present case, the parties agree that the purpose of Christopher\u2019s Law is to assist in the investigation and prevention of sexual offences, that this purpose is pressing and substantial, and that the limits it places on Charter rights are rationally connected to that purpose. However, Christopher\u2019s Law is not minimally impairing of the s.\u00a015(1) rights of NCRMD individuals. The inclusion of any method of exempting and removing those found NCRMD from the registry based on individualized assessment would be less impairing. Thus, the Attorney General has not justified the s.\u00a015(1) infringement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The determination of appropriate remedies for legislation that violates the Charter must follow a principled approach. Section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, provides in absolute terms that laws inconsistent with the Constitution are of no force or effect to the extent of the inconsistency. A general declaration is the means by which courts give full effect to the broad terms of s.\u00a052(1). A court faced with a constitutional challenge to a law must determine to what extent it is unconstitutional and declare it to be so. A measure of discretion is inevitable in determining how to respond to an inconsistency between legislation and the Constitution. While s.\u00a052(1) recognizes the primacy of the Constitution, including the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and groups guaranteed by the Charter, fashioning constitutional remedies inevitably implicates other \u2014 at times competing \u2014 constitutional principles. Courts must strike an appropriate balance between these principles in determining how to give effect to s.\u00a052(1) in a manner that best aligns with Canada\u2019s constitutional order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court\u2019s leading decision on remedies for laws that violate the Charter, Schachter v. Canada, 1992 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, provides helpful guidance on how to craft a responsive and effective remedy for unconstitutional laws. Schachter set out a general approach to granting remedies. It endorsed remedies tailored to the breadth of rights violations, thereby allowing constitutionally compliant aspects of unconstitutional legislation to be preserved, and recognized that, in rare circumstances, the effect of a declaration of invalidity could be suspended for a period of time to protect the public interest. Schachter also considered how s.\u00a052(1) remedies can be combined with individual remedies for Charter violations, including whether the claimant should receive an individual exemption from a suspension, thereby ensuring that successful claimants can enjoy the immediate benefit of a declaration of invalidity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 By employing and building on Schachter\u2019s guidance in determining the form and breadth of declarations of invalidity, suspending the effect of those declarations, and exempting individuals from suspensions, the Court\u2019s jurisprudence has coalesced around a group of core remedial principles that structure the exercise of principled remedial discretion and provide the groundwork for meaningful remedies in different contexts. First, safeguarding rights lies at the core of granting Charter remedies because the Charter exists to protect rights, freedoms, and inherent dignity. Second, the public has an interest in legislation that is constitutionally compliant. Third, the public is entitled to the benefit of legislation, which individuals rely upon to organize their lives and protect them from harm. Fourth, courts and legislatures play different institutional roles: the legislature is sovereign in the sense that it has exclusive\u00a0authority to enact, amend, and repeal any law as it sees fit, while courts remain guardians of the Constitution and of individuals\u2019 rights under it. These principles provide guidance to courts and encourage them to transparently explain remedial results.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As the language of s.\u00a052(1) directs, the first step in crafting an appropriate remedy is determining the extent of the legislation\u2019s inconsistency with the Constitution. The nature and extent of the Charter violation lays the foundation for the remedial analysis because the breadth of the remedy ultimately granted will reflect at least the extent of the breach.\u00a0The second step is determining the form that a declaration should take. Remedies other than full declarations of invalidity should be granted when the nature of the violation and the intention of the legislature allows for them. However, if granted in the wrong circumstances, tailored remedies can intrude on the legislative sphere. To respect the differing roles of courts and legislatures, determining whether to strike down legislation in its entirety or to grant a tailored remedy of reading in, reading down, or severance, depends on whether the legislature\u2019s intention was such that it would have enacted the law as modified by the court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When an immediately effective declaration of invalidity would endanger an interest of such great importance that, on balance, the benefits of delaying the effect of that declaration outweigh the cost of preserving an unconstitutional law, the court may suspend the effect of the declaration. The power to suspend the effect of a declaration of invalidity arises from accommodation of broader constitutional considerations and is included in the power to declare legislation invalid. Suspensions of declarations of invalidity should be rare; the effect of a declaration should not be suspended unless the government demonstrates that an immediately effective declaration would endanger a compelling public interest that outweighs the importance of immediate constitutional compliance and an immediately effective remedy for those whose Charter rights will be violated. The period of suspension, where warranted, should be long enough to give the legislature the amount of time it requires to carry out its responsibility diligently and effectively, while recognizing that every additional day of rights violations will be a strong counterweight against giving the legislature more time.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, the declaration of invalidity was properly limited to those who have been found NCRMD of a sexual offence and absolutely discharged. A tailored remedy was clearly appropriate here, since granting such a remedy better protects the public\u2019s interest in legislation enacted for its benefit, like Christopher\u2019s Law, and better respects the role of the legislature while also safeguarding Charter rights and realizing the public\u2019s interest in constitutionally compliant legislation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The declaration of invalidity was also properly suspended for a 12\u2011month period. Although the terms of s.\u00a052(1) and the need to safeguard Charter rights and ensure constitutional compliance of all legislation weigh heavily in favour of an immediately effective declaration, those factors must be balanced against protecting the public\u2019s interest in legislation passed for its benefit. To do so requires considering the nature and extent of both the continued rights violations and the danger to an identified public interest that could flow from an immediate declaration of invalidity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, public safety has been identified as the public interest that justifies a suspension. NCRMD persons are at a statistically higher risk of offending than the general population. Granting an immediate declaration would therefore endanger the public interest in safety to some extent. The registry contributes to public safety by enhancing the ability of police to prevent and investigate sexual offences. Immediately relieving people who may pose some risk of committing sexual offences from the obligation to report or permitting them to seek removal of their information could detract from this enhanced ability. The threat to public safety is therefore meaningful. However, given that persons found NCRMD who pose the highest demonstrable risk to reoffend are not given absolute discharges, this threat is limited. The other public interest at stake is respect for the legislature: granting an immediate declaration of invalidity could risk compromising the legislature\u2019s ability to fulfil its role and restrict the effectiveness of whatever new version of Christopher\u2019s Law is eventually enacted. Balanced against these considerations is the significance of the rights violation that the suspension would temporarily prolong: Christopher\u2019s Law treats those found NCRMD in accordance with a persistent, demeaning stereotype without providing an opportunity to determine whether they pose sufficient risk. On balance, the combination of these two interests justifies temporarily depriving those affected of the immediate benefit of the declaration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, the exercise of the Court of Appeal\u2019s discretion in granting G an individual exemption from the suspension deserves deference. G\u2019s record since his release 17 years ago has been spotless and there is no indication that he poses a risk to public safety. An exemption ensures that G receives an effective remedy and is not denied the benefit of his success on the constitutional merits.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Rowe\u00a0J.: The appeal should be dismissed. There is agreement with C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ. regarding s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter, and regarding the general approach to ordering an individual exemption under s.\u00a024(1) from the suspended effect of a declaration of invalidity under s.\u00a052(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, there is disagreement on the proper approach to suspending a declaration of invalidity under s.\u00a052(1). The Court\u2019s approach in Schachter should be reaffirmed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s principled discretion approach to suspended declarations of invalidity lacks analytic structure, and its\u00a0four principles are so indeterminate and truistic as to provide no meaningful guidance. This discretionary approach could\u00a0lead to a continuation of current trends in which declarations of invalidity are suspended in a way that varies with the length of the Chancellor\u2019s foot. There is no legitimate basis to read remedial discretion into s.\u00a052(1). The absence of remedial discretion in s.\u00a052(1) is not an oversight, and the inherent jurisdiction of a court is not a sound or sufficient legal basis to depart from the immediate effect of s.\u00a052(1). The only basis on which a court can order a constitutionally invalid statute\u00a0to be enforced notwithstanding its illegality is if an immediate declaration of invalidity would offend some other constitutional principle.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Schachter is grounded in a view that suspended declarations are exceptional and should be ordered only where: (1)\u00a0an immediate declaration of invalidity would pose a potential danger to the public; (2)\u00a0it would otherwise threaten the rule of law; or (3)\u00a0the impugned law is underinclusive and the court cannot determine properly whether to cancel or extend its benefits. These\u00a0categories exemplify circumstances in which countervailing constitutional principles constitute a valid basis to suspend an immediate declaration of invalidity. While not exhaustive, the Schachter categories should be extended only where an immediate declaration would infringe some constitutional principle.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, the declaration of invalidity was suspended on the basis of public safety concerns. However, as the 12\u2011month suspension of the declaration of invalidity ordered by the Court of Appeal has expired, this issue is now moot, as is the issue of the individual exemption order for G. Consequently, there is no cause to decide whether the declaration was properly suspended, or whether the individual exemption was rightly ordered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Brown\u00a0JJ. (dissenting in part): There is agreement with the majority that Christopher\u2019s Law infringes G\u2019s s. 15(1) Charter right to equal treatment, and that the declaration of invalidity was properly suspended\u00a0for a period of 12 months. However, the suspension of the declaration of invalidity should be grounded solely on the threat to the rule of law that would otherwise manifest, in the present case, in the form of a threat to public safety. Consistent with the limited role of the judiciary vis\u2011\u00e0\u2011vis the legislature, an individual exemption from the suspended declaration of invalidity should not be granted. The appeal should therefore be allowed in part.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The section 15(1) issue is easily disposed of. Christopher\u2019s Law draws a distinction between persons found NCRMD and persons found guilty. That distinction exacerbates pre\u2011existing disadvantage by perpetuating the stereotype that persons with mental illness are inherently dangerous. Persons found guilty of sexual offences have several exit ramps leading away from the obligation to comply with Christopher\u2019s Law but persons found NCRMD do not, even where the Ontario Review Board determines that they no longer pose a significant threat to public safety and grants them an absolute discharge. This constitutes differential treatment on the basis of an enumerated ground: mental disability. The proper remedy is to require the legislature to provide persons found NCRMD who have been absolutely discharged with an opportunity for exemption and removal from the Christopher\u2019s Law registry.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Suspended declarations of invalidity are only warranted when there is a threat to the rule of law, for three principal reasons. First, this was what the Court envisioned in assuming for the first time the power to issue a suspended declaration in Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, 1985 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1985]\u00a01 S.C.R. 721. The Court in Manitoba Reference tightly constrained the use of suspended declarations to situations where they are necessary to preserve the rule of law under conditions of emergency, when it is impossible to comply with constitutional rights. Since Manitoba Reference, however, the Court has lost its way and has suspended declarations of invalidity almost as a matter of course, often with no justification or attention to the rule of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Secondly, the Constitution contemplates immediate declarations as the norm, subject only to a rule of law concern. Once it is found that a statute is inconsistent with the Constitution, s.\u00a052(1) limits the role of courts to declaring a law is of no force or effect. While the Constitution does not expressly permit courts to suspend a declaration of invalidity, it does provide a means for Parliament and legislatures to do so in certain cases under s.\u00a033(1). Courts must therefore be judicious, measured and principled when exercising the judicially created power to suspend a declaration of invalidity. Rights under the Charter may be temporarily judicially displaced by the operation of a suspended declaration of invalidity only where necessary to preserve the rule of law and to ensure its continuity. In such instances, courts are not fulfilling an impermissible legislative role as they\u00a0otherwise would be by granting a suspended declaration, but an assuredly judicial role.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Thirdly, lessons that follow from Schachter\u2019s jurisprudential progeny show why it is essential to confine judicial discretion. Restraint is imperative because suspending a declaration will often pull a court beyond its institutional competence and capacity, and into the role of the legislature. As well, courts are ill\u2011equipped\u00a0to determine the period of time during which a suspended declaration should govern. Further, allowing an unconstitutional law to remain in force not only withholds the immediate relief to which a successful claimant is expressly entitled under s.\u00a052(1), but also sustains the invalidated law\u2019s capacity to produce harm. Finally, suspended declarations can exacerbate pre\u2011existing disadvantage and discourage\u00a0rights holders from bringing Charter claims forward in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 If used improperly, suspended declarations can undermine the rule of law they were meant to preserve in two ways: they can lead to uncertainty in the law during the period of suspension; and they can lessen the consequences for lawmakers of enacting laws that violate the Charter, which in turn, reduces the incentives for complying with rights when making law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, granting an immediate declaration of invalidity would threaten public safety and, therefore, the rule of law, as it would mean that the Christopher\u2019s Law registry would not apply to all persons found NCRMD and who have been granted absolute discharges by the Ontario Review Board. While Christopher\u2019s Law likely captures persons who do not pose a significant risk of reoffending, it also captures many who do. More importantly, it must be remembered that the recidivism risk is that of committing sexual offences, which are violent crimes that cause profound harm to the most vulnerable members of society. Given that an immediate declaration of invalidity would remove persons found NCRMD who are potentially dangerous from the registry, it would create a lacuna in the regime that would undoubtedly pose a danger to the public and thus threaten the rule of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 If a suspended declaration of invalidity should be rare, then an individual exemption from that suspension must be exceedingly so. There is disagreement with the majority that judges are well\u2011suited to conduct an individualized assessment as to whether an exemption would endanger public safety. Rather, a helpful consideration in determining whether an individual exemption should be granted is to ask whether an exemption is necessary\u00a0to prevent irreparable harm to the interests the Charter was designed to protect during the suspension. The case for irreparable harm must be so significant that it overcomes the weighty need to leave the manner of addressing a constitutional infringement to the legislature.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although G has shown that he is entitled to the opportunity for exemption and removal from the registry, this is not one of those rare cases where an individual exemption is warranted. A delayed remedy will not deprive G of an effective one, nor preclude him from accessing the new opportunity for exemption in whatever form that may take. Further, G will, at most, have to report to the police station one more time as part of his obligation to report annually, a far cry from irreparable harm. In G\u2019s case, as in most, crafting an individual exemption will exceed the competence of the Court and encroach on what is an issue for resolution by the legislature, which is in a far better position to determine what the appropriate mechanism is to provide persons found NCRMD with the opportunity for exemption.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Granting G an individual exemption also raises concerns of horizontal unfairness \u2014 that is, of treating G better than others who are similarly situated. In a constitutional case involving the validity of a statute of general applicability, a litigant should not be entitled to a better or more immediate constitutional remedy than all other persons similarly situated merely because they brought the case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Discussed: Schachter v.

        "summary": "<strong>Part of Ontario\u2019s sex-offender registry law discriminates against people  with mental disabilities, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>\r\n   In  2001, G had his first and only mental health episode. He was charged with two  counts of sexual assault against his then-wife. In 2002, he was found \u201cnot  criminally responsible on account of mental disorder.\u201d This meant that he did  not know what he was doing or did not know that it was wrong, or both. It also  meant he didn\u2019t have any kind of criminal record. The Ontario Review Board decides  if someone found not criminally responsible is a risk to public safety. It said  G wasn\u2019t a major risk. It gave him an \u201cabsolute discharge\u201d in 2003. This meant  he didn\u2019t need to be monitored by the Review Board. He was never charged with  any other crime again. Even  though he got the absolute discharge from the Review Board, G was placed on Ontario\u2019s  sex offender registry. Because of this, he had to report to the police every  year. Police could also randomly check up on him. His name couldn\u2019t be deleted  from the list, even if he died. Sexual  crimes are very serious. But not everyone who commits a sexual crime has to  register in Ontario. Anyone who gets a \u201cdischarge\u201d at sentencing doesn\u2019t have  to register. This kind of discharge means the person isn\u2019t convicted even if  they are found guilty. Anyone who is pardoned is deleted from the registry.  Anyone who gets a \u201crecord suspension\u201d (where their record is taken out of the  criminal record database) doesn\u2019t have to keep reporting. In each of these situations,  officials can look at a person\u2019s case on an individual basis to decide what  kind of risk they are to the public. But  none of these options were available to people like G who were found not  criminally responsible. Those people had no way of getting off the registry.  They had to report to police at least once a year no matter what. This was true  even if they got an absolute discharge, like G did. G  said this was discriminatory. He said it breached sections 7 and 15(1) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Section 7 protects everyone\u2019s right to life,  liberty, and security of person. Section 15(1) says everyone has the right to  be treated equally. The  judge who heard the <em>Charter </em>application  said G\u2019s rights weren\u2019t breached. The Court of Appeal agreed that his section  7 rights weren\u2019t breached. But it said his section 15 rights were.      All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that G\u2019s section 15 right to be  treated equally and without discrimination was breached. They all pointed out  many people wrongly think those with mental disabilities are always, and by  nature, dangerous. The majority said Ontario\u2019s sex offender  registry law was discriminatory under section 15. This was because it didn\u2019t  provide a way for people found not criminally responsible to get off the list  or to not have to report anymore. People who were found guilty had ways to do  this. This discriminated against people like G based on mental disability. (The  majority didn\u2019t need to look at section 7 because it already found a <em>Charter </em>breach under section 15.) When a court  finds that a law violates the Constitution, the next question is the proper  \u201cremedy,\u201d or how to make it right. The majority set out principles for courts to  use when deciding remedies in these kinds of cases. In this case, the majority  said that the Court of Appeal was right that the part of Ontario\u2019s law that  discriminated against G was invalid. It also said that the Court of Appeal was  right to give Ontario a year to fix the problem. When deciding whether to give  governments time to fix an unconstitutional law, the majority said courts should  look at the whole situation.  The majority  also said that the Court of Appeal was right to delete G from the registry. It  said the Court of Appeal was right to exempt him from having to keep reporting even  though it gave the government time to fix the law. This was because G, like  others who bring successful <em>Charter </em>cases,  help the public by uncovering unconstitutional laws. Giving governments time to fix unconstitutional laws should be rare. The  Supreme Court has not done this since <em><a href=\"https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do\">Carter  v. Canada (Attorney General)</a></em>, over five years ago."

Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec realized that it would be easier to run the line through a corridor where it already had servitudes that had been established in the 1970s for a transmission line between the Jacques\u2011Cartier substation near Qu\u00e9bec and the Duvernay substation in Laval. Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s acquisition of those servitudes had involved two steps. Having been authorized by order in council to acquire them by expropriation, it had first served and published notices of expropriation, after which it had signed, with the then owners, notarial agreements that described the servitudes being established and provided for various indemnities that would be payable, including for any work that might be carried out on the servient land.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec claimed that these servitudes authorized it to route up to three electrical transmission lines through the servient land. The current owners of the lots contested this claim; they submitted that the rights arising from the servitudes acquired when the Jacques-Cartier-Duvernay line was constructed were limited to that one line only. They denied Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s employees access to their lots. Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec then applied for an injunction. The owners considered the proceedings abusive. In a cross\u2011application, they sought damages for unauthorized use of the servitudes following a reconfiguration of the Jacques-Cartier-Duvernay line in the 1980s and for hardship and inconvenience caused by the existing infrastructure. The proceeding was split so as to have the hearing of the cross\u2011application postponed to a later date, depending on the outcome on the issue of the scope of the servitudes.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge ruled in Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s favour. He found that the servitudes at issue had originally been acquired by expropriation, but that the subsequent agreements had clarified their purpose and scope. In his view, the agreements were clear: they authorized Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec to erect three electrical transmission lines no matter what the origin or the destination of the electricity was. Having concluded that the servitudes established in favour of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec authorized it to place three electrical transmission lines on the owners\u2019 lots, the trial judge granted the injunction and dismissed the cross\u2011application.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal allowed the owners\u2019 appeal. It remarked that the trial judge\u2019s decision to dismiss the cross\u2011application had been ultra petita, as the splitting of the proceeding meant that that matter had not been before him. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s view, the servitudes at issue had been acquired by expropriation and should be characterized as servitudes established by operation of law. Their scope therefore had to be analyzed in light of the limits imposed by the order in council that authorized them. The Court of Appeal accordingly concluded that Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec could not rely on the servitudes in its favour for the construction of the new line and that it had to proceed by way of new expropriations or agreements.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 All the conclusions of the trial judge\u2019s decision are restored, except the one dismissing the cross\u2011application. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for hearing of the cross\u2011application. The power line servitudes in favour of Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec are not limited to the Jacques-Cartier-Duvernay Line; they authorize Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec to route a second electrical transmission line through the owners\u2019 lots.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge was correct in characterizing the post\u2011expropriation agreements as servitude agreements. The order in council, the notices of expropriation and the agreements are different types of documents, and it is important to distinguish them from one another. An order in council is an administrative act for the purpose of authorizing the exercise of the power to deprive a property owner of the enjoyment of the attributes of his or her right of ownership. Filing a notice of expropriation and the documents related to it is an administrative act that establishes and individualizes the servitude. As for the agreement, it relates to the ordinary exercise of civil rights and to the private law rules of contract. A servitude acquired by expropriation is, according to the classification set out in art.\u00a01181 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec, established by operation of law. This being the case, neither the law nor public order bars the expropriating party and the expropriated party from clarifying or modifying such a servitude by mutual agreement: notices of expropriation thus do not preclude parties from negotiating conventional servitudes. It must be presumed that the servitude agreement, if entered into after the notice of expropriation, contains a more faithful definition of the scope and terms for exercise of the servitude of public utility than does the notice of expropriation. Servitude agreements are subject to the rules applicable to the interpretation of contracts. If their words are clear, effect must be given to the clearly expressed intention of the parties.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, the agreements at issue include a complete description of the servitudes, adding some details that do not appear in the notices of expropriation. In these circumstances, the agreements are the titles to which the owners of the servient land and the dominant land must refer in exercising their respective rights. Because the agreements are clear, the scope of the servitudes must be determined in light of their words. The agreements do not mention any restrictions regarding the origin or destination of the electricity. The servitudes are therefore not limited to the line between the Jacques\u2011Cartier and Duvernay substations. The servitudes on the owners\u2019 lots authorize Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec to construct the Chamouchouane-Bout-de-l\u2019\u00cele line.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the servitudes concern the lines crossing the servient land, not the substations located at either end of those lines. There is nothing in the words of the agreements that would explicitly or implicitly prevent Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec from redirecting one of its lines toward another substation. The right to operate electrical transmission lines includes the right to make modifications such as the one that was made in the reconfiguration of the Jacques-Cartier-Duvernay line.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s proceedings are not abusive. It sought to use the servitudes that had been granted to it by the owners\u2019 predecessors in title and had been published in the land register. The owners were presumed to be aware of the rights granted by these servitudes. They nonetheless blocked construction of the new electrical transmission line and forced Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec to seek injunction orders. It is not up to Hydro\u2011Qu\u00e9bec to pay for the steps they took.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Approved: Michaud et Simard Inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec could rely on permissions given in the decades before to  build a new transmission line on people\u2019s land, the Supreme Court has  unanimously ruled.</strong>\r\n   In  recent years, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec worked to modernize its electricity system. In  particular, it wanted to make Montreal\u2019s access to power more reliable. It also  wanted to make sure there was enough electricity to meet people\u2019s needs in  Terrebonne.  To  do this, it needed to build a new transmission line. Transmission lines move  high-voltage electricity over long distances. (The voltage gets lowered before  it moves to regular power lines closer to where it will be used.) These kinds  of lines have thicker cables and are held up by tall metal towers.  Building  the transmission line would mean crossing parts of people\u2019s property. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec  realized it would be easiest to put the transmission line somewhere it already  had permission to.  Under  Quebec\u2019s civil law rules, a \u201cservitude\u201d is a kind of permission to use someone  else\u2019s property for a specific purpose. It\u2019s like an \u201ceasement\u201d in the common  law rules found in other provinces. Both servitudes and easements are recorded  in the land registration system. Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec  had close to 40,000 different servitudes on people\u2019s property. Many of these  servitudes were very old. The servitudes that Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec wanted to use to  build the transmission line were from the 1970s. It originally got them through  \u201cexpropriation\u201d to build another transmission line. Expropriation is when  government takes property, or some kind of right in that property, from owners.  Owners usually get compensation when this happens. After the expropriation, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec  came to agreements with the people who owned the land at the time. The  agreements set out exactly what the permission was for, and how much  Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec would pay the owners. A first transmission line was built  afterward. In  2016, Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec started working on its new project. Workers went to the  properties that the transmission line would cross. They wanted to take  measurements and get the land ready to build. Ms. Matta and the other property  owners didn\u2019t let them do this. The property owners said the servitudes Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec  was relying on were only for the transmission line that was built in the 1970s.  They said Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec wasn\u2019t allowed to use those servitudes to build a new  line.  The  trial judge said Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec could go ahead. The Court of Appeal said it  couldn\u2019t, unless it got new servitudes. To get those, it could make new  agreements with the owners or follow the usual process for expropriation.  All  the judges at the Supreme Court said Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec could go ahead. It said the  Court of Appeal made a few mistakes. The Court of Appeal relied on evidence the  parties didn\u2019t talk about, which it shouldn\u2019t have done. It also made an  incorrect statement that affected the outcome of the case. The  Court said the agreements between Hydro-Quebec and the property owners likely  best captured everyone\u2019s understanding of what the servitudes covered. Servitudes  that are gotten through expropriation can be changed by contract if everyone  agrees. The agreements between Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and the owners were the documents  that should be relied on. The  Supreme Court added that higher courts have a limited role. They aren\u2019t allowed  to change a lower court\u2019s decision on the nature of an agreement simply because  they disagree with it. They can only step in if there is a major and obvious  mistake. In this case, there was none. The trial judge was right to say that  the agreements reflected the permissions given by the servitudes. He was also  right to say that these permissions let Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec build its new transmission  line on the owners\u2019 land. Therefore, the Court of Appeal should not have  interfered with his decision. There are different  legal rules for when higher courts can or can\u2019t step in. These are called  \u201cstandards of appellate review.\u201d Higher courts can step in more easily if the  judge makes a mistake that\u2019s only about the law. They can\u2019t easily do this if  it\u2019s a mistake about the facts or a combination of the law and the facts."

Following the recall, the franchisees experienced a shortage of product for six to eight weeks. At the time, the relationship between Mr.\u00a0Sub and Maple Leaf was governed by an exclusive supply agreement pursuant to which Maple Leaf was made the exclusive supplier of ready\u2011to\u2011eat meats served in all Mr.\u00a0Sub restaurants. To give effect to this arrangement, the franchise agreement between Mr.\u00a0Sub and its franchisees required them to purchase ready\u2011to\u2011eat meats produced exclusively by Maple Leaf. No contractual relationship ever existed between the franchisees and Maple Leaf, each being linked to the other indirectly through separate contracts with Mr.\u00a0Sub.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A class action against Maple Leaf on behalf of the franchisees was certified, in which the franchisees claimed to have suffered economic loss and reputational injury due to their association with contaminated meat products and advanced claims in tort law, seeking compensation for lost past and future sales, past and future profits, capital value of the franchises and goodwill. Maple Leaf unsuccessfully brought a motion for summary judgment dismissing these claims. The motion judge held that Maple Leaf owed the franchisees a duty to supply a product fit for human consumption, and that the contaminated meat products posed a real and substantial danger, so as to ground a duty of care. The Court of Appeal allowed Maple Leaf\u2019s appeal, and found that no duty of care was owed to the franchisees. It determined that the motion judge\u2019s decision to allow these claims to proceed could not stand in light of the Court\u2019s decision in Deloitte & Touche v. Livent Inc. (Receiver of), 2017\u00a0SCC\u00a063, [2017] 2\u00a0S.C.R.\u00a0855, which had been decided following the disposition of the motion for summary judgment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis and Kasirer JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown, Rowe and Martin JJ.: Maple Leaf does not owe a duty of care to the franchisees in respect of these matters. Though the common law readily imposes liability for negligent interference with and injury to the rights in bodily integrity, mental health and property, it has been slow to accord protection to purely economic interests. Pure economic loss may be recoverable in certain circumstances, but there is no general right in tort protecting against the negligent or intentional infliction of pure economic loss.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Pure economic loss is economic loss that is unconnected to a physical or mental injury to the plaintiff\u2019s person, or physical damage to property. It is distinct from consequential economic loss, being economic loss that results from damage to the plaintiff\u2019s rights, such as wage losses or costs of care incurred by someone injured. To recover for any type of negligently caused loss, a plaintiff must prove all the elements of the tort of negligence: (1) that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care; (2) that the defendant\u2019s conduct breached the standard of care; (3) that the plaintiff sustained damage; and (4) that the damage was caused, in fact and in law, by the defendant\u2019s breach. To satisfy the element of damage, the loss sought to be recovered must be the result of an interference with a legally cognizable right.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The current categories of pure economic loss between private parties are: (1) negligent misrepresentation or performance of a service; (2) negligent supply of shoddy goods or structures; and (3) relational economic loss. The distinguishing feature among each of these categories is that they describe how the loss occurred. However, a duty of care cannot be established by showing that a claim fits within one of these categories, as they are but mere analytical tools. Invoking a category offers no substitute for the necessary examination that must take place into whether the parties were at the time of the loss in a sufficiently proximate relationship. Proximity is and remains the controlling concept.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In Livent, cases of negligent misrepresentation and negligent performance of a service were brought into accord with the duty of care framework laid out in Anns v. London Borough of Merton, [1977] 2\u00a0All\u00a0E.R.\u00a0492, and later refined in Cooper v. Hobart, 2001\u00a0SCC\u00a079, [2001] 3\u00a0S.C.R.\u00a0537. Previously, the duty analysis grounded a prima facie duty of care on mere foreseeability of injury. Cooper signalled a shift from that test by establishing the requirements of both proximity of relationship and foreseeability of injury. Foreseeability alone was deemed to be insufficient, as a duty arises only where a relationship of proximity obtains. Duty in tort law is a general notion describing a class or type of case, not a particular fact situation. In particular, the inquiry into reasonable foreseeability of injuries asks whether the type of injury to the relevant class of persons could have been foreseen. As such, each component of the Anns/Cooper analysis supporting a prima facie duty raises questions of law reviewable under the correctness standard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In cases of negligent misrepresentation or performance of a service, two factors are determinative of whether proximity is established: the defendant\u2019s undertaking, and the plaintiff\u2019s reliance. The proximate relationship is formed when the defendant undertakes responsibility which invites reasonable and detrimental reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant for that purpose. It is the intended effect of the defendant\u2019s undertaking upon the plaintiff\u2019s autonomy that brings the defendant into a relationship of proximity with the plaintiff. Where that effect works to the plaintiff\u2019s detriment, it is a wrong to the plaintiff entitling it to its pre-reliance circumstance. But that entitlement operates only so far as the undertaking goes. Any reliance on the part of the plaintiff which falls outside of the scope of the undertaking falls outside the scope of the proximate relationship. That is because reliance that exceeds the purpose of the defendant\u2019s undertaking is not reasonable, and therefore not foreseeable. In the present case, the undertaking by Maple Leaf to provide ready\u2011to\u2011eat meats fit for human consumption was made to consumers with the purpose of assuring them that their interests were being kept in mind, and not to commercial intermediaries such as the franchisees. The business interests of the franchisees lie outside the scope and purpose of the undertaking.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The parameters established in Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No.\u00a036 v. Bird Construction Co., 1995 CanLII 146 (SCC), [1995] 1\u00a0S.C.R.\u00a085, recognize that recovery for economic loss in cases of negligent supply of shoddy goods or structures is founded upon the defendant\u2019s negligent interference with a right to be free from injury to one\u2019s person or property. A breach of the duty laid out in Winnipeg Condominium exposes the defendant to liability for the cost of averting a real and substantial danger, but not of repairing a defect. The duty is based on the reasonable foreseeability of injury to other persons and property in the community, and the presence of danger is the linchpin of the analysis. Shoddy products, as opposed to dangerous ones, raise different questions which are better channelled through the law of contract. The potential injury to persons or property grounds not only the duty but also one\u2019s entitlement to the cost of putting the good or structure back into a non\u2011dangerous state. Allowing recovery exceeding the costs associated with removing the danger goes beyond what is necessary to safeguard the right protected. The Winnipeg Condominium liability rule applies to products other than building structures, but in such cases the duty is narrow. What a plaintiff can recover will ultimately be confined by the duty\u2019s concern for averting danger, and will be determined by the feasibility of discarding the thing posing a danger. In assessing the possibility of discarding the thing, the plaintiff must show that it is effectively bereft of reasonable options. When applied to goods, such cases will be rare. Here, any danger posed by the supply of ready\u2011to\u2011eat meats could be a danger only to the ultimate consumer, and not to the franchisees. Further, while the ready\u2011to\u2011eat meats may have posed a real and substantial danger to consumers when they were manufactured, any such danger evaporated when they were recalled and destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Developments to the law of negligence signify that claims under Winnipeg Condominium must now attend to an inquiry into the requisite element of proximity. Proximity informs the foreseeability inquiry and should be considered first, as the considerations that support a finding of proximity also limit the type of injury that may be reasonably foreseen to result from the defendant\u2019s negligence. Assessing proximity proceeds in two steps and requires asking whether, in light of the nature of the relationship at issue, the parties are in such a close and direct relationship that it would be just and fair having regard to that relationship to impose a duty of care in law. The court must first determine whether proximity can be made out by reference to an established or analogous category of proximate relationship. At this stage, the particular factors which justified recognizing that particular category should be scrutinized. As between parties to a relationship, some acts or omissions might amount to a breach of duty, while others will not. If the court determines that proximity cannot be based on an established or analogous category, it must then conduct a full proximity analysis. In so doing, all relevant factors present in the relationship must be examined, including expectations, representations, reliance, and the property or other interests involved. Under this step, the fact that the parties could have protected their interests under contract is a crucial consideration. Contractual silence will not automatically foreclose the imposition of a duty of care, but courts must be careful not to disrupt the allocations of risk reflected in relevant contractual arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, proximity cannot be established by reference to a recognized category of proximate relationship, nor by conducting a full proximity analysis. Though the franchise agreement worked a vulnerability upon the franchisees, it did not have the effect of establishing a proximate relationship between them and Maple Leaf. The franchisees were not consumers, but commercial actors whose choice to enter into that arrangement substantially informed the expectations of their relationship with Maple Leaf. As there is no relationship of proximity between Maple Leaf and the franchisees under the Winnipeg Condominium rule, there is also no proximity for the purposes of recognizing a novel duty of care.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis and Kasirer JJ. (dissenting): There is agreement with the majority that the franchisees\u2019 claim does not fall within an existing category of economic loss or an established or analogous relationship of proximity. However, it is just and fair to impose a novel duty of care on Maple Leaf in the circumstances, and the appeal should therefore be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Historically, the common law did not allow for recovery of losses in negligence that were not consequent to physical injury or property damage. Over the years, however, Canadian courts have repeatedly affirmed that there is no general bar against recovery of economic loss for negligence. As a cause of action, claims concerning the recovery of economic loss are identical to any other claim in negligence in that the plaintiff must establish a duty, a breach, damage and causation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The proper approach to assessing whether a duty of care exists is the two-step inquiry established in Anns and adjusted in Cooper. If foreseeability and proximity are established at the first stage, a prima facie duty of care arises and the court considers whether any residual policy considerations negate that duty at the second stage. Where a case falls within or is analogous to a previously recognized category of proximity, and reasonable foreseeability is also established, then a prima facie duty may be found without a full analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While specific types of economic losses have been identified, it is the duty of care and not the category of economic loss that dictates whether economic loss is recoverable in negligence. The existing categories can act as analytical tools, but the scope of allowable economic loss is not limited to them. In cases engaging a novel relationship and requiring a full Anns/Cooper analysis, courts should be attentive to the specific circumstances of the case, as the traditional policy concerns may not always arise. The core inquiry is the two-step analysis, responsive to the facts at hand.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, the franchisees\u2019 claim engages novel issues and a different set of policy considerations that should be considered through a novel duty of care analysis. The usual indication of proximity is foreseeability, and this can be a useful starting point. Assessing proximity first may be helpful in cases of negligent misrepresentation, but this will not always be the case for other types of tort claims. The reasonable foreseeability inquiry requires the court to ask whether the type of injury to the plaintiff, or to a class of persons to which the plaintiff belongs, was reasonably foreseeable to someone in the defendant\u2019s position. It was foreseeable that the franchisees would be identified as a public\u2011facing retailer of potentially tainted meats while the meats posed a real danger to public health.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Reasonable foreseeability of harm must be supplemented by proximity. In assessing proximity, the overarching question is whether the parties are in such a close and direct relationship that it would be just and fair having regard to that relationship to impose a duty of care in law. The factors to assess that relationship are diverse and depend on the circumstances of each case, but include the expectations, representations, reliance, and the property or other interests involved. In the present case, there was a proximate relationship between Maple Leaf and the franchisees such that Maple Leaf was under an obligation to be mindful of the franchisees\u2019 interests. It was clearly contemplated by the partnership agreement that the franchisees would be using and selling Maple Leaf products, and that they could enter into direct contact with Maple Leaf. Unlike other retailers of Maple Leaf products, the franchisees were bound to use Maple Leaf meats exclusively and were in a business that centred on such meats, placing them in a particularly dependent relationship. Thus, Maple Leaf established a close relationship with the franchisees.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In cases involving pure economic loss, the contractual matrix linking the parties can be an important factor in finding a lack of proximity. When considering whether a plaintiff was able to contractually protect itself from the types of economic loss claimed, a realistic approach must be taken. An overly formalistic appeal to protection through contract risks failing to take into account the parties\u2019 actual circumstances, including their commercial sophistication and bargaining power. In the case at bar, the prospect of the franchisees protecting themselves by contract was illusory, placing them in a particularly dependent and vulnerable relationship with Maple Leaf. Far from negating proximity between Maple Leaf and the franchisees, the contractual matrix strengthens it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the context of this close and direct relationship, Maple Leaf was under a duty to take reasonable care not to place unsafe goods into the market that could cause economic loss to the franchisees as a result of reasonable consumer response to the health risk posed by those goods. Subject to the other requirements of negligence being met, it is fair and just to hold Maple Leaf responsible for the franchisees\u2019 direct economic consequences of being associated with unsafe Maple Leaf products while they posed a danger to consumer health. None of the residual policy considerations \u2014 that is, the risk of a negative impact on the marketplace by raising the spectre of indeterminate liability for manufacturers or of chilling effects on manufacturers issuing voluntary recalls \u2014 are sufficiently persuasive to oust the prima facie duty of care on Maple Leaf.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Deloitte & Touche v.

        "summary": "<strong>Maple Leaf Foods wasn\u2019t responsible for the lost profits of Mr. Sub  owners due to a food recall, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Mr.  Sub was a chain of Canadian sandwich shops. It was a \u201cfranchise.\u201d This meant  each shop was owned by different \u201cfranchisees.\u201d As franchisees, shop owners had  the benefit of Mr. Sub\u2019s brand. They also got better prices for supplies. Franchisees  usually have to use specific products and do things a specific way. This is so  the customer\u2019s experience is always the same. As part of Mr. Sub\u2019s franchise  agreement, its franchisees agreed to buy most of their sandwich meats from  Maple Leaf Foods. In  2008, Maple Leaf Foods learned that some of its meat contained a bacteria  called listeria. There was a lot of news coverage about people getting sick and  dying from eating Maple Leaf meats. No one got sick or died from eating meat at  a Mr. Sub. Anyone who bought the meat from Maple Leaf had to return it to be  destroyed, or throw it away, and would get a refund. Two of the meats affected  by the recall were used by Mr. Sub shops.  Right after the listeria outbreak, shop owners weren\u2019t  allowed to buy meats from somewhere else. This was because the franchise  agreement with Mr. Sub said they couldn\u2019t. After about two months, Mr. Sub said  the shop owners could buy from other companies. But before this, the individual  shops lost money. Their reputations were hurt. This was because people knew  they used Maple Leaf products, and they knew about the listeria contamination.  The shop owners could have asked Mr. Sub for permission to buy meat from  another company during this time, but they didn\u2019t. The  shop owners sued Maple Leaf Foods. They couldn\u2019t sue Mr. Sub because the  franchise agreement said they couldn\u2019t. They said Maple Leaf was responsible  for their lost sales, profits, business value, and customer goodwill because of  the recall. The motion judge said Maple Leaf was responsible for  the shop owners\u2019 losses. The Court of Appeal said it wasn\u2019t.  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court said Maple Leaf Foods didn\u2019t owe the shop  owners for the money they lost or the damage to their reputation.  For  Maple Leaf Foods to be legally responsible, the shop owners would have to show  that it owed them a \u201cduty of care.\u201d In law, a duty of care means someone  has to act reasonably to avoid hurting others close to them. It is an important  concept in tort law. Tort law deals with non-criminal wrongdoing outside of a  contract.  Tort law isn\u2019t about contracts. But one way courts can decide if someone is  close enough to owe someone else a duty is if there is a contract between them.  The  shop owners didn\u2019t have a contract with Maple Leaf Foods. They had a contract  with Mr. Sub. The contract with Mr. Sub said they had to buy meat from Maple  Leaf. But Maple Leaf wasn\u2019t part of that contract. Contracts are only between  the parties who agree to them. Maple Leaf didn\u2019t have a contract with any of  the shop owners saying it <em>had </em>to  supply the meat to them. The shop owners said Maple Leaf Foods had to provide meat that was fit to  eat. They said it was responsible for their losses because it didn\u2019t. When a claim  is only for lost profits, sales, value, or goodwill, it is a claim for \u201cpure  economic loss.\u201d This is a loss that doesn\u2019t involve mental or physical damage  to someone or something. Claims for pure economic loss are allowed in very  specific situations. For example, it can be allowed so someone can avoid injury  when someone else builds or supplies something dangerous. The majority said  Maple Leaf\u2019s duty was to protect customers from getting sick from eating their  meats, not to protect shop owners\u2019 business interests. While it was responsible  for removing the danger (by recalling the meat), it wasn\u2019t responsible for the shop  owners\u2019 lost profits, sales, value, or goodwill. This case was a  \u201cclass action.\u201d When a large group of people have the same legal problem, they  might decide to get together and sue as a group. The \u201cclass\u201d is the group, and  the \u201caction\u201d is the lawsuit. That means a class action is a group lawsuit. It  lets the whole group get their complaint dealt with at once. In this case, 1688782  Ontario Inc. was the plaintiff who represented the group."

Pursuant to s.\u00a0197.1 of that Act, the penalty for an offence under s.\u00a046 is a mandatory minimum fine which varies depending on whether the offender is an individual or a corporation. Applying this provision, the Court of Qu\u00e9bec imposed the then minimum fine for corporations of $30,843. The corporation challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum fine on the basis that it offended its right to be protected against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under s.\u00a012 of the Charter. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec dismissed the challenge, concluding that expanding the protection of rights intrinsically linked to individuals to include corporate rights would trivialize the protection granted by s.\u00a012. On appeal by the corporation, the Quebec Superior Court similarly held that corporations were not covered by s.\u00a012, as the provision\u2019s purpose was the protection of human dignity, a notion meant exclusively for natural persons. A majority at the Quebec Court of Appeal, however, allowed the corporation\u2019s appeal, concluding that since corporations could face cruel treatment or punishment through harsh or severe fines, s.\u00a012 could apply to them. The dissenting judge was of the view that s.\u00a012 does not apply to corporations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ.: Section 12 of the Charter does not protect corporations from cruel and unusual treatment or punishment because the text \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d denotes protection that only human beings can enjoy. The protective scope of s.\u00a012 is thus limited to human beings. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence on s.\u00a012, in both its French and English versions, is marked by the concept of human dignity, and the existence of human beings behind the corporate veil is insufficient to ground a s.\u00a012 claim of right on behalf of a corporate entity, in light of the corporation\u2019s separate legal personality.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To claim protection under the Charter, a corporation must establish that it has an interest falling within the scope of the guarantee, and one which accords with the purpose of that provision. The court must seek to discern the scope and purpose of the right by way of a purposive interpretation, that is, by reference to the character and the larger objects of the Charter itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the Charter. The approach is generous, purposive and contextual and should be done in a large and liberal manner. Within the purposive approach, the analysis must begin by considering the text of the provision. While constitutional norms are deliberately expressed in general terms, the words used remain the most primal constraint on judicial review and form the outer bounds of a purposive inquiry. Giving primacy to the text prevents an interpretation that overshoots (or undershoots) the actual purpose of the right. It is not the sole consideration, but treating it as the first indicator of purpose is constitutive of the principles of Charter interpretation. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The text of s.\u00a012, particularly the inclusion of \u201ccruel\u201d, strongly suggests that the provision is limited to human beings. The ordinary meaning of the word \u201ccruel\u201d does not permit its application to inanimate objects or legal entities such as corporations. The words \u201ccruel and unusual treatment or punishment\u201d refer to human pain and suffering, both physical and mental. An examination of s.\u00a012\u2019s historical origins shows that the Charter took a different path from its predecessors, the English Bill of Rights and the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution, by carving off the right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause from the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and by omitting the protection against excessive fines. The protection against cruel and unusual punishment under s.\u00a012 therefore exists as a standalone guarantee. This is highly significant: excessive fines (which a corporation can sustain), without more, are not unconstitutional. For a fine to be unconstitutional, it must be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency and abhorrent or intolerable to society. This threshold is, in accordance with the purpose of s.\u00a012, inextricably anchored in human dignity and cannot apply to treatments or punishments imposed on corporations. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is agreement with Abella\u00a0J.\u2019s discussion of related Charter rights. However, there is disagreement with the prominence given to international and comparative law in the interpretive process. International and comparative sources play a limited role of providing support or confirmation for the result reached by way of purposive interpretation of Charter rights. Their weight and persuasiveness depends on the nature of the source and its relationship to the Charter. A principled framework and methodology for considering international and comparative sources in constitutional interpretation is necessary, both to properly recognize Canada\u2019s international obligations and to provide consistent and clear guidance to courts and litigants.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The presumption of conformity is the firmly established interpretive principle that the Charter is presumed to provide protection at least as great as that afforded by similar provisions in international human rights documents which Canada has ratified. Binding international instruments carry more weight in the analysis than non\u2011binding instruments, which should be treated as relevant and persuasive but not determinative interpretive tools, and courts drawing from the latter should be careful to explain why they are drawing on a particular source and how it is being used. In this case, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are both binding on Canada, thus triggering the presumption of conformity. However, neither extends protection from cruel and unusual punishment to corporations. While both the American Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms have also been found not to extend protection to corporations against cruel and unusual punishment, these instruments are merely persuasive here. International instruments that pre\u2011date the Charter can also clearly form part of the historical context of a Charter right regardless of whether Canada is a party to such instruments. In this case, the context of the English Bill of Rights and the Eighth Amendment is highly relevant as each contained similar but not identical protections as s.\u00a012. As for instruments that post\u2011date the Charter, those that do not bind Canada carry much less interpretive weight than those that do. Finally, decisions of foreign and international courts are included among those non\u2011binding sources that are relevant and may be persuasive. However, particular caution should be exercised as the measures in effect in other countries say little about the scope of the rights enshrined in the Canadian Charter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Karakatsanis and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The purpose of s.\u00a012 of the Charter is to prevent the state from inflicting physical or mental pain and suffering through degrading and dehumanizing treatment or punishment. It is meant to protect human dignity and respect the inherent worth of individuals. Its intended beneficiaries are people, not corporations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Determining the scope of s.\u00a012 requires first determining the purpose of the right, which is to be sought by reference to the character and objectives of the Charter itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and to the principles and values underlying the right. Examining the text of the Charter is only the beginning of the interpretive exercise, which is fundamentally different from interpreting a statute. A generous, purposive and contextual approach should be applied so that Charter rights can grow and adapt to changing realities. Overemphasizing the plain text of Charter rights would make Canadian constitutional law more insular, and creates a risk that, over time, those rights will cease to represent the fundamental values of Canadian society and the purposes they were meant to protect. Purpose remains the central consideration in interpreting the scope and content of a Charter right. While several factors \u2014 including the text \u2014 can help inform the exercise, the Court has never endorsed a rigid hierarchy among these interpretative guides.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A review of the language used in the Court\u2019s s.\u00a012 jurisprudence shows that both the English and French versions capture the same concept, namely, that s.\u00a012 prohibits treatment or punishment that is incompatible with human dignity. Dictionary definitions of \u201ccruel\u201d, \u201ccruelty\u201d, \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d in French, reveal that the ordinary meaning of the words cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in s.\u00a012 centers on human pain and suffering. The fact that the word \u201ceveryone\u201d is found in the text of s.\u00a012 cannot, by virtue of its literal meaning, expand the protection to corporations, without any regard for the purpose of the right as protecting human dignity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The historical origins and values underlying s.\u00a012 of the Charter can be traced back to art.\u00a010 of the English Bill of Rights, which stipulated that excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. The provision was incorporated almost verbatim into the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In both the English and American contexts, protection for corporations was not contemplated. In the United States, the historical purpose of prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment was to protect the inherent worth and dignity of human beings. In Canada, similar language first appeared in s.\u00a02(b) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. The wording of that provision and of s.\u00a012 of the Charter are almost identical. Like the Canadian Bill of Rights, the enactment of the Charter was influenced by the events of the Second World War, WWII\u2019s shocking indifference to human dignity and the devastating human rights abuses it tolerated resulted in responsive protections in international human rights instruments and in domestic rights guarantees like the Charter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Since Canada\u2019s rights protections emerged from the same chrysalis of outrage as other countries around the world, it is helpful to compare Canada\u2019s s.\u00a012 prohibition against cruel and unusual treatment with how courts have interpreted the numerous international instruments containing similar provisions. The Court has frequently relied on international and comparative law sources to assist in delineating the breadth and content of Charter rights; this is a standard and accepted practice. Both those sources which are binding and those which are not have proven to be indispensable in almost all areas of the law. The Court has never required that these sources be separately weighed, nor has it ever applied a hierarchical sliding scale of persuasiveness, segmenting non-binding international and comparative sources into categories worthy of more or less influence. Considering what and how laws and decisions have been applied on related questions by other countries and institutions is part not only of an ongoing global judicial conversation, but of the epistemological package constitutional courts routinely rely on. Narrowing our approach by putting unnecessary barriers in the way of access to international and comparative sources is a worrying setback.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While s.\u00a012\u2019s international siblings vary in language, a common meaning can be ascribed to their various formulations as the phrase \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d is a compendious expression of a norm. The criterion applied to determine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual is whether the punishment prescribed is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency. All of the relevant international sources lead to the irrefutable inference that the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment is intended to protect human dignity by prohibiting degrading, inhuman, or dehumanizing treatment or punishment that causes physical or mental pain and suffering. None of them include protection for corporations. While this international consensus does not dictate the outcome, it provides compelling and relevant interpretive support. A review of foreign domestic law, while not determinative, also supports an interpretation of s.\u00a012 of the Charter which excludes protection for corporations. Internationally, it is widely acknowledged that the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment is intended to protect human dignity by prohibiting degrading, inhuman, or dehumanizing treatment or punishment that causes physical or mental pain and suffering.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Looking at the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which s.\u00a012 is associated, ss.\u00a07 to 14 of the Charter are grouped under the heading \u201cLegal Rights\u201d. The broad purposes of these legal rights are to preserve the rights of detained individuals, by ensuring they are dealt with fairly and humanely, and to maintain the repute and integrity of the system of justice. Significantly, corporations have been found not to be included under both ss.\u00a07 and 11(c).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The purpose of s.\u00a012 is to confer protection on a singularly human level. It is meant to protect human dignity and respect the inherent worth of individuals. Just as corporations cannot experience human reactions such as stress or anxiety, neither can they experience suffering. It would strain the interpretation of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under s.\u00a012 if a corporation, an artificial entity, could be said to experience it. Since corporations do not fall within the purpose of s.\u00a012, they do not fall within its protective scope.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Kasirer\u00a0J.: There is agreement with Abella, Brown and Rowe JJ. that the protection offered by s.\u00a012 of the Charter does not extend to corporations. Charter rights must be given a large, liberal and purposive interpretation. Starting from the language of s.\u00a012, particularly the word \u201ccruel\u201d, the dissenting Court of Appeal judge correctly found that it would distort the ordinary meaning of the words to say that it is possible to be cruel to a corporate entity. Although the scope of s.\u00a012 has been broadened over the years, its evolution is still concerned only with human beings. In his analysis, the dissenting judge relied on sources drawn from domestic, international and English law and on the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec. In this case, it is unnecessary to consider questions relating to the proper approach to constitutional interpretation or the place of international law and comparative law in that approach any further.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "citation": "2020 SCC 32",
        "summary": "<strong>The </strong><em><strong>Charter </strong></em><strong>only protects human  beings\u2014not corporations\u2014from cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   9147-0732  Qu\u00e9bec inc. was a corporation. It was found guilty of doing construction work  without a licence. Quebec\u2019s <em>Building Act</em> set out a minimum fine as punishment. It was fined over $30,000. The corporation  said that the minimum fine was cruel and unusual punishment. It said this made  the fine unconstitutional.      The <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> sets  out the rights and freedoms that Canadians have. It is part of Canada\u2019s  Constitution. Section 12 says that everyone has  the right \u201cnot to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or  punishment.\u201d This means certain treatments or punishments  are unacceptable and not allowed.  A  corporation is a \u201clegal person.\u201d A legal person is treated like a physical  person (a human being) for some purposes under the law. It has its own \u201clegal  personality,\u201d meaning it has its own rights and duties. For example, it can  sign contracts and own property, just like a human being can.  Corporations  can benefit from some <em>Charter </em>rights.  For example, corporations are protected against \u201cunreasonable search and  seizure\u201d under section 8. The state can\u2019t search or take something  private from a corporation without permission, unless the law specifically  allows it, like when police have a warrant. Corporations also have the right to  a criminal trial in a reasonable time under section 11(b). However, they don\u2019t  get the benefit of all <em>Charter </em>rights.  Corporations don\u2019t have a right to \u201clife, liberty and security of the person\u201d  under section 7. They also don\u2019t have a right not to be forced to testify under  section 11(c). The question in this case was whether a corporation could be  protected from cruel and unusual punishment under section 12. The trial judge at the Court of Quebec said the fine wasn\u2019t cruel and  unusual. Anyway, he said, section 12only  protects human beings, not corporations. The first appeal judge, at the  Superior Court, agreed. The majority of judges at the Court of Appeal  disagreed, though. They said section 12 could apply to corporations. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that section 12 only protects people  (that is, real, live human beings). They said it doesn\u2019t protect corporations. Cases  dealing with section 12 have focused on \u201chuman dignity.\u201d Human dignity is the  idea that everyone has value and deserves respect, simply because they are a  human being. It doesn\u2019t matter who they are or what they\u2019ve done. The judges  pointed out that section 12 is meant to protect human dignity. Only human  beings can have human dignity. Corporations can\u2019t. The  majority noted that it didn\u2019t matter that there were human beings behind the  corporation. There are always real human beings behind a legal person. Even  though they may be making decisions on its behalf, they still keep their own  separate, individual legal personality. Most  of the judges looked at the word \u201ccruel\u201d in the phrase \u201ccruel and unusual  punishment.\u201d They pointed out that this word would normally only describe  something that caused pain or suffering. That could only happen to a living  thing like a human being, not a legal person like a corporation. This supported  the idea that section 12 didn\u2019t apply to corporations. The  majority of judges focused on the wording of the <em>Charter</em>, its goals, and its history in making their decision. They said  the wording of the <em>Charter </em>and past  Canadian court decisions made it clear that section 12 only applied to human  beings. The majority said they didn\u2019t need to rely on international treaties or  laws or cases from other countries to help them decide. But they said  international treaties that Canada agreed to should matter more than ones that  it didn\u2019t agree to. Section  12 falls under the part of the <em>Charter </em>that  deals with legal rights. Sections 7 to 14 protect people\u2019s rights when they are dealing with the justice system. They  make sure people can trust it and that they are treated fairly, especially when  they are charged with a crime. They are based on a belief in the dignity and  worth of every human being."

The investments essentially involved capital that was guaranteed at maturity and corresponded to the original value of the deposit, and a potential return that was variable. It is alleged that the investments were purchased as a result of representations made by a financial planner and mutual fund representative who was a subordinate or mandatary of Desjardins Financial Services Firm Inc. (\u201cFirm\u201d), which is part of the Desjardins Group and which specializes in financial services. Both the financial planner and various documents promoting the investments allegedly represented them as being safe and as providing an attractive return, despite the fact that they involved a specific risk that affected their return potential.\u00a0It is alleged that the investments were designed and managed by Desjardins Global Asset Management Inc. (\u201cManagement\u201d), which is also part of the Desjardins Group and which specializes in asset management.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In March 2009, A received a letter informing him that he would obtain no return on his PP and ALT investments up to the time they matured. In February 2010, A received an investment statement indicating that his investments had in fact yielded a return of 0 percent for 2009. In September 2011, A filed a motion in the Quebec Superior Court seeking authorization to institute a class action against Firm and Management. He argued that Firm was contractually liable to the members of the class action group for breaching its duty to inform. He claimed that Firm had not adequately informed him and the other members of the group of the risks associated with the investments, alleging both direct and indirect fault. He argued that Management was extracontractually liable to the group\u2019s members for breaching its duties of competence with regard to design and management. He alleged that Management had used risky investment strategies, including strategies involving investments in asset\u2011backed commercial paper (\u201cABCP\u201d), that had resulted in a loss of all the assets allocated to the return.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Superior Court dismissed the motion for authorization to institute a class action against Firm and Management. The authorization judge found that A had not shown that his proposed action in contractual liability against Firm and in extracontractual liability against Management had a good colour of right as required by art.\u00a01003(b) of the former Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec (\u201cformer C.C.P.\u201d). The judge also found that there were no common questions as required by the condition set out in art.\u00a01003(a) of the former C.C.P., though she neglected to deal with that condition in relation to the action against Management. The Court of Appeal allowed A\u2019s appeal and authorized the class action against Firm and Management.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis, Brown, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: The Court of Appeal was correct to authorize the class action proposed by A both against Firm and against Management. The authorization judge erred in analyzing certain aspects of the conditions set out in subparas.\u00a0(a) and (b) of art.\u00a01003 of the former C.C.P.\u00a0(which correspond to subparas.\u00a0(1) and (2) of art.\u00a0575 of the new Code of Civil Procedure). However, the appeal should be allowed in part for the sole purpose of varying paras.\u00a08 and 9 of the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment in order to clarify the scope of the claim for punitive damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Here, the allegations are sufficient to establish an arguable case against Firm in accordance with the condition set out in art.\u00a01003(b) of the former C.C.P. It is in principle not appropriate at the authorization stage for the court to make any determination as to the merits in law of the conclusions in light of the facts being alleged. The proposed syllogism is neither frivolous nor clearly unfounded in law. The allegations are precise enough to be assumed to be true, and there is a sufficient basis for them in the evidence adduced. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A\u2019s syllogism is based on a breach by Firm of its duty to inform. In his motion, A explains right in the summary that he is alleging that Firm and Management breached and violated the obligations and duties of information, competence and management. Firm allegedly failed to inform adequately the group\u2019s members of the risky transactions conducted using the amounts the members had entrusted to it. With regard to injury, A explains the loss of a return resulting from risky investment strategies; with regard to causation, he states that he would never have agreed to invest in the PP and ALT investments if Firm had adequately informed him of the risks associated with them. The faults are described with sufficient precision, and the information missing for the entire group relates, among other things, to the level of risk involved in the investments, their volatility and the way they worked, including the leverage used.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It can be understood from these allegations that the proposed action is based not on a breach of the deposit agreements, but rather on a generalized and systematic breach of the duty to inform. A alleges that Firm systematically breached this duty by not adequately informing all of its representatives of the risks and characteristics of the investments (the direct fault). According to the facts alleged in the motion, the representatives, having received false, misleading or incomplete information, then failed to provide adequate information to the group\u2019s members (the indirect fault). Firm\u2019s alleged dual fault, and the basis for the action, is a generalized and systematic breach of its general duty to inform. This dual fault refers, in other words, to two sides of the same coin: Firm\u2019s breach of its duty to inform the group\u2019s members directly itself, and to inform them indirectly through its representatives.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A person who provides financial services is indeed subject to a duty to inform, and failure to comply with that duty may give rise to civil liability, for which the principal or mandator of the financial adviser at fault must answer. The group\u2019s members were linked to Firm by a contract for services within the meaning of art.\u00a02098 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec or, if the services were not paid for directly, a similar sui\u00a0generis contract. Grounded in the general obligation of good faith (arts.\u00a06, 7 and 1375 of the Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec), the duty to inform relates to all contracts and, in principle, applies to all contracting parties. There is a distinction between the duty to provide advice and the duty to inform. The obligation to inform is an obligation to reveal to another facts that the latter, in order to adjust his or her conduct, may legitimately expect to receive. The obligation to provide advice is an obligation to provide counsel to another in the furtherance of the latter\u2019s interest. The duty to inform is less onerous and less individualized than the obligation to provide advice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In Bank of Montreal\u00a0v. Bail Lt\u00e9e, 1992 CanLII 71 (SCC), [1992] 2\u00a0S.C.R. 554, the Court observed that the scope of the obligation to inform is assessed on the basis of the following criteria: (1)\u00a0knowledge of the information, whether actual or presumed, by the party which owes the obligation to inform; (2)\u00a0the fact that the information in question is of decisive importance; (3)\u00a0the fact that it is impossible for the party to whom the duty to inform is owed to inform itself, or that the creditor is legitimately relying on the debtor of the obligation. In the case at bar, Firm knows or is presumed to know the characteristics of the investments it recommends. A alleges that he would never have agreed to invest in the PP and ALT investments if he had been adequately informed of the risks associated with them and that it was impossible for him to inform himself of Management\u2019s investment strategies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The motion does not allege a positive misrepresentation; it alleges an omission corresponding to a breach of the duty to inform, which, unlike the duty to provide advice, is an obligation of result. Mere proof by the creditor that the result was not achieved is sufficient to give rise to a presumption that the debtor is liable. At the authorization stage, the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that the proposed legal syllogism is arguable, not the burden of proving each element of the syllogism on the usual civil balance of probabilities standard. In this context, the evidence adduced by A in support of allegations that must be assumed to be true is more than sufficient. The action can be authorized without proof on a balance of probabilities that A was not given the information. A filed many documents to support allegations concerning Firm\u2019s failure to disclose, to all clients, the risks associated with the methods used to manage the investments. It is argued that the choice made by Firm and its representatives to rely on the documents is evidence of the breach of the contractual duty to inform alleged in support of Firm\u2019s indirect contractual liability. A\u2019s pre\u2011hearing examination is also relevant evidence with respect to the non\u2011performance of an obligation to do something, such as an absence of advice or information. The breach amounts to a negative, which is inherently difficult to establish persuasively, but which can be proved simply by testimony.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The common questions condition set out in art.\u00a01003(a) of the former C.C.P.\u00a0is also met with respect to the proposed action against Firm. At the authorization stage, the decisions of the Quebec courts and of the Court require a flexible approach to the common interest that must exist among the group\u2019s members. As a result, even where circumstances vary from one group member to another, a class action can be authorized if some of the questions are common. The fact that the situations of all members of the group are not perfectly identical does not mean that the group does not exist or is not uniform. In Quebec, a single common question is sufficient as long as it advances the litigation in a not insignificant manner. The class action in this case concerns a contractual breach of the duty to inform that grounds both Firm\u2019s direct liability and its indirect liability. In both cases, the alleged omissions are systematic in nature and do not depend on each client\u2019s individual characteristics. The systematic nature of these omissions in both cases makes it possible to identify common questions in the proposed action against Firm under art.\u00a01003(a). \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The motion filed by A indicates that the group\u2019s members were systematically misinformed. By giving its representatives documents that were misleading or incomplete, Firm misinformed them and did not give them the means to adequately inform the group\u2019s members. The information provided to the members was therefore necessarily wrong or insufficient, if not false, deceptive or misleading. The systematic nature of Firm\u2019s breach is thus clearly alleged and must be assumed to be true. Moreover, the information in question was objective information that Firm never gave the representatives or the members concerning the risky nature of the investments.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The position taken in the motion is not based on the individual liability of a financial adviser to a particular client, which would depend on evidence of each client\u2019s profile to establish whether the investment was in fact appropriate. The alleged fault is a breach of a general obligation to inform that affected each member, not a breach of an individualized obligation to properly advise a client. Although the duty to inform varies with the context, there are circumstances in which all creditors were deprived of information as a result of a systematic omission. In this case, A specifically alleges the existence of such circumstances, in which an informational imbalance and Firm\u2019s control of the information are common to all the members. Indeed, A alleges that the group\u2019s members could not have known the information that Firm had about how the investments worked even with all due diligence. A class action based on a brokerage firm\u2019s liability for the conduct of its representatives is therefore possible if the issue is whether the information provided by the firm to its representatives and to the group\u2019s members was insufficient, with the result that a general duty to inform was breached. To conclude otherwise would deprive the class action of part of its role of helping people who, for economic and other reasons, face barriers in asserting their rights. The Court of Appeal was accordingly justified in intervening. It appears that the authorization judge considered the common questions condition from the perspective of an action based on the duty to provide individualized advice tailored to each client\u2019s risk tolerance even though that was not the basis for A\u2019s action.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is conceded that it can be argued that Management is liable as the designer of the investments. On the issue of whether the case against Management is an arguable one, the syllogism proposed by A is neither circular nor untenable. A does not merely say in his allegations that Management\u2019s practices were risky because the investments did not generate a return; he makes concrete allegations against Management. These allegations are sufficiently precise. As for the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on the causal link between Management\u2019s alleged extracontractual faults and the loss for which A is seeking compensation, this is an issue that goes to the merits of the case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A is claiming punitive damages from Management pursuant to ss.\u00a06 and 49 of the Charter of human rights and freedoms for unlawful and intentional interference with his right to the peaceful possession of his property. For the purposes of that claim, he alleges that a significant portion of the money market investments in the PP and ALT investments consisted of ABCP. Management submits that any claim relating to ABCP has been extinguished as a result of the Sanction Order made by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as part of the restructuring of the ABCP market carried out under the Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act (\u201cCCAA\u201d). The motion judge found that the claim based on ABCP was, on its face, barred, but she did not refer to the distinction between \u201cAffected ABCP\u201d and \u201cUnaffected Claims\u201d as dealt with in the Third Amended Plan of Compromise and Arrangement that was the subject of the Sanction Order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal correctly found that the motion judge could not decide whether the claim was barred at the authorization stage. It is true that a court may decide a pure question of law at the authorization stage if the outcome of the proposed class action depends on its doing so, but the question of whether the ABCP concerned is part of the Affected ABCP covered by the release and listed in its Schedule \u201cA\u201d is not a pure question of law. It is not the application of the Order that is being contested but rather its scope, which can be argued later. The scope of the Affected ABCP and the unaffected ABCP under the Order is an issue that could, if necessary, be referred to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Caution must be exercised at the authorization stage, and any doubt should weigh in favour of the continuation of the proceedings. Deferring this matter will not result in Management losing any rights given that the action must proceed on the merits on the claim for compensatory damages. Though difficult, a claim for punitive damages based on unlawful and intentional interference under s.\u00a06 of the Charter of human rights and freedoms in relation to the ABCP not covered by the release remains arguable in this context. However, it must be specified that any payment to each member of the group of an amount in punitive damages may be sought solely in relation to Unaffected Claims within the meaning of art.\u00a01 of the Third Amended Plan of Compromise and Arrangement dated January\u00a012, 2009. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part.\u00a0Authorization of the proposed class action against Firm should be denied, and authorization of the proposed class action against Management should be granted, but only in relation to the claim for compensatory damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The objectives of facilitating access to justice, modifying harmful behaviour and conserving judicial resources that underlie the class action can be attained only if a rigorous procedure is followed for the authorization of such an action. The class action is a cumbersome procedural vehicle that represents a huge undertaking for all of the participants, including the courts. Authorization is meant to be more than a mere formality. Its purpose is to protect the interests of all those involved in the class action \u2014 not only the interests of the representative and the absent members, but also those of the defendants and even of the administration of justice. The authorization stage is what confers full legitimacy on the class action.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Even though the court plays a more active role in the context of a class action, it may not take on the role of party or counsel and reorient the action as presented by the applicant however it likes. The court\u2019s role is not to read between the lines in order to guess the basis for the action whose authorization is being sought, or for the legal syllogism, where no specific allegations are made in relation to a key element of the cause of action. The court hearing the motion for authorization can supplement the allegations using the evidence in the record and can draw inferences and presumptions from them. However, the court is not required to assume the applicant\u2019s legal allegations to be true; it may decide a pure question of law at the authorization stage if the outcome of the proposed class action depends on its doing so. When a judge decides a question of law on which the outcome of a class action depends at the authorization stage, this furthers the objectives of predictability of the law and judicial economy that underlie the system of administration of justice. The judge\u2019s role at the authorization stage is to screen out frivolous or untenable actions, but also to verify that all the conditions of art.\u00a01003 of the former C.C.P. are met. A motion that does not meet all the conditions is not for that reason alone frivolous. Because the court must assume that the alleged facts are true, the allegations must be clear and complete, not vague, general or imprecise. Defects of form can be excused, but substantive defects cannot be. The allegations must be read carefully in order to determine whether the legal syllogism they propose is an arguable one.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the authorization stage, judges have considerable leeway in assessing whether the conditions set out in art.\u00a01003 of the former C.C.P. are met. If a judge is of the opinion that each condition is met, he or she must authorize the action and has no discretion to decline to do so. An appellate court\u2019s power of intervention is limited, and it must defer to the judge\u2019s assessment of the conditions. The applicable standard for appellate intervention is that of palpable and overriding error.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the motion judge did not err in stating that Firm could not be contractually liable on the basis of the deposit agreements for the PP and ALT investments because the parties to those agreements were the clients and their respective caisses populaires. The contract that could give rise to Firm\u2019s contractual liability is instead the one that it entered into with clients through its representatives, which was a contract for services whose sole object was the giving of advice. While the giving of advice was the core prestation under the contract, this did not preclude a duty to inform from existing as well. The judge also analyzed the action against Firm as it had been presented, that is, from the standpoint of Firm\u2019s contractual liability for a breach of the duty to inform. This was analyzed in relation to a contractual basis for the action arising from the mandator\u2011mandatary relationship between Firm\u2019s representatives and the clients. The judge\u2019s assessment of the authorization conditions was entitled to deference on appeal absent a palpable and overriding error.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The common questions requirement set out in art.\u00a01003(a) of the former C.C.P. is not met with respect to the proposed action against Firm. The liability of financial advisers for a breach of the duty to inform and the duty to provide advice is not well suited to a class action because of the highly individual nature of the relationship between a client and an adviser in the context of a contract for investment services. In such a case, the liability analysis would have to be repeated for each individual claim. The case law is consistent in this regard: there can be no common questions in such circumstances. However, if an applicant can show that the breach was systematic in nature, the common questions condition will not be an impediment to authorizing the action. A, on the other hand, has neither alleged nor shown any kind of systematic breach of the advisers\u2019 duty to inform that might be imputed to Firm. By his own admission, he has no idea whether other clients were in the same situation as him. It is therefore the absence of a systematic breach that is fatal to A\u2019s action, not the fact that the action concerns financial advisers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The duty to inform is more general than the duty to provide advice owed by Firm\u2019s representatives; the duty to inform is, however, a variable obligation shaped by the circumstances of each case, as was affirmed in Bail. This is especially true in cases where the duty to inform is an accessory to a main prestation whose object is the giving of advice. In this case, the obligation to inform arose in the broader context of the provision of a financial adviser\u2019s services, which varies in accordance with several factors, including the length of the relationship and the client\u2019s goals and level of expertise. The obligation of advisers or dealers to know their clients shapes their relationship with them; it is clear that the clients\u2019 specific circumstances are of significant importance. It is therefore not surprising that A does not know whether there are other members in the same situation as him. His situation cannot be extrapolated to the other members of the proposed group.\u00a0Accordingly, even though a court should not focus on each member\u2019s specific characteristics at the authorization stage of the class action, the fact remains that in this case the elements of fault, causation and injury raised by A on behalf of the group are highly variable. Given the need for such a contextual analysis, there can therefore be no commonality to the question of whether the duty to inform was breached unless it is shown that the breach occurred systematically. The individualized analysis required by the action precludes the possibility of proceeding on a collective basis. A systematic duplication of fact\u2011finding and legal analysis will be required for each relationship between a financial adviser and a client, which means that the proposed question cannot advance the litigation in a not insignificant manner.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case of the proposed action against Management, the Court of Appeal\u2019s intervention was warranted only in part. The Court of Appeal properly authorized the action against Management except in relation to the claim for punitive damages. On this point, the authorization judge was correct to consider the release with respect to ABCP found in the Sanction Order, and the scope of that release, in concluding that the claim against Management for punitive damages in relation to ABCP did not establish an arguable case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The defences available to a defendant are generally considered at the trial on the merits. However, a court may decide a pure question of law at the authorization stage if the outcome of the proposed class action depends on its doing so. This principle also extends to the interpretation of a release included in a sanction order made by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which has full force and effect in Quebec under s.\u00a016 of the CCAA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The outcome of the part of the proposed action that concerns punitive damages in relation to ABCP depends on how the terms of the release are interpreted. Where evidence is necessary to determine the applicability of a release found in a sanction order, this question should be decided at the trial on the merits. Conversely, where such evidence is not necessary, as in this case, it would be neither logical nor desirable, from the standpoint of judicial economy and of proportionality of proceedings, to defer making a decision on this question of law when the court has an opportunity to decide it at the authorization stage. This is especially true for releases resulting from a compromise or arrangement sanctioned by a court under the CCAA. These releases advance one of the CCAA\u2019s important objectives, which is to favour restructuring by preventing the risk of litigation. Under ss.\u00a016 and 17 of the CCAA, it is imperative that Quebec courts give effect to CCAA orders regardless of the jurisdiction where the proceedings took place.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the release presents two impediments that are fatal to A\u2019s claim for punitive damages based on ABCP. The first impediment arises from the limited cause of action authorized for an Excepted Claim: the claim must be based on express fraudulent misrepresentations made to the potential plaintiff by an authorized representative of the potential defendant. However, A\u2019s claim for punitive damages is based not on a misrepresentation, but rather on Management\u2019s fault, which lies in flawed design and management\u00a0contrary to its obligations and duties to act prudently and diligently and to adhere to sound and prudent management practices. The motion does not allege a cause of action covered by the definition of an Excepted Claim.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second impediment to the claim for punitive damages relates to the strict time limit for asserting a claim. The nine\u2011week time limit began to run on the date of delivery of notice by the Monitor, which was essentially the date on which the Sanction Order was made, namely June\u00a05, 2008. A\u2019s motion for authorization to institute a class action was served on September\u00a016, 2011. His claim for punitive damages based on Management\u2019s use of an investment strategy that included ABCP was therefore filed out of time. The release stands in the way of A\u2019s legal syllogism with regard to Management\u2019s fault, and the claim based on ABCP must be dismissed because it does not have the colour of right required by art.\u00a01003(b) of the former C.C.P.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Insofar as it is argued that Management is liable as the designer and manager of the products, the action can be authorized in relation to compensatory damages. By referring to the effects of the 2008 financial crisis in declining to authorize this part of the action, the authorization judge decided the merits of the action. However, this aspect of the action is not devoid of foundation. This was an error that warranted the Court of Appeal\u2019s intervention.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: L\u2019Oratoire Saint\u2011Joseph du Mont\u2011Royal v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0class action by investors against mutual fund  sellers and managers can go ahead, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n    Desjardins  Financial Services sold mutual funds and helped people with financial planning.  Desjardins Global Asset Management created and managed investments that people  could buy. Mr.  Asselin talked to a Desjardins financial planner. The financial planner  recommended he buy some investments. He bought them. The investments were  \u201ccapital-guaranteed,\u201d meaning he wouldn\u2019t lose any money. The representative  gave Mr. Asselin documents saying the investments would make money and weren\u2019t  risky. In the end, he earned nothing. He did get his original investment back,  though. Mr.  Asselin said he only found out later that the investments were risky. He also said  they were managed in a risky way. Mr. Asselin said he wouldn\u2019t have bought them  if he knew the risks. He argued that Desjardins Financial Services should have  told its financial planners about the risk, so they could tell their clients. Other  people were in the same position as him. Mr. Asselin decided to launch a \u201cclass  action\u201d lawsuit on their behalf. He said Desjardins Financial Services was  directly responsible for the fact he didn\u2019t make the money he expected. This  was because it didn\u2019t give proper instructions to its financial planners and  other representatives. He said it was indirectly responsible for the  representatives passing on the bad information. He also said Desjardins  Financial Management was responsible because it created and managed the  investments. When a large group of people have the same legal  problem, they might decide to get together and sue as a group. This is called a  \u201cclass action\u201d lawsuit. (The \u201cclass\u201d is the group, so it\u2019s a <em>group</em> action.) A class action lets the  whole group get their complaint dealt with at once. Otherwise, each person  would have to go to court on their own. A judge has to give permission for  (authorize) the class action to go ahead. In Quebec, the judge\u2019s main goal is  to make sure the class action isn\u2019t \u201cfrivolous\u201d (has no chance of success). The motion judge said the class action couldn\u2019t go  forward. The Court of Appeal said it could. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court mostly agreed  with the Court of Appeal. They said the motion judge went beyond making sure  the class action wasn\u2019t frivolous. This was legally wrong at this point in the  process.  The majority didn\u2019t make a decision about Mr.  Asselin\u2019s claim. It only said he could have his day in court. The majority agreed with Mr. Asselin that Desjardins  Financial Services had a \u201cduty to inform\u201d people about the risks. The majority  said a trial judge might eventually hold it responsible directly (for not  giving its representatives the information) and indirectly (through the  representatives acting on its behalf). However, a trial judge would decide that  later.  The majority said a trial judge might eventually  hold Desjardins Global Asset Management responsible for how it designed and  managed the investments. It might not be responsible for everything, though. Part  of the class action asking for \u201cpunitive damages\u201d (which aren\u2019t meant to  compensate victims, but to punish wrongdoers) wouldn\u2019t go forward. The trial  judge would have to decide what this covered.    Class actions are based on people having the same  legal issues. This means the court has to deal with \u201ccommon questions\u201d  (questions that are the same for many or all members of the group). But people  may also have individual issues and questions. In Quebec, as long as there is  one common question that pushes the class action forward, that\u2019s enough. In  this case, a common question was whether Desjardins Financial Services didn\u2019t  properly inform its representatives, who then failed to tell clients about the  risks. It wasn\u2019t about a particular financial adviser who made a mistake. All  the financial advisers may have made the same mistake if they weren\u2019t trained  properly or given the right information.   Class actions are  meant to help people get access to justice. This can be easier to do as a group  instead of individually. When a class action is authorized, judges aren\u2019t  supposed to look at whether the case will be successful. They are just supposed  to look at whether it has a chance of success. Different provinces and  territories have different rules, but the goals are the same.

In 1999, the developer and the City of Burnaby entered into an agreement (\u201cASP Agreement\u201d), which provided for mutual easements for support, service connections, vehicular access and other uses to and on the Crystal\u2019s various air space parcels. In particular, s.\u00a07.5 of the ASP Agreement obliged the owner of the parking facility to provide the owners of the other air space parcels with parking and vehicular access rights in exchange for an annual fee, payable monthly. It also provided that, upon the subdivision of any of the air space parcels by a strata plan, the strata corporation so created would be entitled to give all permissions and consents permitted to be given by the owners of the subdivided parcel, and that the strata corporation would be responsible for payment of the fee as well as for administering the parking rights of the strata lot owners. In addition, it provided that once the owner of the parking facility had recouped the capital costs of construction of the facility, the annual fee would be significantly reduced. Further, s.\u00a016.3 provided that, upon subdivision of a parcel by a strata plan, the strata corporation was to enter into an assumption agreement with the owners of the other air space parcels so as to assume obligations under the ASP Agreement. The ASP Agreement was registered as an easement in a land title office on March 17, 1999.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 On May 26, 1999, Strata Plan LMS 3905, which comprises 68 strata lots in the office tower on the Crystal\u2019s second air space parcel, was deposited in a land title office, establishing Strata Co. Strata Co. never entered into the assumption agreement with the other air space parcel owners that was provided for in the ASP Agreement. On June 28, 2002, the developer sold the fifth air space parcel, upon which the parking facility is situated, to a parking corporation (\u201cCSPC\u201d). As part of the transaction, the developer assigned the ASP Agreement to CSPC.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Until 2012, Strata Co.\u2019s members parked in the parking facility and paid the fees at the rate contemplated in the ASP Agreement. A dispute then arose between the parties and Strata Co. ceased paying the parking fees. CSPC responded by revoking the parking privileges of Strata Co.\u2019s members. Litigation ensued. Strata Co. sought a declaration that s.\u00a07.5 of the ASP agreement was null and void or an order that it was unenforceable, or, in the alternative, an order that s.\u00a07.5 be rectified to state that the capital costs had been fully recovered, and also sought damages or disgorgement for breach of contract. CSPC filed a counterclaim, seeking judgment in the amount of unpaid fees it alleged were owed to it by Strata Co. pursuant to the ASP Agreement. The trial judge found Strata Co.\u2019s conduct did not evince an intention to enter into a post\u2011incorporation agreement and therefore that it was not bound by the ASP Agreement. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial judge\u2019s decision and held that Strata Co. had entered into a post-incorporation contract on the same terms as those of the ASP Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Rowe J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: Although a corporation is not bound by a pre\u2011incorporation contract, it may, after coming into existence, enter into a new contract on the same terms as those of the pre\u2011incorporation contract. The applicable test for finding that a post-incorporation contract exists is the same as the one for finding that any other agreement exists at common law. The test is objective, and the offer, acceptance, consideration and terms may be inferred from the parties\u2019 conduct and from the surrounding circumstances. An outward manifestation of assent by each party such as to induce a reasonable expectation in the other is required, and an examination of how each party\u2019s conduct would appear to a reasonable person in the position of the other party is necessary.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Strata Property Act (\u201cSPA\u201d) does not oust the common law principles relating to contract formation. The common law forms part of the context in which a legislature enacts statutes, and the legislature is presumed not to have intended to alter or extinguish common law rules in doing so. These presumptions can be rebutted only by establishing a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary. There is no indication in the SPA of a clear legislative intent to rebut the presumptions; on the contrary, there are signs in the SPA that the legislature in fact intended to allow strata corporations to enter into unwritten agreements by their conduct. Finding that a contract is binding on a strata corporation on the basis of its objective conduct is not inconsistent with the SPA\u2019s governance model for strata corporations. Furthermore, there are no compelling reasons to alter the common law of contracts as applied to strata corporations in order to protect strata lot purchasers from unscrupulous practices of or unfair surprises from developers, because British Columbia\u2019s legislative framework already includes several protections for strata lot purchasers. Abrogating the generally applicable principles of contract formation in the case of strata corporations would undermine commercial certainty and thwart the reasonable expectations of commercial parties by casting aside the wisdom and experience found in centuries of incrementally developed precedent and principle governing commercial relations. Rather than attempting to reinvent contract law to accommodate the novelty of strata property ownership, it is best to resort to the settled and generally applicable principles established in the jurisprudence. Thus, the need for certainty in commercial affairs and the importance of protecting the reasonable expectations of commercial parties compel the continued ordinary operation of the common law in this area. A strata corporation can therefore enter into a post\u2011incorporation contract by its conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The enforcement of a post\u2011incorporation contract which affects interests in land does not amount to an exception to the general rule that positive covenants do not bind subsequent purchasers of land. Real covenants and contracts create juridically distinct forms of rights and obligations, which should not be confused with one another. Landowners may use restrictive real covenants to bind subsequent purchasers in equity, even in the absence of privity of contract. In contrast, the right to contractual performance is a legal interest that is personal to the contracting parties.\u00a0 Another distinction between real covenants and contractual rights lies in the timing of the creation of the right. When equity is used to enforce a restrictive real covenant against a subsequent purchaser who purchased the land with notice of the covenant, the right being enforced is a pre\u2011existing equitable right which persisted through the transfer from the predecessor in title. Contractual rights, on the other hand, are created at the time of contract formation. In the case of a post\u2011incorporation contract, they are created after the corporation comes into existence when the parties objectively manifest an intention to be bound by a new agreement on the same terms as those of the pre\u2011incorporation contract. The enforcement of a contractual right against a party to the contract is therefore not to be equated with the enforcement of a real covenant against a subsequent purchaser and an otherwise valid and effective post\u2011incorporation contract is not unenforceable simply because its terms affect interests in land.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, the Court of Appeal was correct to find that Strata Co. did in fact manifest an intention, by way of objective conduct, to be bound by a post\u2011incorporation contract with CSPC after CSPC purchased the parking facility from the developer. There is strong evidence of both offer and acceptance of a post\u2011incorporation contract between Strata Co. and CSPC. After purchasing the parking facility, CSPC objectively manifested an intention to offer Strata Co. a contract on the terms of the ASP Agreement by making valid parking passes available to Strata Co.\u2019s members in a quantity which corresponded to their share of parking spaces under s.\u00a07.5 of the ASP Agreement. As well, CSPC\u2019s maintenance and operation of the parking facility over the years would have required significant capital expenditures. The ASP Agreement in fact provided for such expenditures, which were factored into the parking fee paid by Strata Co. Strata Co.\u2019s members ought to have known that valuable consideration was being rendered for their benefit with an expectation that they would pay for it on terms corresponding to those set out in s.\u00a07.5 of the ASP Agreement. In turn, Strata Co. objectively manifested an intention to accept CSPC\u2019s offer by paying the fees contemplated in the ASP Agreement, and its members exercised the rights corresponding to those payments by parking in the facility after CSPC became the facility\u2019s owner. The members, having either assented to the consideration or acquiesced in its being rendered, taking the benefit of it when it was rendered, should be taken impliedly to have requested its being rendered. Thus, a reasonable person in CSPC\u2019s position would consider that Strata Co.\u2019s course of conduct constituted assent by Strata\u00a0Co. to the terms set out in s.\u00a07.5 of the ASP Agreement. Strata Co.\u2019s objective conduct evinces an intention to enter into a legally binding agreement on the terms set out in s.\u00a07.5 of the ASP Agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Rowe J. (dissenting in part): The majority\u2019s analysis of the law in this case should be adopted, but not the disposition of the appeal. It should not be decided whether Strata Co. had manifested an objective intent to be bound to the terms of the ASP Agreement. Rather, this question should be remitted for determination by the trial court as it is better placed to answer it. Applying the law here is a fact\u2011specific exercise and the Court does not have all the facts needed to do so. The majority\u2019s finding of fact differs from that made by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal treated taking the benefit of the agreement as a per se manifestation of the intention of the party to be bound by the terms as expressed. The majority, however, appears to frame things slightly differently in favour of a more traditional assessment of offer and acceptance. By reframing the legal test, the application of the law to the facts necessarily gives rise to a different question of mixed fact and law than that decided by the Court of Appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Appellate courts should make findings of fact not made by courts below only when doing so is in the interests of justice and is feasible on a practical level. This involves weighing two factors: first, the possible savings to the parties in cost and time arising from the appellate court deciding such factual issues; and, second, the possible harm from an appellate court making such findings in the absence of adequate evidence. In this case, both factors run counter to the Court making findings of fact; rather, they favour appellate restraint. It is questionable whether there is efficiency in the use of judicial or counsel resources to be gained by the Court making the factual determinations that the majority would make. The Court cannot finally dispose of the action, as even if it dismisses the appeal, the case must be remitted to the trial court for determination of mutual mistake of fact, rectification, unconscionability or frustration; and, if the claim is not made out, for determination of the counterclaim and assessment of damages. In addition, at that trial the judge may well need to consider the circumstances of contract formation in detail. Second, there is possible harm from this Court making the factual findings that are proposed. In this case, evidence to which the Court does not have access to could plausibly lead the trial judge to a different conclusion on whether and, if so, when the Strata Co. objectively manifested an intention to be bound. Moreover, the trial judge enjoys numerous advantages over appellate judges which bear on all conclusions of fact and can assess the credibility of witnesses, is relatively expert with respect to the weighing and assessing of evidence, and has had greater exposure to the entire factual nexus of the case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The existence of a pre\u2011incorporation contract is part of the circumstances in which the parties\u2019 conduct is objectively interpreted. Conduct consistent with the contract can be persuasive evidence that an offer has been accepted. Such conduct is not, however, dispositive evidence of the acceptance of the offer. In some circumstances, an alternate inference may provide an objectively better explanation for the conduct than acceptance of the offer. It is plausible that the trial court, with the benefit of a more complete record, would not see the conduct by the Strata Co. as objectively manifesting an intention to accept the contract. There are three competing inferences that the trial court might prefer: in paying the parking fees, Strata Co. was performing a pre\u2011existing obligation rather than assenting to a new obligation; Strata Co. was performing what it (mistakenly) thought to be a pre\u2011existing obligation and if the parking corporation, CSPC, had reason to know this, it could be unreasonable for it to take Strata Co.\u2019s payment as an indication of acceptance of a new obligation; and the ASP Agreement formed a conditional easement, and Strata Co.\u2019s payment was the exercise of an option under the conditional easement. Accordingly, these factual matters should be remitted to the trial court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Saint John Tug Boat Co. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0binding agreement will exist where both sides  show by their actions they meant to enter an agreement, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>\r\n     Crystal Square was a large complex in Burnaby, BC. It had  a mall, office tower, residential tower, hotel, parking garage, police office,  and cultural centre. Each was in a different \u201cair space parcel.\u201d Air space  parcels are parts within a whole. They can be separate buildings, or parts of a  building (like specific floors in a large tower). Legally, air space parcels  are separate. But they can share certain parts of the building or services. For  example, access to the street or connections for water or electricity. When Crystal Square was built,  its developer signed an Air Space Parcel Agreement with the City of Burnaby.  One thing the agreement set out was access to parking for each air space parcel  and how much they would pay for it. The office tower was a strata (condo) tower. A strata  is made up of several units or \u201cstrata lots.\u201d Strata lots are owned by  different people, but have shared areas. Each strata lot owner is a member of a  strata corporation. The corporation manages and maintains shared areas and services.  A strata corporation is considered a legal person. That means it can sign  contracts and own property, just like a physical person can. The strata  corporation didn\u2019t exist yet when the Air Space Parcel Agreement was signed. But  the members of the strata corporation still used the parking garage and paid  for it like the agreement said. Eventually, the owners felt that the parking cost was  too high. They realized they never formally signed the Air Space Parcel Agreement.  They said they didn\u2019t agree to the terms and it didn\u2019t apply to them. Crystal Square Parking owned and ran the parking  garage. It said the strata corporation accepted the agreement by following the  terms for a while.  The trial judge said the strata  corporation didn\u2019t sign any agreement. She said the agreement between the  developer and the city couldn\u2019t be enforced against the corporation. The Court  of Appeal said the strata corporation made a new agreement about parking. The  new agreement had the same terms as the one between the developer and the city.  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the Court of  Appeal. They said the strata corporation made a new agreement with Crystal  Square Parking, and that it could be enforced. They said the new agreement had  the same terms that were in the Air Space Parcel Agreement. The  Court used the usual rules of contract law to decide this case. There was no  law in BC that would change the way the rules applied to a strata corporation.  It was clear the owners couldn\u2019t be forced to follow the original Air Space  Parcel Agreement. Contracts are only between the parties who agree to them. Two  people can\u2019t sign a contract to force another person, who didn\u2019t agree, to do  something. This is called \u201cprivity of contract.\u201d (\u201cPrivity\u201d comes from the same  Latin word that \u201cprivate\u201d does, and contracts are private agreements.) Some  companies can \u201cadopt\u201d contracts that were agreed to before they existed, but  that didn\u2019t apply here. The majority said the strata corporation made and  accepted a new agreement, though. The owners had to follow that.<br/>\r\n     Generally,  contracts don\u2019t have to be in writing. That just makes the terms easier to  prove. If it\u2019s not clear that there is an agreement, or exactly what was agreed  to, courts look at actions. If both sides showed they meant to enter an  agreement, and acted in a way that led the other side to expect they would  follow through, then there is a contract. In this case, Crystal Square Parking made  parking passes available to the strata owners. The owners used the parking  spots and paid the fees that the original Air Space Parcel Agreement set out. In  this situation, there was no reason for Crystal Square Parking to think the strata  owners <em>didn\u2019t </em>agree to the terms.\r\n  This case was decided based on  common law contract rules (that is, rules about contracts developed by judges).  Legislatures can change these rules by passing laws, but no written laws  (statutes) applied to strata corporations in this particular case. The Supreme  Court of Canada has dealt with many different kinds of contract issues before.  For example, in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/37546-eng.aspx\">Moore v. Sweet</a></em>,  it said a verbal agreement about who got insurance money was valid. "

Upon returning to full\u2011time service, they experienced difficulties combining their work obligations with their childcare responsibilities. At the time, the RCMP did not permit regular members to work part\u2011time. In December 1997, the RCMP introduced a job\u2011sharing program in which members could split the duties and responsibilities of one full\u2011time position. The three claimants enrolled in the job\u2011sharing program; they and most of the other RCMP members who job\u2011shared were women with children. Pursuant to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act, and the associated Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Regulations (\u201cpension plan\u201d), RCMP members can treat certain gaps in full\u2011time service, such as leave without pay, as fully pensionable. The claimants expected that job\u2011sharing would be eligible for full pension credits. However, they were later informed that they would not be able to purchase full\u2011time pension credit for their job\u2011sharing service.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The claimants initiated an application arguing that the pension consequences of job\u2011sharing have a discriminatory impact on women contrary to s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter. Their claim failed at the Federal Court. The application judge found that job\u2011sharing is part\u2011time work for which participants cannot obtain full\u2011time pension credit and that this outcome did not violate s.\u00a015(1). The application judge held that there was insufficient evidence that job\u2011sharing was disadvantageous compared to leave without pay. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the claimants\u2019 appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Full\u2011time RCMP members who job\u2011share must sacrifice pension benefits because of a temporary reduction in working hours. This arrangement has a disproportionate impact on women and perpetuates their historical disadvantage. It is a clear violation of their right to equality under s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To prove a prima facie violation of s.\u00a015(1), a claimant must demonstrate that the impugned law or state action, on its face or in its impact, creates a distinction based on enumerated or analogous grounds, and imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage. The claimants contend that the negative pension consequences of job\u2011sharing infringe s.\u00a015(1) because they have an adverse impact on women. Resolving their claim requires considering how adverse impact discrimination is applied.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Adverse impact discrimination occurs when a seemingly neutral law has a disproportionate impact on members of groups protected on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground. There is no doubt that adverse impact discrimination violates the norm of substantive equality which underpins the Court\u2019s equality jurisprudence. Substantive equality requires attention to the full context of the claimant group\u2019s situation, to the actual impact of the law on that situation, and to the persistent systemic disadvantages that have operated to limit the opportunities available to that group\u2019s members. At the heart of substantive equality is the recognition that identical or facially neutral treatment may frequently produce serious inequality. This is precisely what happens when seemingly neutral laws ignore the true characteristics of a group which act as headwinds to the enjoyment of society\u2019s benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The same two\u2011step approach to s.\u00a015(1) applies regardless of whether the discrimination alleged is direct or indirect. At the first step, in order for a law to create a distinction based on prohibited grounds through its effects, it must have a disproportionate impact on members of a protected group. A law, for example, may include seemingly neutral rules, restrictions or criteria that operate in practice as \u201cbuilt\u2011in headwinds\u201d for members of protected groups. In other cases, the problem is not \u201cheadwinds\u201d built into a law, but the absence of accommodation for members of protected groups.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Two types of evidence will be especially helpful in proving that a law has a disproportionate impact on members of a protected group. The first is evidence about the situation of the claimant group. Courts will benefit from evidence about the physical, social, cultural or other barriers which provide the full context of the claimant group\u2019s situation. The goal of such evidence is to show that membership in the claimant group is associated with certain characteristics that have disadvantaged members of the group. These links may reveal that seemingly neutral policies are designed well for some and not for others. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Courts will also benefit from evidence about the outcomes that the impugned law or policy has produced in practice. This evidence may provide concrete proof that members of protected groups are being disproportionately impacted. The evidence may include statistics, especially if the pool of people adversely affected by a criterion or standard includes both members of a protected group and members of more advantaged groups. The goal of statistical evidence is to establish a disparate pattern of exclusion or harm that is statistically significant and not simply the result of chance. The weight given to statistics will depend on, among other things, their quality and methodology. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Ideally, claims of adverse effects discrimination should be supported by evidence about the circumstances of the claimant group and the results produced by the challenged law. However, both kinds of evidence are not always required. In some cases, evidence about a group will show such a strong association with certain traits that the disproportionate impact on members of that group will be apparent and immediate. Similarly, clear and consistent statistical disparities can show a disproportionate impact on members of protected groups, even if the precise reason for that impact is unknown. In such cases, the statistical evidence is itself a compelling sign that the law has not been structured in a way that takes into account the group\u2019s circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In sum, both evidence of statistical disparity and of broader group disadvantage may demonstrate disproportionate impact, but neither is mandatory and their significance will vary depending on the case. Whether the legislature intended to create a disproportionate impact is irrelevant. Proof of discriminatory intent has never been required to establish a claim under s.\u00a015(1), and an ameliorative purpose is not sufficient to shield legislation from s.\u00a015(1) scrutiny.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 If claimants successfully demonstrate that a law has a disproportionate impact on members of a protected group, they need not also prove that the protected characteristic \u201ccaused\u201d the disproportionate impact. It is also unnecessary for them to prove that the law itself was responsible for creating the background social or physical barriers which made a particular rule, requirement or criterion disadvantageous. In addition, claimants need not show that the impugned law affects all members of a protected group in the same way. The fact that discrimination is only partial does not convert it into non\u2011discrimination, and differential treatment can occur on the basis of an enumerated ground despite the fact that not all persons belonging to the relevant group are mistreated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The second step of the s.\u00a015 test \u2014 whether the law has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating disadvantage \u2014 will usually proceed similarly in cases of direct and indirect discrimination. The goal is to examine the impact of the harm caused to the affected group, which must be viewed in light of any systemic or historical disadvantages faced by the claimant group. The presence of social prejudices or stereotyping are not necessary factors in the s.\u00a015(1) inquiry, and the perpetuation of disadvantage does not become less serious under s.\u00a015(1) simply because it was relevant to a legitimate state objective. The test for a prima facie breach of s.\u00a015(1) is concerned with the discriminatory impact of legislation on disadvantaged groups, not with whether the distinction is justified, an inquiry properly left to s.\u00a01. Similarly, there is no burden on a claimant to prove that the distinction is arbitrary to prove a prima facie breach of s.\u00a015(1). It is for the government to demonstrate that the law is not arbitrary in its justificatory submissions under s.\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Full\u2011time RCMP members who work regular hours, who are suspended, or who go on unpaid leave can obtain full pension credit for those periods of service under the pension plan, but full\u2011time members who temporarily reduce their hours under a job\u2011sharing agreement are classified as part\u2011time workers under the Regulations and are unable to acquire full\u2011time pension credit for their service. The question is whether this arrangement has a disproportionate impact on women.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In relying on the claimants\u2019 \u201cchoice\u201d to job\u2011share as grounds for dismissing their claim, the Federal Court and Court of Appeal misapprehended the Court\u2019s s.\u00a015(1) jurisprudence. The Court has consistently held that differential treatment can be discriminatory even if it is based on choices made by the affected individual or group. The Federal Court and Court of Appeal also engaged in a formalistic comparison between the remuneration offered under job\u2011sharing and leave without pay, even though s.\u00a015(1) guarantees the claimants and others in the job\u2011sharing program the right to substantive equality with respect to full\u2011time RCMP workers. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Under a proper assessment, the s.\u00a015(1) claim succeeds. The use of an RCMP member\u2019s temporary reduction in working hours as a basis to impose less favourable pension consequences plainly has a disproportionate impact on women. The relevant evidence showed that RCMP members who worked reduced hours in the job\u2011sharing program were predominantly women with young children. These statistics were bolstered by compelling evidence about the disadvantages women face as a group in balancing professional and domestic work. This evidence shows the clear association between gender and fewer or less stable working hours, and demonstrates that the RCMP\u2019s use of a temporary reduction in working hours as a basis for imposing less favourable pension consequences has an adverse impact on women. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This adverse impact perpetuates a long\u2011standing source of disadvantage to women: gender biases within pension plans, which have historically been designed for middle and upper\u2011income full\u2011time employees with long service, typically male. Because the RCMP\u2019s pension design perpetuates a long\u2011standing source of economic disadvantage for women, there is a prima facie breach of s. 15 based on the enumerated ground of sex. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section\u00a01 allows the state to justify a limit on a Charter right as demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. To start, the state must identify a pressing and substantial objective for limiting the Charter right. The Attorney General has identified no pressing and substantial policy concern, purpose or principle that explains why job\u2011sharers should not be granted full\u2011time pension credit for their service. On the contrary, this limitation is entirely detached from the purposes of both the job\u2011sharing scheme and the buy\u2011back provisions. Job\u2011sharing was clearly intended as a substitute for leave without pay for those members who could not take such leave due to personal or family circumstances. It is unclear, then, what purpose is served by treating the two forms of work reduction differently when extending pension buy\u2011back rights. The government has not offered a compelling objective for this differential treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Since the prima facie breach cannot be justified under s.\u00a01, it is a violation of s.\u00a015(1) to preclude the claimants and their colleagues from buying back their pension credits. The appropriate remedy is a declaration that there has been a breach of the s. 15(1) rights of full\u2011time RCMP members who temporarily reduced their working hours under a job\u2011sharing agreement, because of the inability of those members to buy back full pension credit for that service.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The RCMP pension plan does not violate s.\u00a015 of the Charter in its application to members who job\u2011share by denying them the right to accrue full\u2011time pension credit for periods when they job\u2011shared for childcare reasons. While the pension plan does create a distinction that, in its impact, is based on sex, its effect cannot be to hinder government efforts to address pre\u2011existing inequality. Any disadvantage the claimants face is caused not by the impugned provisions or any government action, but by the unequal division of household and family responsibilities and social circumstances such as the availability of quality childcare. Substantive equality has become almost infinitely malleable, allowing judges to invoke it as rhetorical cover for their own policy preferences in deciding a given case. This discretion does not accord with, but rather departs from, the rule of law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Understanding the pension plan and the underlying legislative scheme in its entirety is key to adjudicating the s.\u00a015 claim. It is incumbent on the Court to understand and account for how the scheme operates as a whole. The only employment statuses provided for under the pension plan are full\u2011time, part\u2011time, and leave without pay. There are no specific provisions relating to job\u2011sharing but the relevant policies define job\u2011sharing as a form of part\u2011time work. Job\u2011sharers are treated as working part\u2011time during the period in which they job\u2011share. As they work part\u2011time hours, they receive part\u2011time pension benefits for the period they job\u2011share.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The s.\u00a015 test, as it is currently framed, can address claims of adverse\u2011impact discrimination by its inquiry into whether a law creates a distinction in its impact. At step one of the s.\u00a015 test, it is not necessary to demonstrate that the impugned law or state action has the effect of contributing to an existing disadvantage. As a search for impact is a search for causation, establishing causation is critical. This is particularly so in instances where the state acts in order to address systemic discrimination given that the inquiry at step one is into whether the gap in outcomes is fully explained by pre\u2011existing disadvantage or whether state conduct has contributed to it. Section\u00a015 is concerned with state conduct that contributes to pre\u2011existing disadvantage. The state does not have a freestanding positive obligation to remedy social inequalities and it can act incrementally, by putting in place policies that narrow a gap without closing it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Ultimately, the onus is on the claimant to establish causation between the impugned law and the disadvantage. The analysis should not assume that correlation is the function of causation, where it might be the function of independent factors \u2014 correlation itself is not proof of causation. Where a law is enacted to incrementally narrow a pre\u2011existing systemic disadvantage without eradicating it, an element of disparity will necessarily remain. In such cases, it is not enough to refer to a statistical disparity and a broader group disadvantage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The focus at step one on identifying a distinction is consistent with the comparative nature of equality. The two ways in which a distinction can be framed on the enumerated ground of sex in this case are by comparison to full\u2011time members and by comparison to members who take leave without pay. The comparison to members who take leave without pay is a distinction that is not based on sex because there is no evidence that members taking leave without pay are less likely to be women than members participating in the job\u2011sharing program. However, the distinction by comparison to full\u2011time members is a distinction based on sex because members of the job\u2011sharing program are disproportionately women, whereas uninterrupted full\u2011time employment is a male pattern of employment. Therefore, the pension plan creates a distinction that, in its impact, is based on sex.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Step two of the s.\u00a015 analysis asks whether that distinction is discriminatory in that it fails to respond to the actual capacities and needs of the group and instead imposes burdens or denies a benefit in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing, perpetuating, or exacerbating the disadvantage of women. The analysis at this step must consider whether the unequal impact corresponds with a group\u2019s actual circumstances or needs or whether it is in any other sense substantively discriminatory.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To establish substantive discrimination, an element of arbitrariness or unfairness has always been required in the s.\u00a015 analysis. Factors relating to arbitrariness or unfairness must not be confined to the s.\u00a01 analysis. The element of arbitrariness or unfairness has been most often expressed as a failure to respond to individuals\u2019 capacities, needs and circumstances but it does not need to take the form of promoting negative attitudes. It has never been confused with a discriminatory purpose, which is not required to establish substantive discrimination. Substantive discrimination cannot be reduced to historical disadvantage. In some circumstances, laws can maintain significant disadvantage while treating individuals equally and without discrimination. Substantive equality has become so vague that it is impossible for claimants or legislatures to anticipate its demands in advance. Legislatures are instead effectively expected to hit a moving target.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is not arbitrary or unfair and therefore not discriminatory for an employer to prorate compensation, including benefits, according to hours worked when this responds to employees\u2019 actual capacities and circumstances. Employers must be able to compensate employees based on hours worked and offering pension benefits that are prorated to hours worked is not substantive discrimination. In accordance with the contextual analysis of the broader scheme, the provisions on leave without pay remain an important consideration at step two even though the distinction based on members who job\u2011share compared to those who take leave without pay is not based on sex. Offering pension benefits that are prorated to hours worked does not become substantive discrimination where members who take leave without pay have the right to buy back hours of pension benefits, because the focus of the contextual analysis must be on the actual impact of the law in its full context and must consider each benefit program in full.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, the record does not suggest that the lines drawn are inappropriate, having regard to all the circumstances. The pension plan does not represent a source of ongoing systemic disadvantage as it does not contribute to women\u2019s systemic disadvantage; nor does it reinforce, perpetuate, or exacerbate the pre\u2011existing disadvantage of women in the workplace which arises in part from unequal distribution of parental responsibilities. The impugned provisions of the pension plan represent an example of a government acting incrementally to address inequities that exist in society, using provisions that do not have a discriminatory impact. The legislation is ameliorative in both intent and effect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Given that s.\u00a015(1) of the Charter is not infringed, there is no need to consider s.\u00a01\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): The claim fails at step one of the s.\u00a015(1) analysis because the impugned provisions of the pension plan do not create a distinction on the basis of the enumerated ground of sex. The effect of the impugned provisions of the pension plan is to create a distinction not on the basis of being a woman, that is, sex simpliciter, but on the basis of caregiving responsibilities alone or as a result of a combination of sex with caregiver status.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The impugned provisions of the pension plan that discriminate against those with caregiving responsibilities do not necessarily discriminate against women. There is disagreement that, in effect, discrimination on the basis of childcare is tantamount to discrimination on the basis of sex due to their historical association with one another because caregiving status can be separated from sex; rather, same\u2011sex couples with children, as well as those individuals with elderly caregiving responsibilities will all be disproportionately affected.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Disproportionate impact alone is not sufficient to meet step one of the s.\u00a015(1) analysis. Ultimately, in cases of adverse effect discrimination, the question under step one is whether the law, while facially neutral, creates an adverse distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground. Step one includes a requirement of causation, nexus or tether between the impugned provisions and their effect. It cannot be satisfied in the absence of such a nexus between the impugned law and the disproportionate impact. In cases of adverse effect discrimination, step one is a step at which claimants have more work to do, unlike at s.\u00a01, where the burden is placed on the government. If disproportionate impact alone were sufficient, this would invite statistics\u2011based litigation which would not be desirable, in part because statistics are constantly shifting.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, the claim is on behalf of women with children, and not simply women. It is critical that the claimants had caregiving responsibilities that made them decide to job\u2011share. The statistical disparity in results showing that women are disproportionately affected \u2014 given that the majority of job\u2011sharers are women with children \u2014 is insufficient to say that step one has been met. There is no reason why job\u2011sharing is a singularly sex\u2011based issue: rather, it is a caregiving status issue because job\u2011sharing is a solution for all members with caregiving responsibilities, not just a solution for those of a certain sex who have children.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In light of the conclusion that any distinction depends not on sex but on caregiving responsibility and that the Court has not recognized caregiving, parental, or family status as an analogous ground, in this case, the claimants\u2019 contention must fail at step one of the s.\u00a015(1) analysis. To be sure, the impugned provisions may very well not be rational \u2014 there may indeed be no logical reason to deprive job\u2011sharers of full pension benefits that are guaranteed to full\u2011time members and members on leave without pay. But it is not the Court\u2019s role to constitutionalize normative judgments to this effect; that is the role of the electorate, and in turn, the legislature. It therefore falls to the legislature, not the courts, to remedy any under\u2011inclusiveness in this legislation, which purportedly was meant to assist with caregiving responsibilities in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As no distinction can be made out on the basis of sex, there is no need to proceed to the second step of the analysis.By Abella\u00a0J.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: Quebec (Attorney General) v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police pension plan  discriminates against women, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Ms. Fraser, Ms. Pilgrim, and Ms. Fox were Royal Canadian Mounted Police  (RCMP) officers. They all had children in the 1990s. When they went back to  work, they found it hard to juggle work with their childcare responsibilities.  The RCMP wouldn\u2019t let them work part-time. Ms. Fox retired and Ms. Fraser and  Ms. Pilgrim took more unpaid leave. In  December 1997, the RCMP began to allow job-sharing as an option instead of unpaid  leave. This way, two or three people could split the duties of one full-time  position. It was for the benefit of both the employees and the RCMP. The three  women joined the program and came back to work. Most people who joined the  program were women with children. Most did so to balance work with their  childcare responsibilities. Members of  the RCMP pay into a pension plan, and get a pension when they retire. Their  pension gets bigger the longer they work and the more money they earn.  Full-time members could \u201cbuy back\u201d pension credit if they were suspended from  duty or took unpaid leave. This would make their pension bigger. But if they  job-shared, they weren\u2019t allowed to buy back any pension credit. Job-sharers  said the situation was unfair. An expert said the RCMP could change the pension  plan to let the job-sharers buy back pension credit. An RCMP committee agreed  that job-sharers should be allowed to buy it back. The RCMP still didn\u2019t let  them. Ms.  Fraser, Ms. Fox, and Ms. Pilgrim said they should be allowed to buy back the  pension credit. They said the pension plan treated job-sharers (who were mostly  women with children) worse than other members. They said this breached section  15(1) the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em>, part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Section 15(1) says the law should  treat everyone equally, without discrimination on certain characteristics.  The judge  who heard the <em>Charter </em>application  said there was no breach of section 15(1). She said if they were disadvantaged,  it wasn\u2019t because they were women or the fact that they had kids. It was  because of their own choices. The Court of Appeal agreed. The majority  of judges at the Supreme Court disagreed with the lower courts. They said the  pension plan discriminated against the job-sharers because they were women. The <em>Charter </em>protects certain groups that  share specific characteristics (for example, their race or religion). The law  isn\u2019t allowed to discriminate against people based on these \u201cprotected\u201d  characteristics. To decide if equality rights have been breached under section  15(1), courts first look at whether a protected group is singled out by the law  somehow. Laws that seem neutral may still discriminate against members of  protected groups by affecting them differently. Members of the group don\u2019t have  to show that the protected characteristic somehow <em>caused</em> the group to be more affected. It also doesn\u2019t matter if all  members of the group are affected in the same way. Next, courts look at whether  the law maintains any kind of disadvantage to the group, or makes it worse. The  majority noted that many attitudes and policies had disadvantaged women in the past.  While many things have changed, rules like those in the pension plan can build  on those past harms.  In this  case, the majority said the pension plan breached the job-sharers\u2019 right to  equality. This was because it disadvantaged women more than men. It didn\u2019t  matter that the plan didn\u2019t set out to hurt women in particular. What mattered  was its effect. The job-sharers were mostly women who were job-sharing because  they needed to care for their children. This maintained the disadvantage caused  by the long-standing expectation that women should be responsible for  childcare. The pension plan didn\u2019t allow them to buy back credit like other  people could. The women were in this situation because they had to job-share to  take care of their kids. The majority said the job-sharers should be  able to buy back all their pension credit.  The  Court previously looked at ways women were disadvantaged at work in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/37002-eng.aspx\">Centrale des  syndicats du Qu\u00e9bec v. Quebec (Attorney General)</a></em> and <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/37347-eng.aspx\">Quebec (Attorney  General) v.

As a senior executive, M was part of Ocean\u2019s long term incentive plan (\u201cLTIP\u201d), a contractual arrangement designed to reward employees for their previous contributions and to provide an incentive to continue contributing to the company\u2019s success.\u00a0Under the LTIP, a \u201cRealization Event\u201d, such as the sale of the company, would trigger payments to employees who qualified under the plan. In 2007, Ocean hired a new Chief Operating Officer, who began a campaign to marginalize M in the company, limiting M\u2019s responsibilities and lying to M about his status and prospects with Ocean. Despite his problems with senior management, the LTIP was a key reason for which M wanted to stay with Ocean, anticipating Ocean would soon be sold. However, M eventually left Ocean in June 2011, taking a position with a new employer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 About 13 months after M\u2019s departure, Ocean was sold for\u00a0$540 million. The sale constituted a Realization Event for the purposes of the LTIP.\u00a0Since M was not actively employed on that date, Ocean took the position that M did not satisfy the terms of the plan, and he did not receive a payment. M filed an application against Ocean alleging that he was constructively dismissed, and that the constructive dismissal was carried out in bad faith and in breach of Ocean\u2019s duty of good faith. The trial judge concluded that Ocean constructively dismissed M, and that M was owed a reasonable notice period of 15 months. The trial judge also held that M would have been a full\u2011time employee when the Realization Event occurred had he not been constructively dismissed, and that, because the terms of the LTIP did not unambiguously limit or remove his common law right to damages, M was entitled to damages equivalent to what he would have received under the LTIP.\u00a0The Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the decision that M had been constructively dismissed and that the appropriate reasonable notice period was 15 months. However, a majority of the court found that M was not entitled to damages on account of the lost LTIP payment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside and the trial judgment restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At common law, an employer has the right to prompt an employee to choose to leave their job in circumstances that amount to a dismissal subject to the duty to provide reasonable notice. The obligation to provide reasonable notice does not, in theory, turn on the presence or absence of good faith. The contractual breach that arises from the employer\u2019s choice is simply the failure to provide reasonable notice, which leads to an award of damages in lieu thereof. A breach of the duty to exercise good faith in the manner of dismissal is a distinct contractual breach and is independent of any failure to provide reasonable notice. It can serve as a basis to answer for foreseeable injury that results from callous or insensitive conduct in the manner of dismissal.\u00a0Damages arising out of the same dismissal are calculated differently depending on the breach invoked. The nature of the contractual breach of good faith is of a different order than that associated with the failure to provide reasonable notice.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Courts should ask two questions when determining whether the appropriate quantum of damages for breach of an implied term to provide reasonable notice includes bonus payments. First, courts should consider the employee\u2019s common law rights and examine whether, but for the termination, the employee would have been entitled to the bonus or benefit as part of their compensation during the reasonable notice period. Second, if so, courts should determine whether the terms of the employment contract or bonus plan unambiguously take away or limit that common law right. This approach accords with basic principles of damages for constructive dismissal, anchoring the analysis around reasonable notice. When an employee sues for damages for constructive dismissal, they are claiming for damages as compensation for the income, benefits, and bonuses they would have received had the employer not breached the implied term to provide reasonable notice. This approach respects the well\u2011established understanding that the contract effectively remains alive for the purposes of assessing the employee\u2019s damages, in order to determine what compensation the employee would have been entitled to but for the dismissal. Damages for wrongful dismissal are designed to compensate the employee for the breach by the employer of the implied term in the employment contract to provide reasonable notice of termination. There is no such implied term of the contract to provide payment in lieu. The payment in lieu is not damages for a breach of the contract, but rather one component of the compensation provided for in the contract. If an employer fails to give proper notice or pay in lieu, the breach is in the failure to pay, not in the termination. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, in determining whether M\u2019s damages include an amount to compensate him for his lost LTIP payment, the focus should be on what damages were appropriately due for Ocean\u2019s failure to provide M with reasonable notice and not on whether the terms of the LTIP were plain and unambiguous. The issue is not whether M is entitled to the LTIP in itself, but rather what damages he is entitled to and, specifically, whether he was entitled to compensation for bonuses he would have earned had Ocean not breached the employment contract. It is uncontested that the Realization Event occurred during the notice period and therefore, but for M\u2019s dismissal, he would have received an LTIP payment during that period. In such circumstances, there is no need to ask whether the LTIP payment was integral to his compensation. On the first question, M is prima facie entitled to receive damages as compensation for the lost bonus. On the second question, the LTIP does not unambiguously limit or remove M\u2019s common law right. Had M been given proper notice, he would have been full\u2011time or actively employed throughout the reasonable notice period. For the purpose of calculating wrongful dismissal damages, the employment contract is not treated as terminated until after the reasonable notice period expires. M should therefore be awarded the amount of the LTIP as part of his common law damages for breach of the implied term to provide reasonable notice.

        "summary": "<strong>An employee forced by their employer to quit should get a bonus they  would have received during the notice period, unless their contract says  otherwise, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Mr.  Matthews was a chemist. He worked for Ocean Nutrition. He helped make the  company successful in making omega-3 products. His job was important to him.  In  2007, Ocean Nutrition hired a new Chief Operating Officer. The Chief Operating Officer  and Mr. Matthews did not get along. He took responsibilities and team members  away from Mr. Matthews. This left Mr. Matthews with much less to do. The Chief Operating  Officer also lied to him. This upset Mr. Matthews. In 2010, Ocean Nutrition put  Mr. Matthews under review. This meant he might lose his job. The Chief  Operating Officer told the Board of Directors that there was no place for Mr.  Matthews at the company. This upset Mr. Matthews even more.  Mr.  Matthews suspected that Ocean Nutrition was going to be sold. As part of his  contract, Mr. Matthews would get a large bonus payment if this happened. This  was part of the reason he stayed with the company for so long, even after the  problems started. But eventually he found himself in an impossible situation,  so he quit. Just  over a year later, Ocean Nutrition was sold for over half a billion dollars.  Because Mr. Matthews didn\u2019t work there anymore, the company said it didn\u2019t owe  him the bonus payment. Mr. Matthews said he would have still been working there  if Ocean Nutrition didn\u2019t \u201cconstructively dismiss\u201d him. \u201cConstructive  dismissal\u201d is when an employer forces an employee out by making things so bad  that they quit, instead of firing them. Mr. Matthews said the company owed him the  bonus payment. The trial judge said that Mr. Matthews was  constructively dismissed. He said Mr. Matthews should get 15 months of \u201creasonable  notice.\u201d The law says someone who is dismissed (\u201cconstructively\u201d or not) should  get \u201creasonable notice\u201d of the dismissal. \u201cNotice\u201d is a specific amount of time  the employee gets between the date when the employer tells them the contract  will end and when it ends. Sometimes the employee will keep working during the  notice period. But sometimes the employer just pays them what they would have  been paid if they had worked the time. Either way, they still count as an  \u201cemployee\u201d during the notice period. The trial judge said Mr. Matthews would  have received the bonus payment if he was still working at Ocean Nutrition. He  said Mr. Matthews should still get it since Ocean Nutrition was sold during the  reasonable notice period. The bonus was about $1 million.  The  majority at the Court of Appeal agreed that Mr. Matthews was constructively  dismissed. It agreed that the notice period should be 15 months. But it said he  didn\u2019t have a right to the bonus after he left the company. By  the time the case got to the Supreme Court of Canada, everyone agreed that Mr.  Matthews was forced to quit. Everyone agreed that he should have received 15  months\u2019 notice. They disagreed on whether he should get the bonus payment as  part of his reasonable notice. They also disagreed on whether Ocean Nutrition  lied to him, and whether this meant he should get the bonus. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed that Mr. Matthews should get  the bonus payment. They said that the reasonable notice period should be 15  months, like the trial judge said. They said Mr. Matthews should get  compensation because he didn\u2019t get notice. The Court said the compensation should  include the bonus payment. This was because the company was sold, and the bonus  payment triggered, during the notice period. There was nothing in Mr. Matthews\u2019  contract that said he shouldn\u2019t get it in this situation.  The Court also noted that Ocean Nutrition wasn\u2019t honest  with Mr. Matthews about his future with the company. This was separate from  constructively dismissing him without notice. Mr. Matthews didn\u2019t get extra  compensation for this, though. This was because he only asked for the bonus,  which he already got as part of reasonable notice.

(\u201cChandos\u201d), a general construction contractor, entered into a construction subcontract with Capital Steel Inc. (\u201cCapital Steel\u201d). Clause VII Q(d) of the subcontract provides that Capital Steel will pay Chandos 10 percent of the subcontract price as a fee for the inconvenience or for monitoring the work in the event of Capital Steel\u2019s bankruptcy. When Capital Steel filed an assignment in bankruptcy prior to completing its subcontract with Chandos, Chandos argued it was entitled to set off the costs it had incurred to complete Capital Steel\u2019s work and to set off 10 percent of the subcontract price, as provided for by clause VII Q(d). Capital Steel\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy applied for advice and directions as to whether clause VII Q(d) was valid. The application judge found the provision to be a valid liquidated damages clause, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Brown, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Clause VII Q(d) is invalid by virtue of the anti\u2011deprivation rule. This rule renders void any provision in an agreement which provides that upon an insolvency (or bankruptcy), value is removed from the reach of the insolvent person\u2019s creditors which would otherwise have been available to them, and places that value in the hands of others.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The anti\u2011deprivation rule has existed in Canadian common law since before federal bankruptcy legislation existed, and has not been eliminated by any decision of the Court or by Parliament. Parliament\u2019s actions are better understood as gradually codifying limited parts of the common law rather than seeking to oust all related common law. The anti\u2011deprivation rule prevents contractual provisions from frustrating the scheme of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (\u201cBIA\u201d) as it renders void contractual provisions that would prevent property from passing to the trustee. This helps maximize the global recovery for all creditors in accordance with the priorities set out in the BIA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The test under the anti\u2011deprivation rule has two parts: the relevant clause is triggered by an event of insolvency or bankruptcy, and the effect of the clause is to remove value from the insolvent\u2019s estate. This is an effects\u2011based test. What should be considered is whether the effect of the contractual provision was to deprive the estate of assets upon bankruptcy, not whether the intention of the contracting parties was commercially reasonable. Adopting a purpose\u2011based test would create new and greater difficulties. It would require courts to determine the intention of contracting parties long after the fact, detract from the efficient administration of corporate bankruptcies, and encourage parties who can plausibly pretend to have bona fide intentions to create a preference over other creditors by inserting such clauses. It would also be inconsistent with the general principles of contractual freedom \u2014 parties do not negotiate with a view to protecting the interests of their creditors in the event of their bankruptcy. Finally, under a purpose\u2011based rule, unsecured creditors would receive even less than they do now. An effects\u2011based approach provides parties with the confidence that contractual agreements, absent a provision providing for the withdrawal of assets upon bankruptcy or insolvency, will generally be upheld.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Clause VII Q(d) violates the anti\u2011deprivation rule and is thus void. It provides that, in the event Capital Steel commits any act of bankruptcy, Capital Steel shall forfeit 10 percent of the subcontract price \u2014 this is a direct and blatant violation of the rule. It cannot be rescued by the law of set\u2011off, as set\u2011off only applies to enforceable debts or claims. It applies to debts owed by the bankrupt that were not triggered by the bankruptcy, since the anti\u2011deprivation rule only makes deprivations triggered by insolvency unenforceable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): There is agreement with the majority that the anti\u2011deprivation rule has a longstanding and strong jurisprudential footing in Canadian law and that it has not been eliminated by the Court or through legislation. However, this rule should not apply to transactions or contractual provisions which serve a bona fide commercial purpose. As clause VII Q(d) furthers a bona fide commercial purpose, it is enforceable and does not offend the anti\u2011deprivation rule. Accordingly, the application judge\u2019s order should be restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The anti\u2011deprivation rule should not apply to transactions or contractual provisions which serve a bona fide commercial purpose for three reasons. First, courts applying the anti\u2011deprivation rule in Canada have not been content to rest their reasons for decision merely on a finding that the effect of a transaction or contractual provision was to deprive a bankrupt\u2019s estate of value \u2014 the golden thread weaving its way through the jurisprudence is the presence or absence of a bona fide commercial purpose behind the deprivation. In the minority of cases where bona fide commercial purpose has not been discussed, its absence has been readily inferable from the circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, there is a principled legal basis for retaining a bona fide commercial purpose test. The anti\u2011deprivation rule is based on the common law public policy against agreements entered into for the unlawful purpose of defrauding or otherwise injuring third parties. It thus requires an objective assessment of the parties\u2019 intentions. In contrast, the pari passu rule has an effects\u2011based test because it is based on an implied prohibition in the BIA that operates regardless of the parties\u2019 intentions. The pari passu provision in the BIA establishes a very clear bright line rule that all claims proved in a bankruptcy shall be paid rateably. This clear and straightforward statutory language readily supports a conclusion that Parliament intended to prohibit a debtor from contracting with creditors for a different distribution of the debtor\u2019s assets in bankruptcy than that provided in s.\u00a0141 of the BIA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The anti\u2011deprivation rule does not derive from a strained interpretation of s. 71 of the BIA. But even if the anti\u2011deprivation rule was an implied prohibition in the BIA, it is a well\u2011established principle that the BIA does not grant a trustee any greater interest in a bankrupt\u2019s property than that enjoyed by the bankrupt prior to the bankruptcy. Holding that s.\u00a071 of the BIA converts the bankrupt\u2019s qualified interest in an asset into an absolute or unqualified interest in the hands of the trustee breaks with this principle. The statutory context includes numerous provisions indicating that arm\u2019s\u2011length bona fide commercial transactions are valid as against the trustee of a bankrupt\u2019s estate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Third, as a matter of public policy, the considerations cited in support of an effects\u2011based test are not sufficient to override the otherwise strong countervailing public interest in the enforcement of contracts. Despite being a judicially\u2011derived public policy, it is still prudent for courts to take into account the policies embodied in legislation as a reflection of society\u2019s public policy concerns. Therefore, anti\u2011deprivation rule\u2019s common law character does not preclude a court from taking into account Parliament\u2019s objective of maximizing global recovery for all creditors, when considering how to formulate the anti\u2011deprivation rule. However, Parliament\u2019s objectives must be weighed against the other policy interests protected by the common law when considering how to best formulate the rule. The common law places great weight on the freedom of contracting parties to pursue their individual self\u2011interest, and the public policy considerations which have been cited in support of an effects\u2011based test are not sufficient to override the otherwise strong countervailing public interest in the enforcement of contracts.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A purely effects\u2011based test gives too little weight to freedom of contract, party autonomy, and the elbow\u2011room which the common law traditionally accords for the aggressive pursuit of self\u2011interest. It may also create significant uncertainty by introducing a vague standard which unduly restricts the scope of the anti\u2011deprivation rule. By contrast, a subjective purpose test would place too little weight on Parliament\u2019s objective of maximizing global recovery for all creditors. The middle path \u2014 the objective bona fide commercial purpose test \u2014 is the best way to balance freedom of contract, the interests of third party creditors, and commercial certainty. Certainty in commercial affairs is typically better served by giving effect to contracts which were freely entered into, particularly when they serve commercial purposes and are not directed at an unlawful objective.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In addition, applying a bona fide commercial purpose test would not require a significantly more onerous analysis into the parties\u2019 intentions than that entailed by an effects\u2011based test. Moreover, while debtors are not properly incentivized to protect their creditors\u2019 interests when dealing with third parties, creditors can access a full range of options to protect their rights: the oppression remedy, the directors\u2019 duty of care, the various anti\u2011avoidance provisions in the BIA and in provincial statutes, as well as the ability of creditors to bargain for contractual protections. Parliament has also occupied much of the ground formerly covered by the common law such that there is a reduced need for a general anti\u2011deprivation rule. Indeed, the many statutory protections already in place to safeguard the interests of creditors undermine any perceived policy need to expand the reach of the anti\u2011deprivation rule. These provisions reflect Parliament\u2019s policy preference for upholding the validity of bona fide commercial arrangements, even when they have the effect of reducing the pool of assets available to a debtor\u2019s creditors in bankruptcy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, clause VII Q(d) furthers a bona fide commercial purpose. A general contractor\u2019s role is essentially to oversee and coordinate the construction of a project by various subcontractors according to a set schedule. It is evident that a subcontractor\u2019s bankruptcy during the construction of the project would require the general contractor to redirect significant administrative and management resources. The general contractor would also incur administrative and management costs from mitigating the fallout up and down the construction pyramid. Costly delays would ensue as well.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0company couldn\u2019t make a bankrupt company it had a  contract with pay a penalty just because of the bankruptcy, the Supreme Court  has ruled.</strong>\r\n   When a company can\u2019t pay all of its bills, it can file  for bankruptcy. When this happens, everything it owns is given to a \u201ctrustee.\u201d  The trustee decides how to divide everything among the people the company owes  money to. The rules for doing this are set out in the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>, a federal law. Chandos Construction signed a contract with Capital  Steel. It was worth almost $1.4 million. Part of the contract said Chandos  would get money if Capital Steel went bankrupt. The contract would be frozen  and Capital Steel would have to pay Chandos for anything it lost, plus extra  for overhead and profit. The contract also said Capital Steel would have to pay  Chandos 10% of the contract price (that is, about $140,000) for the  inconvenience. Capital Steel went bankrupt. At the time, Chandos owed  Capital Steel about $150,000 on the contract. But it said Capital Steel actually <em>owed it</em> over $10,000. This was  because of the costs and the 10% inconvenience fee that the contract said  Capital Steel had to pay if it went bankrupt. This added up to more than was  left on the contract. The trustee asked the court if  this was allowed. The application judge said yes. The majority of the Court of  Appeal said no. This was because it broke the \u201canti-deprivation rule.\u201d The anti-deprivation rule says any part of a  contract that takes away (that is, <em>deprives</em> the trustee of) some of what the bankrupt company owns isn\u2019t allowed.  The majority of judges at the Supreme Court agreed with  the Court of Appeal. They said there are two reasons why part of a contract  might be found invalid during a bankruptcy. The first is where the contract  gives some people who are owed money more than their fair share, so they get  bigger slices of the pie than they deserve. This is called the \u201c<em>pari passu</em> rule.\u201d The second is when part  of the pie is taken away so the whole pie is shrunk before it can even be  sliced. This is the situation covered by the anti-deprivation rule. The  majority said that the anti-deprivation rule had been part of Canadian law  since the 1870s. It was part of \u201ccommon law,\u201d not legislation. Common law is  law made by courts when there is no legislation (laws passed by Parliament or  legislatures). It can also help interpret and apply legislation. Common law  can\u2019t go against legislation. It is just there to fill in the gaps, keeping  with the spirit of what Parliament or the legislature wanted. Legislation can  change common law, though. But in this case, the majority said the common law  was never changed, even by the <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em>.  The  majority said the Act\u2019s purpose was to make sure the trustee had as much as  possible to give to people who were owed money. The anti-deprivation rule helps  make sure this happens. It stops people from writing contracts to get around  the rules in the Act.  When deciding if something broke the anti-deprivation rule, the majority  said that courts should look at its effect. They shouldn\u2019t look at what the  parties wanted, or said they wanted, at the time they came to an agreement. First,  it would be hard to know or prove what people wanted if a contract was signed a  long time ago. Second, a contract could still have the effect of hurting others  who were owed money, even if no one meant for that to happen. This would still  be wrong.  However, the  majority said the anti-deprivation rule might not be broken where someone  agreed to give up physical property (not money). Agreeing to get insurance, or  a putting up money (security) as a guarantee for the contract, might also be  allowed. The majority said that Chandos wasn\u2019t allowed to reduce what it owed to  Capital Steel by deducting the inconvenience fee amounts. Capital Steel didn\u2019t  actually owe Chandos any money, so there was nothing to deduct.  Bankruptcy is a  complicated process, and often involves many companies, people, and issues. The  Court previously dealt with bankruptcy\u2019s effect on companies\u2019 environmental  obligations in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37627-eng.aspx\">Orphan Well  Association v. Grant Thornton Ltd.</a></em> and <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37985-eng.aspx\">Resolute FP  Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Attorney General)</a></em>.

After M and G separated in 1994, A lived with M, and\u00a0G agreed to pay child support based upon his stated annual income. This was formalized in a consent order made in 2001. G had, however, understated his income from the time of the consent order \u2014 with the exception of 2004 \u2014 until his child support obligation was terminated by court order in 2012. In January 2015, M applied under s.\u00a0152 of British Columbia\u2019s Family Law Act (\u201cFLA\u201d) to retroactively vary child support for the period between April 2001 and April 2012, to reflect G\u2019s actual income during that period of time. The hearing judge allowed M\u2019s application and G was ordered to pay $23,000 in retroactive child support. The Supreme Court of British Columbia allowed G\u2019s appeal and set aside the hearing judge\u2019s order. In its view, the Court\u2019s conclusion in D.B.S. v. S.R.G., 2006 SCC 37, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231, that an application for child support under the federal Divorce Act had to be made while the child remained a \u201cchild of the marriage\u201d was equally applicable where child support was sought under the FLA. The Court of Appeal dismissed M\u2019s appeal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and the order of the hearing judge reinstated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe, Brown and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Section 152 of the FLA authorizes a court to retroactively vary a child support order, irrespective of whether the beneficiary is a \u201cchild\u201d at the time of the application, and irrespective of whether the order has expired. The order of the hearing judge should therefore not have been disturbed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When deciding an application for retroactive child support, a court must analyze the statutory scheme in which the application was brought, and the different policy choices made by the federal and provincial governments must be respected. In D.B.S., the Court examined the enforcement mechanism set out in s.\u00a015.1 of the Divorce Act, which addresses original child support orders, and concluded that a court has no authority to grant a retroactive award of child support under that provision if the child beneficiary is no longer a \u201cchild of the marriage\u201d at the time of the application. The Court did not consider or decide the issue of retroactive variation orders under s.\u00a017 of the Divorce Act. Accordingly, D.B.S. does not stand for the proposition that courts can retroactively vary child support only while the child beneficiary is a \u201cchild of the marriage\u201d; furthermore, the Court in D.B.S. did not state a sweeping principle that transcends the Divorce Act to embrace all other statutory schemes regardless of legislative intent. The Court insisted that provinces remain free to espouse a different paradigm than that adopted by Parliament in the Divorce Act. Where they do so via legislation establishing an application\u2011based regime such as the FLA, and where an application for retroactive child support is brought thereunder, it is that legislation which governs a court\u2019s authority to grant retroactive child support. Courts should not be hasty to recognize jurisdictional impediments that bar applications for retroactive child support. Jurisdictional constraints are inimical to the principles and policy objectives articulated in D.B.S., and may be imposed only where the legislature has clearly intended that they be imposed. Such constraints must therefore be apparent in the statutory scheme, bearing in mind that preventing courts from even considering an award for retroactive child support would prevent enforcement of an unfulfilled legal obligation even in the most appropriate of circumstances. Unless compelled by the applicable legislative scheme, courts should avoid creating an incentive whatsoever for payor parents to avoid meeting their child support obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For the purposes of determining who is eligible to receive child support, the FLA defines the term \u201cchild\u201d in different ways; but in essence, says that children who are dependent on their parents are eligible to receive child support. Section 152 authorizes a court to change, suspend or terminate an order respecting child support, and to do so prospectively or retroactively. Far from erecting barriers, s.\u00a0152 of the FLA creates an avenue for courts to retroactively change any child support order, irrespective of the beneficiary\u2019s dependent status and irrespective of whether the order is extant at the time of the application. Section 152(1) contains no reference to the defined term \u201cchild\u201d that might serve to qualify the authority of a court to vary child support, nor does it contain any conditions which relate to the dependent status of the beneficiary of a child support order. The text of s.\u00a0152 and the scheme of the FLA indicate that the Legislature authorized a court to vary any child support order, irrespective of whether the beneficiary remains a dependent child, and irrespective of whether the order continues to require payment. Straining to read jurisdictional impediments into s.\u00a0152 that would prevent a court from ordering retroactive child support in circumstances in which such an order is warranted would defeat that legislative purpose and create a perverse incentive for payor parents to avoid their obligations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Child support awards are highly discretionary, and the hearing judge\u2019s findings and inferences of fact may not be disturbed absent an error on an extricable question of law, a palpable and overriding error, or a fundamental mischaracterization or misapprehension of the evidence. In the present case, the hearing judge was correct to conclude that s. 152 gave him authority to order retroactive child support, he identified and applied the appropriate factors from D.B.S., and his conclusion that A experienced hardship in her childhood as a result of G\u2019s neglect of his child support obligations was amply supported on the record. He also found that G would not experience hardship from a retroactive award. G\u2019s failure to accurately disclose his income at the time of the 2001 order, and to disclose material changes in his income for the 11 years that followed, constituted blameworthy conduct, which justifies an order for retroactive child support. Further, there is no basis for interfering with the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that M\u2019s delay in seeking retroactive support was reasonable. Finally, it was clearly appropriate for the hearing judge to award support dating back to the 2001 consent order, as the date of effective notice is not relevant when a payor parent has engaged in blameworthy conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Martin\u00a0J.: There is agreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion and with its analysis of s.\u00a0152 of the FLA, and there is agreement that D.B.S. did not decide the question at issue in this case. However, there are other compelling considerations and numerous additional reasons why s.\u00a0152 should be read to permit applications such as the one in this case. The jurisprudence on child support calls for a fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects. Such objects include a consideration of the best interests of the child. The required contextual and purposive reading of s.\u00a0152 thus requires the Court to look to its wider legislative purposes, societal implications, and actual impacts. Seen this way, a jurisdictional bar preventing these cases from being heard not only rests on unsound legal foundations, it is inconsistent with the bedrock principles underlying modern child support and contributes to systemic inequalities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The purpose and promise of child support is to protect the financial entitlements due to children by their parents. Canadian jurisprudence has not consistently fulfilled that promise when it comes to historical child support, when retroactive child support is sought after the child no longer qualifies as a beneficiary under the applicable legislation. This is evidenced by muddled jurisprudence: confused, contradictory, and divided judgments across different provinces about whether applications for historical awards can be considered, and a multiplying number of exceptions to and other creative ways around principles set out in D.B.S.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Child support obligations arise upon a child\u2019s birth or the separation of their parents. Retroactive awards are a recognized way to enforce such pre\u2011existing, free\u2011standing obligations and to recover monies owed but yet unpaid. Such a debt is a continuing obligation which does not evaporate or fade into history upon a child\u2019s 18th or 19th birthday or their graduation from university. Under s.\u00a0152 of the FLA, a debt exists if the child qualified as a beneficiary at the time the support was due, irrespective of their status at the moment of the application. This reading not only accords with the text, legislative scheme, and purpose of s.\u00a0152, it promotes the best interests of children, enhances access to justice, reinforces that child support is the right of the child and the responsibility of the parents, encourages the payment of child support, acknowledges that there are many reasons why a parent may delay making an application, and recognizes how the underpayment of child support leads to hardship and contributes to the feminization of poverty.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In D.B.S., when interpreting s.\u00a015.1 of the Divorce Act, the majority of the Court expressed the view that courts have no jurisdiction to hear original applications for child support brought after a child ceases to be a \u201cchild of the marriage\u201d. These comments have led some courts to believe that the same jurisdictional bar also prevents applications to vary historical child support under s.\u00a017 of the Divorce Act, and under similarly\u2011worded provincial legislation, like s.\u00a0152 of the FLA. However, D.B.S. did not decide the issue for variation orders under s.\u00a017. There is therefore no binding authority requiring s.\u00a0152 to be read as imposing a jurisdictional bar on the hearing of variation application for historical child support.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 152 must be interpreted and applied in accordance with first principles. In addition to the reasons provided by the majority, there are other strong and equally compelling reasons that support allowing the consideration of historical child support claims. An analysis that takes into account the policies and values of contemporary Canadian society, focuses on the best interests of the child, and interprets s.\u00a0152 in a fair, large, and liberal manner to best ensure the attainment of the objects of child support clearly supports permitting historical child support claims to be heard by a court to determine if monies are owing and what amounts may be fairly recovered. A procedural bar to historical child support claims prevents access to justice, runs counter to the best interest of many children, gives rise to an under\u2011inclusive outcome, and reinforces patterns of socio\u2011economic inequality. It operates to prevent applications advanced on behalf of Canada\u2019s children from ever being heard on their merits. The courtroom doors should not be closed because certain categories of debts owed to children are classified as coming \u201ctoo late\u201d. Unmet child support obligations, whether they are in the form of arrears or have not yet been judicially recognized, are a valid debt that must be paid, similar to any other financial obligation, regardless of whether the quantum is significant. Further, the obligation to support one\u2019s child exists irrespective of whether an action has been started by the recipient parent against the payor parent to enforce it, because child support is a continued obligation owed independently of any statute or court order. Any interpretation of s.\u00a0152 should support the modern understanding of child support and not encourage behaviour that undercuts its values, efficiency, or effectiveness.\u00a0Thus, the court should not create a perverse incentive by granting payor parents immunity after the child ceases to be a child of the marriage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Preventing historical claims for child support under s.\u00a0152 of the FLA also ignores how family law calls for an approach that takes into account the broader social framework in which family dynamics operate. Gender roles, divorce, separation, and lone parenthood contribute to child poverty and place a disproportionate burden on women. A bar against applications for historical child support means children have gone without their due, and the law provides no remedy for the hardship this has created for the children and their caregivers, most of whom are still women. Today, women still bear the bulk of child care and custody obligations and earn less money than men, so women\u2019s poverty remains inextricably linked to child poverty. Women who obtain custody are often badly placed to evaluate their co\u2011parent\u2019s financial situation and to take action against it. Measures that place further barriers on their ability to claim and enforce their rights, like a jurisdictional bar, inhibit their ability to improve their circumstances and those of their children. Family law\u2019s holistic approach demands taking account of the interconnected nature of issues of child support, child poverty, and the consequent feminization of poverty. A system that can account for the social dynamics which act to impoverish certain members of society over others, or to prevent them from accessing the courtroom and reclaiming their rights, is a fairer system for all. The principles of child support also favour the interpretation that is favourable to children such that the best interest of the child is at the heart of any interpretive exercise. Moreover, an interpretation adverse to the pre\u2011existing common law rights of children and to the interests of recipient parents should be avoided absent clear statutory expression. The best interests of the child, which are intrinsically tied to those of their caregiver, are in favour of reading s. 152 of the FLA to allow applications for historical child support.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Removing the jurisdictional bar from variation applications means that courts will be called upon to hear these matters on their merits. Judges will have to first determine whether there is a debt outstanding and will then have to consider what would be a fair award under the D.B.S. factors: the recipient parent\u2019s reason for delaying their application for child support, the conduct of the payor parent, the circumstances of the child, and the hardship the award creates for the payor parent. Under the first factor, there are many reasons why even a person in need might delay making an application. There is a growing body of jurisprudence and social science findings demonstrating that, sometimes, parents delay their application for child support to protect their children from harm or because making an application is impracticable or inaccessible in their circumstances. The focus should be on whether the reason provided is understandable rather than whether there is a reasonable excuse, taking into account a generous appreciation of the social context in which the claimant\u2019s decision to seek child support was made.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With respect to the conduct of the payor parent, D.B.S. purposively provided an expansive definition of blameworthy conduct, being anything that privileges the payor parent\u2019s own interests over their children\u2019s right to an appropriate amount of support. The failure to disclose actual income, a fact within the knowledge of the payor, is a failure of a significant obligation and is often the root cause of a delayed application. The primary focus needs to be on the payor\u2019s actions and their consequences \u2014 the payor\u2019s subjective intention is rarely relevant. The presence of blameworthy conduct is not a necessary trigger to the payor\u2019s obligation to pay the claimed child support. Regarding the third factor, a child\u2019s needs may be relevant in awarding and calculating retroactive child support. If there has been hardship present during their childhood, or if the child needs funds at the time of the hearing, this weighs in favour not only of an award but also of extending the temporal reach of the award. However, this does not mean that any kind of hardship is a necessary antecedent to an award of retroactive child support. Furthermore, the fact that a child did not have to suffer hardship because of their custodial parent\u2019s sacrifice is not one that weighs against awarding retroactive or historical child support.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The final factor \u2014 the hardship that the award might entail \u2014 takes into account the ease with which the payor might be able to pay the award. If the award would cause the payor undue hardship, and if the other factors do not militate against it, this factor may weigh against an award or affect its temporal scope to achieve a fair result. While the focus is on hardship to the payor, that hardship can only be assessed after taking into account the hardship which would be caused to the child and the recipient parent from not ordering the payment of sums owing but unpaid.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Regarding the date to which a child support award should be retroactive, the date of retroactivity should perhaps correspond to the date when the support ought to have been paid. Effective notice to the payor parent, the default date to which a child support award should be retroactive, is a broad concept which goes well beyond actual knowledge of a filed variation application. The distinct features of child support reduce somewhat the strength of concerns about lack of notice, and today, certainty for payor parents is provided by the Federal Child Support Tables and the payor parents\u2019 knowledge that they are liable according to their actual income and will be held accountable for missed payments and underpayment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, historical child support can be awarded in part or in whole to either or both the child or their parent, given findings of fact and depending on whom the hardship \u2014 if there was any \u2014 was visited upon. Courts should be flexible when determining how to apportion the award between the recipient parent and the child beneficiary. However, there should be no general reluctance to put monies in the hands of the recipient parent. Where the recipient parent and child beneficiary agree on how the award should be divided, the court should be reluctant to disturb their agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella and Karakatsanis\u00a0JJ.: There is agreement with the majority.

        "summary": "<strong>British Columbia law says courts can order back child support even after  the child is grown up, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Ms.  Michel and Mr. Graydon were \u201ccommon-law\u201d spouses. This meant the law considered  them married, even if they didn\u2019t have a marriage certificate. They lived in  British Columbia. They had a child, AG. A few years later, the relationship  ended. AG went to live with Ms. Michel. Mr. Graydon said his income was about  $40,000 a year. He agreed to pay about $340 a month in child support based on  that. While  AG was growing up, Ms. Michel lived on social assistance. Because of this, she  had to sign over her rights to child support to the government. The government  would collect the child support and pay her social assistance. The government  never tried to ask for more support for AG. When  AG became an adult, the child support ended. But Ms. Michel found out that Mr.  Graydon\u2019s income had been higher than he said. She asked for back (retroactive)  child support based on his real income.     Mr.  Graydon said it was too late to ask for this. He said the court didn\u2019t have the  power to make him pay now, because AG wasn\u2019t a child anymore. When  parents are formally married and decide to get divorced, the <em>Divorce Act </em>applies. The <em>Divorce Act</em> is a federal law. But before  someone files for divorce, or when parents are <em>de facto</em> spouses (in Quebec) or common-law spouses (in other  provinces), provincial laws apply. Under the federal <em>Divorce Act</em>, if the child is now grown up, parents don\u2019t have to  pay back child support even if they should have paid it earlier. Mr. Graydon said  British Columbia\u2019s <em>Family Law Act</em> should be read the same way.      The  trial judge said Mr. Graydon hid his real income, and this hurt AG. He was to  blame for the situation. The trial judge ordered Mr. Graydon to pay $23,000 in  back child support, split between Ms. Michel and AG. But the appeal judges  agreed with Mr. Graydon that it was too late to order back child support. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said Mr. Graydon had to pay. They  said that courts could change past child support orders under the <em>Family Law Act</em>. They could do this even  if the child was now grown up. Child  support is a right that belongs to the child. The parents can\u2019t negotiate it  away. It should give the child the same standard of living they had when their  parents were together. All the judges agreed that back payments are fair. Parents  are always responsible for paying according to their income. Back payment  orders just hold them to that.  All  the judges said courts need to consider the entire situation in deciding  whether to make a parent pay retroactive child support. This includes why a  parent waited to ask for the support, the behaviour of the parent who was  supposed to pay, the child\u2019s situation, and whether it would cause hardship. The  majority said the reason Ms. Michel waited to ask for back payments was that  she had been badly hurt and the government took over her right to support. Mr.  Graydon knew his income was higher than he was saying, so it wouldn\u2019t have been  a surprise to him that he had to pay more. He also knew how bad AG\u2019s living  situation was because of lack of money, and instead of helping her, made  hurtful comments about it. He could afford to pay it now. All of this meant that  he had to pay. All  the judges agreed that preventing retroactive child support hurt women most.  They said that support should be limited only where the law clearly says so. They  said that although an older version of the law might have prevented child support  for the past, the current one didn\u2019t. In any case, it would be wrong to  encourage people to avoid paying in case the other parent might wait too long  to ask for it. People shouldn\u2019t be able to profit from acting badly. This case was  decided \u201cfrom the bench\u201d at the end of the hearing on November 14, 2019. When a  case is decided from the bench, it means the judges tell the parties the  outcome right away. In this case, the judges gave written reasons later to  explain."

B\u2019s email is captured by the statutory definition of \u201cexpression\u201d found in s.\u00a0137.1(2) which contemplates any communication, even if it is non\u2011verbal, and even if it is made privately. The underlying proceeding clearly \u201carises from\u201d that expression, since B\u2019s email is the foundation for P\u2019s defamation proceeding. Moreover, B\u2019s email raises concerns regarding the truthfulness, reliability, and integrity of medical reports filed on behalf of insurers in the arbitration process, which, in turn, raises concerns regarding the integrity of the arbitration process itself and the proper administration of justice. Whether B\u2019s concerns are valid or not is beside the point at this stage. Further, the email is directed at a not insignificant number of individuals, who have a special interest, as part of their broader mandate as members of the OTLA, to steadfastly represent victims of motor vehicle accidents, a public interest in itself. Therefore, B\u2019s email relates to a matter of public interest.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As B has met her burden on the threshold question, the burden shifts to P to show that there are grounds to believe that his defamation proceeding has substantial merit and that B has no valid defence to it under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a) of the CJA. A \u201cgrounds to believe\u201d standard requires a basis in the record and the law,\u00a0taking into account the stage of the litigation, to support these findings. This means that any single basis in the record and the law will be sufficient as long as it is legally tenable and reasonably capable of belief.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 P has discharged his burden under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a)(i) and shown that there are grounds to believe that his defamation proceeding has substantial merit. Defamation is governed by a well\u2011articulated test requiring that three criteria be met and all three of these criteria are easily satisfied in the present case: the words complained of were published, as B wrote an email and sent it to 670 OTLA members; the words complained of explicitly refer to P; and the words complained of were defamatory, since an allegation of professional misconduct would tend to lower P\u2019s reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 P has also discharged his burden under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a)(ii) and shown that there are grounds to believe that B has no valid defence to his defamation proceeding. In other words, there is a basis in the record and the law, taking into account the stage of the proceedings, to support a finding that the defences B has put in play do not tend to weigh more in her favour.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, there are grounds to believe that B\u2019s defence of justification is not valid. To succeed on the defence of justification at trial, the burden is on the defendant to prove the substantial truth of the \u201csting\u201d, or main thrust, of the defamation. Applied to the facts of this case, the \u201csting\u201d of B\u2019s email is an allegation of professional misconduct. In effect, B\u2019s two allegations are constituent parts of the same sting of professional misconduct and the truth of just one will be insufficient for the defence to succeed because B\u2019s two allegations are connected and inseverable. Thus, regardless of whether B\u2019s first allegation of P altering a report is true, if B\u2019s second allegation that P \u201cchanged\u201d a doctor\u2019s decision is not substantially true, then this is sufficient to foreclose her defence of justification under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a)(ii). In the present case, there is a basis in the record and the law to support a finding that the allegation that P \u201cchanged the doctor\u2019s decision\u201d is not substantially true, and that therefore the defence of justification cannot be considered to weigh more in favour of B such that it may be considered \u201cvalid\u201d under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a)(ii).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, there are grounds to believe that B\u2019s defence of qualified privilege is not valid. An occasion of qualified privilege exists if a person making a communication has an interest or duty to publish the information in issue to the person to whom it is published and the recipient has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. However, the privilege is qualified in the sense that it can be defeated. This can occur particularly in two situations: where the speaker was reckless as to the truth of the words spoken; or where the scope of the occasion of privilege was exceeded. In the present case, even assuming without deciding the issue that qualified privilege does attach to the occasion upon which B\u2019s email was sent, there is a basis in the record and the law to support a finding that the scope of B\u2019s privilege was exceeded and that the defence therefore does not tend to weigh more in her favour. This is because the specific references made to P may not have been necessary to the discharge of the duty giving rise to the privilege.\u00a0In other words, B could have communicated her concerns regarding the alteration of medical reports without naming P specifically. Further, the Listserv\u2019s express prohibition on even potentially defamatory remarks suggests that the OTLA acknowledges that the posting of even potentially defamatory material is not necessary (or even relevant) to the duty encompassed within the particular occasion. Lastly, the record reveals a lack of investigation or reasonable due diligence by B prior to making her serious allegations. B took no investigative steps at all to corroborate an allegation of professional misconduct, and instead, relied on her recollection of a specific phrase, from a specific report, by a specific person, concerning a specific event, that had taken place three years earlier, without attempting to communicate with P or consulting her own notes. In light of the heightened expectation of reasonable due diligence that the Court has historically imposed on lawyers, B\u2019s privilege may be defeated simply on the ground that she was indifferent or reckless as to the truth of her defamatory statements. Thus, even assuming that qualified privilege attaches to the occasion upon which B\u2019s communication was made, there are grounds to believe that the defence is not valid under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a)(ii) because it may be defeated by virtue of B having exceeded the scope of the privilege, and perhaps even by her reckless disregard for the truth (i.e. malice).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, the public interest hurdle at s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b) is the crux of the s.\u00a0137.1 analysis. P must show on a balance of probabilities that the harm likely to be or have been suffered as a result of the expression is sufficiently serious that the public interest in permitting the proceeding to continue outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression. First, the harm to P here is extensive and quite serious. Not only does it include significant monetary harm that is more than just a bald assertion, but reputational harm is also eminently relevant to the harm inquiry, even if it is not quantifiable at this stage, and it is only amplified when one considers professional reputation. Second, P\u2019s harm was suffered as a result of B\u2019s expression. B can be held liable for harm that may have resulted from the subsequent leak and/or reproduction of her email in the magazine because republication was reasonably foreseeable to B and/or authorized by B, expressly or impliedly. Even if B cannot be held liable for republication, causation is not an all\u2011or\u2011nothing proposition, and there is a sufficient causal link between the initial email publication and harm suffered by P. No definitive determination of harm or causation is required at this stage. Therefore, the harm likely to be or have been suffered by P as a result of B\u2019s expression lies close to the high end of the spectrum and, correspondingly, so too does the public interest in allowing his defamation proceeding to continue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In determining the public interest in protecting B\u2019s expression, it must be considered that she made a personal attack against P, which cast doubt on his professional competence, integrity, and reputation, without ever having met him and without any investigation into her allegations against him. Indeed, there will be less of a public interest in protecting a statement that contains gratuitous personal attacks and the motivation behind the expression will be relevant to the inquiry. The chilling effect on future expression and the broader or collateral effects on other expressions on matters of public interest must also be considered. Permitting P\u2019s defamation claim to proceed will deter others not from speaking out against unfair and biased practices, but from unnecessarily singling out an individual in a way that is extraneous or peripheral to the public interest, and from making defamatory remarks against an individual without first substantiating, or attempting to substantiate, the veracity of their allegations. In this way, rather than disincentivizing people from speaking out against unfair and biased practices, it will incentivize them to act with reasonable due diligence. Thus, when considered as a whole, the public interest in protecting B\u2019s expression lies somewhere in the middle of the spectrum: while B\u2019s specific references to P fall at the low end of the protection\u2011deserving spectrum, her email interpreted broadly as pertaining to the administration of justice in Ontario falls closer to the high end.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 P has established on a balance of probabilities that the harm likely to be or have been suffered as a result of B\u2019s expression is sufficiently serious that the public interest in permitting his defamation proceeding to continue outweighs the public interest in protecting B\u2019s expression. In light of the open\u2011ended nature of s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b), courts have the power to scrutinize what is really going on in the particular case before them. On its face, this is not a case in which one party is vindictively or strategically silencing another party; it is a case in which one party is attempting to remedy seemingly legitimate harm suffered as a result of a defamatory communication. This is not the type of case that comes within the legislature\u2019s contemplation of one deserving to be summarily dismissed at an early stage, nor does it come within the language of the statute requiring such a dismissal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Moreover, P\u2019s motion to adduce fresh evidence pursuant to s.\u00a062(3) of the Supreme Court Act should be allowed in part. This case is a transitional one: the considerable uncertainty surrounding s.\u00a0137.1 motions \u2014 due to a lack of judicial guidance with respect to both the test for withstanding a s.\u00a0137.1 motion, as well as the nature or comprehensiveness of the evidence required on a such a motion \u2014 militates in favour of granting the motion to adduce fresh evidence in part based on the test from Palmer v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Karakatsanis, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and P\u2019s defamation action should be dismissed under s.\u00a0137.1 of Ontario\u2019s Courts of Justice Act. There is no dispute that P\u2019s defamation action was based on expression that relates to a matter of public interest, as B\u2019s email addressed questions of significance to the administration of justice, particularly the independence, accuracy and impartiality of experts and third\u2011party assessment companies retained by insurers. Section\u00a0137.1(3) is therefore satisfied and P\u2019s defamation proceeding must presumptively be dismissed. Pursuant to s.\u00a0137.1(4), however, P\u2019s proceeding may continue if he satisfies a judge that the following three criteria are met: there are grounds to believe that his case has substantial merit, B has no valid defence to the proceeding, and the likely harm suffered by him is serious enough that it outweighs the public interest in protecting B\u2019s expression. Here, B has a valid defence of qualified privilege and is therefore entitled to the relief mandated by s.\u00a0137.1(3), namely the dismissal of P\u2019s defamation action.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A defence is valid if it has a real prospect of success, meaning that it must be legally tenable, supported by evidence that is reasonably capable of belief, and have a prospect of success that, while not amounting to a demonstrated likelihood of success, tends to weigh more in favour of the person being sued. The burden of showing that the defence can be said to have no real prospect of success is on the plaintiff. The defence of qualified privilege applies where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. Qualified privilege can however be defeated if the communication exceeded the purpose of the privilege or if the communication was predominantly motivated by malice. A defendant will exceed the purpose of the privilege if the information communicated is not reasonably appropriate, that is, relevant and pertinent to the discharge of the duty or the exercise of the right or the safeguarding of the interest which creates the privilege. The question is not whether the statements were strictly necessary. A necessity\u2011based approach would have dangerous and restrictive implications for the defence of qualified privilege. It would effectively exclude from the defence statements containing specific examples of misconduct, since statements like that can almost always be stripped of detail and reconstructed without the unnecessary examples they previously contained. Qualified privilege exists to acknowledge the benefit of expression which is relevant to protecting the public interest, including protecting the public from the perpetuation of wrongdoing or injustice. Generic accounts of misconduct, which do not refer to specific persons, do not require the protection of qualified privilege. The defence is, necessarily, engaged only when someone is identified.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The conclusion that B sent her email in circumstances protected by qualified privilege is supported by evidence that is reasonably capable of belief and sufficiently compelling to give the defence the necessary likelihood of success.\u00a0As president\u2011elect of the OTLA, B had a clear duty to inform its members about selective and misleading expert reports which disadvantage the very individuals they advocate for and represent, as well as a duty to advise OTLA members of ways to protect their clients\u2019 interests against unfair practices by experts and assessment companies. B also had a professional duty as a lawyer to participate in improving the administration of justice and to share best practices. Members of the OTLA Listserv \u2014 all plaintiff\u2011side personal injury lawyers \u2014 unquestionably had a reciprocal duty as well as an interest in receiving B\u2019s communication. Being alerted to questionable conduct by experts and assessment companies \u2014 and advised of ways to guard against such conduct \u2014 was of professional significance to them and especially to their clients. B or her colleagues did not waive their professional obligation to exchange such information by joining a Listserv. B\u2019s communication, therefore, was made by a person with a professional interest and duty to share the information with her colleagues, who had a corresponding interest and duty to receive it. This supports the conclusion that her defence of qualified privilege has a real prospect of success based on both the facts and the law. It is also hard to see how B could have exceeded the bounds of her duty to inform OTLA members of selective and misleading expert reports, by identifying an expert who she reasonably believed to have engaged in precisely that conduct. It was clearly relevant and reasonably appropriate for B, in fulfilling her duty to protect her colleagues and their clients, to identify P, a frequently\u2011retained expert in whose cases it had proven to be especially important to obtain full disclosure of the insurer\u2019s files. It would defeat the purpose of qualified privilege to withhold the defence from B because she chose to identify P by name. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Further, B sent her email while she was president\u2011elect of the OTLA through a Listserv restricted to members of the OTLA who practiced plaintiff\u2011side personal injury law. Members of the Listserv were bound by a wide\u2011ranging undertaking to keep the information strictly confidential.\u00a0As lawyers, Listserv members were also required by the Rules of Professional Conduct to strictly and scrupulously fulfill their undertakings. There was no reason for B to expect that Listserv members would breach these undertakings and, in so doing, breach their professional obligations. There is also nothing in the record to support a finding of malice against B, either due to recklessness or on any other basis. Additionally, the motion judge concluded that there was no evidence to reasonably support the inference that B acted with malice in publishing her email, a conclusion fully supported by the record, and this conclusion is entitled to deference. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, protecting B\u2019s expression on matters of public interest outweighs the harm to P\u2019s reputation. Any harm resulting from the leak of B\u2019s email was caused by unforeseen and unforeseeable communication by others, not by B sending the email to its intended audience of lawyers on the Listserv. B\u2019s email addressed matters of critical importance to the administration of justice and there is a broader public interest in protecting B\u2019s expression, as permitting a defamation suit to proceed would produce a considerable chilling effect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 P\u2019s motion to admit fresh evidence should be dismissed. Most of the material he seeks to admit is clearly irrelevant and inadmissible. What is left are two unsworn letters sent by email between counsel in a related matter. The emails relate to issues that were, from the day P brought his defamation action, live and in serious dispute but unchallenged and unexplored by him, and were rejected as fresh evidence four years ago by the motion judge. Admitting the emails would require the Court to overturn the exercise of discretion by the motion judge, ignore P\u2019s demonstrable lack of due diligence, and accept unsworn, untested, hearsay evidence, all to obtain information that would not, in any event, have affected the result of B\u2019s dismissal hearing. Such an outcome would not only frustrate the purposes of s.\u00a0137.1, it would inexplicably depart from the Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the admission of fresh evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: 1704604 Ontario Ltd. v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0doctor\u2019s defamation lawsuit against a lawyer  wasn\u2019t meant to silence anyone, and could go forward, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>\r\n     Freedom of expression is important to democracy, but  it has limits. One limit is defamation. Defamation law protects a person\u2019s  reputation from unfair harm. Ms. Bent was a lawyer. She had been elected as  president of the Ontario Trial Lawyers Association (OTLA), whose members represented  people hurt in car accidents. Dr. Platnick was a doctor. He was hired by insurance  companies to look at reports written by other medical professionals. He would write  final reports giving medical opinions on how badly people were hurt. In 2014, Ms. Bent sent an email to the OTLA mailing  list. She said that Dr. Platnick had misrepresented and changed other doctors\u2019  reports to make her clients\u2019 injuries look less serious. This meant the people  who were hurt would get fewer insurance benefits.  Emails sent to the OTLA list were supposed to be confidential,  but someone shared the message about Dr. Platnick. An insurance industry  magazine published the full email in an article.  Dr. Platnick said Ms. Bent was wrong. He explained  that in one case he clearly made his own conclusions based on information from  other doctors who didn\u2019t know Ontario\u2019s accident benefits law. In another case,  a doctor made a mistake in a report and later fixed it. Dr. Platnick asked Ms. Bent to apologize. She didn\u2019t,  so he sued her and her law firm for defamation (that is, for harming his  reputation). He asked for over $16 million in damages and lost income.  Ms. Bent said this was a \u201cstrategic lawsuit against  public participation,\u201d or \u201cSLAPP.\u201d SLAPPs are lawsuits used to stop people from  speaking out on something that\u2019s important to the public. SLAPPs aren\u2019t about genuine  legal claims. They are about intimidating and silencing critics with the threat  of costing them time and money to defend the lawsuit. Like some other  provinces, Ontario has a law to stop SLAPPs before they ever go to trial. The motion judge agreed with Ms. Bent that the  defamation suit was a SLAPP and should be stopped. The Court of Appeal said it <em>wasn\u2019t</em> a SLAPP and could go forward. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court said that Dr.  Platnick\u2019s lawsuit wasn\u2019t a SLAPP and should be allowed to continue. For his lawsuit to go forward, Dr. Platnick had to  show three things. First, that he had a likely chance of winning. Second, that  Ms. Bent had no valid defence. Third, he had to show that it was more important  to the public that his lawsuit be allowed to go forward than it was to protect  Ms. Bent\u2019s expression.  The majority of judges said Dr. Platnick showed these  three things. They said that the motion judge made mistakes applying the law on  SLAPPs, about defamation law, and about the evidence. They said Dr. Platnick  had a likely chance of winning. This was because Ms. Bent\u2019s email was sent to  670 OTLA members and talked about Dr. Platnick by name. It was also because Dr.  Platnick showed he lost about $600,000 in income because of the damage to his  reputation. Dr. Platnick also showed at this stage that there was a basis in  fact to find that Ms. Bent had no valid defence. The evidence showed that Dr.  Platnick may not have changed the doctor\u2019s report. What Ms. Bent said wasn\u2019t  necessarily true. Her comments also weren\u2019t necessary because she didn\u2019t have  to mention Dr. Platnick by name. Even if Ms. Bent thought the email list was  confidential, she talked to the magazine about it and let them publish it. The  majority of judges said that the email was a personal attack and that Ms. Bent  didn\u2019t confront Dr. Platnick about anything before she sent it. They said the  harm to Dr. Platnick was more important to the public than protecting Ms.  Bent\u2019s freedom of expression in this situation.  The majority said that just because a court says a  lawsuit isn\u2019t a SLAPP and can go forward doesn\u2019t mean it will succeed. This  just means the person deserves to have their day in court. In a trial, the court  will hear much more evidence and argument, and will have much more to base a  decision on.  <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2020/38376-eng.aspx\">1704604  Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association</a></em> was another  case about SLAPPs. The Court used its decision in that case and applied it to  this one. The Court heard the cases on the same day."

These provisions were aimed at mitigating the harmful effects of strategic lawsuits against public participation (\u201cSLAPPs\u201d), a phenomenon used to describe lawsuits initiated against individuals or organizations that speak out or take a position on an issue of public interest not as a direct tool to vindicate a bona fide claim, but as an indirect tool to limit the expression and deter that party, or other potential interested parties, from participating in public affairs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Pointes Protection Association, a not\u2011for\u2011profit corporation, and six of its members (collectively, \u201cPointes Protection\u201d) relied on s.\u00a0137.1 of the CJA to bring a pre\u2011trial motion to have a $6 million action for breach of contract initiated against them by a land developer dismissed. The action was brought in the context of Pointes Protection\u2019s opposition to a proposed subdivision development by the developer. The developer claimed that the testimony of the association\u2019s president, at a hearing of the Ontario Municipal Board, to the effect that the developer\u2019s proposed development would result in ecological and environmental damage to the region, breached an agreement between the developer and Pointes Protection that imposed limitations on Pointes Protection\u2019s conduct in respect of the approvals sought by the developer from the relevant authorities for its development. Pointes Protection\u2019s s.\u00a0137.1 motion was dismissed by the motion judge, who allowed the developer\u2019s action against Pointes Protection to proceed. The Court of Appeal allowed Pointes Protection\u2019s appeal, granted its s.\u00a0137.1 motion, and dismissed the developer\u2019s lawsuit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Freedom of expression is a fundamental right and value; the ability to express oneself and engage in the interchange of ideas fosters a pluralistic and healthy democracy by generating fruitful public discourse and corresponding public participation in civil society. Section 137.1 of the CJA was enacted to circumscribe proceedings that adversely affect expression made in relation to matters of public interest, in order to protect that expression and safeguard the fundamental value that is public participation in democracy. Applying this framework in this case, Pointes Protection\u2019s s.\u00a0137.1 motion should be granted and the developer\u2019s underlying breach of contract action dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 137.1(3) places an initial burden on the moving party \u2014 the defendant in a lawsuit \u2014 to satisfy the motion judge that the proceeding initiated against them arises from an expression relating to a matter of public interest. This burden is a threshold one, meaning it is necessary for the moving party to meet in order to even proceed to s.\u00a0137.1(4) for the ultimate determination of whether the underlying proceeding should be dismissed. While the term \u201cexpression\u201d is expressly defined in the statute, other terms are in need of elaboration. First, in accordance with the jurisprudence interpreting the word, \u201csatisfies\u201d requires the moving party to meet its burden on a balance of probabilities. Second, a broad and liberal interpretation of \u201carises from\u201d is warranted, which does not limit proceedings arising from an expression to those directly concerned with expression, such as defamation suits. Third, the text of s.\u00a0137.1(2) makes it abundantly clear that \u201cexpression\u201d is defined expansively. Fourth, and finally, the term \u201crelates to a matter of public interest\u201d should be given a broad and liberal interpretation, consistent with the legislative purpose of s.\u00a0137.1. Importantly, it will not be legally relevant whether the expression is desirable or deleterious, valuable or vexatious, or whether it helps or hampers the public interest \u2014 there is no qualitative assessment of the expression at this stage. The only question is whether the expression pertains to any matter of public interest, defined broadly. The principles from Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, apply in the present context. Ultimately, the inquiry is a contextual one that is fundamentally asking what the expression is really about.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To the extent that the threshold burden under s.\u00a0137.1(3) is met by the moving party (i.e. the defendant in the underlying proceeding), then the burden shifts to the responding party \u2014 (i.e. the plaintiff) \u2014 to avoid having their proceeding dismissed. Under s.\u00a0137.1(4), the plaintiff must satisfy the motion judge that (a)\u00a0there are grounds to believe that their underlying proceeding has substantial merit and the defendant has no valid defence, and that (b)\u00a0the harm likely to be or have been suffered and the corresponding public interest in permitting the proceeding to continue outweighs the public interest in protecting the expression. If either (a) or (b) is not met, then this will be fatal to the plaintiff discharging its burden and, as a consequence, the underlying proceeding will be dismissed. However, if the plaintiff can show that both are met, then the proceeding will be allowed to continue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Unlike with s.\u00a0137.1(3), s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a) \u2014 the merits\u2011based hurdle \u2014 is statutorily circumscribed by an express standard: \u201cgrounds to believe\u201d. These words plainly refer to the existence of a basis or source (i.e. \u201cgrounds\u201d) for reaching a belief or conclusion that the legislated criteria have been met. Accordingly, \u201cgrounds to believe\u201d requires that there be a basis in the record and law \u2014 taking into account the stage of litigation at which a s.\u00a0137.1 motion is brought \u2014 for finding that the underlying proceeding has substantial merit and that there is no valid defence. This assessment must be made from the motion judge\u2019s perspective.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In consideration of the statutory text, the statutory context, and legislative intent, for an underlying proceeding to have \u201csubstantial merit\u201d under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a)(i), it must be legally tenable and supported by evidence that is reasonably capable of belief such that it can be said to have a real prospect of success \u2014 in other words, a prospect of success that, while not amounting to a demonstrated likelihood of success, tends to weigh more in favour of the plaintiff. This standard is more demanding than the one applicable on a motion to strike, which requires that the claim have some chance of success or a reasonable prospect of success. It is, however, less stringent than the likely to succeed standard, the strong prima facie case threshold, or the test for summary judgment. It is critical to recall that a s.\u00a0137.1 motion is not a determinative adjudication of the merits of the proceeding and the motion judge should be acutely aware of the stage of the litigation process at which a s.\u00a0137.1 motion is brought. Motion judges should engage in only limited weighing of the evidence and should defer ultimate assessments of credibility and other questions requiring a deep dive into the evidence to a later stage, where judicial powers of inquiry are broader and pleadings more fully developed. It must be borne in mind that even if a lawsuit clears the merits\u2011based hurdle at s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a), it remains vulnerable to summary dismissal as a result of the public interest weighing exercise under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b), which provides courts with a robust backstop to protect freedom of expression.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(a)(ii), the plaintiff must also satisfy the motion judge that there are \u201cgrounds to believe\u201d that the defendant has \u201cno valid defence\u201d in the underlying proceeding. The word \u201cno\u201d is absolute, and the corollary is that if there is any defence that is valid, then the plaintiff has not met its burden and the underlying claim should be dismissed. Mirroring the \u201csubstantial merit\u201d prong, the \u201cno valid defence\u201d prong requires the plaintiff to show that there are grounds to believe that the defences put in play by the defendant have no real prospect of success.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The final weighing exercise under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b) is the fundamental crux of the analysis. Section\u00a0137.1(4)(b) provides courts with the ability to scrutinize what is really going on in the particular case before them: it is intended to optimize the balance between the public interest in allowing meritorious lawsuits to proceed and the public interest in protecting expression on matters of public interest by open\u2011endedly engaging with the overarching public interest implications that this statute, and anti\u2011SLAPP legislation generally, seek to address.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Harm is principally important in order for the plaintiff to meet its burden under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b). As a prerequisite to the weighing exercise, the statutory languages requires (i) the existence of harm and (ii) causation \u2014 the harm was suffered as a result of the defendant\u2019s expression. Either monetary harm or non\u2011monetary harm can be relevant, and harm is not synonymous with the damages alleged. Since s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b) is a weighing exercise, there is no threshold requirement for the harm to be worthy of consideration: the magnitude of the harm simply adds weight to one side of the weighing exercise. The plaintiff need not prove harm or causation, but must simply provide evidence for the motion judge to draw an inference of likelihood in respect of the existence of the harm and the relevant causal link.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Once harm has been established and shown to be causally related to the expression, s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b) requires that the harm and corresponding public interest in permitting the proceeding to continue be weighed against the public interest in protecting the expression. The term \u201cpublic interest\u201d is used differently here in s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b) than in s.\u00a0137.1(3). Under s.\u00a0137.1(3), the query is concerned with whether the expression relates to a matter of public interest; the assessment is not qualitative. Under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b), in contrast, the public interest must be relevant to specific goals: permitting the proceeding to continue and protecting the impugned expression. Therefore, not just any matter of public interest will be relevant. Instead, the quality of the expression, and the motivation behind it, are relevant. While judges should be wary of conducting a moralistic taste test, not all expression is created equal, thus the weighing exercises can be informed by considerations underlying s.\u00a02(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, such as the search for truth, participation in political decision making, and diversity in forms of self\u2011fulfilment and human flourishing: the closer the expression is to any of these core values, the greater the public interest in protecting it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Additional factors may also prove useful in guiding the weighing exercise. For example, the following factors, in no particular order of importance, may be relevant to consider: the importance of the expression, the history of litigation between the parties, broader or collateral effects on other expressions on matters of public interest, the potential chilling effect on future expression either by a party or by others, the moving party\u2019s history of activism or advocacy in the public interest, any disproportion between the resources being used in the lawsuit and the harm caused or the expected damages award, and the possibility that the expression or the claim might provoke hostility against an identifiably vulnerable group or a group protected under s.\u00a015 of the Charter or human rights legislation. However, because the s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b) stage is fundamentally a public interest weighing exercise and not simply an inquiry into the hallmarks of a SLAPP, the only factors that might be relevant in guiding the weighing exercise are those tethered to the text of s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b), which calls for a consideration of: the harm suffered or potentially suffered by the plaintiff, the corresponding public interest in allowing the underlying proceeding to continue, and the public interest in protecting the underlying expression.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Fundamentally, s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b) allows judges to assess how allowing individuals or organizations to vindicate their rights through a lawsuit \u2014 a fundamental value in its own right in a democracy \u2014 affects, in turn, freedom of expression and its corresponding influence on public discourse and participation in a pluralistic democracy. The burden is on the plaintiff\u00a0to show on a balance of probabilities that it likely has suffered or will suffer harm, that such harm is a result of the expression established under s.\u00a0137.1(3), and that the corresponding public interest in allowing the underlying proceeding to continue outweighs the deleterious effects on expression and public participation. The provision expressly requires that one consideration outweigh the other; this is substantively different than simply balancing the considerations against one another.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, Pointes Protection meets its threshold burden under s.\u00a0137.1(3) with little difficulty, as the relevant expression \u2014 testimony on the environmental impact and ecological consequences of the proposed development \u2014 relates to a matter of public interest and the land developer\u2019s breach of contract action arises from that expression. The land developer\u2019s action must be dismissed, however, as the developer cannot meet its burden under s.\u00a0137.1(4).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, the developer\u2019s action lacks substantial merit: it is not legally tenable and not supported by evidence that is reasonably capable of belief such that the claim can be said to have a real prospect of success. The land developer\u2019s claim is based solely on an alleged breach of a contract by Pointes Protection, but the interpretation advanced by the land developer does not flow from the plain language of the contract or the factual matrix surrounding it; the reading urged by the land developer would distort the ordinary meaning of the words in a manner that exceeds the bounds of appropriate judicial intervention in matters of contractual interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, regardless, the land developer\u2019s underlying action can nonetheless be dismissed on the independent ground that the developer cannot establish on a balance of probabilities that the weighing of the public interest favours permitting the proceeding to continue under s.\u00a0137.1(4)(b). The harm likely to be or have been suffered by the developer as a result of Pointes Protection\u2019s expression lies at the very low end of the spectrum and, correspondingly, so too does the public interest in allowing the proceeding to continue. Indeed, the land developer\u2019s theory of harm is conjecture and its interest in finality is dependent entirely on the correctness of its interpretation of the contract. In contrast, the public interest in protecting Pointes Protection\u2019s expression is significant and falls at the higher end of the spectrum. The public has a strong interest in the subject matter \u2014 which relates to the ecological impact and environmental degradation associated with a proposed large\u2011scale development \u2014 and strengthening the integrity of the justice system by encouraging truthful and open testimony is inextricably linked to the freedom of participants to express themselves in the forums concerned without fear of retribution.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For these reasons, Pointes Protection\u2019s s.\u00a0137.1 motion should be granted on either of the independent grounds that the land developer\u2019s action lacks substantial merit and that the land developer is unable to demonstrate that the weighing of the public interest favours permitting the proceeding to continue. Consequently, the land developer\u2019s underlying action should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: Galloway v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0land developer\u2019s lawsuit against a residents\u2019 group was meant to  silence critics and can\u2019t go forward, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled.</strong>\r\n   1704604 Ontario Ltd. was a land development company in  Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. It wanted to build a neighbourhood on an area that was  part of a wetland. Some local residents were against the plan. They said it  would destroy the wetland and cause other damage to the environment. They  formed a group called Pointes Protection. The company had to get permission to build the  neighbourhood. It needed approvals from the local Conservation Authority and  City Council.  The  Conservation Authority approved the plan. Pointes Protection said the decision  was wrong. It asked a court to review it. While this was happening, Council  said no to the plan. The company appealed Council\u2019s decision to the Ontario  Municipal Board, which decides on planning disagreements. Pointes  Protection agreed not to go to court about the Conservation Authority decision.  It agreed not to say that the Conservation Authority\u2019s decisions were against  the law or not allowed. The company lost at the Municipal Board hearing. During  the hearing, a Pointes Protection representative testified about the company\u2019s  plan. He said the plan would hurt the environment and destroy part of the  wetland. The company said this went against the agreement. It sued for breach  of contract and asked for $6 million in damages. Pointes Protection said the company was wrongly trying  to stop residents from speaking out. It said the company was trying to silence  criticism on an important public issue. It said this was a \u201cstrategic lawsuit  against public participation,\u201d or \u201cSLAPP.\u201d SLAPPs aren\u2019t about genuine legal  claims. They are about intimidating and silencing critics. They are about  getting people to settle and stop speaking to avoid the time and money it would  cost to go to court. Like some other provinces, Ontario has a law to stop  SLAPPs before they ever go to trial. The  motion judge said the lawsuit wasn\u2019t a SLAPP and it could go forward. The Court  of Appeal said it <em>was</em> a SLAPP, so it  had to be dismissed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed this was a SLAPP. They said  that SLAPPs hurt people\u2019s right to freedom of expression, and that freedom of  expression is important to our democracy. Ontario\u2019s rules about SLAPPs were new, so the Court  had to decide how to apply them. For a lawsuit to be a SLAPP, it had to be  about something the defendant (the person being sued) communicated. Whatever it  was the defendant communicated had to be important to the public. But the  person suing (the plaintiff) could show the lawsuit <em>wasn\u2019t</em> a SLAPP by showing three things. The first was that they  were likely to win. The second was that the person being sued had no valid defence.  The third was that it was more important to the public to let the lawsuit go  forward than to protect what the defendant said. The Court said judges have to  look at the whole situation, between the parties and in society, to decide  whether a lawsuit is really a SLAPP and should be stopped.      In  this case, the testimony at the Ontario Municipal Board was an expression  related to the public interest, as it was about the environmental impacts of  the company\u2019s plan. The lawsuit was based on what the Pointes Protection representative  said in the testimony. The Court said that the company didn\u2019t have much of a  chance of winning because its argument was based on an incorrect interpretation  of the agreement. Pointes Protection had agreed it wouldn\u2019t raise their environmental  concerns to the Conservation Authority. However, nothing in the contract said  it couldn\u2019t use the same evidence in a different situation. The Court also said it was more important to the  public to protect Pointes Protection\u2019s testimony before an administrative  decision-maker than to prevent the harm the company said it experienced. This was the first  time the Supreme Court dealt with Ontario\u2019s new rules about SLAPPs. Another  case, <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2020/38374-eng.aspx\">Bent v.  Platnick</a></em>, was also about SLAPPs. The Court used its decision in  this case and applied it to that one. The Court heard the cases on the same  day."

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0Cabinet document used to decide on judges\u2019 pay in British Columbia  should stay confidential, the Supreme Court has unanimously ruled. But parts of  one used in Nova Scotia should be disclosed.</strong>\r\n   Under  the Constitution, Canada has three branches of state. The executive branch (the  Prime Minister or Premier and Cabinet) decides policy. The legislative branch  (Parliament or legislatures) makes laws. The judiciary (the courts) interprets  and applies laws. Each branch has a different role. It  is important for our democracy that each branch has some independence. For  courts, \u201cjudicial independence\u201d means they can do their work without  interference from the other branches. For example, judges can only be removed  from office for very good reasons. This is so judges aren\u2019t afraid to make the  right decisions, even unpopular ones. Also, only judges can decide how to  manage court processes. And judges must be paid properly, so financial pressure  can\u2019t be used against them. Judges  can\u2019t negotiate their salaries with the government. Negotiations would make the  issue political. This would upset the relationship between the branches.  Instead, independent commissions make salary recommendations to governments. Governments  have to formally respond and give reasons if they decide not to follow them. Only  the executive and the legislative branches can make decisions about judges\u2019  salaries. But courts can still review these decisions. This is to make sure  governments are doing what they are supposed to under the Constitution. For  judges\u2019 salaries, courts will look at whether there was a valid reason not to  follow a recommendation. They will look at whether the decision was based on  facts. And they will look at whether the government respected the commission\u2019s  role and judicial independence. Commissions  in British Columbia and Nova Scotia made recommendations about salaries of  judges appointed by those provinces. The governments decided not to follow all the  recommendations. The associations representing the judges asked the courts to  review the governments\u2019 decisions. As part of this, they asked the courts to  order the governments to give them copies of the confidential Cabinet documents  used to make the decisions. The  lower courts in both provinces said the governments had to disclose (share) the  Cabinet documents. All  the judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said the British Columbia Cabinet  document should stay confidential. But they said part of the Nova Scotia  document should be disclosed (shared). The  Court said confidential Cabinet documents could only be shared under certain  conditions. There had to be reason to believe the documents might help show  that the government didn\u2019t follow its obligations. In such a case, a judge  would look at the documents, without anyone else seeing them. If the judge  decided the document would help show the government didn\u2019t follow its  obligations, the judge could still decide not to release the documents. But  only if there was a good reason not to. For  example, the document could be protected by solicitor-client privilege, if it  dealt with legal advice to the government. The document could also be protected  by \u201cpublic interest immunity.\u201d This is when courts look at whether the public  interest in keeping Cabinet documents confidential outweighs the public interest  in knowing what was said. It  would depend on the situation. But it is important that ministers can have  frank discussions with their colleagues. They have to defend government  decisions publicly, even if they don\u2019t agree with them personally. It\u2019s part of  their job. If Cabinet discussions weren\u2019t confidential, ministers could be  criticized for holding different private views than those they defended in  public. This could be a distraction and lower people\u2019s confidence in  government. In  the British Columbia case, the Court said there was no reason to believe the  document might help show the government didn\u2019t follow its obligations. But,  in the Nova Scotia case, the Court said there was reason to believe the document  might help show the government didn\u2019t follow its obligations when it decided on  judges\u2019 salaries. The Court looked at the Cabinet document. It confirmed parts  of it would help show the government didn\u2019t follow some obligations. And the  Court said public interest immunity didn\u2019t prevent those parts from being  shared. Courts have a  special role in society because they hold up the rule of law. The rule of law  is the principle that everyone should follow the same legal rules in society.  Under the Constitution, courts can\u2019t be politicized. Otherwise, people could  lose faith in our justice system. This is why judicial independence is  important to all Canadians, not just judges."

The plaintiffs applied for certification of a class action against ALC, on behalf of any natural person resident in Newfoundland and Labrador who paid to play VLTs in that province in the six years preceding the class action. The plaintiffs claim that VLTs are inherently dangerous and deceptive.

The Court of Appeal substantially upheld the certification judge\u2019s conclusions, and allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in waiver of tort, breach of contract and unjust enrichment to proceed to trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ. dissenting in part): The appeals should be allowed, the certification order set aside and the plaintiffs\u2019 statement of claim struck in its entirety.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ.: Each claim that the plaintiffs have pleaded is bound to fail because it discloses no reasonable cause of action.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The plaintiffs cannot rely on the doctrine of waiver of tort as an independent cause of action for disgorgement. This novel cause of action does not exist in Canadian law and has no reasonable chance of succeeding at trial. In addition, the term \u201cwaiver of tort\u201d is apt to generate confusion and should be abandoned. Despite its early acceptance, this term is a misnomer. Rather than forgiving or waiving the wrongfulness of the defendant\u2019s conduct, plaintiffs relying on the doctrine are simply electing to pursue an alternative, gain\u2011based, remedy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Restitution for unjust enrichment and disgorgement for wrongdoing are two types of gain\u2011based remedies. What the plaintiffs seek in this case is disgorgement, which does not require proof of deprivation to the plaintiff, and requires only that the defendant gained a benefit. Restitution is awarded in response to the causative event of unjust enrichment, where there is correspondence between the defendant\u2019s gain and the plaintiff\u2019s deprivation. Disgorgement should be viewed as an alternative remedy for certain forms of wrongful conduct, not as an independent cause of action. In order to make out a claim for disgorgement, a plaintiff must first establish actionable misconduct. By pleading disgorgement as an independent cause of action, however, the plaintiffs in this case seek to establish an entirely new category of wrongful conduct \u2014 one that is akin to negligence but does not require proof of damage. Although disgorgement is available for some forms of wrongdoing without proof of damage (for example, breach of fiduciary duty), it is a far leap to find that disgorgement without proof of damage is available as a general proposition in response to a defendant\u2019s negligent conduct. Granting disgorgement for negligence without proof of damage would result in a remedy arising out of legal nothingness, and would be a radical and uncharted development. This is not the type of incremental change that falls within the remit of courts applying the common law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that VLTs are \u201csimilar to\u201d three\u2011card monte within the meaning of s.\u00a0206 of the Criminal Code and that their operation is therefore prohibited also has no reasonable chance of success.\u00a0Statutory interpretation requires discerning legislative intent by examining statutory text in its entire context and in its grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statute\u2019s scheme and objects. In determining what games can be considered \u201csimilar to\u201d three\u2011card monte, it must be kept in mind that courts cannot create common law crimes through an act of judicial interpretation. Furthermore, while expert evidence may assist in deciding whether the defined elements of an offence are made out on the facts of a particular charge, expert evidence cannot purport to define the elements of an offence. The text of the provision and its surrounding context suggest that the prohibition of games similar to three\u2011card monte was directed towards the game\u2019s concrete attributes and not towards the abstract feature of deception. Had Parliament sought to prohibit broadly deceptive games, it would have straightforwardly done so. Games \u201csimilar to\u201d three\u2011card monte must therefore involve, at a minimum, a player betting on the location of an object after a series of a manipulations. Nothing in the pleadings describes VLTs as operating in this manner.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claim is also doomed to fail. Whether this claim discloses a reasonable cause of action should be considered in light of the remedies the plaintiffs actually seek \u2014 that is, disgorgement and punitive damages \u2014 and the question of whether these remedies are available to the plaintiffs, assuming the truth of their pleadings. The ordinary form of monetary relief for breach of contract is an award of damages, measured according to the position which the plaintiff would have occupied had the contract been performed. Disgorgement for breach of contract may be appropriate in exceptional circumstances, but only where, at a minimum, other remedies are inadequate and only where the circumstances warrant such an award. As to those circumstances, courts should in particular consider whether the plaintiff had a legitimate interest in preventing the defendant\u2019s profit\u2011making activity. The key to developing principles for gain\u2011based recovery in breach of contract is to consider what legitimate interest a gain\u2011based award serves to vindicate. A coherent approach that reconciles the relief awarded with the structure of breach of contract as a cause of action should be preferred. While the circumstances in which a gain\u2011based award will be appropriate cannot be clearly delineated in advance, one would expect future legitimate interests protected by a gain\u2011based award to resemble those interests that have been protected in the past. Courts have, in some exceptional circumstances, long awarded monetary amounts departing from the ordinary measure of expectation damages. An award that appears to be measured by a defendant\u2019s gain might serve a compensatory purpose that distinguishes it from disgorgement and which therefore tends to support recovery. Where, as here, the argument is that the quantum of loss is equal to the defendant\u2019s gain, but the plaintiff would simply rather pursue disgorgement, a gain\u2011based remedy is not appropriate. Further, there is nothing exceptional about the breach of contract the plaintiffs allege: once the allegations of criminal conduct are put aside, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is simply that they paid to play a gambling game and did not get exactly what they paid for. The plaintiffs cannot be said to have a legitimate interest in ALC\u2019s profit\u2011making activity, and their claim has no reasonable chance of achieving disgorgement damages for breach of contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Punitive damage awards for breach of contract are also exceptional, but will be awarded where the alleged breach of contract is an independent actionable wrong. The actionable wrong need not be tortious: punitive damages may also be awarded where the defendant breaches a contractual obligation. Not every contract, however, imposes actionable good faith obligations on contracting parties: while good faith is an organizing principle of Canadian contract law, it manifests itself in specific circumstances and its application is generally confined to existing categories of contracts and obligations. The alleged contract between ALC and the plaintiffs does not fit within any of the established good faith categories; accordingly, their claim for punitive damages has no reasonable chance of success.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, the plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim has no reasonable chance of success.\u00a0The principled unjust enrichment framework requires establishing that ALC was enriched, that the plaintiffs suffered a corresponding deprivation, and that the enrichment and corresponding deprivation occurred in the absence of any juristic reason therefor. The juristic reason element proceeds in two stages: first, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s enrichment cannot be justified by any of the established categories of juristic reason; and second, the defendant can rebut the plaintiff\u2019s case by showing that there is a residual reason to deny recovery. In the present case, there is no need to go beyond the first stage. The plaintiffs\u2019 own pleadings allege that there was a contract between ALC and the plaintiffs under which the plaintiffs paid to play VLTs, and nothing in the pleadings could serve to vitiate the alleged contract. A defendant that acquires a benefit pursuant to a valid contract is justified in retaining that benefit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ. (dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part.\u00a0There is agreement with the majority that a mere breach of a duty of care, in the absence of loss, cannot ground a claim for disgorgement. There is also agreement that VLTs cannot constitute \u201cthree\u2011card monte\u201d as defined in the Criminal Code, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in unjust enrichment must be struck. However, there is disagreement with whether the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in breach of contract is a reasonable cause of action, as well as the conclusion that there are no available remedies for that breach. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim should be certified as a class action on the common issues of breach of contract, punitive damages and the appropriateness of a disgorgement remedy. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are the existence of a contract and the breach of a term of that contract. Loss is not an essential element. The plaintiffs have pleaded the nature of the contract, the terms they say are implied, and the manner in which ALC breached the contract between them. The first implied term pleaded is a warranty that the VLTs were not inherently dangerous. In the alternative, the plaintiffs plead that ALC breached an implied term requiring ALC to warn the plaintiff class of any inherent danger in the consumption of the games and to satisfy itself of their safety. Finally, the plaintiffs allege that ALC breached an implied term of good faith. It is not plain and obvious that implying these terms would improperly touch on or fetter ALC\u2019s authority as a public regulator of VLTs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The claim for breach of contract should not be struck on the basis that it is plain and obvious that there are no available remedies. There are several remedies that are open to the plaintiffs on their pleadings, including nominal damages, declaratory relief, disgorgement, and punitive damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A court finding breach of contract may make binding declarations of right, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed. Nominal damages are always available for causes of action, like breach of contract, that do not require proof of loss. This alone precludes striking the claim.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Whether disgorgement is an appropriate remedy for breach of contract in this case is a matter for trial that cannot be resolved on the pleadings alone. While the customary remedy for a breach of contract is compensation measured in the form of expectation damages, in some cases, disgorgement of a defendant\u2019s profits can be an appropriate remedy for breach of contract. Disgorgement is an exceptional remedy, available where a plaintiff has shown that the ordinary remedies of contract law are inadequate to protect and vindicate their contractual right. Although compensatory damages will often help to achieve deterrence of wrongful conduct, they will not always be adequate or appropriate in the circumstances of the breach. The measure of a disgorgement award implicitly effects deterrence and is dictated by the minimum amount necessary to make the wrong unprofitable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Disgorgement awards are not limited to situations in which they serve a compensatory purpose. A self\u2011interested and deliberate breach; the impracticability of calculating loss; and the plaintiff\u2019s legitimate interest in preventing the defendant\u2019s profit\u2011making activity, including where the defendant had a quasi\u2011fiduciary duty to the plaintiff, weigh in favour of a disgorgement remedy. No single factor is necessarily crucial or dispositive. The plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings in this case correspond with several factors that, if established at trial, may point to a disgorgement remedy, including that the plaintiffs were vulnerable to ALC\u2019s abuse of its power and that ALC\u2019s breach was self\u2011interested, deliberate, and in bad faith. A trial judge may also find that ascertaining the actual amount lost is impracticable since VLTs are designed not to create records of who uses them and how much money they have lost. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The plaintiffs have also pleaded a sufficient basis to support a claim for punitive damages. The focus of punitive damages is on the defendant\u2019s misconduct, not the plaintiff\u2019s loss, and injury to the plaintiff is not a condition precedent to an award of punitive damages. The plaintiffs have pleaded a breach of the duty of honest performance, which can constitute an actionable wrong to ground a claim for punitive damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With regard to certification, the class representative must show that there is some \u201cbasis in fact\u201d that there is an identifiable class of two or more persons, that there is at least one common issue, and that the class action is the preferable procedure. This standard ensures that there is an evidentiary foundation to support the certification order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The proposed class definition uses objective criteria that will allow for identification of those who can attest to playing the games, and there is a basis to believe that at least two persons will be able to establish that they paid ALC to gamble on VLT games during the proposed class period.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An issue is common where its resolution is necessary to the resolution of each class member\u2019s claim. The issues relating to breach of contract, disgorgement, and punitive damages are appropriate common issues, but the issue relating to aggregate monetary relief is not. On breach of contract, the pleadings assert a civil wrong that is common to each member of the class: whether the terms alleged by the plaintiffs are in fact implied, and whether the functioning of the VLTs routinely violates those terms, would be the same for every consumer. On disgorgement, determining whether the circumstances of this case are exceptional, such that other contractual remedies are inadequate, is a substantial ingredient of each member\u2019s claim and will benefit all members of the class. For punitive damages, ALC\u2019s conduct and the alleged breach of the duty of good faith would be common to all class members.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 But there is no basis in fact to certify aggregate monetary relief as a common issue. Before making an award of disgorgement, the court must be satisfied that the breach of contract is causally connected to the gain to be disgorged. To ensure that ALC\u2019s total liability is limited to that flowing from the breach, some plausible methodology is needed to estimate ALC\u2019s liability from its breach of contract, including what its profits might have been had it not breached its contractual obligations. No methodology has been suggested.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, with regard to preferability, the keystone of the plaintiffs\u2019 action is a deception common to each member of the class.\u00a0Determining the content of a contract entered into by each member, and whether that contract was systematically breached, does not require individualized assessments and is more practical and efficient than individual actions. A class action has the potential to acknowledge, vindicate and protect individual players\u2019 contractual interest in a safe and fair game.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Attorney General v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0class action lawsuit about video lottery games can\u2019t go forward, the  Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>Video  lottery terminals (VLTs) are electronic gambling machines. They let people pay  to play gambling games, like slots, for fun or in hopes of winning money. They  are usually found in bars and places that sell alcohol. Any place that has a  VLT has to get a licence for it. In Newfoundland and Labrador, Atlantic Lottery  Corporation approves the licence. Mr.  Babstock played VLTs. He wanted to sue Atlantic Lottery Corporation. He said VLTs  were dangerous and that they tricked people. He said Atlantic Lottery  Corporation should have to pay six years\u2019 worth of profits from VLTs in  Newfoundland and Labrador to the people who played them. Mr. Babstock wanted to  sue on behalf of all of these people. When a large group of people have the same legal problem, they might decide  to get together and sue as a group. This is called a \u201cclass action\u201d lawsuit.  (The \u201cclass\u201d is the group, so it\u2019s a group action.) A class action lets the  whole group get their complaint dealt with in court at once. Otherwise, each  person would have to go to court on their own. A judge has to \u201ccertify\u201d the  class action, to give it permission to go ahead. A \u201crepresentative plaintiff\u201d is  a person that represents the entire group. In this case, Mr. Babstock was the  representative plaintiff. He asked the court to certify the class action. Mr. Babstock said that Atlantic Lottery Corporation was negligent (that is,  it didn\u2019t take proper care). He said it should have warned people about the  risks of gambling on VLTs. These risks included addiction and suicidal  thoughts. Mr. Babstock said this was wrong. He said Atlantic Lottery  Corporation should have to pay the group all the profits it made. He said it  had to do this even if no one showed any harm or loss. Mr. Babstock said that  this was a \u201cwaiver of tort.\u201d He said it wasn\u2019t just a way of <em>compensating</em> harm, but that it was the <em>basis</em> for that harm. Also, Mr. Babstock said that Atlantic Lottery Corporation broke a contract with  each person who paid to play. He said it should have provided games that were  safe. Instead, the games tricked people. This was a \u201cbreach of contract.\u201d  Finally, he said Atlantic Lottery Corporation got a benefit at the group\u2019s  expense that it didn\u2019t have a legal right to. This was \u201cunjust enrichment.\u201d\r\n     Both the certification judge and Court of Appeal said the class action could  go ahead. They said \u201cwaiver of tort\u201d may be a basis someone could sue on, not  just a way of compensating for harm. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court said that none of Mr. Babstock\u2019s  arguments had a chance of success. Because of this, they said the class action  shouldn\u2019t go ahead.  All the judges agreed that \u201cwaiver of tort\u201d doesn\u2019t exist in Canadian law.  They said people could be compensated for harm through \u201cdisgorgement\u201d but that  it couldn\u2019t be the basis for harm. Disgorgement means giving up your profits  even if you didn\u2019t cause anyone harm or loss.  The majority said that disgorgement could only be used as compensation in  very specific situations, like a broken contract. It could only be used if  other ways of compensating wouldn\u2019t work. For example, if it isn\u2019t possible to  calculate the amount of the loss, or if the loss can\u2019t be expressed in money,  disgorgement might be an option. The majority said that wasn\u2019t the case here. The majority said this wasn\u2019t a case of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d because there  was a contract, as Mr. Babstock admitted. Getting a benefit from a valid  contract is a legal reason to keep that benefit. Trials, especially class action  trials, take a lot of time and money. This is why judges have to make sure a  class action has a chance of success before saying it can go ahead. They don\u2019t  look at all of the evidence to decide this. They just apply the law to decide  whether it would have a chance of success if all the claims were true."

The preliminary hearing lasted more than a year. In June 2015, T\u2019s trial was scheduled for February 2018, but it was later rescheduled to proceed in April 2017. Shortly before his trial, T brought a motion for a stay of proceedings pursuant to s.\u00a011(b) of the Charter. The trial judge ordered the stay. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge\u2019s order.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The delay between the charge and the anticipated end of trial gave rise to a breach of T\u2019s s.\u00a011(b) Charter right to be tried within a reasonable time. The delay in this case far exceed the 30\u2011month presumptive ceiling established in Jordan. The preliminary hearing was not a discrete exceptional event and its length was not outside the Crown\u2019s control. Furthermore, although most of the delay accrued before Jordan was released, the transitional exceptional circumstance does not justify the delay. This case would certainly have qualified for a stay under the previous framework set out in R. v. Morin, 1992 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, as the institutional delay of 43 months greatly surpasses the Morin guidelines of 14 to 18 months.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0person\u2019s right to trial within a reasonable time was breached because it  took over four and a half years for his trial to begin, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>\r\n   The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights  and Freedoms </em>is part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Under section 11(b), anyone  charged with a crime has the right to be tried in a reasonable time. This right  protects both people accused of crimes and society. Long criminal trials cause  suffering and frustration for everyone involved. People accused of crimes often  sit in jail while waiting for their trial. Victims and their families are left  waiting for a final decision. The public waits longer to see justice done.  The  right to be tried in a reasonable time is important. If an accused person\u2019s  trial takes too long, it can be stopped. This is called a \u201cstay of  proceedings.\u201d It means there won\u2019t be a verdict of guilty or not guilty.  In  2016, the Supreme Court of Canada decided an important appeal, <em><a href=\"https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do\">R. v. Jordan</a></em>. <em>Jordan</em> set out rules  to decide how long is too long for a criminal trial. It said that most trials  should finish either 18 or 30 months after a person is charged, depending on  the type of trial. <em>Jordan </em>tells judges to \u201cpresume\u201d (accept as true) that  anything longer is \u201cunreasonable,\u201d unless there is something unusual to justify  it. (In this context, \u201cunreasonable\u201d basically means \u201ctoo long.\u201d) If the time  taken was unreasonable, the proceedings have to be \u201cstayed.\u201d <em>Jordan</em> also set out  special rules for cases that had already started when the rules changed. These  were called \u201ctransitional\u201d cases. Mr. Thanabalasingham was charged with second-degree murder of his spouse in  2012. Before the trial was  scheduled, the Crown (the prosecution) wanted to change the charge to  first-degree murder. The preliminary hearing (a hearing that sometimes happens  before a trial for serious crimes) took over a year. There were also other  delays. The trial was set for 2017, after <em>Jordan </em>was released. But just before it was going to start, Mr.  Thanabalasingham said his right to be tried in a reasonable time had been breached.  He asked for a stay of proceedings. The trial judge agreed and ordered the stay. A majority at the Court of  Appeal agreed. The Supreme Court  unanimously agreed that Mr. Thanabalasingham\u2019s right to be tried in a  reasonable time was breached. It said the proceedings should be stayed. The delay in Mr.  Thanabalasingham\u2019s case was at least 45 months, and he spent it waiting in jail.  This was much longer than the 30-month maximum set out in <em>Jordan. </em>The Court said it was open to the Crown to change the  charge to first-degree murder. But the Crown should have been aware that this  could cause delay, and the delay would affect Mr. Thanabalasingham\u2019s right to  be tried in a reasonable time.  Most of the delay  in this case happened before <em>Jordan </em>was  decided. This was a \u201ctransitional\u201d case, but that didn\u2019t matter because it also  would have been stayed under the old rules. The Court said that, because of <em>Jordan</em>,  delays this bad probably wouldn\u2019t happen again. Before<em> Jordan</em>, many people in the justice system just accepted long delays  as normal. <em>Jordan</em> said it shouldn\u2019t  be this way. It sent the message that everyone in the justice system has a role  to play in making sure people get tried in a reasonable time. The Crown has to  be organized, share information with the defence without delay, and not waste court  time. The defence has to be ready to go ahead with the trial if the court and  the Crown are. Trial judges have to avoid delay where they can, even if it means  denying a defence request to postpone. This is because the right to a trial in  a reasonable time also benefits victims and society, too.  This case came to the  Supreme Court as an appeal \u201cas of right.\u201d This means that the person doesn\u2019t  need the Court\u2019s permission to appeal. There is an appeal as of right in  criminal cases when a Court of Appeal judge dissents (disagrees) on a point of  law, as happened here."

Section 8 of the Act amended the Canada Labour Code to protect employees from forced genetic testing or disclosure of test results, and from disciplinary action on the basis of genetic test results, and ss.\u00a09 to 11 of the Act amended the Canadian Human Rights Act to add genetic characteristics as a prohibited ground of discrimination and to create a deeming provision relating to refusal to undergo genetic testing or disclose test results.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Government of Quebec referred the constitutionality of ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act to the Quebec Court of Appeal, asking whether these provisions were ultra vires to the jurisdiction of Parliament over criminal law under s.\u00a091(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The Court of Appeal answered the reference question in the affirmative, concluding that ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act exceeded Parliament\u2019s authority over criminal law. The Canadian Coalition for Genetic Fairness, which had intervened in the Court of Appeal, appeals to the Court as of right.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Brown, Rowe and Kasirer\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the reference question answered in the negative.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Karakatsanis and Martin\u00a0JJ.: Parliament had the power to enact the Genetic Non\u2011Discrimination Act under s.\u00a091(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The pith and substance of the challenged provisions is to protect individuals\u2019 control over their detailed personal information disclosed by genetic tests, in the broad areas of contracting and the provision of goods and services, in order to address Canadians\u2019 fears that their genetic test results will be used against them and to prevent discrimination based on that information. This matter is properly classified within Parliament\u2019s power over criminal law. The provisions are supported by a criminal law purpose because they respond to a threat of harm to several overlapping public interests traditionally protected by the criminal law \u2014 autonomy, privacy, equality and public health.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To determine whether a law falls within the authority of Parliament or a provincial legislature, a court must first characterize the law and then, based on that characterization, classify the law by reference to the federal and provincial heads of power under the Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the characterization stage, a court must identify the law\u2019s pith and substance. The goal is to determine the law\u2019s true subject matter, even when it differs from its apparent or stated subject matter. The court will first look to characterize the specific provisions that are challenged, rather than the legislative scheme as a whole, to determine whether they are validly enacted. Identifying a law\u2019s pith and substance requires considering both the law\u2019s purpose and its legal and practical effects. Characterization plays a critical role in determining how a law can be classified, and thus the law\u2019s matter must be precisely defined. The focus is on the law itself and what it is really about.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To determine a law\u2019s purpose, a court looks to both intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. Intrinsic evidence includes the text of the law, and provisions that expressly set out the law\u2019s purpose, as well as the law\u2019s title and structure. Extrinsic evidence includes statements made during parliamentary proceedings and drawn from government publications. Both legal and practical effects are also relevant to identifying a law\u2019s pith and substance. Legal effects flow directly from the provisions of the statute itself, whereas practical effects flow from the application of the statute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Here, the title of the Act and the text of the prohibitions provide strong evidence that ss.\u00a01 to 7 have the purpose of combatting genetic discrimination and the fear of genetic discrimination based on the results of genetic tests by prohibiting conduct that makes individuals vulnerable to genetic discrimination in the areas of contracting and the provision of goods and services. The prohibitions created by ss.\u00a03 to 5 apply to a wide range of circumstances in which individuals might be treated adversely based on their decision about whether to undergo genetic testing. They do not target a particular activity or industry, but instead target conduct that enables genetic discrimination. Section 2 of the Act defines a \u201cgenetic test\u201d as an analysis of genetic material for a health\u2011related purpose and therefore speaks to a health\u2011related genetic test. Reading the definition this way supports the conclusion that the Act aims to combat discrimination based on genetic test results, as health\u2011related genetic tests reveal highly personal information \u2014 details that individuals might not wish to know or share and that could be used against them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The parliamentary debates provide strong evidence to support the view that the purpose of ss.\u00a01 to 7 is to combat genetic discrimination. The debates make clear that the immediate mischief that the law was intended to address was the lack of legal protection for the results of genetic testing, which left individuals vulnerable to genetic discrimination and gave rise to fear of genetic discrimination. Those concerns correspond to the title of the Act and the text of the prohibitions. Parliament\u2019s amendments to the Canada Labour Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act enacted at the same time as ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act suggest that Parliament was looking to take a coordinated approach to tackling genetic discrimination based on test results, using different tools.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Parliament\u2019s purpose in enacting the provisions in question is borne out in the provisions\u2019 effects. Starting with legal effects, ss.\u00a03 to 5 of the Act prohibit genetic testing requirements and non\u2011consensual uses of genetic test results in a broad range of circumstances. Section 7 imposes significant penalties for contravening these prohibitions. These prohibitions and penalties will also likely affect the operation of provincial and territorial legislation that requires the disclosure of genetic test results. The most direct and significant practical effect of the prohibitions is to give individuals control over the decision of whether to undergo genetic testing and over access to the results of genetic testing. The prohibitions do so by preventing genetic testing requirements from being imposed on individuals as a condition of access to goods, services and contracts, and by preventing individuals\u2019 genetic test results from being used non\u2011consensually when they seek to obtain goods and services and enter into contracts.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As to classification, s.\u00a091(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867, gives Parliament the exclusive authority to make laws in relation to the criminal law. A law will be valid criminal law if, in pith and substance, (1)\u00a0it consists of a prohibition (2)\u00a0accompanied by a penalty and (3)\u00a0backed by a criminal law purpose. Here, as there are undoubtedly prohibitions accompanied by penalties, the only issue is whether ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act are supported by a criminal law purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A law is backed by a criminal law purpose if the law, in pith and substance, represents Parliament\u2019s response to a threat of harm to a public interest traditionally protected by the criminal law, such as peace, order, security, health and morality, or to a threat of harm to another similar interest. As long as Parliament is addressing a reasoned apprehension of harm to one or more of these public interests, no degree of seriousness of harm need be proved before it can make criminal law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The essential character of the prohibitions in the Act represents Parliament\u2019s response to the risk of harm that the prohibited conduct, genetic discrimination and the fear of genetic discrimination based on genetic test results pose to several public interests traditionally protected by the criminal law: autonomy, privacy, equality and public health.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Safeguarding autonomy and privacy are established uses of the criminal law power. The conduct prohibited by ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act poses a risk of harm to two facets of autonomy and personal privacy because individuals have an interest in deciding whether or not to access the detailed genetic information revealed by genetic testing and whether or not to share their test results with others. The risk of harm to these dignity\u2011related interests in the contexts of the provision of goods and services and the conclusion of contracts is significant: the dignity, autonomy and privacy interests in individuals\u2019 detailed genetic information were understood by Parliament to be unique and strong. The potential for genetic test results to reveal highly personal information about the individual tested and the potential for abuse of genetic test results and the information they reveal are immense. Protecting fundamental moral precepts or social values is also an established criminal law purpose. Genetic discrimination threatens the fundamental social value of equality by stigmatizing and imposing adverse treatment on individuals because of their inherited, immutable genetic characteristics. In pith and substance, ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act are Parliament\u2019s response to the risk of harm that the prohibited conduct and discrimination based on genetic test results pose to autonomy, privacy and equality. Parliament has the power under s.\u00a091(27) to protect people from emerging threats to these interests. This is especially so when Parliament reasonably views the information it is safeguarding as uniquely elemental to identity, and uniquely vulnerable to abuse. Protecting these core interests is an established, proper use of the criminal law power.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Parliament can also use its criminal law power to respond to a reasoned apprehension of harm to public health. Genetic discrimination and the fear of genetic discrimination are barriers to accessing suitable, maximally effective health care, to preventing the onset of health conditions and to participating in research.\u00a0Here, in pith and substance, Parliament\u2019s action was a response to the harm that vulnerability to and fear of genetic discrimination posed to public health. Giving individuals control over access to their genetic information by prohibiting forced genetic testing and disclosure of test results and the non\u2011consensual collection, use or disclosure of genetic test results in the areas of contracting and the provision of goods and services targets the harmful fear of genetic discrimination that poses a threat to health. The Act was intended to target that fear.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0JJ.: There is agreement in the result with Justice Karakatsanis that ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act represent a valid exercise of Parliament\u2019s power over criminal law set out at s.\u00a091(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. However, there is disagreement as to the pith and substance of ss.\u00a01 to 7: it is to protect health by prohibiting conduct that undermines individuals\u2019 control over the intimate information revealed by genetic testing. By giving people control over the decision to undergo genetic testing and over the collection, disclosure and use of the results of such testing, Parliament sought to mitigate their fears that their genetic test results could be used against them in a wide variety of contexts. Parliament had ample evidence before it that this fear was causing grave harm to the health of individuals and their families, and to the public healthcare system as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The pith and substance of the impugned provisions is borne out by their purpose and effects. By enacting ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act, Parliament sought to prohibit conduct that was undermining individuals\u2019 control over the information revealed by genetic testing \u2014 conduct that was leading to health\u2011related harms. This purpose can be discerned from the structure and content of the Act, and from the parliamentary debates.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The text of the impugned provisions is a key source of intrinsic evidence of purpose. Section 2 sets out the definition of \u201cgenetic test\u201d, which is restricted to tests that are taken for health\u2011related purposes. This limited definition is crucial in order to accurately identify the purpose of the prohibitions in ss.\u00a03 to 5 of the Act, since the term \u201cgenetic test\u201d lies at the heart of each of those sections. Sections 3 to 5 give individuals control over the profoundly personal information revealed by genetic testing.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An additional form of intrinsic evidence is the title of the Act. While the short and long titles of the Act do not mirror the pith and substance of ss.\u00a01 to 7, they are nonetheless consistent with the purpose identified. This is because reducing the opportunities for genetic discrimination is one of the ways in which the provisions in issue reduce individuals\u2019 fears that their genetic information will be used against them \u2014 the barrier to pursuing genetic testing that Parliament identified and sought to remove. Thus, while preventing genetic discrimination is not the dominant purpose of the impugned provisions, it is still an important feature of the legislation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although the constitutionality of ss.\u00a08 to 10 of the Act \u2014 which amended the Canada Labour Code and the Canadian Human Rights Act \u2014 is not in issue, considering ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act alongside those sections reveals important distinctions that shed light on the purpose of the impugned provisions. Unlike ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act, the amendments in ss.\u00a08 to 10 of the Act prohibit genetic discrimination. This indicates that where Parliament\u2019s dominant objective was to prevent and prohibit genetic discrimination, it did so directly. This supports the conclusion that the dominant purpose of ss.\u00a01 to 7 is not preventing and prohibiting genetic discrimination, but rather prohibiting conduct that deprives individuals of control over their genetic test results in order to protect health.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The parliamentary record bolsters the conclusion regarding the purpose of the provisions in question. The debates and testimony are directed at the devastating health consequences that were resulting from people foregoing genetic testing out of fear that the personal health information revealed by such testing could be used against them, including in discriminatory ways. To avoid these health consequences, Parliament targeted a disincentive to genetic testing: individuals\u2019 lack of control over the personal health information revealed by genetic testing. It sought to remove this barrier by prohibiting conduct that deprived individuals of that control.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is agreement with Karakatsanis\u00a0J. that the most significant practical effect of the Act is that it gives individuals control over the decision of whether to undergo genetic testing and over access to the results of any genetic testing they choose to undergo. Sections 1 to 7 confer near complete control over the specific category of genetic information that Parliament was targeting (i.e. \u201cgenetic test\u201d results). These sections give individuals the ability to dictate the manner and extent to which their genetic test results may be collected, disclosed, and used in a wide array of contexts. This control has cascading effects that ultimately result in the protection of health. By giving individuals control over the intimate health\u2011related information revealed by genetic testing, the pertinent provisions have the effect of reducing their fears that this information will be used against them in myriad ways.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the classification stage, ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act are backed by a criminal law purpose because they are directed at suppressing a threat. Canadians choosing to forego genetic testing and thereby dying preventable deaths and suffering other preventable health\u2011related harms for no reason other than the fear that their genetic test results could be used against them is a threat to health that Parliament was constitutionally entitled to address, pursuant to s.\u00a091(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Beyond addressing the dangers of preventable disease, the impugned provisions also protect other significant facets of health, like privacy and autonomy. They accordingly represent a valid exercise of Parliament\u2019s power to enact laws in relation to the criminal law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Brown, Rowe and Kasirer\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed and the reference question answered affirmatively. Sections 1 to 7 of the Act were not enacted within the constitutional authority of Parliament over the criminal law under s.\u00a091(27)\u00a0of the Constitution Act, 1867. Rather, they fall within provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights conferred by s.\u00a092(13).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The pith and substance of ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act is to regulate contracts and the provision of goods and services, in particular contracts of insurance and employment, by prohibiting some perceived misuses of one category of genetic tests, the whole with a view to promoting the health of Canadians. Sections 1 to 7 do not satisfy the substantive component of criminal law \u2014 a valid criminal law purpose \u2014 as Parliament has neither articulated a well\u2011defined threat that it intended to target, nor did it provide any evidentiary foundation of such a threat. Instead, ss.\u00a01 to 7 substantially affect the substantive law of insurance as well as human rights and labour legislation in all provinces.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To determine whether ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act are ultra vires Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction over criminal law under s.\u00a091(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867, courts must first characterize the law, i.e. determine its pith and substance, and then classify the law and determine whether it comes within the jurisdiction of the level of government that enacted it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The exercise of characterization of impugned legislation must be as precise as possible. The true character of legislation is one which reflects its dominant purpose and effect. While other incidental features of the law may be noted, they should not dictate characterization lest classification be sent down the wrong path. The court\u2019s inquiry into pith and substance must be anchored in the text of the impugned legislation. The court must also be careful not to let form control the pith and substance inquiry; it should examine the substance of the legislation to determine what the legislature is really doing. In order to discern the purpose for which the impugned provisions were adopted, both intrinsic and extrinsic evidence must be considered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Regarding intrinsic evidence, while a statute\u2019s title can be helpful to identify its pith and substance, legislatures sometimes use titles to other ends. Here, neither the long title nor the short title of the Act can be said to reflect clearly the impugned provisions\u2019 true purpose. They do not support a conclusion that ss.\u00a01 to 7 seek to prohibit or prevent discrimination on genetic grounds. They also do not disclose Parliament\u2019s dominant purpose as focused on privacy and autonomy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As no preamble or purpose section outlines the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the law, the text of the provisions take particular significance in determining their pith and substance. The definition of \u201cgenetic test\u201d in s.\u00a02 is central to identifying the law\u2019s purpose, since the prohibitions in ss.\u00a03 to 5, the exemption in s.\u00a06, and the penalties in s. 7 all rely on this narrow, health\u2011based definition. Taken together, ss.\u00a01 to 7 aim to prohibit making the provision of goods and services or the making, continuing, or offering of specific terms or conditions of a contract conditional upon an individual undergoing or disclosing the results of genetic testing. The provisions do not prohibit the use of genetic information that may be disclosed voluntarily or obtained through other means, and they do not prohibit genetic discrimination. Sections 1 to 7 are limited in compass to a category of certain health\u2011based genetic tests.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With respect to extrinsic evidence, the amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Act and Canada Labour Code in ss.\u00a08 to 10 of the Act plainly create prohibitions against genetic discrimination which are absent from ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act. This demonstrates that the purpose of ss.\u00a01 to 7 is not to prohibit discrimination based on genetic characteristics. While ss.\u00a01 to 7 may offer, to some extent, limited control to individuals over their genetic information, they do not reduce their fears surrounding genetic testing in any real measure, since they do nothing to prohibit genetic discrimination.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Next, the legislative debates are an indicia of the legislature\u2019s intent, but they cannot stand for the Act and replace its provisions. With that said, in this case, the debates generally reveal that genetic tests were considered to be beneficial and viewed as a means of opening avenues to improved health treatment, as they allow Canadians to be aware of risks and change their behaviour. Parliament was focused on the promotion of health and on removing barriers in order to create incentives for genetic testing. The main sectors of focus in the parliamentary record were insurance and employment. On balance, the debates emphasize that ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act were included as a way to encourage Canadians to undergo genetic tests, by mitigating their fears that they would be misused, in particular in respect of insurance and employment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In light of the above, the purpose of ss.\u00a01 to 7 is not to combat discrimination based on genetic characteristics, or to control the use of private information revealed by genetic testing. Rather, their true aim is to regulate contracts, particularly contracts of insurance and employment, in order to encourage Canadians to undergo genetic tests without fear that those tests will be misused so that their health can ultimately be improved.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Immediate effects, and not indirect or speculative effects, are relevant to the validity of a law in so far as they reveal its pith and substance. Here, the dominant effects of ss.\u00a01 to 7 concern the regulation of insurance and the promotion of health rather than the protection of privacy and autonomy or the prevention of genetic discrimination. The provisions\u2019 focus is on controlling the exchange of information obtained through specific means in relation to contracts and the provision of goods and services, particularly in the insurance industry. Legally, the provisions represent a departure from the provincial law of insurance and human rights legislation in Canada; practically, the insurance market will be affected by the incomplete information insurers receive from some policy\u2011holders.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The definition of \u201cgenetic test\u201d in s.\u00a02 of the Act and the conditions placed on contracts and the provision of services in ss.\u00a03 to 5 also indicate plainly that health improvement is the dominant effect sought by ss.\u00a01 to 7 of the Act. The contested provisions seek to improve the health of Canadians through the removal of a stumbling block: the fear that genetic tests will be misused. They also bear upon privacy and autonomy. However, given the focus on a narrow category of testing and only on genetic information derived from genetic tests, and given that all information about one\u2019s health is considered private, the effects of the impugned provisions on privacy are incidental to the promotion of health.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The sole issue at the classification stage is whether Parliament was authorized to enact the impugned provisions under the criminal law power conferred by s.\u00a091(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. A law will be properly categorized as valid criminal law if three essential elements are satisfied: a prohibition, a penalty related to that prohibition, and a valid criminal law purpose. The first two elements are formal requirements while the third is substantive. This tripartite test ensures Parliament cannot use its authority improperly to invade upon provinces\u2019 areas of competence, thus ensuring the balance of federalism is respected. Here, the only issue concerns whether ss.\u00a01 to 7 are supported by the third requirement, a valid criminal law purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For the substantive criminal law purpose requirement to be met, the impugned legislation must be directed at an evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public. The concept of \u201cevil\u201d is necessary to remind Parliament that mere undesirable effects are not sufficient for legislation to have a criminal purpose. It remains conceptually useful for courts to search for an evil before the criminal law purpose requirement is satisfied. Three questions must be confronted when determining whether a law rests upon a valid criminal law purpose. First, does the impugned legislation relate to a public purpose, such as public peace, order, security, health, or morality? Second, did Parliament articulate a well\u2011defined threat to be suppressed or prevented by the impugned legislation (i.e. the evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public)? Third, is the threat \u201creal\u201d, in the sense that Parliament had a concrete basis and a reasoned apprehension of harm when enacting the impugned legislation?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Regarding the first question, there is agreement that the contested provisions can be said to relate to a public purpose: health. There is a clear dimension related to health in the dominant character of the legislation. The impugned provisions also have an impact on privacy and autonomy, but the scope of the definition of \u201cgenetic test\u201d in s.\u00a02 means that health is the primary character of the law and that privacy and autonomy are only derivatives thereof.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Regarding the second question, Parliament must clearly articulate and define the scope of the threat it seeks to suppress, i.e. it must articulate a precise threat with ascertainable contours. This requirement is particularly important in relation to matters that have provincial aspects, such as health, in order to preserve the balance of federal and provincial powers. It is not sufficient for the impugned provisions\u2019 pith and substance to merely relate to health; it must also involve suppressing an evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public. Here, there is no defined public health evil or threat to be suppressed. The objective of the legislation is to foster or promote beneficial health practices \u2014 it seeks to encourage Canadians to undergo genetic testing, which may then result in better health outcomes. This, in and of itself, will simply not suffice at this stage. The mere fact that genetic testing is a novel development does not, on its own, bring it within the purview of the criminal law. Moreover, a gap in provincial legislations across the country is not a well\u2011defined threat that justifies recourse to the criminal law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Regarding the third question, while Parliament undoubtedly has wide latitude to determine the nature and degree of harm to which it wishes to respond, it cannot act where there is no adequate evidentiary foundation of harm. Had there been a well\u2011defined threat to health in this case, there still would have been no evidentiary foundation of harm. Rather, Parliament seeks to improve the health of Canadians by making them aware of underlying conditions they may have and does so by attempting to encourage the use of genetic tests. The contested provisions therefore do not satisfy the substantive component of criminal law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: RJR\u2011MacDonald Inc. v.

        "citation": "2020 SCC 17",
        "summary": "<strong>Parliament had the power to make it a crime to force someone to get  genetic testing or reveal their test results, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Genetic  testing looks at genetic material (like DNA) from a person\u2019s body. It can find  out personal information, like what diseases a person might have, develop, or  pass on to their children. Parliament  passed the <em>Genetic Non-Discrimination Act </em>to make rules on genetic testing related to diseases. It made it a crime to  force someone to get that testing, or share their results, to sign a contract  or buy something. For example, insurance companies couldn\u2019t make people get  tested to get life insurance coverage. Parliament also made it a crime to  collect, use, or share the results of someone\u2019s genetic tests without their permission.  Anyone breaking the rules could be fined up to $1 million or put in jail for up  to five years, or both.  The  Government of Quebec didn\u2019t think Parliament had the power to make these rules.  That\u2019s because Canada\u2019s Constitution gives different powers to the provinces  and the federal government. For example, Parliament (the branch of the federal  government responsible for making laws) has the power to make criminal laws. Provincial  legislatures (which make laws for each province) can make laws about property  and civil rights. This includes laws about buying and selling goods and  services. If a provincial legislature or Parliament passes a law that only the  other has the power to make, the law will be unconstitutional. The  Government of Quebec asked the Quebec Court of Appeal to decide if the rules  were unconstitutional. The Attorney General of Quebec said the rules were unconstitutional  because they were really about making rules for insurance and employment contracts and  promoting health, not about making criminal law. The Attorney  General of Canada agreed.  The  Attorneys General of Quebec and Canada both argued that the rules were  unconstitutional. To make sure it heard the other side of the argument, the  Court of Appeal appointed an \u201c<em>amicus  curiae</em>\u201d to argue that they were constitutional. \u201c<em>Amicus curiae</em>\u201d is a Latin term meaning \u201cfriend of the court.\u201d It is  an independent lawyer a court asks to take part in a case. The <em>amicus curiae</em> said the rules were  meant to protect the security and dignity of vulnerable people, and to prevent  outcomes that would be morally wrong. He said this fell under Parliament\u2019s  power to make criminal law. The  Court of Appeal agreed with the Attorneys General and said the rules were  unconstitutional. It said Parliament didn\u2019t have the power to make the rules  because they were really about things under provincial power. The Court of  Appeal said the rules didn\u2019t have anything to do with criminal law. The  Canadian Coalition for Genetic Fairness was an \u201cintervener\u201d when the Court of  Appeal heard the case. Interveners are people or groups who get the court\u2019s  permission to give their point of view. They make arguments in writing. Some  are also allowed to make short arguments in person at the hearing. They help  judges see different angles and make better decisions. The Coalition said the  rules fell under Parliament\u2019s power to make criminal law because they protected  people\u2019s health, privacy, and equality. The Coalition appealed the Court of  Appeal\u2019s decision to the Supreme Court. Most  of the judges at the Supreme Court said the rules were constitutional. Five  judges agreed that Parliament had the power to create the rules. They said the rules were  criminal law because they prohibited something and created punishments for  breaking the rules, and because the rules were trying to prevent certain kinds  of harm. They said this is what criminal law is meant to do. These  judges disagreed over what the rules were really about and the kinds of harm  they were meant to prevent. This case came to the Supreme Court as an appeal from a provincial  \u201creference.\u201d References are questions that governments ask courts for their  opinion on. (In law, an \u201copinion\u201d isn\u2019t just a belief or point of view. It is a  formal explanation of the law.) The federal government can ask the Supreme  Court for a legal opinion on an issue. Provincial and territorial governments  can ask their Courts of Appeal for opinions, and these opinions can be appealed  to the Supreme Court. Appeals in references from Courts of Appeal don\u2019t need  leave (permission) to be heard by the Supreme Court. This case began as a  reference to the Quebec Court of Appeal by the Quebec government."

To become a driver for Uber, H had to accept the terms of Uber\u2019s standard form services agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, H was required to resolve any dispute with Uber through mediation and arbitration in the Netherlands. The mediation and arbitration process requires up-front administrative and filing fees of US$14,500, plus legal fees and other costs of participation. The fees represent most of H\u2019s annual income.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In 2017, H started a class proceeding against Uber in Ontario for violations of employment standards legislation. Uber brought a motion to stay the class proceeding in favour of arbitration in the Netherlands, relying on the arbitration clause in its services agreement with H. H argued that the arbitration clause was unconscionable and therefore invalid. The motion judge stayed the proceeding, holding that the arbitration agreement\u2019s validity had to be referred to arbitration in the Netherlands, in accordance with the principle that arbitrators are competent to determine their own jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal allowed H\u2019s appeal and set aside the motion judge\u2019s order. It concluded that H\u2019s objections to the arbitration clause did not need to be referred to an arbitrator and could be dealt with by a court in Ontario. It also found the arbitration clause to be unconscionable, based on the inequality of bargaining power between the parties and the improvident cost of arbitration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Because of the extensive fees for initiating arbitration, there is a real prospect that if the matter is sent to be heard by an arbitrator, H\u2019s challenge to the validity of the arbitration agreement may never be resolved. The validity of the arbitration agreement must therefore be resolved by the court. H\u2019s claim that the arbitration clause is unconscionable requires considering two elements: whether there is an inequality of bargaining power and whether there is a resulting improvident bargain. There was inequality of bargaining power between Uber and H because the arbitration clause was part of an unnegotiated standard form contract, there was a significant gulf in sophistication between the parties, and a person in H\u2019s position could not be expected to appreciate the financial and legal implications of the arbitration clause. The arbitration clause is improvident because the arbitration process requires US$14,500 in up-front administrative fees. As a result, the arbitration clause is unconscionable and therefore invalid.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The parties disagreed on the arbitration statute applicable to their dispute. Uber argued that the Ontario International Commercial Arbitration Act applies and H argued that the Ontario Arbitration Act applies. Whether the International Commercial Arbitration Act governs depends on whether the arbitration agreement is international and commercial. That the agreement here is international is not in dispute. Labour or employment disputes are not the type that the International Commercial Arbitration Act is intended to govern. The Arbitration Act therefore governs.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court set out a framework in Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs, 2007 SCC 34 (CanLII), [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801, and Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc., 2011 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2011] 1 S.C.R. 531, for when a court should decide if an arbitrator has jurisdiction over a dispute instead of referring that question to the arbitrator. That framework applies to Ontario\u2019s Arbitration Act. According to that framework, a court should refer all challenges to an arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction to the arbitrator unless they raise pure questions of law, or questions of mixed fact and law that require only superficial consideration of the evidence in the record \u2014 that is, if the necessary legal conclusions can be drawn from facts that are either evident on the face of the record or undisputed by the parties.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to the two exceptions to arbitral referral in Dell and Seidel, a court may depart from the general rule of arbitral referral if an issue of accessibility arises. The assumption made in Dell is that if the court does not decide an issue, then the arbitrator will. Dell did not contemplate a scenario wherein the matter would never be resolved if the stay were granted. Such a situation raises obvious practical problems of access to justice that the Ontario legislature could not have intended when giving courts the power to refuse a stay. One way in which the validity of an arbitration agreement may not be determined is when an arbitration agreement is fundamentally too costly or otherwise inaccessible. This could occur because the fees to begin arbitration are significant relative to the plaintiff\u2019s claim or because the plaintiff cannot reasonably reach the physical location of the arbitration. Another example might be a foreign choice of law clause that circumvents mandatory local policy, such as a clause that would prevent an arbitrator from giving effect to the protections in Ontario employment law. In such situations, staying the action in favour of arbitration would be tantamount to denying relief for all claims made under the agreement. The arbitration agreement would, in effect, be insulated from meaningful challenge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Accordingly, a court should not refer a challenge to an arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction to the arbitrator if there is a real prospect that doing so would result in the challenge never being resolved. To determine whether only a court can resolve the challenge to arbitral jurisdiction, the court must first determine whether, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, there is a genuine challenge to arbitral jurisdiction. Second, the court must determine from the supporting evidence whether there is a real prospect that, if the stay is granted, the challenge may never be resolved by the arbitrator. While this second question requires some limited assessment of the evidence, this assessment must not devolve into a mini-trial. The only question at this stage is whether there is a real prospect, in the circumstances, that the arbitrator may never decide the merits of the jurisdictional challenge. If there is a real prospect that referring a challenge to an arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction to the arbitrator would result in the challenge never being resolved, a court may resolve whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction over the dispute and, in so doing, may thoroughly analyze the issues and record. The Court, therefore, should resolve the arguments H has raised.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Unconscionability is an equitable doctrine that is used to set aside unfair agreements that resulted from an inequality of bargaining power. When the traditional assumptions underlying contract enforcement lose their justificatory authority, this doctrine provides relief from improvident contracts. The purpose of unconscionability is the protection of those who are vulnerable in the contracting process from loss or improvidence in the bargain that was made.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Unconscionability requires both an inequality of bargaining power and a resulting improvident bargain. An inequality of bargaining power exists when one party cannot adequately protect its own interests in the contracting process. A bargain is improvident if it unduly advantages the stronger party or unduly disadvantages the more vulnerable. Improvidence is measured at the time the contract is formed and must be assessed contextually. The question is whether the potential for undue advantage or disadvantage created by the inequality of bargaining power has been realized. Although one party knowingly taking advantage of another\u2019s vulnerability may provide strong evidence of inequality of bargaining power, it is not essential for a finding of unconscionability. Unconscionability does not require that the transaction was grossly unfair, that the imbalance of bargaining power was overwhelming, or that the stronger party intended to take advantage of a vulnerable party.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The doctrine of unconscionability has particular implications for standard form contracts. The potential for such contracts to create an inequality of bargaining power is clear, as is the potential to enhance the advantage of the stronger party at the expense of the more vulnerable one, particularly through choice of law, forum selection, and arbitration clauses that violate a party\u2019s reasonable expectations by depriving them of remedies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying the unconscionability doctrine in this case, there was clearly inequality of bargaining power between Uber and H. The arbitration agreement was part of a standard form contract and a person in H\u2019s position could not be expected to understand that the arbitration clause imposed a US$14,500 hurdle to relief. The improvidence of the arbitration clause is also clear because these fees are close to H\u2019s annual income and are disproportionate to the size of an arbitration award that could reasonably have been foreseen when the contract was entered into.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Respect for arbitration is based on its being a cost-effective and efficient method of resolving disputes. When arbitration is realistically unattainable, it amounts to no dispute resolution mechanism at all. In this case, the arbitration clause is the only way H is permitted to vindicate his rights under the contract, but arbitration is out of reach for him and other drivers in his position. His contractual rights are, as a result, illusory.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Based on both the financial and logistic disadvantages faced by H in his ability to protect his bargaining interests and on the unfair terms that resulted, the arbitration clause is unconscionable and therefore invalid.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown\u00a0J.: There is agreement with the majority that the appeal should be dismissed. There is also agreement with the majority that the mandatory arbitration requirement is invalid, but there is disagreement with respect to the majority\u2019s reliance upon the doctrine of unconscionability to reach this conclusion. Contractual stipulations that foreclose access to legally determined dispute resolution \u2014 as the arbitration agreement in this case does \u2014 are unenforceable not because they are unconscionable, but because they undermine the rule of law by denying access to justice. They are therefore contrary to public policy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority vastly expands the scope of the doctrine of unconscionability\u2019s application. This is unnecessary, because the law already contains settled legal principles outside the doctrine of unconscionability which operate to prevent contracting parties from insulating their disputes from independent adjudication. It is also undesirable, because it drastically expands the doctrine\u2019s reach without providing any meaningful guidance as to its application. Charting such a course will serve only to compound the uncertainty that already plagues the doctrine, and to introduce uncertainty to the enforcement of contracts generally.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The public policy doctrine is fundamental to Canadian contract law and provides grounds for setting aside specific types of contractual provisions including those that harm the integrity of the justice system. This head of public policy applies when a provision penalizes or prohibits one party from enforcing the terms of their agreement, which serves to uphold the rule of law. At a minimum, the rule of law guarantees Canadian citizens and residents a stable, predictable and ordered society in which to conduct their affairs. Such a guarantee is meaningless without access to an independent judiciary that can vindicate legal rights. There is therefore no good reason to distinguish between a clause that expressly blocks access to a legally determined resolution and one that has the ultimate effect of doing so. While public policy does not require access to a court of law in all circumstances, any means of dispute resolution that serves as a final resort for contracting parties must be just. Arbitration is an acceptable alternative to civil litigation because it can provide a resolution according to law, but where a clause expressly provides for arbitration while simultaneously having the effect of precluding it, the considerations which promote curial respect for arbitration dissolve. This is where the public policy principle preventing an ouster of court jurisdiction operates.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In evaluating a clause that limits access to a legally determined dispute resolution, the court\u2019s task is to decide whether the limitation is reasonable as between the parties, or instead causes undue hardship. A court must show due respect for arbitration agreements, particularly in the commercial setting. It will be the rare arbitration agreement that imposes undue hardship and acts as an effective bar to adjudication. Public policy should not be used as a device to set aside arbitration agreements that are proportionate in the context of the parties\u2019 relationship and the possibility for timely resolution but that one party simply regrets in hindsight.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To decide whether a limitation on dispute resolution imposes undue hardship, the first factor to consider is the nature of disputes that are likely to arise under the parties\u2019 agreement. Where the cost to pursue a claim is disproportionate to the quantum of likely disputes arising from the agreement, this suggests the possibility of undue hardship. Courts should also consider the relative bargaining positions of the parties. However, to be clear, an imbalance in bargaining power is not required to find that a provision bars access to dispute resolution. Finally, it may be relevant to consider whether the parties have attempted to tailor the limit on dispute resolution. Here, the arbitration agreement effectively bars any claim that H might have against Uber and is disproportionate in the context of the parties\u2019 relationship. This form of limitation on legally determined dispute resolution undermines the rule of law and is contrary to public policy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While arbitrators should typically rule on their own jurisdiction, an arbitrator cannot reasonably be tasked with determining whether an arbitration agreement, by its terms or effects, bars access to that very arbitrator. It therefore falls to courts to do so. While the question of whether an arbitration agreement bars access to dispute resolution is one of mixed fact and law, and may require more than a superficial review of the record, this limited exception to the general rule of referral \u2014 where a clause effectively prevents access to arbitration \u2014 is necessary to preserve the public legitimacy of the law in general, and arbitration in particular.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a stay of proceedings should be granted on the condition that Uber advances the funds needed to initiate the arbitration proceedings. One of the most important liberties prized by a free people is the liberty to bind oneself by consensual agreement. Party autonomy and freedom of contract inform the policy choices embodied in the Arbitration Act, 1991 and the International Commercial Arbitration Act (\u201cInternational Act\u201d), one of which is that the parties to a valid arbitration agreement should abide by their agreement. The parties to the agreement in this case have bound themselves to settle any disputes arising under it through arbitration. The Arbitration Act, the International Act, the Court\u2019s jurisprudence and compelling considerations of public policy require the Court to respect the parties\u2019 commitment to submit disputes to arbitration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The International Act, not the Arbitration Act, governs Uber\u2019s motion for a stay. However, neither the analysis that follows nor the ultimate conclusions would change if the Arbitration Act applied. The International Act applies to arbitrations which are international and commercial. The arbitration in this case is international because the parties have their residences or places of business in different countries, so the applicability of the International Act turns on whether the parties\u2019 relationship is properly characterized as being commercial in nature. A court should approach this issue by analyzing the nature of the parties\u2019 relationship on the basis of a superficial review of the record, as opposed to characterizing the nature of the dispute solely on the basis of the pleadings. Focussing the analysis on the nature of the relationship created by the transaction is consistent with the weight of the Canadian jurisprudence on the scope of the UNCITRAL Model Law. In this case, a superficial review of the documentary evidence reveals that the underlying transaction between Uber and H is commercial in nature. The service agreement expressly states that it does not create an employment relationship. Instead, it is a software licensing agreement, a type of transaction identified as coming within the scope of the UNCITRAL Model Law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A motion for a stay and for referral to arbitration may be dismissed if the arbitration agreement is found to be null and void under the UNCITRAL Model Law or invalid under the Arbitration Act. The validity of the arbitration clause in this case should be determined by an arbitral tribunal. There is a general rule that in any case involving an arbitration clause, a challenge to the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction must be resolved first by the arbitrator. This is the rule of systematic referral. A court may depart from the rule of systematic referral only if the jurisdictional challenge is based solely on a question of law or a question of mixed law and fact that requires only a superficial review of the documentary evidence, is not a delaying tactic, and will not unduly impair the conduct of the arbitration proceeding. A review is not superficial if the court is required to review testimonial evidence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 H\u2019s arguments challenging the validity of the arbitration clause require more than a superficial review of the documentary evidence: H\u2019s arguments are dependent upon testimonial evidence regarding his financial position, his personal characteristics, the circumstances of the formation of the contract and the amount that would likely be at issue in a dispute to which the arbitration clause applies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court should not create an exception to the rule of systematic referral. An exception that would apply where an arbitration agreement is deemed to be too costly or otherwise inaccessible is inappropriate for several reasons. First, the rule of systematic referral is the product of an exercise of statutory interpretation, so any exception to it must also be a product of statutory interpretation. The policy considerations relied on by the majority cannot be used to make the Arbitration Act or the UNCITRAL Model Law say something they do not say. Second, the Court has already declined to allow courts discretion to fully entertain a challenge to an arbitration agreement\u2019s validity. Third, it has also decided that delaying tactics should be counteracted by confining the scope of review on a motion for a stay to the documentary evidence. Fourth, the ordinary operation of the rule of systematic referral under an agreement governed by a foreign choice of law clause is not a loophole, and there is no basis in the Arbitration Act or in the UNCITRAL Model Law for distinguishing between arbitration agreements which include a foreign choice of law clause from those which do not. Fifth, there is no basis for concluding that the mandatory fees for the administration of mediation and arbitration proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce\u2019s (\u201cICC\u201d) Arbitration Rules, Mediation Rules (\u201cICC Rules\u201d) are significant relative to H\u2019s claim, given that the amount of the claim is unknown and no explanation is given by the majority for concluding that H will be unable to reach the physical location of the arbitration. Furthermore, there is disagreement with Brown J. that the rule of systematic referral would, absent an exception, infringe, or even engage, s. 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Legislation which facilitates the enforcement of agreements to submit disputes to arbitration neither abolishes the superior courts nor removes any part of their core or inherent jurisdiction. Courts retain an oversight role throughout the arbitration process and afterwards as proceedings commenced in contravention of an arbitration agreement are stayed, not dismissed, and as the stay may set conditions specifying how the parties are to proceed to arbitration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The issues as to the doctrine of unconscionability, the Employment Standards Act, 2000 (\u201cESA\u201d), and public policy raise questions of mixed law and fact which cannot be decided on the basis of a superficial review of that documentary evidence and, if the Court could consider the testimonial evidence in the record, it is insufficient to support a finding that the arbitration clause is unconscionable, inconsistent with the ESA, or contrary to public policy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is agreement with Brown J. with respect to the unconscionability doctrine in the general law of contracts. The unconscionability doctrine applies where there is (1)\u00a0a significant inequality of bargaining power stemming from a weakness or vulnerability, (2)\u00a0a resulting improvident bargain, and where (3)\u00a0the stronger party knows of the weaker party\u2019s vulnerability. The key question in relation to the significant inequality of bargaining power is whether the weaker party had a degree of vulnerability that had the potential to materially affect their ability, through autonomous, rational decision making, to protect their own interests, thereby undermining the premise of freedom of contract. The majority\u2019s claim that vulnerability in the contracting process may arise from provisions in standard form contracts which are dense or difficult to read or understand sets the threshold so low as to be both practically meaningless and open to abuse. This sweeping restriction on arbitration clauses in standard form contracts would be best left to the legislature, especially since the sharing economy \u2014 a vital and growing sector of Canada\u2019s economy which depends on standard form contracts that are agreed to electronically \u2014 could be stifled if a reduced threshold for inequality of bargaining power is adopted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 H\u2019s claim that the bargain was improvident rests on three propositions: (1)\u00a0the place of arbitration clause requires him to travel to Amsterdam at his own expense, (2)\u00a0the choice of law clause excludes the application of the ESA, and (3)\u00a0the selection of the ICC Rules entails the payment of fees which he alleges are disproportionately high. As to the place of arbitration clause, the place of arbitration is a legal concept which denotes the parties\u2019 selection of a particular jurisdiction whose arbitration law governs proceedings, and under whose law the arbitral award is made. There is no obligation to actually conduct the arbitration at the place of arbitration. As to the choice of law clause, arguments directed at the alleged unfairness of having the service agreement governed by foreign law are analytically distinct from those concerning alleged unfairness arising from the arbitration clause itself. The separability doctrine holds that arbitration clauses embedded in contracts should be treated as independent agreements that are ancillary or collateral to the underlying contract. The result is that the alleged invalidity of the choice of law clause on the basis that it is unconscionable does not affect the validity of the arbitration clause. As to the selection of the ICC Rules, arbitration agreements involve a mutuality of exchange, so mandatory fees which apply to disputes initiated by either party would make pursuing a claim for a small amount just as uneconomic for Uber as for H. Therefore, if unfairness results from the imposition of the ICC fees on hypothetical claims for small amounts, the unfairness is mutual. In any event, the actual amount of H\u2019s claim is unknown, and establishing that a dispute over a small amount is likely would require the production and review of testimonial evidence. The proportionality of the ICC fees to H\u2019s ability to finance a larger claim must be measured as of the time the contract is formed, and the Court has no evidence regarding his financial position at that time.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The evidence does not support a finding that Uber had constructive knowledge of H\u2019s alleged peculiar vulnerability. It would have been impossible for Uber to be aware of H\u2019s specific income and education level when he decided to become an Uber driver, or that he intended to use the Driver App as his primary source of income. In any event, such questions would require the production and review of testimonial evidence, which would lead the Court to stray impermissibly beyond the documentary record.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The arbitration clause is not invalid under the ESA. The ability to file a complaint under the ESA is not an employment standard since the relevant section does not require an employer to do\u00a0or not do anything. As such, the arbitration clause does not unlawfully contract out of an employment standard. In any event, a court cannot determine that an arbitration agreement is invalid pursuant to the ESA without first finding that the parties involved are an employer and an employee. Whether H is an employee within the meaning of the ESA is a complex question of mixed law and fact which cannot be decided on the basis of a superficial review of the documentary evidence. The rule of systematic referral applies, and the parties should be referred to arbitration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The arbitration clause is also not invalid under public policy. The Court should not create a new common law rule that contractual provisions which have the effect of prohibiting access to dispute resolution are contrary to public policy. The Arbitration Act and the International Act are strong statements of public policy which favour enforcing arbitration agreements. When considering whether, or how, to refashion old common law doctrines regarding arbitration, the Court should continue to embrace a more modern approach to arbitration law which views arbitration as an autonomous, self-contained, self-sufficient process pursuant to which the parties agree to have their disputes resolved by an arbitrator, not by the courts. The Court should not seek to roll back the tide of history by breathing new life into authorities which are irreconcilable with the modern approach to arbitration. Therefore, doctrines based on the notion that only superior courts are capable of granting remedies for legal disputes should no longer be applied. Additionally, the comparative suitability of litigation, arbitration and other methods of dispute resolution for various classes of persons in various circumstances is a complex, polycentric policy decision that involves a host of different interests, objectives and solutions. Such questions do not fall to be answered by the courts, as they are instead matters for the elected policy-makers who sit in the legislature.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The pro\u2011arbitration stance taken by legislatures across Canada and by the Court supports a generous approach to remedial options which will facilitate the arbitration process. Two such options include ordering a conditional stay of proceedings and applying the doctrine of severance. Although it will usually be unnecessary for a court to order a conditional stay, it may be appropriate to do so to ensure procedural fairness in the arbitration process. Courts should be careful not to impose conditions which impinge on the decision-making jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal, but a condition which facilitates the arbitration process can protect the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by ensuring that the parties are able to proceed with the arbitration. In addition, compelling policy considerations support a generous application of the doctrine of severance in cases in which the parties have clearly indicated an intent to settle any disputes through arbitration but in which some aspects of their arbitration agreement have been found to be unenforceable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In light of the evidence that H cannot afford the ICC fees, Uber should be required to advance the filing fees to enable him to initiate arbitration proceedings. In addition, if the arbitration clause were unconscionable or contrary to public policy, the selection of the ICC Rules and the place of arbitration clause could be severed. The majority does not explain why they have chosen not to address severance in their reasons. Defeating the parties\u2019 commitment to submit disputes to arbitration based on a hypothetical case would be commercially impractical and, given that the dispute actually before the Court concerns a proposed class proceeding for CAN$400,000,000 and that the amount of H\u2019s individual claim is as yet unknown, absurd. Approaching the enforceability of arbitration agreements in this fashion compromises the certainty upon which commercial entities rely in structuring their operations. The arbitration clause should be upheld.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: Peterson Farms Inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>An\u00a0agreement saying an UberEats driver had to go to arbitration instead  of suing in Ontario was so unfair it was invalid, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>Uber  was a company that created software (phone apps) to arrange ride-sharing and  food delivery.  Mr.  Heller was a driver for UberEats, the food delivery service. To become a  driver, Mr. Heller had to click to agree to a long, standard contract. He  didn\u2019t have any power to negotiate any of it. His only option was to accept or  reject it. The contract said any legal problem Mr. Heller had with the company had  to be resolved by the International Chamber of Commerce in the Netherlands, not  a court. This part of a contract is called an \u201carbitration clause.\u201d The  agreement meant Mr. Heller wasn\u2019t allowed to sue the company in court. When  Mr. Heller clicked on the contract, he didn\u2019t know how much arbitration would  cost. The contract didn\u2019t say anything about this. He later found out that it  would cost him almost $15,000 (U.S. dollars) just to start the process. This  didn\u2019t count legal fees, travel costs, or lost wages. Mr. Heller earned between  $400 and $600 (Canadian dollars) each week. This was before he paid taxes and  expenses. Starting the arbitration would cost most of his yearly income. In  2017, Mr. Heller said Uber was breaking the terms of the contract and Ontario  employment law. He decided to sue Uber. His lawsuit was about whether he and other  drivers were employees of the company. Uber  said Mr. Heller couldn\u2019t sue in Ontario courts. This was because he had agreed  to go to arbitration. Mr.  Heller said the arbitration clause was \u201cunconscionable\u201d (so unfair it was  invalid). The  motion judge stayed (stopped) the lawsuit. He agreed with Uber that the  arbitrator should decide if the arbitration clause was unfair. The Court of  Appeal, on the other hand, agreed with Mr. Heller that Ontario courts should  decide whether the arbitration agreement was valid. The Court of Appeal decided  the agreement was invalid. The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court agreed that courts should decide if the  arbitration clause was unfair. They also agreed that it was invalid. The  majority said Ontario\u2019s <em>Arbitration Act </em>applied  in this situation. The Act said a lawsuit in court shouldn\u2019t go forward in  court if both sides had agreed to arbitration, but there were exceptions. One  exception was if the agreement was invalid.  In  this case, the majority said upholding the arbitration agreement would deny Mr.  Heller access to a remedy (that is, a way to get compensated for harm or  wrongdoing). There would be no way he could even have his arguments heard  without paying most of his yearly income and likely having to go to the  Netherlands. He didn\u2019t know any of this when he agreed to the contract. The  majority said this made the arbitration agreement unconscionable, so it was  invalid. Courts  use unconscionability to protect weaker parties in contracts with stronger  parties. When one party has no choice, or doesn\u2019t understand what they are  signing, their bargaining power is weaker. Courts can set aside the agreement  if a stronger party gets too much of an advantage (even if it doesn\u2019t mean to).  Because it found the arbitration  clause to be invalid for unconscionability, the majority didn\u2019t need to decide  if it was also invalid for avoiding mandatory employment laws. The result meant  Mr. Heller could continue his lawsuit in Ontario courts. Arbitration  agreements are becoming more common in many contracts. The Supreme Court  previously dealt with Ontario arbitration laws in <em><a href=\"../2019/37722-eng.aspx\">TELUS  Communications Inc. v. Wellman</a></em>.\r\n  "

(dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the forced surrender of the immovable ordered and the bank declared the owner of the immovable. The bank exercised its hypothecary remedy against the individuals in a timely manner, while the personal claim against the debtor was not prescribed and all of the applicable conditions were met. The filing of the motion for forced surrender and taking in payment interrupted prescription for the purposes of exercising the hypothecary remedy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A hypothec is a real right made liable for the performance of an obligation. It gives the creditor a right to follow, allowing the creditor to follow the property in whatever hands it lies. The creditor can therefore exercise a hypothecary remedy against the person who has become the owner of the charged property. The fact that a hypothec is an accessory right means that it is valid only as long as the obligation whose performance it secures subsists. The prescriptive period for a hypothecary action follows that which applies to a personal action, since the accessory follows the principal. Three\u2011year extinctive prescription applies in the case of a hypothec that secures a personal obligation, pursuant to art.\u00a02925\u00a0C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The rights and remedies arising from a hypothec are in addition to the personal rights and remedies that the law confers on the creditor. It is a cardinal principle of the law of hypothecs that the creditor, and only the creditor, has the choice of remedy. Not only can the creditor choose the type of hypothecary remedy he or she wishes to pursue, but the creditor can also choose whether or not to exercise a hypothecary or a personal remedy. The creditor can also combine the two remedies if he or she wishes without worrying about lis\u00a0pendens or res\u00a0judicata, because their objects are different.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Hypothecary rights are exercised directly against the person who has the hypothecated property in his or her hands. It is possible that that person will not be the person with whom the hypothecary creditor contracted in the first place. For example, a hypothecary creditor who takes property in full payment of a claim and becomes its owner takes the property subject to all hypothecs published before his or her hypothec was published. In such circumstances, that creditor therefore becomes hypothecarily obligated toward a creditor holding an earlier ranking hypothec, and the latter\u2019s hypothecary rights must then be exercised against the former.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Civil Code requires certain conditions to be met and preliminary measures to be taken in order for a creditor to exercise a hypothecary remedy. The conditions set out in art.\u00a02748\u00a0para.\u00a02 C.C.Q. must be met: the debtor must be in default and the claim must be liquid and due. In addition, art.\u00a02749\u00a0C.C.Q. provides that the creditor may not exercise his or her hypothecary rights before the period determined in art.\u00a02758 C.C.Q. for surrender of the property has expired. The creditor must therefore serve and register a prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary remedy that specifies the period provided for by law for the surrender of the hypothecated property. Only after that period has expired can the creditor exercise a hypothecary remedy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A court must look to the time when the creditor exercised his or her hypothecary remedy, i.e. the time when the creditor\u2019s motion was filed and served \u2014 not the time of the judgment \u2014 to determine whether the conditions of art.\u00a02748 C.C.Q. are met and whether the remedy was therefore exercised in a timely manner. Like a personal remedy, a hypothecary remedy must be exercised while the principal obligation is not prescribed. The registration of a prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary right does not represent the exercise of the hypothecary right itself. It is not the prior notice, but rather the motion for forced surrender and taking in payment, that constitutes a judicial application capable of interrupting prescription within the meaning of art.\u00a02892 para.\u00a01 C.C.Q. Once filed, the motion interrupts prescription until a judgment is rendered, and the interruption has effect with regard to all the parties with respect to any right arising from the same source, as stated in art.\u00a02896 para.\u00a02 C.C.Q. Both the hypothecary remedy and the personal remedy arise from the same source \u2014 the secured obligation \u2014 and thus meet the criterion in art.\u00a02896 para.\u00a02 for finding that prescription has been interrupted. A hypothecary creditor who chooses to pursue a hypothecary remedy is therefore not required to bring a personal action in order to interrupt prescription. Provided that the conditions set out in arts.\u00a02748 and 2749 C.C.Q. are met, the exercise of a hypothecary remedy interrupts prescription on a hypothecary basis. These principles take on added relevance where a hypothecary remedy is exercised against a person who is not the debtor of the principal obligation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the individuals took the immovable in payment and became its owners subject to the bank\u2019s first hypothec. They became bound propter\u00a0rem because the hypothecated property was in their hands. Once the period specified in the prior notice of the exercise of a hypothecary right expired, the bank exercised its hypothecary remedy by filing a motion for forced surrender and taking in payment against the owners of the immovable, the individuals, who were its hypothecary debtors. On that date, the debtor of the secured obligation was in default, the personal claim secured by the hypothec was liquid and due and the 60\u2011day period had expired. All of the conditions for exercising the hypothecary remedy were met. The bank therefore exercised its hypothecary remedy in a timely manner. By filing its motion and serving it on the hypothecary debtors, the bank interrupted prescription in relation to them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 St. Lawrence Cement Inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court issued written reasons in a case  decided from the bench in November 2019.</strong>\r\n   In 2009, Ms. Macht got a loan for $306,000 from TD  Bank. The loan was secured by a hypothec on her house. (A hypothec in Quebec\u2019s  civil-law system is like a mortgage in common-law provinces and territories.)  She also got a loan of about $94,000 from the Youngs. It was also secured by a  second hypothec. The Youngs knew about the first hypothec with the bank.  Ms. Macht stopped paying her loans. If a hypothec  doesn\u2019t get paid, the person owed money can force the property to be sold or  can take it themselves. The Youngs asked the Quebec court to force Ms. Macht to  give up the house in order to pay the debt she owed them. In 2011, the court  declared them the owners. But the bank still had its hypothec on the house. Shortly after, the bank asked the court to be allowed  to take the house from Ms. Macht because its hypothec wasn\u2019t paid. But the  Youngs owned it now. They paid the bank what Ms. Macht owed in missed payments,  even though they didn\u2019t agree they had to.  The bank asked the court to force  the Youngs to give up the house in order to pay Ms. Macht\u2019s debt. The trial  judge agreed with the bank, and said it was the owner. The Court of Appeal  disagreed. It noted that the bank only took action against the Youngs, who  owned the house at the time. The bank didn\u2019t take action against Ms. Macht, who  personally owed it the money. The Court of Appeal said the hypothec didn\u2019t  exist anymore. It had expired even before the trial judge made his decision.  The bank should have taken action against Ms. Macht to stop it from expiring.  But the time had expired, so it was too late for it to do this and try to get  its money back from the Youngs.  The Supreme Court decided this case \u201cfrom the bench\u201d at  the end of the hearing on November 7, 2019.  When a case is decided \u201cfrom the bench,\u201d it means an  oral decision is given right away. The parties don\u2019t have to wait for a written  decision, which takes some time (an average of about five months in 2019).  About a third of decisions were given from the bench in 2019. When a case is decided from the bench, the Court will  sometimes give a written explanation (reasons) later. This can be done to make  things more clear. In most cases, though, there won\u2019t be written reasons. This  doesn\u2019t mean there is no explanation. When giving the oral decision, the Court  might give a short explanation, or say something like, \u201cwe allow (or dismiss)  this appeal substantially for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.\u201d That  means it\u2019s relying on the reasons of the lower court, which basically got it right. In this case, the majority of judges agreed completely  with the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision stayed in effect. That  meant the Youngs got to keep the house and the bank couldn\u2019t claim anything on  it. Canada has two major  legal traditions, common law (based on English law) and civil law (based on the  French civil code). Quebec is the only province that applies civil law. It can  be found in the province\u2019s <em>Civil  Code</em>, which applies to most non-criminal legal issues. Some concepts \u2013 like  mortgages and hypothecs \u2013 are similar under common law and civil law. But they  are often based on different principles and can have different rules. Having  two main legal traditions helps make Canada unique. In fact, the Supreme Court  of Canada is the only bilingual (two languages) and bijural (two legal systems)  supreme court in the world. "

Z twice failed to present himself at his door when police attended, and was charged under s.\u00a0145(3) of the Criminal Code with two counts of breaching his curfew and two counts of breaching his condition to answer the door. Z led evidence that he was in his bedroom where it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to hear the doorbell or someone knocking on the door. The trial judge acquitted Z on the alleged curfew violations but convicted Z on the two counts of failing to appear at the door. A summary conviction appeal judge dismissed Z\u2019s appeal, concluding that objective mens rea is sufficient for a conviction under s.\u00a0145(3) and that Z\u2019s behaviour was a marked departure from what a reasonable person would do to ensure they complied with their bail conditions. The Court of Appeal dismissed Z\u2019s appeal. A majority of the court concluded that s.\u00a0145(3) created a duty-based offence that only requires an objective mens rea.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed, Z\u2019s convictions quashed and a new trial ordered on the two counts of failing to attend at the door.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Under s.\u00a0145(3) of the Criminal Code, the Crown is required to prove subjective mens rea. The Crown must establish that the accused breached a condition of an undertaking, recognizance or order knowingly or recklessly. Accordingly, a new trial is required on the two counts charging Z with failing to attend at the door of his residence, in light of the lower courts\u2019 error of applying an objective standard of fault.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The default form of bail for most crimes is release on an undertaking to attend trial, without any other conditions. Bail conditions can be imposed, but only if they are clearly articulated, minimal in number, necessary, reasonable, the least onerous in the circumstances, and sufficiently linked to the accused\u2019s risks regarding the statutory grounds for detention in s.\u00a0515(10): securing the accused\u2019s attendance in court, ensuring the protection or safety of the public, or maintaining confidence in the administration of justice. The setting of bail conditions must be consistent with the presumption of innocence and the right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause under s.\u00a011(e) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In addition, s.\u00a0515 of the Criminal Code codifies the ladder principle, which requires that the form of release and the conditions of release imposed on an accused be no more onerous than necessary to address the risks listed in s.\u00a0515(10). Only conditions specifically tailored to the individual circumstances of the accused can meet the required criteria. Bail conditions are intended to be particularized standards of behavior designed to curtail statutorily identified risks posed by a particular person and are to be imposed with restraint. Restraint is required because bail conditions limit the liberty of someone who is presumed innocent of the underlying offence and, through the offence in s.\u00a0145(3), create new sources of potential criminal liability personal to that individual accused.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Section 145(3) of the Criminal Code creates a hybrid offence that applies to breaches of conditions imposed on an accused by a court order when the accused person is released prior to trial, while awaiting sentencing, or during an appeal. It is a crime against the administration of justice and carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment. Accused persons may therefore be subject to imprisonment under s.\u00a0145(3) if they breach a condition of their bail, even if they are never ultimately convicted of any crimes for which they were initially charged. In many cases, an accused person faces criminal sanctions for conduct which, but for the stipulated bail condition, would be a lawful exercise of personal freedom. Accordingly, the fault element under s.\u00a0145(3) has far-reaching implications for civil liberties and the fair and efficient functioning of bail in this country, and there is a direct link between what conditions may be imposed in a bail order and Parliament\u2019s intent in criminalizing their breach under s.\u00a0145(3).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Determining the mens rea of s.\u00a0145(3) involves discerning the fault standard intended by Parliament. The presumption is that Parliament intends crimes to have a subjective fault element unless there is a clear legislative intention to overturn the presumption. If the offence in the Criminal Code is ambiguous as to the mens rea, then the presumption has not been displaced. The text and context of s.\u00a0145(3) suggest that Parliament intended for subjective fault to apply. The wording in s.\u00a0145(3) is neutral insofar as it does not show a clear intention on the part of Parliament with regard to either the subjective or objective mens rea. The absence of express words indicating a subjective intent cannot on its own displace the presumption of subjective mens rea. Furthermore, nothing establishes a clear intention to create a duty-based offence which calls for an objective mens rea. Duty-based offences are directed at legal duties very different from the obligation to comply with the conditions of a judicial order. And, unlike these duty-based offences, bail conditions do not impose a minimum uniform standard of conduct having regard to societal interests rather than personal standards of conduct. Parliament legislated a bail system based upon an individualized process and the bail order is expected to list personalized and precise standards of behaviour. As a result, there is no need to resort to a uniform societal standard to make sense of what standard of care is expected of an accused in fulfilling their bail conditions and no need to consider what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to understand the obligation imposed by s. 145(3). In addition, the highly individualized nature of bail conditions excludes the possibility of a uniform societal standard of conduct applicable to all potential failure to comply offences. Bail conditions and the risks they address also vary dramatically among individuals on release, so it is not intelligible to refer to the concepts of a \u201cmarked\u201d or \u201cmere\u201d departure from the standard of a reasonable person. The offence under s.\u00a0145(3) is not comparable to other objective fault offences, and reasonable bail cannot be compared to a regulated activity that is entered into voluntarily. Further, the offence of failure to comply with bail conditions is similar to the offence of breach of probation for which a subjective mens rea is required.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A subjective fault requirement is consistent with the penalties and consequences which flow from conviction under s.\u00a0145(3). A conviction has profound implications for the liberty interests of the offender, including imprisonment even if the offender is acquitted of the underlying charge or further conditions imposed as part of a sentence. A conviction under s.\u00a0145(3) creates or adds to that person\u2019s criminal record. Being charged under s.\u00a0145(3) also places a reverse onus on accused persons to show why they should be released on bail again. Previous convictions under s.\u00a0145(3) inform bail hearings for future offences and may lead to the denial of bail or more stringent bail conditions for future unrelated offences. Breach charges often accumulate quickly, leading to a vicious cycle of increasingly numerous and onerous conditions, more breach charges and eventually pre-trial detention. These serious consequences presuppose that the person knowingly, rather than inadvertently, breached their bail condition.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Parliament\u2019s intention to require subjective fault is further demonstrated by the distinct purpose of s. 145(3), being to punish and deter those who knowingly or recklessly breach their bail conditions. Parliament did not intend for criminal sanctions to be the primary means of managing any risks or concerns associated with individuals released with bail conditions. Such risks or concerns are to be managed through the setting of conditions that are minimal, reasonable, necessary, least onerous, and sufficiently linked to the accused\u2019s risk; variations to those conditions when necessary through bail reviews and vacating bail orders; and bail revocation when bail conditions are breached. Charges under s.\u00a0145(3) are not, and should not be, the principal means of mitigating risk. Bail review is the primary way to challenge or change bail conditions. Bail revocation under s.\u00a0524 of the Criminal Code and criminal charges under s.\u00a0145(3) work together to promote compliance with conditions of bail, but they serve distinct and different legislative purposes. Section\u00a0524 fulfills a risk management role; s.\u00a0145(3) exists to punish and deter. Section 145(3) is a means of last resort when other risk management tools have not served their purposes. Specific deterrence has little or no effect if an accused does not know they were doing anything wrong. An accused must know what standard of behaviour to meet and that their conduct is failing to meet that standard in order to be deterred from engaging in prohibited conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The requirement that bail conditions must be tailored to the accused points to a subjective mens rea so that the individual characteristics of the accused will be considered when bail is set and if bail is breached. Requiring a subjective mens rea reinforces, mirrors, and respects the individualized approach mandated for the imposition of bail conditions. In practice, the number of unnecessary and unreasonable bail conditions, and the rising number of breach charges, indicates insufficient individualization of bail conditions. The majority of bail orders include numerous conditions of release which often do not clearly address an individual accused\u2019s risks. A culture of risk aversion contributes to courts applying excessive conditions. The expeditious nature of bail hearings generates a culture of consent which aggravates the lack of restraint in imposing excessive bail conditions and encourages accused persons to agree to onerous terms of release rather than run the risk of detention. Onerous conditions disproportionately impact vulnerable and marginalized populations, including those living in poverty or with addictions or mental illnesses, and Indigenous people. The presence of too many unnecessary, excessive and onerous conditions provides legislative context for finding no clear intention of Parliament to displace the presumed subjective fault standard for s.\u00a0145(3) and illustrates the need for restraint and careful review of bail conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The principle of restraint and the ladder principle require anyone proposing bail conditions to consider what risks might arise if the accused is released without conditions. Only conditions which target the accused\u2019s risk in relation to flight, public protection and safety, or maintaining confidence in the administration of justice are necessary. A bail condition must attenuate a risk that would otherwise prevent release without that condition. Conditions cannot be imposed for gratuitous or punitive purposes and should not be behaviourally-based. They must be sufficiently linked to the defined statutory risks, as narrowly defined as possible to meet their objective, and reasonable. They will only be reasonable if they realistically can and will be met by the accused. They cannot contravene federal or provincial legislation or the Charter, and must be clear, minimally intrusive, and proportionate to any specific risk posed by the accused. The setting of bail is an individualized process and there is no place for standard, routine, or boilerplate conditions, whether bail is contested or the product of consent. Some specific non-enumerated conditions are commonly included in release orders, but must be scrutinized to ensure that each condition is necessary, reasonable, least onerous and sufficiently linked to a risk in s.\u00a0515(10). All persons involved in the bail system are required to act with restraint and to carefully review bail conditions they propose or impose. The Crown, defence, and the court all have obligations to respect the principles of restraint and review. Ultimately, the obligation to ensure appropriate bail orders lies with the judicial official. These obligations carry over to consent releases. Judicial officials should not routinely second-guess joint proposals by counsel, however, they have the discretion to reject overbroad proposals and must act with caution when reviewing and approving consent release orders.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Subjective mens rea under s.\u00a0145(3) can be satisfied where the Crown proves: (1)\u00a0the accused had knowledge of the conditions of their bail order or were wilfully blind to those conditions; and (2)\u00a0either the accused knowingly failed to act according to the bail conditions or they were wilfully blind to those circumstances and failed to comply despite that knowledge, or the accused recklessly failed to act according to the conditions, meaning they perceived a substantial and unjustified risk that their conduct would likely fail to comply with the conditions and persisted in this conduct. Genuinely forgetting a condition could be a mistake of fact and would negate mens rea. The accused need not have knowledge of the legal consequences or scope of their condition, but they must know that they are bound by the condition. Knowledge in the second component of the mens rea means that the accused must be aware of, or be wilfully blind to, the factual circumstances requiring them to act or refrain from acting. The second component of the mens rea can also be met by showing that the accused was reckless. Knowledge of risk is key to recklessness \u2014 the accused must know of their bail conditions and the risk of factual circumstances arising that would require them to act (or refrain from acting) to comply with their bail conditions. Recklessness is a subjective standard and the accused must be aware that their conduct created a substantial risk of non-compliance with their bail conditions and aware of any factors that contributed to that risk being unjustified.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, a new trial should be ordered in light of the error in law by the courts below in applying an objective rather than a subjective standard of fault for s.\u00a0145(3). This is not a case where the curative proviso under s.\u00a0686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code applies \u2014 identifying the wrong fault standard is not a harmless or trivial error. A subjective mens rea would have required the trial judge to consider Z\u2019s state of mind, which clearly could have had an impact on the verdict. The evidence is not so overwhelming that a conviction is inevitable. A new trial is therefore needed to address whether Z knowingly or recklessly breached his conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>To be found guilty of breaching bail conditions, people have to know  they are breaching them (or know they are seriously risking it), the Supreme  Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   When someone is charged with a  crime, they are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court. This is why someone  who is arrested should normally be freed on bail before their trial. A court  can put conditions on bail for limited reasons, including to protect the public.  Conditions are rules the person has to follow. Breaching a  bail condition is a crime. This is true even if the person isn\u2019t found guilty  of the original charges. It\u2019s true even if the act that makes up the breach (for  example, staying out too late) isn\u2019t a crime itself and no one gets hurt. Mr. Zora was charged with drug crimes  and was out on bail. One of his bail conditions was that he had a curfew (he  had to be home at certain times). Another was that he had to come to the door  within five minutes if someone came to check that he was home. Two times, Mr.  Zora didn\u2019t come to the door when police checked. He was charged for breaching  his bail conditions. Mr. Zora said he was home both times but didn\u2019t hear the  door. The trial judge found him guilty of  not coming to the door. The summary conviction appeal judge and the Court of  Appeal agreed. This case was about the nature of  the crime of breaching a bail condition. To be guilty of a crime, a  person must\u00a0<em>do</em>\u00a0something that is against the (criminal) law.  This is called the \u201c<em>actus reus</em>,\u201d which means \u201cguilty act\u201d in Latin. (In  this case, the <em>actus reus</em> was not  coming to the door.) But something has to make the person\u00a0<em>responsible</em>\u00a0for  what they\u2019ve done. This is called the \u201c<em>mens rea</em>,\u201d which means \u201cguilty  mind\u201d in Latin. For many crimes, a person is responsible if they intended,  knew, or were aware of what might happen. This is \u201csubjective\u201d <em>mens rea</em>. But for some crimes, a person  can be responsible even if they don\u2019t mean to do anything wrong. This is \u201cobjective\u201d <em>mens rea</em>. That is, courts look at whether  the accused person did something very different from what an ordinary, sensible  person would have done in the same situation. Courts across Canada disagreed  about the <em>mens rea</em> for breaching a  bail condition.  The Supreme Court of Canada was unanimous. All the judges said the <em>mens rea </em>for breaching a bail condition  was subjective. Courts had to look at what the person actually knew or was  aware might happen when deciding if they were guilty of a breach. Criminal law is based on the principle that a morally innocent person shouldn\u2019t  be punished. That\u2019s why courts assume the <em>mens  rea </em>for crimes is subjective<em>.</em> The  exception is if Parliament says something different in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Parliament didn\u2019t say that here.  The Court said Parliament meant for the <em>mens  rea </em>for breaching bail conditions to be subjective. Being found guilty of a  breach can have serious effects on a person\u2019s life. They can go to jail for up  to two years for each breach and are more likely to be denied bail in the  future. This especially affects vulnerable and marginalized people who can get  many charges because they can\u2019t follow their conditions. Charging people for  breaching conditions isn\u2019t the only way to prevent them from doing this. The crime  exists to stop people who know they are breaching their conditions, or know  they are risking it, and do so anyways. Parliament meant for courts to look at  the person\u2019s situation when the breach happened.  The Court also said how bail conditions should be set. Normally there shouldn\u2019t  be any conditions on bail. If there are conditions, there should be as few as  possible. They have to be clear, necessary, and match the risk of the  situation. Courts should be careful not to set bail conditions that a person can\u2019t  meet.  In Mr. Zora\u2019s case, the Court said there should be a new trial. The new  trial would decide if he knew he was breaching his bail conditions, or creating  a serious risk he would breach them. This was the first  time the Supreme Court of Canada looked at the <em>mens rea</em> for breach of bail conditions. The Court recently looked  at bail and pre-trial detention in <em><a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2019/37869-eng.aspx\">R. v. Myers</a></em>. "

The alleged infringements can be divided into two categories: the first involved systemic claims (among other things, the fact that the CSF had not received an annual grant for building maintenance, the formula used to set priorities for capital projects, a lack of funding for school transportation and a lack of space for cultural activities), and the second involved claims for the purpose of obtaining new schools or improvements to existing schools in 17 communities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge set out an approach to be taken in order to situate the number of students in a given community on the sliding scale, which serves to determine the level of services to which an official language minority is entitled and is used to decide whether the minority is entitled to a homogeneous school, to educational facilities shared with the majority or to another appropriate solution. Applying her analytical framework, the trial judge issued declarations concerning the right to educational facilities in several communities. She then outlined the test that is to be applied in determining the quality of the educational experience that must be provided to official language minorities. She concluded with respect to several communities that the children of rights holders are entitled to facilities that provide them with an educational experience that is substantively equivalent to the experience of the majority, but she found with respect to other communities that the numbers of children of rights holders warranted not a substantively equivalent educational experience, but one that is proportionately equivalent to the educational experience provided to the majority. Discussing the principles of interpretation that must inform the analysis of infringements of s.\u00a023 under s.\u00a01 of the Charter, the trial judge then concluded that several infringements of the rights holders\u2019 language rights were justified under s.\u00a01. Finally, she concluded that awarding damages would not be appropriate for most of the claims of the linguistic minority representatives, but she found that the freeze on funding for school transportation at a time when the number of students of the linguistic minority was rising constituted an infringement of s.\u00a023, and she awarded $6 million in damages to the CSF. On the other hand, the trial judge declined to award damages to the CSF in compensation for its having been denied the Annual Facilities Grant Rural Factor.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The linguistic minority representatives appealed the trial judge\u2019s judgment, arguing that she had made several errors of law in analyzing the alleged infringements of s.\u00a023 of the Charter, including in the approach she had taken in order to situate a given number of students on the sliding scale and in the test she had applied in order to assess the quality of the educational experience provided to official language minorities; in reviewing the justification of the infringements under s.\u00a01; and in granting the remedies being sought. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but allowed the province\u2019s cross appeal and set aside the award of damages for inadequate funding of school transportation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Brown and Rowe JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: The courts below adopted an inordinately narrow interpretation of s.\u00a023 of the Charter and its role in the Canadian constitutional order. Section 23 has a remedial purpose related to promoting the development of official language minority communities and changing the status quo. In accordance with an interpretation of that section that takes its remedial purpose fully into account, and in light of the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact, the appeal should be allowed in part.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In Mahe v. Alberta, 1990 CanLII 133 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 342, the Court explained that situating a given number of students on the sliding scale requires that the analysis focus on (1) the services appropriate, in pedagogical terms, for the number of students involved; and (2) the cost of the contemplated services. However, the Court did not provide an exhaustive definition of these two factors. The approach to be taken in order to situate a given number of students on the sliding scale must therefore be clarified.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the second step, the court must take a comparative approach in order to determine whether the school contemplated by the minority is appropriate from the standpoint of pedagogy and cost. The approach is intended for the determination of whether the number of students in question from the official language minority is comparable to the numbers of students in the majority language schools. The burden is on the claimants from the official language minority to identify comparator schools. It is necessary to be flexible in determining what constitutes a comparable number. Comparable does not mean identical. If the court finds that the number of minority language students is comparable to the numbers of students in local majority language schools, there is no doubt that the number of minority language students falls at the high end of the sliding scale and that the minority is entitled to a homogeneous school. In other cases, a province-wide comparative exercise is required to ensure fair treatment across the province.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The existence of majority language schools that serve a given number of students, regardless of where they are located in the province, supports a presumption that the province considers maintaining those schools to be appropriate from the standpoint of pedagogy and cost, and thus that it is appropriate to create a comparably sized homogeneous school for the minority. The province can rebut this presumption by showing on a balance of probabilities either that the majority language schools used as comparators are not appropriate for that purpose or that the school proposed by the minority is not appropriate from the standpoint of pedagogy or cost.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the third step, the level of services to be provided to the official language minority must be determined. If the court has found at the second step that the number of students is comparable and that the presumption has not been rebutted, that number is at the high end of the sliding scale and the minority is therefore entitled to have its children receive instruction in a homogeneous school. If the result of the province\u2011wide comparison is that there is no comparable number, the number of minority language students falls below the high end of the sliding scale, that is, at the low end or in the middle. A minority at the lower levels of the scale can qualify for a range of services varying from a few hours of classes in its language to the use and control of premises in a school shared with the majority. In such a situation, the court must show deference to the level of services proposed by the minority language school board in determining whether that level of services is appropriate from the standpoint of pedagogy and cost.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For the communities of North Victoria, Whistler, Chilliwack and Pemberton, the trial judge decided on a local basis for comparison even though the comparison must take schools located across the province into account. The appropriate comparative approach requires that the number of students who will eventually avail themselves of the service \u2014 98 for North Victoria, 85 for Whistler, 60 for Chilliwack and 55 for Pemberton \u2014 be compared with the numbers of students attending the small schools located across the province that were retained by the trial judge and for which there is no evidence in the record capable of rebutting the presumption that it is appropriate to create a school of comparable size for the minority. Enrolment in these majority language schools ranges from 66 to 73 students. The relevant numbers for North Victoria, Whistler and Chilliwack are comparable to the numbers of students attending these comparator majority language schools. These communities are therefore entitled to homogeneous schools. As for Pemberton, it is difficult to compare the number of students in question there with the numbers of students at the majority language schools located elsewhere in the province that were retained by the trial judge. Given that the available evidence is limited and that additional submissions might be necessary, the question of the level of services warranted by this number of students should therefore be remanded to the court of original jurisdiction for reconsideration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The test used to assess the quality of the educational experience provided to official language minorities does not vary with the number of minority language students. Section 23 gives an official language minority the right to instruction that is equivalent in quality to the instruction provided to the majority. Children of s.\u00a023 rights holders must therefore receive an educational experience that is substantively equivalent to the experience provided to the majority, regardless of the size of the school or program in question. The essentials of the approach from Association des parents de l\u2019\u00e9cole Rose\u2011des\u2011vents v. British Columbia (Education), 2015 SCC 21, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 139, which allows for a holistic assessment of the quality of the educational experience provided to the official language minority, do not need to be adapted in a situation in which the schools of the official language minority are small, aside from the fact that a reasonable parent must take into account the inherent characteristics of attendance at a small school. Accordingly, where a minority language school is not comparable in size to nearby majority language schools, what must be considered is whether reasonable parents who are aware of the inherent characteristics of small schools would be deterred from sending their children to a school of the official language minority because the educational experience there is meaningfully inferior to the experience at available majority language schools. Even where the number of students falls at the low end of the sliding scale, such that there is a right to instruction alone, the factors listed in Rose\u2011des\u2011vents must be taken into account in assessing the quality of the educational experience from a program of instruction; the right to instruction cannot be entirely severed from the overall educational experience. In the case of a heterogeneous school or a program of instruction, the analysis based on the substantive equivalence test serves to determine whether the instruction over which the minority has control and the facilities to which it has access are of sufficient quality.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In light of these comments, the approach adopted by the courts below in this case where the number of students was not comparable to the numbers of majority language students must be rejected, because that approach was based on what was called a proportionality test rather than on that of substantive equivalence. The trial judge\u2019s conclusions are therefore varied to reflect the conclusion that all rights holders whose children attend CSF schools or participate in its programs are entitled to an educational experience that is substantively equivalent to the experience at nearby majority language schools.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For the schools in the communities of Nelson, Chilliwack and Mission, the quality of the educational experience must be assessed from the perspective of a reasonable parent who is aware of the inherent characteristics of a small school. When the substantive equivalence test and the proper approach are applied for the CSF school in Nelson, the trial judge\u2019s finding that the educational experience of the minority language students is equivalent to the experience provided to the majority language students should be accepted. As for the CSF school in Chilliwack, a balancing of the advantages and disadvantages shows that the quality of the educational experience provided there is meaningfully inferior to that of the experience at the majority\u2019s schools. This means that the children of rights holders in Chilliwack do not receive an educational experience of the quality guaranteed to them by s.\u00a023 of the Charter. In the case of the CSF school in Mission, the situation is concerning, but the evidence that was adduced is insufficient for the purpose of making the holistic assessment required by the test of a reasonable parent who is aware of the inherent characteristics of a small school. The question of the quality of the educational experience and the impact of the Facility Condition Driver on this situation must therefore be remanded to the court of original jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fact that the province compels the CSF to prioritize the capital projects the latter submits, even in response to infringements of s.\u00a023, does not infringe the right of management guaranteed by s.\u00a023 of the Charter. How much time the province has to remedy the infringements of s.\u00a023 will have to be addressed on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis, but the infringements must nonetheless be remedied in a timely fashion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where an infringement of s.\u00a023 is established, a court must take the approach established in R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, while applying a particularly stringent justification standard. This very stringent standard is appropriate for three reasons. First, the framers of the Charter imposed positive obligations on the provincial and territorial governments in s.\u00a023, and these obligations must be fulfilled in a timely fashion in order to avoid the likelihood of assimilation and of a loss of rights. Second, s.\u00a023 is not subject to the notwithstanding clause in s.\u00a033 of the Charter, which reflects the importance attached to this right and the intention of the framers that intrusions on it be strictly circumscribed. Third, s.\u00a023 has an internal limit, the numbers warrant requirement, according to which the exercise of the right for which the section provides will be warranted if there are a sufficient number of students. In adopting this limit, the framers sought to take account of practical considerations, including cost and pedagogical needs, related to the number of students who might benefit from the right in question. Where the government concerned advances a financial argument to justify an infringement of s.\u00a023, the s.\u00a01 analysis will then in some respects duplicate the numbers warrant analysis that has already been completed. For an infringement of s.\u00a023 to be justified under s.\u00a01, it must not therefore be supported by considerations that have already been taken into account at the numbers warrant stage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the second stage of the approach established in Oakes \u2014 proportionality between the effects of the measure that is responsible for limiting the right and the objective that has been identified as important \u2014, it is necessary to take assimilation fully into account as a deleterious effect when the right under s.\u00a023 is infringed. The purpose of s.\u00a023 is not only to ensure the sustainability of the country\u2019s linguistic communities, but also to make it possible for those communities to develop in their own language and culture in the present. In this sense, even though the evidence shows that s.\u00a023 has not been able to counter or slow the process of assimilation, the fact remains that citizens from official language minority communities still have a right to achieve fulfillment in their own language in everyday life. In addition, a court must bear in mind that s.\u00a023 has an individual dimension and that minority language schools have a definite impact on the likelihood of assimilation of French speakers who attend them. Finally, cost savings linked to an infringement of s.\u00a023 cannot be considered a relevant factor in the balancing of the salutary and deleterious effects of the infringing measure.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, the courts below erred in ruling that the fair and rational allocation of limited public funds is a pressing and substantial objective that can justify infringements of s.\u00a023 in accordance with the Oakes test. The fair and rational allocation of limited public funds represents the daily business of government. The mission of a government is to manage a limited budget in order to address needs that are, for their part, unlimited. There is accordingly no pressing and substantial objective here that can justify an infringement of rights and freedoms in this case. The justification for the infringements therefore fails at the first stage of the analysis. Without a valid objective, the province cannot justify the infringements of s.\u00a023.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As a result, the infringement of s.\u00a023 found by the trial judge on the basis that the CSF had been denied $1.1\u00a0million by not having benefited from the Annual Facilities Grant Rural Factor is not justified, and the CSF is entitled to damages in that amount.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The limited government immunity from damages awards does not apply to decisions made in accordance with government policies that are found to be contrary to s.\u00a023. Although damages can be awarded against a government where they are an appropriate and just remedy in the circumstances, it may avoid such an award by raising concerns for effective governance, including where a law has been declared to be invalid after the act that caused the infringement. However, the government does not have immunity in relation to government policies that infringe fundamental rights. The possibility of damages being awarded in respect of Charter\u2011infringing government policies in this context is unlikely to have a chilling effect on government actions and thereby undermine their effectiveness; on the contrary, it helps ensure that government actions are respectful of fundamental rights. While it is appropriate to give the government immunity in respect of a well\u2011defined instrument such as a law, the same is not true in respect of undefined instruments with unclear limits, such as government policies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, because the freeze on school transportation funding was a government policy, the trial judge\u2019s order awarding damages for the inadequate funding of school transportation should be restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting in part): Unlike most Charter rights, s.\u00a023, which confers the right to minority language education, imposes positive duties on governments to act. It is preventative, remedial, and unifying, and must be interpreted in light of these objectives. The framing of s.\u00a023 as a positive right is particularly significant. The right expresses its own internal limit, the \u201cnumbers warrant\u201d criterion, which reflects a carefully struck constitutional bargain between the federal and provincial governments. This numerical threshold ensures that the positive obligations on the provinces are reasonable and reflect what is practical while at the same time providing the appropriate level of services for minority language students. Both the text of s.\u00a023 and its particular nature require courts to give the provision its proper and intended effect, in line with settled jurisprudence. Striking the right balance recognizes that it is possible to breathe life into the s.\u00a023 right, albeit with caution.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The analysis to be applied to s.\u00a023 claims follows two main steps. First, a court must determine the level of services warranted by the number of rights holders in a given area (the \u201cnumbers warrant\u201d analysis). This entails ascertaining the relevant number of rights holders, then placing that number on a sliding scale of entitlement in order to decide what level of service is warranted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The relevant figure for the purposes of this analysis is the number of persons who will eventually take advantage of the contemplated program or facility. This figure is an estimate that will fall somewhere between the known demand for the service and the total number of persons who potentially could take advantage of the service. The goal is not to establish how many students will take advantage of the facility or program when it is first launched, but rather to forecast how many will do so in the future.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 After determining the relevant number, the court must then establish, using the sliding scale approach, what level of services is warranted, pedagogically, given the number of minority language students, and the cost of such service. The right to minority language education is internally limited to the services that can be justified, pedagogically and financially, by the number of children of rights holders. To trigger the obligation to publicly fund minority language education, a claimant must demonstrate that this limit is accounted for. The burden of proving all elements of the s.\u00a023 breach rests on the person asserting the breach. This ensures that s.\u00a023\u2019s own internal qualifications and method of internal balancing are fulfilled. The operation of the sliding scale gives effect to this internal limit because the content of the right expands as the numbers increase, thereby ensuring that rights holders receive a level of service that is appropriate to their number. Proper placement on the sliding scale is critical. It ensures that governments will deploy the resources necessary to meet their obligations under s.\u00a023, and that the internal limit to those obligations is accounted for. Furthermore, just as a failure to give effect to the rights conferred by s.\u00a023 can be detrimental to the flourishing of minority languages, improper placement on the scale can also be harmful to minority students. There would be no point, for instance, in having a school for only ten students in an urban centre, as it would deprive the students of the numerous benefits of studying and interacting in larger numbers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To determine the level of service that is warranted for a given group of rights holders, a claimant must first demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the level of service claimed is pedagogically appropriate for the number of children. To assess the pedagogical appropriateness of a given level of service, the existence of majority schools or programs built for similar numbers elsewhere in the province can be a relevant indicator that a homogeneous school or program would be pedagogically appropriate for the number of rights holders\u2019 children. However, the existence of a small school anywhere in the province is not determinative. Courts need to first assess whether the school or program is a relevant comparator, taking into account factors such as whether it is in a rural or urban area, whether it serves a remote or isolated community, whether the school continues to operate at the capacity for which it was built, and whether the school operates as a result of supplementary private funding. As a general rule, because s.\u00a023 calls for publicly funded minority language education, an appropriate comparator would also need to be publicly funded. This approach entails considering the context of schools used in the comparison to ensure that the circumstances are relevant and comparable to the proposed school or service. The assessment of relevant comparators must take into account that there need not be perfect correspondence of pedagogical appropriateness between the minority and the majority language education. At this stage of the analysis, there is no principled reason to constrain comparator schools locally, and the views of school boards are entitled to a measure of deference with respect to particular services among the range of potentially available services that are most pedagogically appropriate below the upper end of the sliding scale, consistent with the principle that minority language groups should have control over those aspects of education which pertain to their language and culture.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 If successful in showing pedagogical appropriateness, a presumption then arises to the effect that the level of service is also appropriate as to cost. The burden in turn shifts to the province or territory to rebut the presumption, which is suitable given that it is better placed to adduce such evidence. Throughout, the burden for demonstrating pedagogical appropriateness rests with the claimant, who has the onus of establishing a Charter breach. This approach is consistent with the fact that cost appropriateness is usually subsumed within the assessment of pedagogical appropriateness. It is particularly important to circumscribe the entitlement within the s.\u00a023 analysis given the limited application of s.\u00a01 of the Charter in cases of s.\u00a023 infringements. Considerations of pedagogy and cost are thus seriously taken into account within the s.\u00a023 analysis itself. Though cost is not usually a factor in determining whether an individual is to be accorded a right under the Charter, in the specific case of s.\u00a023, such a consideration is mandated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying a province\u2011wide presumption of pedagogical and cost appropriateness at the \u201cnumbers warrant\u201d stage, as a majority of the Court suggests, affects key elements of the s.\u00a023 analysis and leads to a compression of the middle of the sliding scale. Considerations of pedagogy and cost are effectively withdrawn, regardless of the particular context that may explain the continued relevance of a school elsewhere in the province. A right to a homogeneous school, which is the highest level of entitlement on the scale, is immediately presumed, thereby shifting the claimant\u2019s burden to the province from the outset. How a province could successfully rebut this presumption is unclear, transforming the presumption effectively into a rule. This operates as a fast track to the upper end of the sliding scale, eliminating any middle level. Such an approach is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s past refusal to adopt a view of s.\u00a023 as encompassing only two rights, that is, one with respect to instruction and one with respect to facilities. This view was rejected by the Court in favour of the sliding scale approach, which allows for a progressive increase in entitlement as the number of rights holders increases.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 At the second step of the s.\u00a023 analysis, courts must determine whether the quality of services granted to the rights holders is substantively equivalent to the quality of services provided to local majority language students (the \u201csubstantive equivalence\u201d analysis). A purposive interpretation of s.\u00a023 requires that substantive equivalence apply throughout the sliding scale. This approach recognizes that the quality of official minority language education cannot be meaningfully inferior to that of the majority. The use of a \u201cproportionality\u201d norm at this stage of the s.\u00a023 analysis would mean that the minority\u2019s relative weight to that of the majority will be taken into account not once but twice, each time diminishing the quality and level of the minority\u2019s constitutional entitlement. As such, it must be rejected.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A purposive interpretation of s.\u00a023 emphasizes its true purpose of redressing past injustices and providing the official language minority with equal access to high quality education in its own language, in circumstances where community development will be enhanced. A purposive interpretation of s.\u00a023 may be achieved only by applying substantive equivalence as the appropriate norm at the second stage of the s.\u00a023 analysis, irrespective of where a community falls on the sliding scale. The rationale for applying substantive equivalence is further rooted in the broader principle of protecting minority rights, a fundamental underlying principle to the Constitution.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The \u201csubstantive equivalence\u201d analysis under s.\u00a023 seeks to evaluate the quality of services provided to minority rights holders. The analysis is circumscribed by comparing the quality of the level of services that is warranted for the number of minority language students with the quality of that same level of services provided to neighbouring schools. The analysis must remain global and contextual and must be mindful that instruction cannot be dissociated from the facilities in which it is provided. Multiple factors may be considered, including the quality of instruction, teachers, physical facilities, educational outcomes, extracurricular activities, and travel time. The relevant factors, as dictated by the circumstances of each case, are considered together in assessing whether the overall educational experience is inferior in a way that could discourage rights holders from enrolling their children in a minority language school. These considerations are applied from the standpoint of the reasonable rights holder parent, comparing the minority language school with the local majority schools that represent realistic alternatives for them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The effect of combining a legal presumption of pedagogical and cost appropriateness at the first stage of the s.\u00a023 analysis, as suggested by a majority of the Court, with recourse to substantive equivalence as the proper comparative norm at the second stage, leads to a strained application of substantive equality. This combination will result in the establishment of very small minority language schools being compared to local majority language schools, which are typically larger and equipped with more or better services, thereby lifting local minority groups to the top of the sliding scale. Such an approach departs from the notion of a sliding scale of warranted services that gradually increases based on the number of children that may benefit from them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The analysis under s.\u00a01 of the Charter provides that the rights and freedoms in the Charter are subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. To demonstrably justify a reasonable limit, the state must show that the objective of the proposed measure is pressing and substantial, and that the means by which the measure is achieved are proportionate. The assessment of the objective is a threshold requirement, analyzed without considering the limit\u2019s scope, the means employed or the effects of the measure. The proportionality requirement will be satisfied where the means are rationally connected to the ends; the measure minimally impairs the right at issue; and the salutary effects of the measure outweigh its deleterious effects.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The fact that s.\u00a023 is internally limited has an important effect on how the justification analysis should proceed. Rather than affecting the stringency of the s.\u00a01 analysis, as suggested by a majority of the Court, the internal limit of s.\u00a023 results in s.\u00a01 having less to do in practice. If done properly, the analysis under s.\u00a023 will account for many of the considerations that would normally arise under s.\u00a01. Applying cost considerations under the s.\u00a023 analysis does not mean that they will never be relevant under s.\u00a01. Although such instances may be rare in the context of a s.\u00a023 Charter right, costs may be a pressing and substantial objective under s.\u00a01 where they are linked to other public policy considerations. However, a measure whose sole purpose is financial, and which infringes Charter rights, can never be justified under s.\u00a01. Decisions about the fair and rational allocation of limited public funds are the bread and butter of government functions and are purely financial. As such, they are not a valid pressing and substantial objective under s.\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The first and most important remedy for Charter breaches is a declaration of invalidity. In the context of s.\u00a023, courts must pay particular attention to whether a declaration will be an adequate remedy for a breach. A declaration often strikes the right balance between vindicating Charter rights and affording governments flexibility to meet their s.\u00a023 obligations. This primary remedy is supplemented by Charter damages, which are available where appropriate and just, but are not presumed. Trial judges have significant discretion in determining the appropriate remedy for a Charter breach.\u00a0However, this discretion is not unfettered, and what is appropriate and just will depend on the circumstances. An award of damages must be fair not only to the claimant whose rights were breached, but also to the state which is required to pay them. Other remedies may also be more responsive to a breach. Under the framework set out in Vancouver (City) v. Ward, 2010 SCC 27, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 28, the first step for assessing Charter damages is to show a Charter breach. Second, the claimant must show why damages are an appropriate and just remedy that fulfills one or more of the related functions of compensation, vindication of the right, or deterrence of future breaches. Third, the government may show countervailing factors that render damages inappropriate or unjust, such as the existence of alternative remedies and good governance concerns. Finally, the court determines the quantum of damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The immunity from Charter damages set out in Mackin\u00a0v. New Brunswick (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 13, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 405, has been recognized as responding to a good governance concern. According to the Mackin principle, absent conduct that is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power, courts will not award damages for the harm suffered as a result of the mere enactment or application of a law that is subsequently declared to be unconstitutional. This confers a limited immunity intended to balance the protection of constitutional rights against the need for effective government. In addition to legislation, Mackin immunity applies to government policies. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence has consistently framed the principle in terms sufficiently broad to cover other instruments. Moreover, there is no principled basis to limit the application of Mackin immunity to legislation, as proposed by a majority of the Court. The question is not about the vehicle of state action but rather the general purpose of the immunity and under what circumstances the state should be liable for damages.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the rationale underlying Mackin immunity, being the ability to carry out government functions without the threat of damages, does not support its application in the context of s.\u00a023. Normally, governments make regulations and develop policies to carry out their everyday responsibilities. In doing so, they presumably endeavour not to breach Charter rights. Yet, a government that has breached s.\u00a023 has not carried out its functions as mandated. Unlike most Charter rights, s.\u00a023 requires action. Legislation must be enacted, policies must be established, and public funds must be spent to give effect to the right. The s.\u00a023 entitlement is particularly vulnerable to inaction, as any delay in implementation can result in assimilation and undermine access to the right itself. An additional barrier of immunity for damages is ill\u2011suited to the substance of established s.\u00a023 claims. By the time a court reaches the question of remedy, a breach of s.\u00a023 will already have been found. This means that the government has failed to fund minority language education adequately or has unduly delayed in doing so. Accordingly, an exception is warranted such that the immunity does not apply in the context of s.\u00a023. Damages will therefore be appropriate for s.\u00a023 breaches when all the Ward factors are satisfied.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Mahe v.

        "summary": "<strong>Children who study in English  or French should get the same quality of education, and eight B.C. communities  should get French-language schools, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em> is part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. It sets out the rights and  freedoms of all Canadians. Some of those <em>Charter </em>rights protect the use of Canada\u2019s official languages, English and French.  Section 23 of the <em>Charter </em>is about  the right to go to school in English or French, even when it\u2019s not  the main language of the province or territory. It says people whose first  language is the minority language, or who went to primary school in that  language, can send their kids to school in that language. But there have to be  enough children in a community to justify it. Section 23 doesn\u2019t say exactly  how many children is enough for different levels of services. (For example, their  own classrooms, their own schools, or their own school boards.) It also doesn\u2019t  say how good the education in those schools has to be. The  Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique is B.C.\u2019s  French-language school board. The school board and some parents said B.C.  hadn\u2019t done enough for French-language schools in the past. It wanted the  government to fix school buildings and property and to build new schools  because the number of students was going up. It said the government\u2019s laws and  policies breached the French-speaking community\u2019s language rights under section  23. B.C. said there weren\u2019t enough students for new schools and that the  existing schools were good enough. It also said it would cost too much to  provide all the services the school board wanted. The  trial judge said there were enough children for a school in some, but not all,  parts of B.C. By not providing those schools, B.C. breached the French-speaking  community\u2019s rights under section 23. But she said this didn\u2019t mean B.C. had to  build new schools right away. She said it had to pay $6 million in damages for  not funding school buses, though. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial  judge but said the government didn\u2019t have to pay the $6 million. The majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said the lower courts  interpreted section 23 of the <em>Charter</em> too narrowly. They said school helps preserve the language and culture of  official-language minorities. That\u2019s why the right to go to school in the  minority language is protected. The  majority set out a way to decide what kinds of programs and services  minority-language students should get. In general, it said they should  get their own school if the government gave one to the same number of  majority-language speakers somewhere in the province. This would promote  fairness and make sure public funds are spent wisely. In B.C., it means that  there were enough students to justify eight new French-language schools. They  said a trial court should decide about one more school. The  majority also said all children deserve the same opportunities. That means that  minority- and majority-language students should get the same quality and  experience at school. Going to a small school shouldn\u2019t mean students get a  worse education. Under section 1 of the <em>Charter</em>,  certain rights can be limited. But this is only if the limit is reasonable and  can be justified in a free and democratic society. The majority said it would  be very difficult to justify a limit for section 23. Section 23 is already  limited because the right depends on there being enough students. Plus, it  requires the government to spend money on schools. \u00a0So the majority said that saving money wasn\u2019t  a good enough reason to justify breaching section 23. The majority also said governments can\u2019t avoid paying damages for decisions  based on their policies. This is in order to ensure they respect people\u2019s  rights. That meant B.C. had to pay the $6 million for not funding school buses. It also had to pay $1.1 million  because it hadn\u2019t given the school board enough money for rural schools. This was one of two cases heard during the Supreme Court\u2019s <a href=\"/court-cour/events-evenements/winnipeg/index-eng.aspx\">visit  to Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba in September 2019. It was the first time in  history the Court sat outside of Ottawa. "

In these operations, drug traffickers use cell phones to connect with their customers and sell them illicit drugs. Officers called the numbers and, in brief conversations with the men who answered, requested drugs and arranged meetings to complete the transactions. A and W were subsequently arrested and charged with drug\u2011related offences. At trial, each accused claimed that the proceedings should be stayed on the basis of entrapment. In A\u2019s case, the trial judge entered convictions, concluding that the accused was not entrapped because the police had not offered him an opportunity to traffic drugs until they had sufficiently corroborated the tip in the course of the conversation. In W\u2019s case, the trial judge found that the accused was entrapped because the police provided him an opportunity to sell cocaine before forming a reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in drug trafficking. The Court of Appeal held that entrapment was not made out for either A or W. A majority of the court concluded that where reasonable suspicion relates to the phone number itself, the police can provide opportunities to commit offences to a person associated with that phone number, even if they do not also have a reasonable suspicion about the person who answers the phone. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal dismissed A\u2019s appeal but allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal in W\u2019s case, entering convictions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal by A should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal by W should be allowed, the convictions set aside, and the stay of proceedings reinstated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Karakatsanis, Brown, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: The entrapment framework set out in R. v. Mack, 1988 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, and R. v. Barnes, 1991 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449, has proved workable for decades in a variety of contexts. It has stood the test of time, furnishing a principled, stable and generally applicable doctrine that is fully capable of adapting to a variety of circumstances and responding to the evolution of crime and police tactics. There is no reason to alter the carefully calibrated balance struck in these cases in investigations of suspected dial\u2011a\u2011dope operations. Applying the Court\u2019s entrapment framework and in particular its reasonable suspicion standard, the decision of each trial judge should be affirmed. While A was not entrapped, W was.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court\u2019s decision in Mack settled the law of entrapment in Canada. It set out two alternative branches, either of which is sufficient to ground an accused\u2019s claim of entrapment and justify a stay of proceedings. On the first branch, at issue in these appeals, the police may present an opportunity to commit a crime only upon forming reasonable suspicion that either a specific person is engaged in criminal activity or people are carrying out criminal activity at a specific location, sometimes referred to as a bona fide inquiry. The offer of an opportunity to commit a crime must always be based upon a reasonable suspicion of particular criminal activity, whether by a person, in a place defined with sufficient precision, or a combination of both. In every context, the reasonable suspicion standard ensures courts can conduct meaningful judicial review of what the police knew at the time the opportunity was provided. This standard requires the police to disclose the basis for their belief and to show they had legitimate reasons related to criminality for targeting an individual or the people associated with a location.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 An individual phone number can qualify as a place over which police may form reasonable suspicion. However, a phone number is not the same as a public physical location. A phone is a means of private communication between persons, and calling a number, or exchanging text messages, is an inherently private activity. Accordingly, state surveillance over virtual spaces is of an entirely different qualitative order than surveillance over a public space. Technology and remote communication significantly increase the number of people to whom police investigators can provide opportunities, thereby heightening the risk that innocent people will be targeted. It is therefore important to carefully delineate and tightly circumscribe virtual locations in which police can provide the opportunity to commit a crime. The virtual space must be defined with sufficient precision in order to ground reasonable suspicion. Reviewing courts must scrutinize the evidence that prompted the inquiry to ensure the police have narrowed their scope so that the purview of their inquiry is no broader than the evidence allows.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Police cannot offer a person who answers the phone the opportunity to commit an offence without having formed reasonable suspicion that the person using that phone, or that phone number, is engaged in criminal activity. Whether the police are targeting a person, place or phone number, the legal standard for entrapment is a uniform one, requiring reasonable suspicion in all cases where police provide an opportunity to commit a criminal offence. Reasonable suspicion is a familiar legal standard that provides courts with the necessary objective basis on which to determine whether the police have justified their actions. It protects individuals\u2019 interests and preserves the rule of law by ensuring courts can meaningfully review police conduct. It requires that a constellation of objectively discernible facts give the officer reasonable cause to suspect that a certain kind of crime was being committed by a particular person or in a particular place. Reasonable suspicion is also individualized, in the sense that it picks an individual target \u2014 whether a person, an intersection or a phone number \u2014 out of a group of persons or places. When an objectively grounded suspicion attaches to a sufficiently particularized constellation of factors, like those relating to an individual phone number, concerns about the police intruding on the protected interests of all persons in broadly or poorly defined locations fall away.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A bare tip from an unverified source that someone is dealing drugs from a phone number cannot ground reasonable suspicion. However, it can be sufficiently corroborated such that the standard is met. Police practice itself shows that, whether the police are investigating an individual or a phone number, various steps can be taken upon receiving a tip associating a phone number with dial\u2011a\u2011dope activity before acting on it by calling the number. Although it would be prudent for police officers to investigate the reliability of the tip before placing the call where they are able to do so, it is also possible for the police to form reasonable suspicion in the course of a conversation with the target, but prior to presenting the opportunity to commit a crime. The target\u2019s responsiveness to details in the tip, along with other factors, may tend to confirm the tip\u2019s reliability. The target\u2019s use of or response to language particular to the drug subculture properly forms part of the constellation of factors supporting reasonable suspicion. Whether or not responding to such terminology is neutral or adds to the weight of other factors will depend on the circumstances. There is no requirement that the police rule out innocent explanations for these responses.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Unless the police had formed reasonable suspicion before a phone call was made, review of the words spoken during the call is unavoidable in order for the court to determine whether an accused was entrapped. Reviewing conversations between undercover officers and their targets in the dial\u2011a\u2011dope context is the inevitable consequence of accepting that the police must have reasonable suspicion before offering an opportunity to commit an offence. Reasonable suspicion is not formed retroactively, but applied prospectively. Reasonable suspicion can justify an action only on the basis of information already known to police. A court must examine all of the circumstances, and not merely the language used during the call, in order to determine whether police had formed reasonable suspicion by the time the opportunity was provided.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The determination of whether a police action constitutes an opportunity to commit an offence is informed both by the definition of the offence and the context in which the action occurred. The definition of drug trafficking includes not only selling, transporting and administering illegal drugs, but also making an offer to do so. In the dial\u2011a\u2011dope context, in which the initial interaction between the police and target occurs entirely over the phone, the exercise centres on determining whether words spoken by the police officer constitute an opportunity to commit drug trafficking. The inquiry is properly directed to how close the police conduct is to the commission of the offence. To allow the police sufficient flexibility to investigate crime, an officer\u2019s action \u2014 to constitute an offer of an opportunity to commit a crime \u2014 must be sufficiently proximate to conduct that would satisfy the elements of the offence. In the particular context of drug trafficking, an opportunity to commit an offence is offered when the officer says something to which the accused can commit an offence by simply answering \u201cyes\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The facts of each of the two appeals lead to different conclusions. In A\u2019s case, the police had a reasonable suspicion of drug trafficking before providing the opportunity to commit an offence and therefore A was not entrapped. The officer had asked A if he went by the name provided in the tip, which he did not deny. When the officer asked A, \u201cYou can help me out?\u201d, A responded positively to this use of language particular to the drug subculture, asking the officer, \u201cwhat do you need?\u201d Having connected the tip to the person on the phone, the aspect of the tip that asserted illegality was corroborated by A\u2019s understanding of drug\u2011trafficking slang and willingness to engage in it. In this context, these markers of reliability together sufficiently corroborated the initial tip to give rise to an objective possibility that A was involved in drug trafficking. Unlike in A\u2019s case, there was nothing in W\u2019s responses to suggest that the phone number was being used to sell drugs before the officer provided the opportunity to traffic. Therefore, W was entrapped. The police officer did not wait to see how W would respond to an investigative question that could have corroborated that W was engaged in criminal activity prior to providing the opportunity to commit the crime. Although W confirmed that he went by the name provided in the tip, he did not respond positively to slang particular to the drug subculture until after the opportunity had been provided. The corroboration of the name did not strengthen the reliability of the tip in its assertion of illegality. The police had no more than a bare tip that someone using a particular phone number was selling drugs and this did not ground reasonable suspicion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting in part): Both appeals should be dismissed. Attempting to apply the doctrine of entrapment as formulated in R. v. Mack, 1988 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, and R. v. Barnes, 1991 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449, to present\u2011day dial\u2011a\u2011dope operations has revealed both doctrinal and policy concerns with how the first branch of the doctrine is currently formulated. Both the individualized suspicion and the bona fide inquiry prongs of this branch have failed to remain faithful to the balance struck in Mack and Barnes between protecting an individual\u2019s legitimate interest in being left alone by the state and effective law enforcement. The bona fide inquiry prong must be revised to preserve this fundamental balance, to rectify doctrinal issues within the prong itself, and to address policy concerns that have arisen with respect to the prong\u2019s application. The revised framework will ensure that only the clearest of cases of intolerable state conduct are captured by the doctrine of entrapment by refocusing the doctrine on its principled origin: abuse of process. Applying the revised framework, the police were engaged in a bona fide inquiry when they offered each A and W an opportunity to commit the offence of drug trafficking.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The individualized suspicion prong of the doctrine of entrapment has come under fire for leading to anomalous results, particularly in dial\u2011a\u2011dope cases where police call alleged drug dealers based on minimal information. This prong permits the police to provide an individual with an opportunity to commit an offence if they reasonably suspect that the targeted individual is already engaged in criminal activity of the same type. The concern expressed is that even though the investigating officer may not possess individualized reasonable suspicion at the time they offer an opportunity, the police conduct in a typical dial\u2011a\u2011dope case cannot be said to rise to the level of an abuse of process warranting a stay of proceedings. In an attempt to both adhere to the formal requirement of reasonable suspicion and preserve the substantive abuse of process character of entrapment in dial\u2011a\u2011dope cases, some courts have drawn a distinction between taking an investigative step (which does not require reasonable suspicion) and presenting an opportunity to commit an offence (which does). The problem with the fine line distinction this approach draws is that it requires courts to closely parse undercover calls to determine whether an accused was entrapped. This approach creates artificial distinctions based on the specific words used by the undercover officer rather than focusing on whether society would view the officer\u2019s conduct, considered in context, as simply intolerable. These distinctions are often difficult to draw, and promote an approach that is akin to dancing on the head of a pin.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The manner in which the majority proposes to dispose of the appeals provides a clear example of the dubious distinctions that flow from an application of the parsing approach. In both cases, an undercover officer made a call based on information from an anonymous or a confidential source. Each call was answered by a then\u2011unknown man. Seemingly without surprise, each man confirmed or did not deny that he went by a name that, based on the officer\u2019s information, belonged to a drug dealer operating out of the phone line. The only distinction between the cases is that the undercover officer in W\u2019s case used a drop name before asking for a specific quantity of cocaine, whereas the undercover officer in A\u2019s case used a drop name and waited for A to say \u201cwhat do you need?\u201d before asking for a specific quantity of cocaine. The conduct of either undercover officer in these cases cannot be described as intolerable \u2014 the officers were doing precisely what society would expect them to do upon receiving information about an alleged dial\u2011a\u2011dope operation. A reasonably informed observer in our society would be utterly bewildered by the majority\u2019s conclusion that the conduct of the undercover officer in W\u2019s case rises to the level of an abuse of process while the conduct of the undercover officer in A\u2019s case is acceptable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The problem in applying the bona fide prong as defined in Mack and Barnes to present\u2011day dial\u2011a\u2011dope investigations is that the reasonable suspicion standard has evolved since those cases were decided. The bona fide inquiry prong permits the police to randomly approach citizens and offer them opportunities to commit offences, so long as the area within which they are operating is defined with sufficient precision and they reasonably suspect that that type of crime is occurring in the area. The incorporation of this type of generalized location\u2011based reasonable suspicion into the bona fide inquiry prong reflects the view that requiring the police to meet a more stringent standard, such as individualized reasonable suspicion, would unduly hinder law enforcement efforts and thereby fail to strike an appropriate balance between individual liberties and legitimate law enforcement. However, in R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, the notice that reasonable suspicion includes generalized suspicion that attaches to a particular activity or location rather than to a specific person was rejected. Put differently, since Mack and Barnes were decided, individualization has come to define the reasonable suspicion standard. In this way, the more restrictive meaning ascribed to reasonable suspicion in Chehil has rendered it incompatible with the balance between individual liberties and legitimate law enforcement struck by the bona fide inquiry prong in Barnes.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The solution to the doctrinal incoherence and policy concerns revealed by the dial\u2011a\u2011dope entrapment jurisprudence is to revise the bona fide inquiry prong. The revised framework will refocus the bona fide inquiry prong on its principled origin: abuse of process.\u00a0Under the revised framework, the police should be found to be acting pursuant to a bona fide inquiry where they meet three requirements. First, their investigation must have been motivated by genuine law enforcement purposes. Second, they must have had a factually\u2011grounded basis for their investigation. They need to be able to point to a specific reason for their investigation beyond a mere hunch.\u00a0Third, their investigation must have been directed at investigating a specific type of crime within a tightly circumscribed location (whether physical or virtual). Whether the precision of the location meets this threshold should be determined by reference to the overarching question entrapment poses, that is, whether, in all the circumstances, society would view the inquiry as abusive. Inevitably, whether a particular type of location is sufficiently circumscribed for the purposes of a particular type of investigation will need to be considered on a location\u2011by\u2011location basis, until a jurisprudence develops. Some considerations may include: the nature and seriousness of the type of crime under investigation; the number of citizens that may be impacted by the investigation technique used by the police; the nature of the location under investigation; and the intrusiveness of the technique.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The revised framework offers significant improvements to the bona fide inquiry prong by bringing it in line with recent doctrinal developments, and by placing limitations on the scope of the location under investigation. These limitations mitigate the risk that police may be able to indiscriminately offer opportunities within an expansive area (i.e., to conduct large\u2011scale random virtue testing) and effectively address the risk of police targeting the vulnerable and marginalized and engaging in racial profiling. If the police deliberately target the marginalized and vulnerable, it will amount to impermissible bad faith conduct. In addition, by considering the nature of the location under investigation and the number of citizens potentially impacted, together with other relevant factors, reviewing courts will be able to discern whether the risk of ensnaring the marginalized and vulnerable was so high in a given case that society would not tolerate that risk, notwithstanding the legitimate law enforcement interests at stake.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Neither A nor W were entrapped. The police in both cases were acting in the course of bona fide inquiries into the cell phone numbers in issue at the time they extended the respective opportunities to traffic in narcotics. Applying the new framework, there is no suggestion that the police were not motivated by genuine law enforcement purposes, nor is there any evidence of bad faith. Further, the police had a factually\u2011grounded basis for their investigations, having received information containing the names and phone number of alleged drug dealers. Finally, their inquiry was sufficiently tightly circumscribed. Drug trafficking is a serious crime and the number of individuals potentially impacted by the police conduct here is extremely low. The locations under investigation were phone numbers and, as a result, any concerns that racial profiling or other unconscious biases may have played a role in the investigations are highly attenuated. Notably, the investigatory technique did not involve accessing any of the information on either A\u2019s or W\u2019s cell phone. On this point, there is disagreement with the majority that a call to a potential dial\u2011a\u2011dope line engages the informational privacy interest protected by s.\u00a08 of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and accordingly does demand the imposition of a standard as robust as the individualized reasonable suspicion standard developed in s.\u00a08 jurisprudence. Dial\u2011a\u2011dope investigations do not involve search or seizure of the person\u2019s phone, or any of the information it contains. All that dial\u2011a\u2011dope investigations involve is a conversation between an undercover officer and the person on the other end of the line. The majority\u2019s acceptance that the police may phone an individual and engage them in potentially extensive conversation without first holding reasonable suspicion belies its contention that a typical dial\u2011a\u2011dope investigation engages the privacy interest that s.\u00a08 of the Charter protects. The nature of the individual privacy interests at play here are limited to individuals\u2019 interest in being left alone by the state. It is difficult to imagine a less intrusive technique than those used in typical dial\u2011a\u2011dope cases like these ones. In sum, the police conduct here cannot be said to be conduct that society would find intolerable.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Police need good reason to suspect someone answering a  phone (or the number itself) is involved in drug dealing before asking them to sell  drugs, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Police can investigate crime in different ways. To find  out about crimes that are hard to investigate (like drug trafficking, child  luring, or terrorism), they may have to tempt people to commit them. But there  are limits to this. They have to be able to show the court that they had a \u201creasonable  suspicion\u201d (a good reason to suspect) that a certain crime was happening. Needing  reasonable suspicion makes sure courts can review police actions to check they  are acting properly.  If police don\u2019t have a reasonable suspicion and they  tempt a person to commit a crime anyway, it is called \u201centrapment.\u201d Entrapment  is very serious. It undermines society\u2019s sense of justice and the rule of law. When  it happens, there has to be a \u201cstay of proceedings.\u201d That means the prosecution  must be stopped and the person can\u2019t be convicted of the crime.  This decision dealt with two entrapment cases.  In Mr. Ahmad\u2019s case, the police got a tip that someone  named \u201cRomeo\u201d was selling drugs over the phone. The officer called \u201cRomeo\u2019s\u201d  phone number. He didn\u2019t know if the tip was trustworthy. He had a short  conversation with \u201cRomeo,\u201d who agreed to sell him cocaine. They met in person  and \u201cRomeo\u201d sold the officer cocaine. Police arrested and searched \u201cRomeo,\u201d who  turned out to be Mr. Ahmad.  The trial judge said Mr. Ahmad wasn\u2019t entrapped. This  was because police confirmed enough about the tip during their conversation to  have a good reason to suspect he was already selling drugs. They did this  before they asked to buy drugs from him. Mr. Ahmad was convicted. In Mr. Williams\u2019 case, a police officer got  information from another officer that someone named \u201cJay\u201d was selling cocaine.  The information also came from a tip. The officer didn\u2019t know if the  information was trustworthy or recent. Another officer called Jay\u2019s number and  asked to buy crack cocaine. \u201cJay\u201d agreed to meet and sold the officer crack.  \u201cJay\u201d turned out to be Mr. Williams. The police arranged another drug deal eleven  days later. A month later, police arrested Mr. Williams. The trial judge said police didn\u2019t have a reasonable  suspicion of Mr. Williams before they asked to buy drugs from him. The trial  judge said Mr. Williams was entrapped, and ordered a stay of proceedings. The Court of Appeal heard both appeals together,  because they dealt with the same issue. It said neither Mr. Ahmad nor Mr.  Williams were entrapped.  All the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that Mr.  Ahmad wasn\u2019t entrapped, but for different reasons. The majority said Mr.  Williams was entrapped. The majority said police can ask a person answering a  phone to commit a crime. But they can only do this if they already have  reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion must be about a specific person  committing a crime or crime happening in a specific place. But in this digital  age, a place doesn\u2019t have to be physical. It can be a phone number. So, police  need a good reason to suspect that the person answering is committing a certain  crime or the phone number is being used for that crime before asking them to  commit a crime.  Police don\u2019t have reasonable suspicion if they just  have a tip and don\u2019t know if it\u2019s reliable. They can develop reasonable suspicion  by investigating if a tip is reliable before calling. The majority said it\u2019s  better to have reasonable suspicion before making the call. But it\u2019s also possible  to establish reasonable suspicion by having a conversation with the person who  answers.  In both appeals, the police didn\u2019t have reasonable  suspicion before calling the phone numbers. But the majority said Mr. Ahmad  wasn\u2019t entrapped because police developed a good reason to suspect he was  selling drugs while talking to him on the phone. They did this before they asked  to buy drugs from him. The police didn\u2019t confirm the tip during the phone call  in Mr. Williams\u2019 case, though. The majority said Mr. Williams <em>was</em> entrapped because the police asked  to buy drugs from him before they had a good reason to suspect he was selling drugs.  Mr. Ahmad got permission (or \u201cleave\u201d) to appeal  to the Supreme Court. People who get convicted on appeal when they weren\u2019t  convicted at trial, like Mr. Williams, can appeal \u201cas of right\u201d (meaning they  don\u2019t need permission)."

The petition succeeded, and the initial order was issued by a supervising judge, who became responsible for overseeing the proceedings. Since then, substantially all of the assets of the debtor companies have been liquidated, with the notable exception of retained claims for damages against the companies\u2019 only secured creditor. In September 2017, the secured creditor proposed a plan of arrangement, which later failed to receive sufficient creditor support. In February 2018, the secured creditor proposed another, virtually identical, plan of arrangement. It also sought the supervising judge\u2019s permission to vote on this new plan in the same class as the debtor companies\u2019 unsecured creditors, on the basis that its security was worth nil. Around the same time, the debtor companies sought interim financing in the form of a proposed third party litigation funding agreement, which would permit them to pursue litigation of the retained claims. They also sought the approval of a related super\u2011priority litigation financing charge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The supervising judge determined that the secured creditor should not be permitted to vote on the new plan because it was acting with an improper purpose. As a result, the new plan had no reasonable prospect of success and was not put to a creditors\u2019 vote. The supervising judge allowed the debtor companies\u2019 application, authorizing them to enter into a third party litigation funding agreement. On appeal by the secured creditor and certain of the unsecured creditors, the Court of Appeal set aside the supervising judge\u2019s order, holding that he had erred in reaching the foregoing conclusions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and the supervising judge\u2019s order reinstated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The supervising judge made no error in barring the secured creditor from voting or in authorizing the third party litigating funding agreement. A supervising judge has the discretion to bar a creditor from voting on a plan of arrangement where they determine that the creditor is acting for an improper purpose. A supervising judge can also approve third party litigation funding as interim financing, pursuant to s.\u00a011.2 of the CCAA. The Court of Appeal was not justified in interfering with the supervising judge\u2019s discretionary decisions in this regard, having failed to treat them with the appropriate degree of deference.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The CCAA is one of three principal insolvency statutes in Canada. It pursues an array of overarching remedial objectives that reflect the wide ranging and potentially catastrophic impacts insolvency can have. These objectives include: providing for timely, efficient and impartial resolution of a debtor\u2019s insolvency; preserving and maximizing the value of a debtor\u2019s assets; ensuring fair and equitable treatment of the claims against a debtor; protecting the public interest; and, in the context of a commercial insolvency, balancing the costs and benefits of restructuring or liquidating the company. The architecture of the CCAA leaves the case-specific assessment and balancing of these objectives to the supervising judge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 From beginning to end, each proceeding under the CCAA is overseen by a single supervising judge, who has broad discretion to make a variety of orders that respond to the circumstances of each case. The anchor of this discretionary authority is s.\u00a011 of the CCAA, with empowers a judge to make any order that they consider appropriate in the circumstances. This discretionary authority is broad, but not boundless. It must be exercised in furtherance of the remedial objectives of the CCAA and with three baseline considerations in mind: (1)\u00a0that the order sought is appropriate in the circumstances, and (2)\u00a0that the applicant has been acting in good faith and (3)\u00a0with due diligence. The due diligence consideration discourages parties from sitting on their rights and ensures that creditors do not strategically manoeuvre or position themselves to gain an advantage. A high degree of deference is owed to discretionary decisions made by judges supervising CCAA proceedings and, as such, appellate intervention will only be justified if the supervising judge erred in principle or exercised their discretion unreasonably.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A creditor can generally vote on a plan of arrangement or compromise that affects its rights, subject to any specific provisions of the CCAA that may restrict its voting rights, or a proper exercise of discretion by the supervising judge to constrain or bar the creditor\u2019s right to vote. Given that the CCAA regime contemplates creditor participation in decision-making as an integral facet of the workout regime, the discretion to bar a creditor from voting should only be exercised where the circumstances demand such an outcome. Where a creditor is seeking to exercise its voting rights in a manner that frustrates, undermines, or runs counter to the remedial objectives of the CCAA \u2e3a that is, acting for an improper purpose \u2e3a s. 11 of the CCAA supplies the supervising judge with the discretion to bar that creditor from voting. This discretion parallels the similar discretion that exists under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and advances the basic fairness that permeates Canadian insolvency law and practice. Whether this discretion ought to be exercised in a particular case is a circumstance-specific inquiry that the supervising judge is best-positioned to undertake.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, the supervising judge\u2019s decision to bar the secured creditor from voting on the new plan discloses no error justifying appellate intervention. When he made this decision, the supervising judge was intimately familiar with these proceedings, having presided over them for over 2 years, received 15 reports from the monitor, and issued approximately 25 orders. He considered the whole of the circumstances and concluded that the secured creditor\u2019s vote would serve an improper purpose. He was aware that the secured creditor had chosen not to value any of its claim as unsecured prior to the vote on the first plan and did not attempt to vote on that plan, which ultimately failed to receive the other creditors\u2019 approval. Between the failure of the first plan and the proposal of the (essentially identical) new plan, none of the factual circumstances relating to the debtor companies\u2019 financial or business affairs had materially changed. However, the secured creditor sought to value the entirety of its security at nil and, on that basis, sought leave to vote on the new plan as an unsecured creditor. If the secured creditor were permitted to vote in this way, the new plan would certainly have met the double majority threshold for approval under s. 6(1) of the CCAA. The inescapable inference was that the secured creditor was attempting to strategically value its security to acquire control over the outcome of the vote and thereby circumvent the creditor democracy the CCAA protects. The secured creditor\u2019s course of action was also plainly contrary to the expectation that parties act with due diligence in an insolvency proceeding, which includes acting with due diligence in valuing their claims and security. The secured creditor was therefore properly barred from voting on the new plan.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Whether third party litigation funding should be approved as interim financing is a case-specific inquiry that should have regard to the text of s.\u00a011.2 of the CCAA and the remedial objectives of the CCAA more generally. Interim financing is a flexible tool that may take on a range of forms. This is apparent from the wording of s.\u00a011.2(1), which is broad and does not mandate any standard form or terms. At its core, interim financing enables the preservation and realization of the value of a debtor\u2019s assets. In some circumstances, like the instant case, litigation funding furthers this basic purpose. Third party litigation funding agreements may therefore be approved as interim financing in CCAA proceedings when the supervising judge determines that doing so would be fair and appropriate, having regard to all the circumstances and the objectives of the Act. This requires consideration of the specific factors set out in s.\u00a011.2(4) of the CCAA. These factors need not be mechanically applied or individually reviewed by the supervising judge, as not all of them will be significant in every case, nor are they exhaustive. Additionally, in order for a third party litigation funding agreement to be approved as interim financing, the agreement must not contain terms that effectively convert it into a plan of arrangement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, there is no basis upon which to interfere with the supervising judge\u2019s exercise of his discretion to approve the litigation funding agreement as interim financing. A review of the supervising judge\u2019s reasons as a whole, combined with a recognition of his manifest experience with the debtor companies\u2019 CCAA proceedings, leads to the conclusion that the factors listed in s.\u00a011.2(4) concern matters that could not have escaped his attention and due consideration. It is apparent that he was focussed on the fairness at stake to all parties, the specific objectives of the CCAA, and the particular circumstances of this case when he approved the litigation funding agreement as interim financing. Further, the litigation funding agreement is not a plan of arrangement because it does not propose any compromise of the creditors\u2019 rights. The fact that the creditors may walk away with more or less money at the end of the day does not change the nature or existence of their rights to access the funds generated from the debtor companies\u2019 assets, nor can it be said to compromise those rights. Finally, the litigation financing charge does not convert the litigation funding agreement into a plan of arrangement. Holding otherwise would effectively extinguish the supervising judge\u2019s authority to approve these charges without a creditors\u2019 vote, which is expressly provided for in s.\u00a011.2 of the CCAA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Century Services Inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Judges can stop creditors  from voting on how to settle insolvent companies\u2019 debts and can approve  \u201cinterim financing\u201d from third parties to fund lawsuits, the Supreme Court has  ruled.</strong>\r\n   When a company doesn\u2019t have money  to pay back its debts, it\u2019s \u201cinsolvent.\u201d If an insolvent company owes people  (creditors) more than $5 million, it can get help through the <em>Companies\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act</em> (CCAA). Under the CCAA, it can work out agreements with its creditors to pay  them back. A \u201csupervising judge\u201d oversees this process.  9354-9186 Qu\u00e9bec inc., also known as Bluberi, was insolvent.  It owed a lot of money to Callidus because Callidus had given it a loan. The  loan was \u201csecured,\u201d meaning if Bluberi didn\u2019t pay, Callidus could take things  Bluberi owned. (A mortgage loan is a kind of secured loan.) This made Callidus  a \u201csecured creditor.\u201d Bluberi also had \u201cunsecured creditors\u201d (like its  employees).  Bluberi agreed to sell what it owned to Callidus to  pay its debt. The agreement said Callidus would get Bluberi\u2019s assets, and  Bluberi would only owe Callidus $3 million. The agreement also said Bluberi  could keep the right to sue Callidus. Bluberi wanted to sue because it blamed  Callidus for its insolvency problems. This right to sue was the only thing of  value that Bluberi had left. Bluberi still had other debts. It wanted to use money  from the lawsuit against Callidus to pay them. But Callidus wanted to settle  Bluberi\u2019s debts in a different way. It put forward a \u201cplan of arrangement.\u201d A  plan of arrangement is a proposal about how to pay an insolvent company\u2019s  creditors. A plan of arrangement needs to be approved by the company\u2019s  creditors. Under Callidus\u2019s plan, some of Bluberi\u2019s creditors would get  everything they were owed, but some would only get part. In exchange, Bluberi  would have to give up its right to sue Callidus. Bluberi\u2019s unsecured creditors  voted and rejected the plan. Callidus could have tried to vote, but chose not  to. Bluberi then came up with a way to get the money it  needed to sue Callidus, through a \u201cthird-party litigation funding agreement.\u201d A  company would provide the money in exchange for part of anything Bluberi won  from Callidus. Bluberi asked the supervising judge to approve this agreement as  \u201cinterim financing.\u201d Interim financing is money that helps a company make use  of the assets it has left. But Callidus said the agreement was a plan of  arrangement, and that the creditors needed to vote on it.  At the same time, Callidus put forward a new plan,  which was basically the same as its first one. Callidus asked the supervising  judge if it could vote on the new plan. If it could vote, its plan would pass. The supervising judge said Callidus couldn\u2019t vote. He  said it was acting with an \u201cimproper purpose.\u201d He said Callidus chose not to  try to vote the first time, and was now trying to override the result of that  vote. He decided Bluberi could go forward with its litigation funding agreement  without a vote because the agreement was fair and wasn\u2019t a plan of arrangement. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the supervising  judge. The Supreme Court unanimously said the supervising  judge\u2019s decisions should stand. It said appeal courts should give a great deal  of respect to a supervising judge\u2019s decisions, even if they would have made  different ones. The supervising judge oversees the case from start to finish,  knows the specific situation the best, and is in the best position to balance  the many goals of the CCAA. One of the CCAA\u2019s goals is to help companies stay  in business. Another goal is to make sure creditors get back as much of the  money they are owed as possible.\u00a0  In this case, the Supreme Court  said the supervising judge balanced those goals properly. It said he was  allowed to stop Callidus from voting if it was acting with an improper purpose,  which it was. He was also allowed to approve Bluberi\u2019s litigation funding  agreement as interim financing, if he thought it was appropriate. He was right  to think that it was. The agreement was meant to help Bluberi make use of the  only asset it had left (its right to sue Callidus). This case was decided  \u201cfrom the bench\u201d right after the hearing on January 23, 2020. When a case is  decided from the bench, it means the judges tell the parties the outcome right  away. In this case, the judges gave written reasons later to explain."

One night, the mother brought F to her residence, where she and F engaged in consensual sexual intercourse in the mother\u2019s bedroom. F then told the mother to bring the victim, her four\u2011year\u2011old daughter, into the bedroom. F and the mother subjected the victim to sexual violence. Her screams and cries awoke the mother\u2019s friend who removed the victim from the room. F then threatened the mother that unless she brought the victim back, he would tell the mother\u2019s friend that the mother had previously sexually abused her one\u2011year\u2011old son.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 F pled guilty to sexual interference with the victim and attempted extortion of the mother. The sentencing judge imposed a six\u2011year sentence for sexual interference and a concurrent six\u2011year sentence for attempted extortion. He determined that the four\u2011to\u2011five year sentencing starting point identified previously by the Manitoba Court of Appeal for major sexual assault committed on a young person within a trust relationship was appropriate even though F did not stand in a position of trust to the victim. The Court of Appeal found that the sentencing judge had erred in principle by applying the starting point, which presumed the existence of a trust relationship, when the sentencing judge had found that there was none. The Court of Appeal conducted a fresh analysis and reduced the sentence to four and one\u2011half years\u2019 incarceration for sexual interference and to eighteen months\u2019 incarceration to be served concurrently for attempted extortion. The Crown appeals to the Court from the Court of Appeal\u2019s interference with the sentence for the sexual interference offence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be allowed and the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for sexual interference restored.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Appellate courts must generally defer to sentencing judges\u2019 decisions and can only intervene to vary a sentence if (1)\u00a0the sentence is demonstrably unfit or (2)\u00a0the sentencing judge made an error in principle that had an impact on the sentence. Errors in principle include an error of law, a failure to consider a relevant factor, or erroneous consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor. If appellate intervention is justified, the court will apply the principles of sentencing afresh to the facts, without deference to the existing sentence, even if that sentence falls within the applicable range. Where an appellate court has found that an error in principle had an impact on the sentence, it is not a further precondition to appellate intervention that the existing sentence is demonstrably unfit or falls outside the range of sentences imposed in the past.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 All sentencing starts with the principle that sentences must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Sentencing judges must also consider the principle of parity: similar offenders who commit similar offences in similar circumstances should receive similar sentences. Parity is an expression of proportionality and gives meaning to proportionality in practice. A proportionate sentence for a given offender and offence cannot be deduced from first principles; instead, judges calibrate the demands of proportionality by reference to the sentences imposed in other cases. Sentencing precedents reflect the range of factual situations in the world, embody the collective experience and wisdom of the judiciary, and are the practical expression of both parity and proportionality.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Appellate courts have a dual role in sentence appeals. They correct errors in sentencing to ensure both that the principles of sentencing are correctly applied and that sentences are not demonstrably unfit, and they have a role in developing the law and providing guidance. Appellate courts will distill many precedents into a single statement, a range of sentences or perhaps a starting point, that sentencing judges can more readily use. As a general rule, appellate courts should give sentencing judges the tools to depart from past precedents and craft fit sentences when a body of precedent no longer responds to society\u2019s current understanding and awareness of the gravity of a particular offence and blameworthiness of particular offenders or to the legislative initiatives of Parliament.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Canadian appellate courts often provide guidance in the form of ranges of sentences, which are summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the past and serve as guides for the application of all relevant principles and objectives. Some courts use starting points as an alternative. However, sentencing ranges and starting points are guidelines, not hard and fast rules. Appellate courts cannot treat the departure from or failure to refer to either as an error in principle. Nor can they intervene simply because the sentence is different from the sentence that would have been reached had the range or starting point been applied. Appellate courts cannot interpret or apply the standard of review to enforce ranges or starting points; to do so would be to usurp the role of Parliament in creating categories of offences.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Protecting children from wrongful exploitation and harm is the overarching objective of the legislative scheme of sexual offences against children in the Criminal Code. At the sentencing stage, in order to effectively respond to sexual violence against children, sentencing judges need to properly understand the wrongfulness of sexual offences against children and the profound harm that they cause and give effect to both in imposing a sentence. This will help bring sentencing law into line with society\u2019s contemporary understanding of the nature and gravity of sexual violence against children and will ensure that past biases and myths do not filter into the sentencing process. Parliament\u2019s creation of the modern legislative scheme of sexual offences against children shifted the focus of the sexual offences scheme from sexual propriety to wrongful interference with sexual integrity. The prime interests that the legislative scheme of sexual offences against children protect are the personal autonomy, bodily integrity, sexual integrity, dignity, and equality of children. Emphasis on these interests require courts to focus their attention on emotional and psychological harm, not simply physical harm. In particular, courts need to take into account the wrongfulness and harmfulness of sexual offences against children when applying the proportionality principle, as these factors impact both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender and understanding them is key to imposing a proportionate sentence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Courts must impose sentences that are commensurate with the gravity of sexual offences against children and that reflect the normative character of the offender\u2019s actions and the consequential harm to children and their families, caregivers, and communities. Specifically, courts must recognize and give effect to (1)\u00a0the inherent wrongfulness of these offences; (2)\u00a0the potential harm to children that flows from these offences; and (3)\u00a0the actual harm that children suffer as a result of these offences. Sexual offences against children are inherently wrongful and always put children at risk of serious harm, even as the degree of wrongfulness, the extent to which potential harm materializes, and actual harm vary from case to case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Courts must also take the modern recognition of the wrongfulness and harmfulness of sexual violence against children into account when determining the offender\u2019s degree of responsibility. Intentionally applying force of a sexual nature to a child is highly morally blameworthy because the offender is or ought to be aware that this action can profoundly harm the child, because it involves the wrongful exploitation of the child by the offender, and because children are so vulnerable. Courts must give proper weight in sentencing to the offender\u2019s underlying attitudes because they are highly relevant to assessing the offender\u2019s moral blameworthiness and to the sentencing objective of denunciation. The fact that the victim is a child increases the offender\u2019s degree of responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Parliament has determined that sentences for sexual offences against children should increase to match its view of the gravity of such offences. It has increased maximum sentences for these offences and prioritized denunciation and deterrence in sentencing. Parliament\u2019s decision to repeatedly increase maximum sentences for sexual offences against children should be understood as shifting the distribution of proportionate sentences for these offences. To respect Parliament\u2019s decision, courts should generally impose higher sentences than the sentences imposed in cases that preceded the increases in maximum sentences. Parliament\u2019s decision to prioritize denunciation and deterrence for offences that involve the abuse of children by enacting s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code confirms the need for courts to impose more severe sanctions for sexual offences against children.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A national starting point or sentencing range for sexual offences against children should not be created by the Court. The appropriate length and the setting of sentencing ranges or starting points are best left to provincial appellate courts. Nonetheless, to ensure that sentences for sexual offences against children correspond to Parliament\u2019s legislative initiatives and the contemporary understanding of the profound harm that sexual violence against children causes, guidance on three specific points is required.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, upward departure from prior precedents and sentencing ranges should occur for sexual offences against children because Parliament increased the maximum sentences for these offences and because society\u2019s understanding of the gravity and harmfulness of these offences has deepened. Courts are justified in departing from dated precedents that do not reflect society\u2019s current awareness of the impact of sexual violence on children in imposing a fit sentence. There is concern about sentencing ranges based on precedents that appear to restrict sentencing judges\u2019 discretion by imposing caps on sentences that can only be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Sexual offences against children can cover a wide variety of circumstances and appellate guidance should make clear that sentencing judges can respond to this reality by imposing sentences that reflect increases in the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Imposing proportionate sentences will frequently require substantial sentences. Parliament\u2019s statutory amendments have strengthened that message. Mid\u2011single digit penitentiary terms for sexual offences against children are normal and upper\u2011single digit and double digit penitentiary terms should be neither unusual nor reserved for rare or exceptional circumstances. A maximum sentence should be imposed whenever the circumstances warrant it.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, sexual offences against children should generally be punished more severely than sexual offences against adults, as Parliament has determined by clear indication in the Criminal Code. Accordingly, provincial appellate courts are directed to revise and rationalize sentencing ranges and starting points where they have treated sexual violence against children and sexual violence against adults similarly.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Third, treating the offence of sexual interference with a child as less serious than that of sexual assault of a person under the age of 16 is an error of law. Parliament has established the same maximum sentences for both offences. The elements of the offences are also similar, and a conviction for sexual assault of a child and for sexual interference with a child can frequently be supported on the same factual foundation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In order to promote the uniform application of the law of sentencing, the following non\u2011exhaustive significant factors to determine a fit sentence for sexual offences against children must be considered. First, the higher the offender\u2019s risk to reoffend, the more the court needs to emphasize the sentencing objective of separating the offender from society to protect vulnerable children from wrongful exploitation and harm. Second, an offender who abuses a position of trust to commit a sexual offence against a child should receive a lengthier sentence than an offender who is a stranger to the child. Any breach of trust is likely to increase the harm to the victim and thus the gravity of the offence, and it also increases the offender\u2019s degree of responsibility. Third, sexual violence against children that is committed on multiple occasions and for longer periods of time should attract significantly higher sentences that reflect the full cumulative gravity of the crime and the offender\u2019s increased degree of responsibility. Fourth, the age of the victim is also a significant aggravating factor because children who are particularly young are even more vulnerable to sexual violence. The moral blameworthiness of the offender is enhanced in such cases. Fifth, defining a sentencing range based on the specific type of sexual activity at issue poses several dangers. In particular, courts must be careful to avoid the following errors: attributing intrinsic significance to the occurrence or non\u2011occurrence of sexual acts based on traditional notions of sexual propriety; assuming that there is correlation between the type of physical act and the harm to the child; failing to recognize the wrongfulness of sexual violence in cases where the degree of physical interference is less pronounced; and understanding the degree of physical interference factor in terms of a type of hierarchy of physical acts. Sixth, a child\u2019s participation is not a mitigating factor, nor should it be a legally relevant consideration at sentencing. In particular, a child\u2019s non\u2011resistance should not be equated to \u201cde facto consent\u201d; a victim\u2019s participation should not distract the court from the harm that the victim suffers as a result of sexual violence; a breach of trust or grooming that led to the victim\u2019s participation is an aggravating factor; and, adults always have a responsibility to refrain from engaging in sexual violence towards children.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, the Court of Appeal based its intervention on an error in principle that the sentencing judge did not make. It is not an accurate characterization of the sentencing judge\u2019s reasons that his choice of the four\u2011to\u2011five\u2011year starting point demonstrated he relied on the aggravating factor of abuse of a position of trust that he had found did not exist. Rather, he determined that it was appropriate to employ a four\u2011to\u2011five\u2011year starting point because the aggravating circumstances of the case warranted it. The sentencing judge sought to exercise his discretion in a way that gave effect to the principles of sentencing, in light of the circumstances of the case, and his decision should be accorded deference. He was entitled to conclude that the aggravating factors were so serious as to place the case on par with the starting point the Manitoba Court of Appeal had set for major sexual assault committed on a young person within a trust relationship.\u00a0Since the Court of Appeal did not identify any other error and concluded the sentencing judge appropriately balanced the aggravating and mitigating factors, it should not have intervened. This case exemplifies the danger of treating starting points as binding laws. Rather than focusing on whether the sentencing judge chose the right starting point, the Court of Appeal should have focused on whether the sentence was fit and, most fundamentally, whether the sentencing judge properly applied the principles of sentencing.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The sentence was also not demonstrably unfit. Far from being so excessive, the sentence was on the lenient end of the spectrum of fit sentences. The sentencing judge took a careful approach to many of the significant factors previously discussed: he properly recognized the immediate and long\u2011term harm to the victim that F\u2019s conduct caused; appreciated the incredibly aggravating nature of the victim\u2019s young age; and properly emphasized separation of the offender from society. The fact that the sentencing judge found that F did not stand in a position of trust does not make the sentence unfit. F\u2019s moral blameworthiness is heightened because he knowingly decided to exploit the mother\u2019s relationship of trust and thus was complicit in the mother\u2019s breach of trust. Even if the mother had not stood in a position of trust, the fact that F coordinated the sexual violence against the victim with the mother would be an aggravating factor. The sentencing judge properly weighed the mitigating factors against the aggravating factors and the need to prioritize denunciation and deterrence as well as separation of F from society because of the high risk he posed to children. This all supported a reasoned and principled basis to impose a substantial custodial term.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>NOTE</strong>:\u00a0 this  document contains details about sexual violence against a child that may be  upsetting to some readers.<strong>Courts should impose tougher punishments for sexual  crimes against children, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   Mr. Friesen met a woman online. One night, he was at the  woman\u2019s home. The woman\u2019s friend was also there, babysitting the woman\u2019s two  kids. Mr. Friesen and the woman had sex. He then told her to bring her four-year-old  daughter to the bedroom so he could do something sexually violent to her. The  woman carried her sleeping daughter into the room and put her on the bed. The child  woke up. She started to cry. She tried to get away. Mr. Friesen was hurting  her. The woman\u2019s friend woke up. She came and took the child away. Mr. Friesen  told the woman to bring the child back. He said if she didn\u2019t do it, he would  tell the friend that the woman had sexually assaulted her one-year-old son. But  the friend confronted Mr. Friesen, and he left. The woman recorded everything  on her phone. Mr.  Friesen pleaded guilty to sexual interference (touching someone under 16  in a sexual way). He also pleaded guilty to trying to extort the woman  (threatening her to make her do something). The judge who decided the sentence said Mr. Friesen  should go to prison for six years. He got six years by comparing Mr. Friesen\u2019s  case to another case. That case said a sentence should start at four to five  years. The Court of Appeal said the judge made a mistake. It said he shouldn\u2019t  have relied on the other case as a starting point, because the facts were  different. In that other case, there was a \u201crelationship of trust\u201d between the  child and the abuser. A \u201crelationship of trust\u201d is a relationship where the adult  should protect the child and keep them safe. For example, a parent-child or  teacher-student relationship. Violating a relationship of trust is very  serious. The Court of Appeal said Mr. Friesen didn\u2019t have a relationship of  trust with the child. It said he should go to prison for four and a half years. The  judges at the Supreme Court were unanimous. All the judges said the original six-year  sentence should stand. Given the facts, they said six years was actually a light  sentence. Protecting  children is one of the basic values of Canadian society. In 2012, over half of  victims of sexual crimes reported to police were under 18. These crimes are  often hidden because they are often done in homes, by someone the child knows  and trusts.  Our  understanding of sexual violence against children has changed over the years.  Parliament made punishments for sexual crimes tougher. It also said judges  should focus on preventing and condemning sexual crimes against children when  deciding sentences. The Supreme Court judges said that sentences have to  reflect the harm to the child, which can last a lifetime, and might not be  fully known right away. They said sentences also have to reflect society\u2019s  deeper understanding of the wrongfulness of sexual violence against children. The  Supreme Court judges said courts should start giving higher sentences for  sexual crimes against children. They said longer sentences (for example, ten  years or more) shouldn\u2019t be unusual. They said sexual crimes against children  should be punished more severely than sexual crimes against adults. They noted  Parliament made the maximum sentences the same for sexual interference and  sexual assault of a child, so one isn\u2019t less serious than the other. The judges  set out a list of factors to help lower courts decide an appropriate sentence.  They didn\u2019t create strict ranges or starting points, though. They said courts  of appeal should do this because they know their local situations best.  Some  people said using starting points (instead of ranges) for sentences caused  problems. But the Supreme Court didn\u2019t decide on this. The judges said they  would wait for a more appropriate case. The  Supreme Court judges said appeal courts should only change a sentence if the  sentencing judge made a legal mistake. But in this case, the sentencing judge  considered the facts properly and there was no mistake. Sexual crimes  against children are serious and widespread. These crimes are the original  basis of many cases that come to the Supreme Court. The actual legal issues  appealed may be different, though.

There was no question that C drove in an objectively dangerous manner and committed the actus reus of the charged offence. However, the trial judge had a reasonable doubt about whether C had the requisite guilty mind or mens rea. The Court of Appeal found the trial judge committed an error of law in finding that C lacked the requisite mens rea, set aside the acquittal and entered a conviction. The sole issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge made an error of law, which would allow the Crown to appeal C\u2019s acquittal under s.\u00a0676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Karakatsanis\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, the Crown can only appeal an acquittal on a question of law alone. An appealable error must be traced to a question of law, rather than a question about how to weigh evidence and assess whether it meets the standard of proof. Therefore, the Crown cannot appeal merely because an acquittal is unreasonable. In this case, the trial judge made two inter\u2011related errors of law: he erred by applying a wrong legal principle and most importantly, by failing to apply the correct legal test by not assessing what a reasonable person would have foreseen and done in C\u2019s circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Firstly, the trial judge\u2019s fixation on the momentariness of the speeding demonstrates an error of law. Momentary excessive speeding on its own can establish the mens rea for dangerous driving where, having regard to all the circumstances, it supports an inference that the driving was the result of a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have exhibited. The trial judge erred in focusing on the momentary nature of C\u2019s conduct, rather than analyzing whether the reasonable person would foresee the dangers to the public from the momentary conduct. A brief period of rapidly changing lanes and accelerating towards an intersection is not comparable to momentary mistakes that may be made by any reasonable driver. The fact that foreseeable consequences occur within a short period of time after someone engages in highly dangerous behaviour cannot preclude a finding of mens rea for dangerous driving.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Secondly, the trial judge did not apply the correct legal test. This is not merely a matter of the trial judge failing to write out his thought process, but rather a matter of the trial judge not turning to the core question at issue: whether the dangerous manner of driving was the result of a marked departure from the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised in the same circumstances. Instead of focussing on what a reasonable person would have foreseen and done in the circumstances, the trial judge engaged in reasoning focussed on the type (speeding) and duration (momentariness) of C\u2019s conduct, to the exclusion of the full picture. Concerning the required mental element, it is not necessary to find that C was subjectively aware of the risk of his conduct and intentionally created this risk. The test for mens rea is based on the reasonable person. A reasonable person would have foreseen the immediate risk of reaching a speed of almost three times the speed limit while accelerating towards a major city intersection. C\u2019s conduct in these circumstances is a marked departure from the norm.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the acquittal restored. The trial judge\u2019s decision to acquit C is not tainted by an identifiable legal error. The Court has emphasized that there is no ground of \u201cunreasonable acquittal\u201d open to the Crown on appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Read fairly and as a whole, the trial judge\u2019s reasons disclose that the trial judge was aware that both excessive speed and momentary conduct could meet the marked departure standard, depending on the circumstances. Questions about whether the trial judge should have placed less weight on the short duration of speeding, and more weight on the degree to which speeding exceeded the limit, where the speeding occurred, or on other factors relating to C\u2019s control of the car and awareness, are not questions of law alone. The trial judge understood that what represents a marked departure in the circumstances is a matter of degree, and that the mens rea test is fundamentally comparative. Inferring that the trial judge failed to compare C\u2019s conduct to that of a reasonable person because he did not explicitly describe what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances is tantamount to presuming that he misunderstood the applicable legal principles. The trial judge was ultimately left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the manner of driving met the mens rea standard. Whether his decision to acquit on that basis was reasonable under the circumstances is not an issue in a Crown appeal such as this one.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Excessive speeding can be dangerous driving, even if it\u2019s just for a few  seconds, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   In  2015, Mr. Chung was driving down a street in Vancouver. The speed limit was 50  km/h. Over the span  of one block, just before a major intersection, Mr. Chung moved into the curb  lane. He passed at least one car on the right and dodged another while  accelerating to 140 km/h. He hit a car that was turning left. The driver  of the other car died. Mr. Chung was charged with dangerous driving causing  death. To be guilty of a crime, a person must <em>do</em> something that is against the (criminal) law. This is called the \u201c<em>actus reus</em>,\u201d which means \u201cguilty act\u201d in  Latin. But something has to make the person <em>responsible</em> for what they\u2019ve done. This is called the \u201c<em>mens  rea</em>,\u201d which means \u201cguilty mind\u201d in Latin. For many crimes, <em>mens  rea</em> is based on intent. But for some crimes, a person can be responsible  even if they don\u2019t mean to do anything wrong. In these cases, a judge doesn\u2019t have  to look at what the person themselves was thinking. Instead, they will look at  what an ordinary, sensible person (a \u201creasonable person\u201d) would have done. If the  actions of the accused person and the \u201creasonable person\u201d are very different, this  is called a \u201cmarked departure from the standard of care.\u201d This \u201cmarked  departure\u201d is the <em>mens rea</em> for crimes  like dangerous driving causing death. The <em>actus reus</em> for this crime is driving  in a way that is dangerous to the public and that results in death.  The trial judge said Mr. Chung\u2019s extreme speeding over a short distance met  the requirement for the <em>actus reus</em>.  But he didn\u2019t think Mr. Chung had the <em>mens  rea</em> or guilty mind. He said the brief period of speeding, on its own,  wasn\u2019t enough to establish the <em>mens rea </em>for  dangerous driving causing death. The Crown appealed. When someone is found not guilty, the Crown can only  appeal if the judge made a legal error. It can\u2019t appeal just because the decision  is unreasonable. The Crown said the trial judge made legal errors in this case. The Court of Appeal agreed that the trial judge made a legal error by concluding  that speeding over a short period of time wasn\u2019t enough to show a \u201cmarked  departure.\u201d Since the trial judge made all the necessary findings of fact, the  Court of Appeal could find that Mr. Chung had the <em>mens rea</em> for dangerous driving. Without the error, the trial judge  would have found Mr. Chung guilty. So the Court of Appeal replaced the \u201cnot  guilty\u201d finding with \u201cguilty.\u201d\r\n   The majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada agreed that the trial  judge made legal errors. They  said the trial judge focused on comparing what Mr. Chung did to specific things  people had been found guilty for in other cases. He also focused on the fact  that his speeding was for a short period of time. But these weren\u2019t the right  things to focus on. The trial judge should have looked at whether a reasonable  person would have foreseen a danger to the public and what they would have done  in the situation. The trial judge should have compared this to what Mr. Chung  did, and then decided if his conduct was a \u201cmarked departure.\u201d The  majority said that Mr. Chung\u2019s conduct was a \u201cmarked departure.\u201d They said a  reasonable person would have foreseen that quickly accelerating toward a major intersection at a high  speed would create a risk, almost immediately, of hurting someone.  The majority of judges  said that a reasonable person understands that driving, by nature, is risky.  They said the faster someone drives, the harder they accelerate, and the more  aggressively they deal with traffic, the more risky it becomes. They said that  even careful driving can have tragic results. But some conduct is so dangerous  it deserves criminal punishment, like in this case. The majority confirmed that  Mr. Chung was guilty of dangerous driving causing death. The Supreme Court  needs to give permission to hear appeals in most cases. One exception is when a  Court of Appeal overturns a \u201cnot guilty\u201d decision. That\u2019s what happened in this  case, so Mr. Chung had a right to appeal without permission. This is called an  appeal \u201cas of right.\u201d"

The evidence and argument at his trial concluded on January\u00a021, 2016. The trial judge reserved judgment. After inquiring as to the status of K\u2019s case, the parties were informed on September\u00a030, 2016, that the trial judge would render his decision on October\u00a025, 2016. The trial judge rendered his decision as planned and convicted K. However, the day before, K filed a motion seeking a stay of proceedings on the basis that the delay between the date the charges were laid and the date the verdict was to be rendered was unreasonable and infringed his s.\u00a011(b) Charter right to be tried within a reasonable time. The trial judge recused himself from the stay motion. The motion judge dismissed K\u2019s motion, finding that neither the verdict deliberation time taken by the trial judge, nor the delay between the charge and the last day of trial, breached K\u2019s s.\u00a011(b) rights. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed K\u2019s appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Although the right to be tried within a reasonable time enshrined in s.\u00a011(b) extends beyond the end of the evidence and argument at trial and encompasses verdict deliberation time, the presumptive ceilings established by the Court in Jordan do not. Where an accused claims that the trial judge\u2019s verdict deliberation time breached their s.\u00a011(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time, they must establish that the deliberations took markedly longer than they reasonably should have in all of the circumstances. The burden on the accused is a heavy one due to the operation of the presumption of judicial integrity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The presumptive ceilings established in Jordan were not intended to cover the entire period of time to which s.\u00a011(b) applies. Properly construed, the Jordan ceilings apply from the date of the charge until the actual or anticipated end of the evidence and argument. They represent a specific solution designed to address a specific problem: the culture of complacency towards excessive delay associated with bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. There is no suggestion in this case, nor was there any suggestion in Jordan, that delay arising from verdict deliberation time contributes to the systemic problem that Jordan sought to address. Further, a host of practical problems would arise if the presumptive ceilings were to include verdict deliberation time, which would run counter to Jordan\u2019s goals of clarity and predictability.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When assessing whether an accused person\u2019s right to be tried within a reasonable time has been infringed by reason of delay occasioned by verdict deliberation time, the question to be asked is whether the deliberation time took markedly longer than it reasonably should have in all of the circumstances. This test should be approached in light of the presumption of integrity from which judges benefit. The presumption of judicial integrity operates in this context to create a presumption that the trial judge balanced the need for timeliness, trial fairness considerations, and the practical constraints they faced, and took only as much time as was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to render a just verdict. The burden lies on the accused to rebut this presumption by explaining why, in all the circumstances of the case, the verdict deliberation time was markedly longer than it reasonably should have been. The threshold is high because of the considerable weight that the presumption of integrity carries.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In conducting this objective assessment, the reviewing court should consider all of the circumstances. Some relevant considerations include: the length of the verdict deliberation time; how close to the relevant Jordan ceiling the case was before the trial judge reserved judgment; the complexity of the case; and anything on the record from the judge or the court. It may also be helpful to compare the length of time taken with the time that a case of a similar nature in similar circumstances would typically take to be decided.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Taking into account all of the circumstances, K has not met his onus of establishing that his right to be tried within a reasonable time under s.\u00a011(b) was violated. While this case is close to the line, the time taken by the trial judge to arrive at his verdict was not markedly longer than it reasonably should have been in all of the circumstances. The most important feature of this case is that K\u2019s trial and a substantial portion of the trial judge\u2019s verdict deliberation time occurred before the release of the Court\u2019s decision in Jordan. The trial judge\u2019s pre\u2011Jordan assessment of the requisite balance between the need for timeliness, fair trial considerations, and the practical constraints he faced was reasonable at the time. Although the end of evidence and argument occurred close to the 30\u2011month ceiling, the proximity of a transitional case (like this one) to the Jordan ceilings cannot inform whether the verdict deliberation time taken was reasonable. That said, had Jordan been available to the trial judge when he took K\u2019s case under reserve, the case\u2019s proximity to the ceiling would no doubt have been a factor that he would have considered in assessing how much time he reasonably needed to render his verdict. The impossibility of taking this consideration into account pre\u2011Jordan should not be held against him. Additionally, the motion judge did not err in finding that, once the reserve time is subtracted from the total delay to verdict, this case constitutes a transitional exceptional circumstance pursuant to Jordan.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella\u00a0J.: There is agreement with the majority\u2019s disposition of the appeal and most of its analysis. However, there is no basis for requiring an accused to rebut the presumption of judicial integrity to show deliberative delay to be unreasonable. The objective and contextual factors laid out by the majority for determining whether the deliberation time took markedly longer than it reasonably should have do not require assessing the judge\u2019s integrity. The \u201cmarkedly longer\u201d standard already creates a high threshold. Adding an additional, conceptually irrelevant, burden on the accused of demonstrating that the trial judge acted without integrity elevates the burden to an impossible threshold.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Moreover, the majority appears to have eliminated the role of the reasonable person in the assessment of whether the presumption has been rebutted. Eliminating the role of the reasonable person, a key feature of the assessment of whether the presumption of judicial integrity has been rebutted, compounds the weight of the accused\u2019s burden by essentially requiring the reviewing court to make a direct finding about the judge\u2019s subjective state of mind and integrity. The test for unreasonable deliberative delay would be more effective and fair, and more consistent with Jordan, if it assessed only the objective and contextual factors for the delay, without the added hurdle of having to rebut the presumption of judicial integrity.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The right to be tried in a reasonable time protects accused persons when  trial judges take too long to render their  decisions, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n   The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>is  part of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Under section 11(b), anyone charged with a crime  has the right to be tried in a reasonable time. It protects both people accused  of crimes and society. Long criminal trials cause suffering and frustration for  everyone involved. People accused of crimes often sit in jail while waiting for  their trial. Victims and their families are left waiting for a final decision.  The public waits longer to see justice done. The right to be tried in a  reasonable time is important. If an accused person\u2019s trial takes too long, it can  be stopped. This is called a \u201cstay of proceedings.\u201d It means there won\u2019t be a  verdict of guilty or not guilty. In  July 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada decided an important appeal, <em><a href=\"https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do\">R. v.  Jordan</a></em>. <em>Jordan</em> set out rules to decide how long is too long for a criminal trial. It said that  most trials should finish either 18 or 30 months after a person is charged,  depending on the type of trial. <em>Jordan </em>tells  judges to \u201cpresume\u201d (accept as true) that anything longer is \u201cunreasonable,\u201d  unless there is something unusual to justify it. (In this context,  \u201cunreasonable\u201d basically means \u201ctoo long.\u201d) If the time taken was unreasonable,  the proceedings have to be \u201cstayed.\u201d <em>Jordan</em> also set out  special rules for cases like K.G.K.\u2019s, which had already started when the rules  changed. These were called \u201ctransitional\u201d cases.  In  2013, K.G.K. was charged with sexual crimes against a child. His trial finished  in January 2016. The trial judge took nine months to decide the case. In  October 2016, he found K.G.K. guilty. The day before, K.G.K. asked for a stay  of proceedings. He said that his case had taken longer than the usual 30-month  maximum. He said the trial judge had taken too long to give his decision. The  Crown (the prosecution) argued that the time taken was reasonable because  K.G.K.\u2019s case was \u201ctransitional\u201d. It said the trial judge\u2019s decision-making  time didn\u2019t count toward the <em>Jordan</em> time limit. The  judge who dealt with K.G.K.\u2019s request for a stay said the trial judge\u2019s time  shouldn\u2019t be counted under <em>Jordan</em>. A  majority of the Court of Appeal agreed. All  the judges at the Supreme Court agreed that the time a trial judge takes to  decide a case doesn\u2019t count toward the <em>Jordan </em>time limit.<strong> </strong>The majority said at  the time <em>Jordan </em>was decided, there  was a real problem with delays in getting people to trial. The criminal justice  system had become too accepting of those delays. But there wasn\u2019t any evidence  of a problem with the time trial judges were taking to give their decisions. So <em>Jordan </em>didn\u2019t deal with that. The  majority created a new approach to decide if a trial judge has taken too long  to give their decision. It said that trial judges should be presumed to take  only the time necessary to deliver a fair decision. Trial judges know that criminal  charges should be dealt with as quickly as possible. As the people dealing with  all the evidence and arguments, they are in the best position to figure out how  long they need to decide the case. Still, sometimes trial judges take too long.  If the accused can show that the trial judge took \u201cmarkedly longer\u201d (a lot  longer) than was reasonably necessary to make their decision, the proceedings  will be stayed.  In  this case, the majority said the trial judge took a long time, but not \u201cmarkedly longer\u201d than he should have. It also noted  that the whole trial, and a lot of the time the trial judge took to decide,  happened before <em>Jordan</em> came out. The  majority said if this case had happened after <em>Jordan</em>, its decision would likely have been different. Besides the  time the judge took, the majority said that any other delay in K.G.K.\u2019s case  was reasonable. This was because his case was \u201ctransitional.\u201d\r\n     This was one of two  cases heard during the Supreme Court\u2019s <a href=\"/court-cour/events-evenements/winnipeg/index-eng.aspx\">visit  to Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba in September 2019. It was the first time in  history the Court sat outside of Ottawa."

In 1997, the Toronto\u2011Dominion Bank offered M a loan for up to $10.5\u00a0million. The loan also contemplated and required the existence of a forward contract as part of the pledge. A forward contract is a type of derivative contract that creates an obligation for one party to sell, and another party to buy, an underlying asset at a pre\u2011determined future date and at a pre\u2011determined price.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Shortly before signing the loan and pledge agreements to gain access to the loan, M entered into the forward contract with TD Securities Inc. The assets underlying the forward contract were 165,000 Bank of Nova Scotia shares, the same number of shares M eventually pledged as collateral for the loan. The forward contract was to be cash settled and was structured so that M would make money if the Bank of Nova Scotia stock price decreased. M was required to pledge Bank of Nova Scotia shares and any cash settlement payments he was entitled to receive from the forward contract as security for the loan. M entered into the forward contract with TD Securities Inc. on June\u00a026, 1997.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 During the life of the forward contract, the price of Bank of Nova Scotia shares increased and M made cash settlement payments totaling approximately $10\u00a0million. In computing his income for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 taxation years, M characterized the cash settlement payments as income losses deductible against income from other sources. The Minister of National Revenue reassessed M and characterized the cash settlement payments as capital losses on the basis that the forward contract was a hedge of the Bank of Nova Scotia shares. M filed notices of objection based on the position that he used the forward contract for speculation, not hedging. The Tax Court concluded that the forward contract was a speculative instrument such that the cash settlement payments were properly characterized as losses on account of income. The Federal Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal, holding that the forward contract was a hedge of M\u2019s Bank of Nova Scotia shares and, therefore, the cash settlement payments were capital losses.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, Brown, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: Whether gains and losses from derivative contracts are to be characterized as on income account or on capital account depends on whether the contract is considered a hedge or speculation. A hedge is generally a transaction which mitigates risk, while speculation is the taking on of risk with a view to earning a profit. Gains and losses arising from hedging derivative contracts take on the character of the underlying asset, liability or transaction being hedged.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The characterization of a derivative contract turns on the contract\u2019s purpose. While subjective manifestations of purpose may sometimes be relevant, the taxpayer\u2019s stated intention is not determinative. The primary source of ascertaining a derivative contract\u2019s purpose is the linkage between the derivative contract and any underlying asset, liability or transaction purportedly hedged.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The linkage analysis begins with the identification of an underlying asset, liability or transaction which exposes the taxpayer to a particular financial risk, and then requires consideration of the extent to which the derivative contract mitigates or neutralizes the identified risk. The more effective the derivative contract is at mitigating or neutralizing the identified risk and the more closely connected the derivative contract is to the item purportedly hedged, the stronger the inference that the purpose of the derivative contract was to hedge. Perfect linkage is not required to conclude that the purpose of a derivative contract was to hedge and the method by which a derivative contract is settled is not determinative of linkage or, ultimately, purpose. The relationship between the derivative contract and transactions or assets outside of the derivative contract will very often be relevant.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While M did not immediately sell his Bank of Nova Scotia shares to offset his losses under the forward contract, the absence of a synchronous transaction used to offset gains or losses arising from a derivative contract is not equivalent to the absence of risk and is not, by itself, determinative of the characterization of a derivative contract. In this case, the substantial linkage between the forward contract and the Bank of Nova Scotia shares fully supports the conclusion that the forward contract was a hedge. The forward contract had the effect of nearly perfectly neutralizing fluctuations in the price of Bank of Nova Scotia shares, pointing to the necessary linkage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The purpose of the forward contract as a hedging instrument is most apparent when one considers the forward contract alongside the loan and pledge agreements. The loan and pledge agreements are part of the context relevant to ascertaining the purpose of the forward contract. They gave M access to a large credit facility but required him to maintain the forward contract and to pledge, as collateral, Bank of Nova Scotia shares and all cash settlement payments owed to him pursuant to the forward contract. The credit available to M could not exceed 95 percent of the value of his pledged Bank of Nova Scotia shares, and the shares pledged as collateral matched the shares contemplated by the forward contract. This arrangement allowed M access to a large credit facility on attractive terms. It also allowed Toronto\u2011Dominion Bank to provide the credit facility with the guarantee of collateral that was free from market fluctuation risk, since if the price of Bank of Nova Scotia shares increased, the value of M\u2019s pledged shares would increase proportionally, but if the price decreased, M would be entitled to an offsetting cash settlement payment which would automatically be pledged as collateral.\u00a0This arrangement reveals the necessary linkage between M\u2019s Bank of Nova Scotia shares and the forward contract to indicate a hedging purpose.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The cash settlement payments arising from the forward contract derive their income tax treatment from the underlying Bank of Nova Scotia shares, which the parties agree were held by M on account of capital.\u00a0When considered in its full and proper context, it is clear that the purpose of the forward contract was to hedge against market price fluctuations that M\u2019s Bank of Nova Scotia shares were exposed to.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the trial judge\u2019s order restored. There is disagreement with the majority regarding the meaning of intent, the majority\u2019s interference with the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and the relationship between the forward contract and M\u2019s arrangements with other entities. There is no basis for intervening in the trial judge\u2019s finding that M intended to speculate and not to hedge.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The tax characterization of the forward contract turns on the taxpayer\u2019s intent, which is determined by reviewing the taxpayer\u2019s subjective statements of intent and objective manifestations of intent. Neither the objective nor the subjective element is determinative on its own. A hedge may exist for tax purposes despite the absence of a synchronous transaction used to offset gains or losses arising from a derivative contract due to ownership risk. Ownership risk is a concept which recognizes that the owner of an asset is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the value of the asset, notwithstanding that the owner does not intend to sell the asset (and thereby incur a transactional risk).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority adopts a test which purports to be similarly anchored on a taxpayer\u2019s subjective statements and objective manifestations of intent. However, its analysis looks only to the economic effects of the derivative instrument in order to ascertain its tax character. The majority\u2019s test will introduce a significant degree of uncertainty into the tax treatment of derivative instruments, because a test which is in effect based solely on risk mitigation will have extensive repercussions for the taxation of financial derivatives.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is disagreement with the majority on its treatment of the forward contract between M and TD Securities Inc. as an indistinguishable component of the credit facility and the securities pledge agreement between M and Toronto\u2011Dominion Bank. It is not a court\u2019s role to prevent taxpayers from relying on the sophisticated structure of their transactions by imposing tax according to the transactions true economic and commercial effects. The tax character of the losses from the forward contract is not affected by M\u2019s arrangements with other entities. The forward contract must be considered separately from the credit facility and the securities pledge agreement. Further, in tax characterization cases, it is the intention of the taxpayer which the court is concerned with, not the intention of other entities on the other side of the taxpayer\u2019s transaction. Therefore, Toronto\u2011Dominion Bank\u2019s interest in mitigating the risk of the Bank of Nova Scotia shares is not relevant. In order for the forward contract to constitute a hedge, it and M\u2019s ownership risk in the Bank of Nova Scotia shares must stand on their own.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is further disagreement with the majority\u2019s three purported legal errors which they impute to the trial judge. Regarding the first error, the majority\u2019s critique amounts to a difference of opinion as to the weight to be ascribed to the forward contract\u2019s mode of settlement and to M\u2019s evidence. The trial judge correctly identified and applied the relevant legal principles. She did not treat the mode of settlement as determinative. She did not treat M\u2019s statements of intent as determinative. There is no basis for the Court to intervene. The second of the purported errors is based on a flawed reading of the trial judge\u2019s reasons. The trial judge did not deny that the law recognizes the concept of ownership risk. Rather, she found as a matter of fact that a short\u2011term ownership risk was not a material concern to M and did not therefore inform his conduct or his intentions. With respect to the final purported error, the trial judge\u2019s reasons must be considered as a whole. She did not focus solely on the absence of ownership risk. Rather, she considered a number of objective factors and made findings of credibility and reliability which are owed deference on appeal.\u00a0Absent an extricable legal error, her factual findings that M had intended to speculate and that he had objectively manifested that intent are findings of fact that can be reviewed only for a palpable and overriding error.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Turning to the question of linkage, while the timing connection and quantum connections are imperfect, during its existence the forward contract achieved a theoretical partial economic hedge of M\u2019s ownership risk in the Bank of Nova Scotia shares. However, economic realities are not the end of the analysis. M\u2019s conduct was more consistent with that of a speculator than of a hedger, because the forward contract was cash\u2011settled and the forward contract was an isolated transaction. On balance, the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact should not be overturned on the application of a deferential standard of review, because, while some of the objective economic indicators are consistent with an intent to hedge, there are also objective circumstances that suggest an intent to speculate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the final analysis, the Court should not disregard a unanimous precedent, applicable standards of review, findings of fact and a trial judge\u2019s assessment of credibility in order to square a theoretical economic hedge into the round hole of an intention\u2011based test.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v.

        "summary": "<strong>How a taxpayer uses a \u201cderivative contract\u201d determines how it is treated  for tax purposes, the Supreme Court has ruled. </strong>\r\n   Mr. MacDonald had  worked in finance and owned a large number of shares. He started a business. He  got a loan from his bank. He used some shares to \u201csecure\u201d part of the loan. If  he couldn\u2019t pay back what he borrowed, the bank could take the shares as \u201csecurity.\u201d  He could borrow up to 95% of the value of the shares. This was over $10  million.  Mr. MacDonald and his  bank also signed a \u201cforward contract\u201d covering the shares. A forward contract  is an agreement to buy (or sell) something at a specific price on a future  date. It is a kind of \u201cderivative contract,\u201d which is a contract based on an  \u201cunderlying asset\u201d (in this case, the shares). These kinds of contracts are  common in the financial world. Forward contracts can be for \u201cspeculation\u201d or  for \u201chedging.\u201d \u201cSpeculation\u201d is when someone invests in something that  increases their risk, hoping for a high return. It is more like gambling.  \u201cHedging\u201d is when someone invests in something to reduce risks of price changes  in something else. It is more like insurance. In this case, if the  value of the shares went up, Mr. MacDonald agreed to pay the difference between  the new price and the price in the forward contract. If the value of the shares  went down, the bank would pay him. The money Mr. MacDonald got would be used as  extra security for the loan. The price of the shares  increased. Mr. MacDonald paid his bank about $10 million. These payments were  \u201ccash settlement payments\u201d under the forward contract. The issue in this case  was how Mr. MacDonald claimed the cash settlement payments on his income tax.  Under the <em>Income Tax Act</em>, there are  two basic categories of earnings. The first category is ordinary income from  things like employment and business. The second is capital gains or losses,  which are the profits (or losses) you get from selling something for more (or  less) than you paid for it. How gains and losses are treated can make a big  financial difference for a taxpayer. Whether the payments from the forward  contract were income losses or capital losses depended on whether the forward  contract was a hedge or speculation. Mr. MacDonald said he  was using the forward contract to speculate. This meant the payments he made  should be deducted from his business income. Canada Revenue Agency said he was  using the forward contract to hedge. This meant the payments were capital  losses. The  Tax Court said the forward contract was speculation. The Federal Court of  Appeal said it was a hedge. The majority of judges  at the Supreme Court said the purpose of a derivative contract determines  whether it is a hedge or speculation. They said the purpose of Mr. MacDonald\u2019s  contract was hedging. This meant the payments were capital losses. To find the  purpose of the forward contract, the majority looked at how closely it was tied  to the shares (the \u201cunderlying asset\u201d). The more closely a derivative contract  is tied to the underlying asset, and the better it is at lowering risk, the  more likely it is to be a hedge. Otherwise, it\u2019s more likely to be speculation. Shares can go up or  down in value over time. But in this case, the majority noted the forward  contract protected Mr. MacDonald from this risk and uncertainty. This  protection was almost perfect. The loan agreement and the agreement to use the  shares as security weren\u2019t part of the forward contract. But the majority said  they were important context for determining the purpose of the forward  contract. Mr. MacDonald had to provide the bank with shares and with any  payments from the forward contract as security for the loan. The amount of money  he could borrow was tied to the value of his shares. The amount of shares he  provided as security for the loan were the same number of shares covered by the  forward contract. This allowed the bank to give Mr. MacDonald a good deal  because it faced very little risk if he didn\u2019t pay back his loan. This arrangement  showed enough of a connection between the contract and the shares to indicate a  hedging purpose. This case started as  a disagreement with Canada Revenue Agency. Tax disagreements can be appealed to  the Tax Court of Canada, which focuses on tax cases."

They claim they were subjected to violent, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The mine is owned by a Canadian company, Nevsun Resources Ltd. The Eritrean workers started proceedings in British Columbia against Nevsun and sought damages for breaches of customary international law prohibitions against forced labour, slavery, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and crimes against humanity. They also sought damages for breaches of domestic torts including conversion, battery, unlawful confinement, conspiracy and negligence. Nevsun brought a motion to strike the pleadings on the basis of the act of state doctrine, which precludes domestic courts from assessing the sovereign acts of a foreign government. Nevsun also took the position that the claims based on customary international law should be struck because they have no reasonable prospect of success. The chambers judge dismissed Nevsun\u2019s motion to strike, and the Court of Appeal agreed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Brown and Rowe JJ. dissenting in part and Moldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis, Gascon and Martin JJ.: The act of state doctrine and its underlying principles as developed in Canadian jurisprudence are not a bar to the Eritrean workers\u2019 claims. The act of state doctrine has played no role in Canadian law and is not part of Canadian common law. Whereas English jurisprudence has reaffirmed and reconstructed the act of state doctrine, Canadian law has developed its own approach to addressing the twin principles underlying the doctrine: conflict of laws and judicial restraint. Both principles have developed separately in Canadian jurisprudence rather than as elements of an all-encompassing act of state doctrine. As such, in Canada, the principles underlying the act of state doctrine have been completely subsumed within this jurisprudence. Canadian courts determine questions dealing with the enforcement of foreign laws according to ordinary private international law principles which generally call for deference, but allow for judicial discretion to decline to enforce foreign laws where such laws are contrary to public policy, including respect for public international law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nor has Nevsun satisfied the test for striking the pleadings dealing with customary international law. Namely it has not established that it is \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that the customary international law claims have no reasonable likelihood of success.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Modern international human rights law is the phoenix that rose from the ashes of World War II and declared global war on human rights abuses. Its mandate was to prevent breaches of internationally accepted norms. Those norms were not meant to be theoretical aspirations or legal luxuries, but moral imperatives and legal necessities. Conduct that undermined the norms was to be identified and addressed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While states were historically the main subjects of international law, it has long-since evolved from this state-centric template. The past 70 years have seen a proliferation of human rights law that transformed international law and made the individual an integral part of this legal domain, reflected in the creation of a complex network of conventions and normative instruments intended to protect human rights and ensure compliance with those rights. The rapid emergence of human rights signified a revolutionary shift in international law to a human-centric conception of global order. The result of these developments is that international law now works not only to maintain peace between states, but to protect the lives of individuals, their liberty, their health, and their education. The context in which international human rights norms must be interpreted and applied today is one in which such norms are routinely applied to private actors. It is therefore not plain and obvious that corporations today enjoy a blanket exclusion under customary international law from direct liability for violations of obligatory, definable, and universal norms of international law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Customary international law is the common law of the international legal system, constantly and incrementally evolving based on changing practice and acceptance. Canadian courts, like all courts, play an important role in its ongoing development. There are two requirements for a norm of customary international law to be recognized as such: general but not necessarily universal practice, and opinio juris, namely the belief that such practice amounts to a legal right or obligation. When international practice develops from being intermittent into being widely accepted and believed to be obligatory, it becomes a norm of customary international law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Within customary international law, there is a subset of norms known as jus cogens, or peremptory norms, from which no derogation is permitted. The workers claim breaches not only of norms of customary international law, but of norms accepted to be of such fundamental importance as to be characterized as jus cogens. Crimes against humanity have been described as among the least controversial examples of violations of jus cogens. Compelling authority confirms that the prohibitions against slavery, forced labour and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment have attained the status of jus cogens. Refusing to acknowledge the differences between existing domestic torts and forced labour, slavery, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and crimes against humanity, may undermine the court\u2019s ability to adequately address the heinous nature of the harm caused by this conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Canada has long followed the conventional path of automatically incorporating customary international law into domestic law via the doctrine of adoption, making it part of the law of Canada. Therefore, customary international law is automatically adopted into domestic law without any need for legislative action. The fact that customary international law is part of our common law means that it must be treated with the same respect as any other law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A compelling argument can therefore be made that since customary international law is part of Canadian common law, a breach by a Canadian company can theoretically be directly remedied. Since the workers\u2019 claims are based on norms that already form part of our common law, it is not \u201cplain and obvious\u201d that our domestic common law cannot recognize a direct remedy for their breach. Appropriately remedying the violations of jus cogens and norms of customary international law requires different and stronger responses than typical tort claims, given the public nature and importance of the violated rights involved, the gravity of their breach, the impact on the domestic and global rights objectives, and the need to deter subsequent breaches.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nevsun has not demonstrated that the Eritrean workers\u2019 claim based on breaches of customary international law should be struck at this preliminary stage. The Court is not required to determine definitively whether the Eritrean workers should be awarded damages for the alleged breaches of customary international law. It is enough to conclude that the breaches of customary international law, or jus cogens, relied on by the Eritrean workers may well apply to Nevsun. Since the customary international law norms raised by the Eritrean workers form part of the Canadian common law, and since Nevsun is a company bound by Canadian law, the claims of the Eritrean workers for breaches of customary international law should be allowed to proceed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown and Rowe JJ. (dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part. There is agreement with the majority that the dismissal of Nevsun\u2019s application to strike the pleadings should be upheld as it regards the foreign act of state doctrine. However, there is disagreement on the matter of the use of customary international law. The workers\u2019 claims for damages based on breach of customary international law disclose no reasonable cause of action and are bound to fail.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Two separate theories have been advanced upon which the pleadings of the Eritrean workers could be upheld. The majority\u2019s theory is that the workers seek to have Canadian courts recognize a cause of action for breach of customary international law and to prosecute a claim thereunder. The second theory is that the workers seek to have Canadian courts recognize four new nominate torts inspired by customary international law: use of forced labour, slavery, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and crimes against humanity. The latter theory is more consistent with the pleadings and with how the workers framed their claims before the Court. Regardless, the workers\u2019 claims are bound to fail on either theory.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The claims are bound to fail on the first theory. On this theory, the workers\u2019 pleading is viable only if international law is given a role that exceeds the limits placed upon it by Canadian law. For this pleading to succeed, then, Canadian law must change. Such a change would require an act of a competent legislature, as it does not fall within the competence of the courts. Without change, the pleading is doomed to fail.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Substantively, the content of customary international law is established by the actions of states on the international plane. A rule of customary international law exists when state practice evidences a custom and the practicing states accept that custom as law. These two requirements are called state practice and opinio juris.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The high bar established by the twin requirements of state practice and opinio juris reflects the extraordinary nature of customary international law: it leads courts to adopt a role otherwise left to legislatures; and, unless a state persistently objects, its recognition binds states to rules to which they have not affirmatively consented. Once a norm of customary international law has been established, it can become a source of Canadian domestic law unless it is inconsistent with extant statutory law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The primacy given to contrary legislation preserves the legislature\u2019s ability to control the effects of international laws in the domestic legal system. If the legislature passes a law contravening a prohibitive norm of international law, that law is not subject to review by the courts. Similarly, if the legislature does not pass a law in contravention of a mandatory norm of international law, the courts cannot construct that law for them, unless doing so is otherwise within the courts\u2019 power. Courts may presume the intent of the legislature is to comply with customary international law norms, but that presumption is rebuttable: customary international law has interpretive force, but it does not formally constrain the legislature. Canada and the provinces have the ability, should they choose to exercise it, to violate norms of customary international law. But that is a choice that only Parliament or the provincial legislatures can make; the federal and provincial governments cannot do so without the authorization of those legislative bodies.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To determine whether a statute prevents amending the common law, courts must precisely identify the norm, determine how the norm would best be given effect and then determine whether any legislation prevents the court from changing the common law to create that effect. If no legislation does, courts should implement that change to the common law. If any legislation does, the courts should respect that legislative choice, and refrain from changing the common law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Procedurally, the content of customary international law is established in Canada by the court first finding the facts of state practice and opinio juris. When there is or can be no dispute about the existence of a norm of customary international law, it is appropriate for the courts to take judicial notice. Courts will also be called on to evaluate both whether there exists a custom generally among states that is applied uniformly, and whether the practicing states respect the custom out of the belief that doing so is necessary in order to fulfil their obligations under customary international law. Once the facts of state practice and opinio juris are found, the second step is to identify which, if any, norms of customary international law must be recognized to best explain these facts. This is a question of law. The final step is to apply the norms, as recognized, to the facts of the case at bar. This is a question of mixed fact and law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applying this structure to the majority\u2019s theory, there is agreement with the majority that: there are prohibitions at international law against crimes against humanity, slavery, the use of forced labour, and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; these prohibitions have the status of jus cogens; individuals and states both must obey some customary international law prohibitions, and it is a question for the trial judge whether they must obey these specific prohibitions; and individuals are beneficiaries of these prohibitions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is, however, disagreement that the majority\u2019s reasons provide a viable path to showing that a corporation may be civilly liable in Canada for a breach of customary international law norms. It is plain and obvious that corporations are excluded from direct liability at customary international law. Corporate liability for human rights violations has not been recognized under customary international law; at most, the proposition that such liability has been recognized is equivocal. Customary international law is not binding if it is equivocal. Absent a binding norm, the workers\u2019 cause of action is clearly doomed to fail.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is unclear how the majority deduces the potential existence of a liability rule from an uncontroversial statement of a prohibition. Perhaps it sees a prohibition of customary international law as requiring Canada to provide domestic liability rules; perhaps it sees the prohibition as itself containing a liability rule; or perhaps it sees the doctrine of adoption as producing a liability rule in response to a prohibition. None of these options provide an interpretation of the majority\u2019s theory of the case that makes the claims viable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The workers did not plead the necessary facts of state practice and opinio juris to support the proposition that a prohibition of customary international law requires states to provide domestic civil liability rules. Indeed, states are typically free to meet their international obligations according to their own domestic institutional arrangements and preferences. A civil liability rule is but one possibility. A prohibition could also be effected through, for example, the criminal law or through administrative penalties.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The workers also did not plead the necessary facts to support the proposition that a prohibition of customary international law itself contains a liability rule. An essay that states it would not make sense to argue that international law may impose criminal liability on corporations, but not civil liability does not constitute state practice or opinio juris. State practice is the difference between civil liability and criminal liability at customary international law. Outside the sphere of criminal law, there is no corresponding acceptance-of-liability rule regarding individuals. For a customary international law prohibition to create a civil liability rule would require there to be widespread state practice that does not exist today.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nor can the doctrine of adoption play the role of converting a general prohibition upon states and criminal prohibitions upon individuals into a civil liability rule. Applying the three-step process for determining whether to amend private common law rules in response to the recognition of a mandatory norm of customary international law, the relevant norms here are that Canada must prohibit and prevent slavery by third parties, mutatis mutandis for each of the claims. Although such norms may exist, they are appropriately given effect through, and only through the criminal law. The criminal law does not provide private law causes of action. Moreover, adopting the norms as crimes cannot be done because Parliament has, in s. 9 of the Criminal Code, clearly prohibited courts from creating criminal laws via the common law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s theory is no more tenable if a step back is taken and it is considered more conceptually. Essentially, the majority\u2019s theory amounts to saying that the doctrine of adoption has what jurists in Europe would call horizontal effect. It would be astonishing were customary international law to have horizontal effect where the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not. The majority\u2019s approach also amounts to recognizing a private law cause of action for simple breach of customary international public law. This would be similarly astonishing, since there is no private law cause of action for simple breach of statutory Canadian public law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nor does the presence of international criminal liability rules make necessary the creation of domestic torts, at least outside the American context. In that country, the hoary and historically unique Alien Tort Statute requires courts to treat international law as creating civil liabilities. Essentially, the majority\u2019s approach would amount to Americanizing the Canadian doctrine of adoption. Canadian courts cannot adopt a U.S. statute when Parliament and the legislatures have not.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While there is agreement that where there is a right, there must be a remedy, the right to a remedy does not necessarily mean a right to a particular form, or kind of remedy. Further, a difference merely of damages or the extent of harm will not suffice to ground a new tort.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Canadian law, as is, furnishes an appropriate cause of action. When there is a breach of rights that is more grave or that needs to be deterred, increased damages are available under existing tort law. Punitive damages have as a goal the denunciation of misconduct. Moreover, a court can express its condemnation of wrongful conduct through its reasons, by stating in them that a party committed human rights abuses, even if the ultimate legal conclusion is that they committed assault, battery or other wrongs. Other states also recognize that such ordinary private law actions provide mechanisms to address the harm arising out of a grave breach of international criminal law. Even were this part of Nevsun\u2019s motion to strike to be granted, the workers could pursue in Canada the same relief they could obtain in most other states.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The only remaining way to support the majority\u2019s theory of the case is for the doctrine of adoption to change so that it provides a civil liability rule for breaches of prohibitions at customary international law. The Court cannot make such a change. Although, it is open to Parliament and the legislatures to make such a change, absent statutory intervention, the ability of the courts to shape the law is, as a matter of common-law methodology, constrained.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Courts develop the law incrementally. For a change to be incremental, it cannot have complex and uncertain ramifications. To alter the doctrine of adoption would set the law on an unknown course whose ramifications cannot be accurately gauged. It is thus for Parliament to decide whether to change the doctrine of adoption to provide courts the power to convert prohibitive rules of international law into free-standing torts. Parliament has not done so.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The claims are also bound to fail on the second theory that the workers sought to have the court recognize four new nominate torts inspired by international law: use of forced labour, slavery, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and crimes against humanity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Three clear rules for when the courts will not recognize a new nominate tort have emerged: where there are adequate alternative remedies; where it does not reflect and address a wrong visited by one person upon another; and where the change wrought upon the legal system would be indeterminate or substantial. The first rule, that of necessity, acknowledges at least three alternative remedies that could make recognizing a new tort unnecessary: an existing tort, an independent statutory scheme, and judicial review. A difference merely of damages or the extent of harm will not suffice. The second rule is reflected in the courts\u2019 resistance to creating strict or absolute liability regimes. The third rule reflects the courts\u2019 respect for legislative supremacy and the courts\u2019 mandate to ensure that the law remains stable, predictable and accessible.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The proposed tort of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment should not be recognized as a new nominate tort, because it is encompassed by the extant torts of battery or intentional infliction of emotional distress. The proposed tort of crimes against humanity also should not be recognized, because it is too multifarious a category to be the proper subject of a nominate tort. It is, however, possible that the proposed torts of slavery and use of forced labour would pass the test for recognizing a new nominate tort.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Nevertheless, these proposed torts should not be recognized for the first time in a proceeding based on conduct that occurred in a foreign territory. In general, tortious conduct abroad will not be governed by Canadian law, even where the wrong is litigated before Canadian courts, except when the foreign state\u2019s law is so repugnant to the fundamental morality of the Canadian legal system as to lead the court not to apply it. Developing Canadian law in such circumstances is inadvisable because the law that is appropriate for regulating a foreign state may not also be law that is appropriate for regulating Canada and because doing so would take courts outside the limits of their institutional competence. The domain of foreign relations is perhaps the most obvious example of where the executive is competent to act, but where courts lack the institutional competence to do so. Setting out a novel tort in the exceptional circumstance of a foreign state\u2019s law being held by the court to be so repugnant to Canadian morality would be an intrusion into the executive\u2019s dominion over foreign relations. The courts\u2019 role within Canada is, primarily, to adjudicate on disputes within Canada, and between Canadian residents.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Not granting the motion to strike in this case offers this lesson: the more nebulous the pleadings and legal theory used to protect them, the more likely they are to survive a motion to strike.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The creation of a cause of action for breach of customary international law would require the courts to encroach on the roles of both the legislature (by creating a drastic change in the law and ignoring the doctrine of incrementalism), and the executive (by wading into the realm of foreign affairs). It is not up to the Court to ignore the foundations of customary international law, which prohibits certain state conduct, in order to create a cause of action against private parties. Nor is it for the courts to depart from foundational principles of judicial law-making in tort law. The result of doing so will be instability and uncertainty.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ. (dissenting): There is agreement with Brown and Rowe JJ.\u2019s analysis and conclusion concerning the workers\u2019 claims inspired by customary international law. It is plain and obvious that they are bound to fail. In addition, the extension of customary international law to corporations represents a significant departure in this area of law. The widespread, representative and consistent state practice and opinio juris required to establish a customary rule do not presently exist to support the proposition that international human rights norms have horizontal application between individuals and corporations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is disagreement with the majority concerning the existence and applicability of the act of state doctrine. The workers\u2019 claims here are not amenable to adjudication within Canada\u2019s domestic legal order. Instead, they are allocated to the plane of international affairs for resolution in accordance with the principles of public international law and diplomacy. They are therefore not justiciable and should be dismissed in their entirety.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is agreement with the majority that Canada\u2019s choice of law jurisprudence plays a similar role to that of certain aspects of the act of state doctrine; however, the act of state doctrine includes a second branch distinct from choice of law which renders some claims non-justiciable. This second branch of the doctrine bars the adjudication of civil actions which have their foundation in allegations that a foreign state has violated public international law. Whether referred to as a branch of the act of state doctrine or as a specific application of the more general doctrine of justiciability, these claims are not justiciable because adjudicating them would impermissibly interfere with the conduct by the executive of Canada\u2019s international relations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Justiciability is rooted in a commitment to the constitutional separation of powers. A court must conform to the separation of powers by showing deference for the roles of the executive and the legislature in their respective spheres so as to refrain from unduly interfering with the legitimate institutional roles of those orders. A court has the institutional capacity to consider international law questions, and its doing so is legitimate, if they also implicate questions with respect to constitutional rights, the legality of an administrative decision or the interface between international law and Canadian public institutions. If, however, a court allows a private claim which impugns the lawfulness of a foreign state\u2019s conduct under international law, it will be overstepping the limits of its proper institutional role. The adjudication of such claims impermissibly interferes with the conduct by the executive of Canada\u2019s international relations. Litigation between private parties founded upon allegations that a foreign state has violated public international law is not the proper subject matter of judicial resolution because questions of international law relating to internationally wrongful acts of foreign states are not juridical claims amenable to adjudication on judicial or manageable standards.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While a court may consider the legality of acts of a foreign state under municipal or international law if the issue arises incidentally, a claim will not be justiciable if the allegation that the foreign state acted unlawfully is central to the litigation. In the instant case, the workers\u2019 claims are not justiciable because the issue of the legality of Eritrea\u2019s acts under international law is central to those claims and requires a determination that Eritrea has committed an internationally wrongful act. As the workers allege that Nevsun is liable because it was complicit in the Eritrean authorities\u2019 alleged internationally wrongful acts, Nevsun can be liable only if the acts of the actual alleged perpetrators \u2014 Eritrea and its agents \u2014 were unlawful as a matter of public international law. Since the workers\u2019 claims, as pleaded, requires a determination that Eritrea has violated international law, they must fail.Cases Cited\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Distinguished: Kazemi Estate v.

        "summary": "<strong>A\u00a0lawsuit against a Canadian company for violations of customary  international law in Eritrea can go forward, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>\r\n     Eritrea  is a country in east Africa. It has a \u201cNational Service Program,\u201d where all  Eritreans have to do military training and military or other public service  when they turn eighteen. But people in this program are forced to work for  years and years on projects supported by military or political party officials. The  Bisha mine was built starting in 2008. It is owned by the Bisha Mining Share  Company. Workers from the National Service Program were used to help build it. They  were forced to work under harsh and dangerous conditions for years. They  weren\u2019t allowed to leave. They were beaten and punished in many ways. Three  workers said they arrived at the Bisha mine between 2008 and 2010. They said  they were forced to work at least twelve hours a day, six days a week, in  temperatures close to 50\u00baC. They escaped Eritrea between 2011 and 2013 and  became refugees.  Nevsun  is a Canadian company based in British Columbia. It owns the Bisha Mining Share  Company. The workers sued Nevsun, saying it was responsible for slavery; forced  labour; cruel, unusual, or degrading treatment; and crimes against humanity.  They said these were violations of \u201ccustomary international law.\u201d They said  customary international law was part of Canadian law. They said that meant Canadian  courts should be able to hold Nevsun responsible for the harm they suffered.  \u201cCustomary  international law\u201d is part of international law. It is like the common law of  the international legal system. Within customary international law, some rules are  so important that no one is allowed to ever break them. These are called  \u201cperemptory norms.\u201d (\u201cPeremptory,\u201d is pronounced per-REMP-torr-ee. Peremptory  norms are rules that can never be avoided). The violations the workers were  claiming were violations of peremptory norms. Nevsun  said British Columbia courts didn\u2019t have the power to rule on the workers\u2019 lawsuit.  It said it was immune because of something called the \u201cact of state doctrine.\u201d This  doctrine says courts in one country aren\u2019t allowed to rule on what another  country does. It had never been applied in Canada before. Nevsun also  said it couldn't be sued for violating customary international law.  The  lower courts said the workers\u2019 lawsuit could go forward.  The  majority of judges at the Supreme Court of Canada said the act of state  doctrine wasn\u2019t part of Canadian law.  The majority said that customary international law is part of Canadian law,  though. It said customary international law becomes part of Canadian law  automatically. This is different than treaty law, which needs Parliament to  pass a law to bring it into force. Because customary international law is part  of Canadian law, courts could, in the right cases, find Canadian companies responsible  for violating it. The majority noted that violations of peremptory norms are serious  violations of rights that are important to everyone, everywhere. They need to  be strongly discouraged. The Court didn\u2019t decide whether Nevsun was responsible  for violating the workers\u2019 rights. It said that the workers\u2019 lawsuit could go  forward. It said that the trial judge would have to decide whether Nevsun  breached customary international law and\u2014if it did\u2014how it should be held  responsible.\r\n  "

They claim to have occupied, since time immemorial, a traditional territory that straddles the border between the provinces of Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador. They allege that the megaproject was built without their consent, and invoke a host of environmental harms which have impeded their activities, depriving them of the enjoyment of their territory. As remedies against these alleged wrongs, the Innu seek, among other things, a permanent injunction against the mining companies ordering them to cease all work related to the megaproject, $900 million in damages, and a declaration that the megaproject constitutes a violation of Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by s.\u00a035 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The mining companies and the Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador each filed a motion to strike from the Innu\u2019s pleading portions of the claim which, in their view, concern real rights over property situated in Newfoundland and Labrador and, therefore, fall under the jurisdiction of the courts of that province.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Superior Court of Quebec dismissed the motions to strike. As it declined to characterize the action as a real action, it held that the Quebec courts had jurisdiction to hear the matter. The Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Abella, Karakatsanis, Gascon and Martin\u00a0JJ.: The Superior Court of Quebec has jurisdiction over the entire claim. The action is properly characterized as a non-classical mixed action that involves the recognition of sui generis rights and the performance of obligations. Since both mining companies are headquartered in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec courts have jurisdiction over the personal and the sui generis aspects of the claim pursuant to art.\u00a03148 and art.\u00a03134 C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Book Ten of the C.C.Q. sets out the rules governing private international law in the province. In the spirit of comity, these rules limit the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities to matters closely linked to the province. The C.C.Q. is silent with respect to the proper analysis for characterizing an action for the purposes of Chapter II, which establishes specific rules of jurisdiction based on the nature of the action in question. In the absence of legislative direction, when characterizing an action, it is the nature of the rights at stake and the conclusions sought that must be considered. The rules of Book Ten must be interpreted in light of the imperatives of our constitutional order and in a manner consistent with the Constitution. Where s.\u00a035 rights are at stake, Book Ten must be interpreted in a manner that respects constitutionally recognized and affirmed Aboriginal rights and treaty rights, and that takes into account access to justice considerations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Aboriginal rights, including the sub\u2011category of Aboriginal title, are sui generis in nature. A sui generis right is a unique one, which it is impossible to fit into any recognized category. Aboriginal title is not to be conflated with traditional civil or common law property concepts, or described using the classical language of property law, as it has unique characteristics that distinguish it from civil law and common law conceptions of property, including features that are incompatible with property as it is understood in the civil law and common law. For example, Aboriginal title is inherently collective and it restricts both the alienability of land and the uses to which land can be put. Aboriginal title is also firmly grounded in the relationships formed by the confluence of prior occupation and the assertion of sovereignty by the Crown, which give rise to obligations flowing from the honour of the Crown that are clearly more akin to personal rights. Disputes involving Aboriginal title must also be understood with reference to Aboriginal perspectives. Section 35 rights are neither real rights nor personal rights as defined in the civil law, nor a combination of the two, but legally distinct sui generis rights.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the context of s.\u00a035 claims that straddle multiple provinces, access to justice requires that jurisdictional rules be interpreted flexibly so as not to prevent Aboriginal peoples from asserting their constitutional rights, including their traditional rights to land. Moreover, the honour of the Crown requires increased attention to minimizing costs and complexity when litigating s.\u00a035 matters. Where a claim of Aboriginal rights or title straddles multiple provinces, requiring the claimant to litigate the same issues in separate courts multiple times would erect gratuitous barriers to potentially valid claims. This would be particularly unjust when the rights claimed pre\u2011date the imposition of provincial borders on Indigenous peoples. The later establishment of provincial boundaries should not be permitted to deprive or impede the right of Aboriginal peoples to effective remedies for alleged violations of these pre\u2011existing rights. Though the provinces have no legislative jurisdiction over s.\u00a035 rights, their courts certainly adjudicate them. Adjudicative jurisdiction over property outside of the province can be conferred in the s.\u00a035 context because it concerns sui generis rights, not real rights, and it operates uniformly across Canada. The determination of whether a claimed Aboriginal or treaty right enjoys constitutional protection under s.\u00a035 is a matter of constitutional law. Neither s.\u00a035 nor constitutional law is foreign to Quebec or its courts.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The claim in the instant case falls into the mixed action category. In order for a Quebec court to have jurisdiction over a classical mixed action, it must have jurisdiction over both the personal and real aspects of the matter. However, this claim is a not a classical mixed action. It is rather a mixed action that involves seeking the recognition of a sui generis right (a declaration of Aboriginal title) and the performance of various obligations related to failures to respect that right (damages in delict and neighbourhood disturbances), that is, a personal aspect. In the context of such a non-classical mixed action, a Quebec court has jurisdiction over both the personal and the sui generis aspects of the claim. Actions in delict and neighbourhood disturbances are generally characterized as personal actions and art.\u00a03148 C.C.Q. grants Quebec authorities jurisdiction over personal actions of a patrimonial nature where the defendant is domiciled in Quebec. With respect to the aspects of the claim that relate to the recognition of a sui generis right, such as a s.\u00a035 right, the C.C.Q. does not include any special provision to establish the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities in such circumstances. Therefore, art.\u00a03134, which states that \u201c[i]n the absence of any special provision, Qu\u00e9bec authorities have jurisdiction when the defendant is domiciled in Qu\u00e9bec\u201d, applies. Given that the mining companies are both headquartered in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction over both aspects of this non\u2011classical mixed action pursuant to arts.\u00a03134 and 3148 C.C.Q., which are sufficient to ground the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the judgments of the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal should be set aside, the motion to strike allegations of the Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador should be allowed in part, and it should be ordered that the conclusions of the Innu\u2019s motion to institute proceedings that are declaratory or injunctive in nature and that relate to their traditional territory or to the megaproject be amended so that they apply only to acts, activities or rights within Quebec\u2019s territory. Aboriginal rights exist within the limits of Canada\u2019s legal system, and Aboriginal rights claims before the courts must not go beyond what is permitted by Canada\u2019s legal and constitutional structure. Finding that the Quebec Superior Court has jurisdiction to issue a declaration recognizing Aboriginal rights in the part of the traditional territory that is situated in Newfoundland and Labrador would have serious consequences for Canadian federalism. Far from promoting access to justice or reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, it would lead to increased litigation and delays, as well as confusion and loss of confidence in our justice system.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The jurisdiction of provincial superior courts is governed first and foremost by the rules of private international law, which in Quebec are set out in the C.C.Q. It is these rules that sometimes authorize provincial superior courts to exercise their powers with respect to persons or property not situated within the province\u2019s territory. It is therefore not possible to disregard these rules and rely solely on an inherent jurisdiction that is, in principle, exercisable only within the province. The rules of private international law are of a different, legislative nature and confer authority. Only these rules can authorize the extraterritorial exercise of a power that otherwise is limited to a single territory.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, the rules of private international law must themselves be consistent with the territorial limits created by the Constitution, which means that they may also be subject to constitutional scrutiny in light of those limits. Canada\u2019s constitutional framework limits the external reach of provincial laws and of a province\u2019s courts. As the Court has already recognized, the Constitution assigns powers to the provinces but limits the exercise of those powers to each province\u2019s territory. These territorial restrictions created by the Constitution are inherent in the Canadian federation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The general criterion for jurisdiction in private international law is the defendant\u2019s domicile, as stated in art.\u00a03134 C.C.Q. However, as that provision expressly indicates, the general rule it states is subsidiary in nature: the rule applies only \u201c[i]n the absence of any special provision\u201d. The special provisions in the C.C.Q. that displace this subsidiary rule govern the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities over personal actions of an extrapatrimonial and family nature (arts.\u00a03141 to 3147 C.C.Q.), personal actions of a patrimonial nature (arts.\u00a03148 to 3151 C.C.Q.) and real or mixed actions (arts.\u00a03152 to 3154 C.C.Q.).\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is therefore necessary to characterize the action in question in order to determine the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities over a case. Private international law must be interpreted on the basis of the lex\u00a0fori, because it is necessary to favour, as a matter of principle, the application of domestic civil law characterizations in private international law. The personal action, real action and mixed action concepts referred to in the special provisions of Title Three of Book\u00a0Ten of the C.C.Q. should therefore be defined on the basis of Quebec law. Because it is inherent in the nature of private international law to be confronted with institutions that are unknown to it, the rules of private international law must be approached with some flexibility so as to include institutions that, although legally distinct, are analogous to the categories recognized by the civil law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal or treaty rights must clearly be considered \u201creal rights\u201d for the purposes of private international law. More specifically, they resemble or are at least analogous to the domestic institution of real rights because they are rights in property, namely the land subject to Aboriginal title, and they are rights enforceable erga\u00a0omnes, that is, against governments and others seeking to use the land. Aboriginal title confers the right to decide how the land will be used, the right of enjoyment and occupancy of the land, the right to possess the land, the right to the economic benefits of the land, and the right to proactively use and manage the land. The fact that Aboriginal title and Aboriginal or treaty rights are sui\u00a0generis in nature does not preclude them from being found to be real rights for the purposes of private international law \u2014 their sui generis nature relates to their source, content and characteristics, which simply cannot be completely explained by reference to the common law or civil law rules of property law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A real action is an action through which a person seeks the recognition or protection of a real right. Because Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal or treaty rights are real rights for the purposes of private international law, it necessarily follows that, in this case, the aspect of the Innu\u2019s action whose purpose is to have such rights recognized and protected constitutes a real action or, at best, a mixed action falling under Division\u00a0III of Chapter\u00a0II of Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 According to well\u2011established jurisprudence, Quebec authorities lack jurisdiction to hear a real action if the property in dispute is situated outside Quebec. Article 3152 C.C.Q. must be read in accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, which applies when interpreting an article of the C.C.Q. It must be read in light of the principles of comity, order and fairness, which inspire the interpretation of the various private international law rules. This article affirms a well\u2011established principle, which is that Quebec authorities lack jurisdiction over an immovable real action where the subject matter of the dispute is situated outside Quebec. It also extends this principle to movable real actions \u2014 in real actions, whether immovable or movable, Quebec authorities lack jurisdiction where the subject matter of the dispute is not situated in Quebec. In particular, the defendant\u2019s domicile does not give them jurisdiction over a real action, regardless of whether the subject matter of the dispute is immovable property or movable property, because art.\u00a03134 C.C.Q. expressly states that this rule applies only in the absence of any special provision. Moreover, art.\u00a03152 provides for the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities where the property in dispute is situated in Quebec, not where all or part of it is situated in Quebec. A different interpretation would amount to rewriting this provision by adding the words \u201call or part of\u201d. Finally, for Quebec authorities to have jurisdiction over a mixed action, the property in dispute must be situated entirely in Quebec, since otherwise they will have no jurisdiction over the real aspect of the dispute. Jurisdiction over the personal aspect of the dispute based, for example, on the defendant\u2019s domicile is therefore not sufficient in the case of a mixed action \u2014 the property in dispute must also be situated in Quebec, as required by art.\u00a03152.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is disagreement with the majority in this case as regards the characterization of the Innu\u2019s action as a \u201cnon\u2011classical\u201d mixed action with a personal aspect and a sui\u00a0generis aspect and as regards the majority\u2019s conclusion that art.\u00a03134 C.C.Q. applies in the absence of any provisions relating specifically to sui\u00a0generis rights. According to that conclusion, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction over both the personal aspect and the sui\u00a0generis aspect of the action because the companies being sued are domiciled in Montr\u00e9al. The rights protected by s.\u00a035 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and in particular Aboriginal title conferring the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes, are a burden first and foremost on the Crown\u2019s underlying title. The characteristics of Aboriginal title flow from the special relationship between the Crown and the Indigenous group in question. It is this relationship that makes Aboriginal title sui\u00a0generis or unique. The Crown is the main defendant in an action for the recognition of Aboriginal title. The majority\u2019s conclusion that the private companies, rather than the Crown, are the defendants in the action for the recognition of Aboriginal rights is therefore highly problematic and distorts the sui\u00a0generis nature of these rights.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is a principle in Quebec private international law to the effect that the jurisdiction of the Quebec court is determined on a case\u2011by\u2011case basis. It is therefore necessary in this case to determine whether the Innu\u2019s action in fact involves claims that are real or mixed in nature because their purpose is to obtain the recognition or protection of Aboriginal title or other Aboriginal or treaty rights, which are real rights for the purposes of private international law; if the action does involve such claims, Quebec authorities lack jurisdiction to grant the claims if they relate to the part of the traditional territory that is situated in Newfoundland and Labrador.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The purpose of the claims for declaratory remedies in the Innu\u2019s motion to institute proceedings is clearly to obtain the recognition of Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal or treaty rights, which are real rights for the purposes of private international law. A declaration is the primary means by which Aboriginal title can be established. However, under art.\u00a03152 C.C.Q., a court may not grant an application for a declaratory judgment with respect to proprietary or possessory rights in immovable property situated abroad because by doing so it would purport to deal directly with title. In this case, even if the declarations sought by the Innu were binding only on the mining companies, the fact remains that the declarations would relate to the title the Innu claim to hold to the traditional territory, including the parts of that territory that are situated outside Quebec. Because of art.\u00a03152, Quebec authorities lack jurisdiction in this regard. If Quebec authorities were to rule directly on the title that the Innu believe they hold to the parts of the traditional territory that are situated outside Quebec, the declarations would be binding on no one, not even on the mining companies, precisely because Quebec authorities lack jurisdiction in this regard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Innu\u2019s claims for a permanent injunction to put a stop to the mining companies\u2019 operations, facilities and activities are also real in nature, because their purpose is clearly to protect Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal or treaty rights, which are real rights for the purposes of private international law. In Quebec law, an injunction is the appropriate procedural vehicle for enforcing one\u2019s right. Therefore, under art.\u00a03152 C.C.Q., a court cannot grant a claim for a permanent injunction relating to immovable property situated outside the province.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The claim for damages against the mining companies \u2014 to the extent that it is based on the alleged infringement of the Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal or treaty rights the Innu claim to hold in the traditional territory \u2014 can be granted only if the Innu are able to obtain the recognition of that Aboriginal title and those other Aboriginal or treaty rights in that territory. However, Quebec authorities do not in fact have the jurisdiction required to hear an action for the recognition of Aboriginal title or other Aboriginal or treaty rights in land not situated in Quebec. It necessarily follows that, as matters stand at present, Quebec authorities must at least stay the proceedings on this point until a competent authority has recognized the existence of those rights in the parts of the traditional territory that are situated in Newfoundland and Labrador.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The remedy under art.\u00a0976 C.C.Q. remains first and foremost a claim that a person has, which makes it a personal action. Because the defendants are domiciled in Quebec and injury has been suffered in Quebec (art.\u00a03148 para.\u00a01(1) and (3) C.C.Q.), Quebec authorities have jurisdiction over this claim.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Lastly, the Innu are claiming various fiduciary remedies or remedies based on administration of the property of others (art.\u00a01299 C.C.Q.) with respect to the mining companies\u2019 works and facilities. These claims are real in nature and, having regard to art.\u00a03152 C.C.Q., Quebec authorities cannot grant them if they relate to works or facilities of the mining companies that are situated in Newfoundland and Labrador.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Given that, as a result of art.\u00a03152 C.C.Q., Quebec authorities lack jurisdiction over the claim for declaratory remedies\u00a0to recognize Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal or treaty rights in land situated in Newfoundland and Labrador, over the claim for a permanent injunction to put a stop to the mining companies\u2019 operations, facilities and activities on land situated in Newfoundland and Labrador, and over the fiduciary claim or the claim based on administration of the property of others with respect to the mining companies\u2019 works and facilities situated in Newfoundland and Labrador, it should be ordered that the conclusions of the Innu\u2019s motion to institute proceedings, and specifically those that are declaratory or injunctive in nature and that relate to the traditional territory or to the megaproject, be amended so that they apply only to acts, activities or rights within Quebec\u2019s territory. However, it should not be ordered that the allegations in the motion to institute proceedings be struck, because the allegations concerning the traditional territory as a whole, including the parts of that territory that are situated in Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the evidence relating thereto, could prove to be relevant during the trial on the merits in order to determine the existence of Aboriginal title and other Aboriginal or treaty rights in Quebec.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 While Aboriginal rights are sui generis, they exist within the general legal system of Canada, and Aboriginal rights claims before the courts must not go beyond what is permitted by the Canadian legal and constitutional structure. The goal of reconciliation between Indigenous peoples\u2019 prior occupation of Canadian territory and Crown sovereignty over that same territory cannot be achieved by recognizing prior occupation by Indigenous peoples on the one hand while disregarding the constitutional principle of federalism and of the sovereignty of the provincial Crown on the other, thereby contravening the well\u2011established principle that one part of the Constitution cannot abrogate another part of the Constitution. The goal of reconciliation must therefore be achieved by accounting not only for the Indigenous perspective \u2014 and thus the prior, borderless occupation of Canadian territory by Indigenous peoples\u00a0\u2014 but also for the constitutional framework that accompanied Crown sovereignty and within which Canadian courts must operate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Holding that superior courts have jurisdiction to decide the s. 35 rights of an Indigenous party as they affect another province implicitly treats the provinces as if they were (at best) administrative units or (at worst) inconvenient technicalities. This is profoundly disrespectful of the constitutional order under which provinces are sovereign within their own jurisdiction. Provincial boundaries are an essential feature of the system of provincial superior courts just as they are an essential feature of provincial legislative power. In particular, the system of provincial superior courts ensures that claims to a province\u2019s land or challenges to a province\u2019s laws must be heard before a judge of that province. Thus, the claims that cut deepest at the heart of a province\u2019s sovereignty will be resolved by a judge connected to the province\u2019s realities. This enhances public confidence in the courts and protects courts\u2019 functioning and legitimacy, particularly if the outcome of the litigation is unfavourable to the province. Section 35 calls on courts to do justice to Aboriginal rights claims that cut across provincial boundaries, but it does not provide a warrant to disregard the provincial boundaries themselves.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The declarations sought in this case are contrary to the Canadian federal structure. Before a court can grant a declaration, it must have jurisdiction to hear the issue. It is unclear how the scope of a declaration of Aboriginal title over land in Labrador could be appropriately limited in a way consistent with the imperatives of Canadian federalism. The Crown is a necessary party in Aboriginal title claims \u2014 and is necessarily implicated when a declaration of Aboriginal title is made. Furthermore, this approach leads to a strong possibility of conflicting judgments and confusion and would allow a superior court in one province to pronounce on Aboriginal title in relation to land located in another province incidentally to an in personam claim. This principle cannot be confined to this case and the provinces implicated in this litigation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Moreover, this approach is incompatible with the principle of Crown immunity. Any claim that asserts Aboriginal title necessarily involves the Crown. Unlike ordinary property disputes which pit private parties against each other within a framework of private law, an Aboriginal title claim cuts to the very root of the Crown\u2019s sovereignty and triggers obligations on the part of the Crown. Not only is the Crown\u2019s presence necessary in principle, it also helps ensure that issues are fairly heard. Private parties cannot be assumed to have any knowledge about the facts of occupation at the time the Crown asserted sovereignty.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, this approach also impedes access to justice. If the impact of the order actually received is uncertain, confusing, or narrower than expected, this is a failure of access to justice. Moreover, access to justice is a precondition to the rule of law. Without procedural adaptations, requiring Indigenous people to bring applications, and to have them heard, in several different forums in order to obtain the recognition and protection of Aboriginal rights in different parts of a single traditional territory that straddles provincial borders creates barriers to access to justice and undermines the efficient and timely adjudication of such claims. However, delivery of efficient, timely and cost\u2011effective resolution of transboundary Aboriginal rights claims must occur within the structure of the Canadian legal system as a whole. Principles of federalism and provincial sovereignty do not preclude development by superior courts, in the exercise of their inherent jurisdiction, of innovative yet constitutionally sound solutions that promote access to justice. Endean\u00a0v. British Columbia, 2016 SCC 42, [2016] 2\u00a0S.C.R. 162, authorizes superior court judges from different provinces to draw on their statutory jurisdiction \u2014 or, where necessary, their inherent jurisdiction \u2014 to sit together and hold a joint hearing on applications that have been brought in the superior courts of more than one province because they seek the recognition and protection of Aboriginal rights in different parts of a single traditional territory that straddles provincial borders. A transboundary Aboriginal rights claim will stand a better chance of being resolved in an efficient, timely and cost\u2011effective manner if the superior court judges sit together for a single joint hearing arising from the joinder of the applications brought in each of the superior courts concerned. In this case, however, the fact that the Innu have not brought applications in each of the superior courts concerned still remains a barrier to the constitutional capacity of the superior courts to appropriately adjudicate their transboundary Aboriginal rights claim.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: St. Lawrence Cement Inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>Quebec courts can decide whether mining harmed an  Indigenous people\u2019s traditional territory, even though part of the territory is  in Newfoundland and Labrador, the Supreme Court has ruled.</strong>The Innu are First Nations. They have lived in what is  now Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador since long before Europeans arrived. Around  1950, a large mining project started. It spanned both provinces. The Innu said  it was on their traditional territory. They said the mining companies didn\u2019t  ask permission to mine there. In 2013, the Innu sued the companies. They said  the project prevented them from enjoying and moving around their territory. The  Innu asked for three things. They asked for the companies to stop work on the  project. They asked the companies to pay them for damages. And they asked the  court to declare they had aboriginal title and other aboriginal rights over  their traditional territory. The Innu sued in Quebec. But they  were asking Quebec courts to make a declaration about aboriginal title and  rights over their whole traditional territory. Part of it is in Newfoundland  and Labrador. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador said Quebec courts  weren\u2019t allowed to make a declaration affecting Newfoundland and Labrador.  The lower courts said Quebec courts could decide all  the issues. The majority of judges at the  Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts. The judges looked at rules about how  courts deal with issues that cross borders. They also looked at the nature of  aboriginal title and rights. Courts in a  province generally can decide cases within their borders. But they have rules  to deal with issues that cross provincial borders. Quebec courts have the power  to decide cases where the person being sued (the defendant) lives in Quebec. This  is true even if the lawsuit is related to something that happened outside  Quebec. The rules are different if the lawsuit is about property outside  Quebec, though. In this case, both mining companies were based in Montreal.  This meant the Innu could ask Quebec courts to make them pay damages and to  stop mining work.  The  majority noted that having aboriginal rights and title to land isn\u2019t the same  as owning property. The concept of property ownership comes from civil and  common law (legal traditions that arrived with Europeans). Aboriginal title is  different. It belongs to a group, not an individual. It\u2019s for the benefit of  future generations, not just the current one. And it can\u2019t simply be sold. Aboriginal  title is really about the relationship between \u201cthe Crown\u201d (Canada) and  Indigenous groups. The Crown has an obligation to act honourably within this  relationship. This is called \u201cthe honour of the Crown.\u201d The majority said the  honour of the Crown must always be interpreted in a way that brings us closer  to reconciliation. Section  35 of the Constitution specifically recognizes aboriginal and treaty rights. It  acknowledges that Indigenous peoples lived in what we now call Canada before  Europeans arrived. It also acknowledges that the Crown has sovereignty (the  power to govern). Section 35 is meant to find a way to work within these two  realities. Since aboriginal rights existed before Crown sovereignty, the  majority said provincial borders shouldn\u2019t affect those rights. That means groups  like the Innu shouldn\u2019t have to fight the same legal battle in courts in  different provinces applying the same law. This would lead to more cost and  confusion. It could even mean the Innu wouldn\u2019t be able to pursue their rights.  This would go against the honour of the Crown. This decision didn\u2019t say whether the  Innu should get what they were asking for. It only said Quebec had the power to  make a declaration about aboriginal rights and title over the Innu\u2019s traditional  territory. Quebec courts could do this even though some of that territory was  in Newfoundland and Labrador. (Quebec courts could still say it was more  appropriate for courts in Newfoundland and Labrador to decide, though.) Even if  the Quebec courts said the project violated the Innu\u2019s aboriginal rights and  title, they couldn\u2019t force Newfoundland and Labrador to do anything. The Innu  would still have to negotiate with the government or go to court in that  province.\u00a0  In this case, the Court looked at reconciliation  and the honour of the Crown. It had to decide how to apply these concepts when  deciding which court had power to decide on aboriginal rights and title. The  Court previously dealt with the honour of the Crown in <em><a href=\"../37441-eng.aspx\">Mikisew Cree First  Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council)</a></em>."

After ending their union, they undertook a mediation process to resolve their disputes with respect to custody and support arrangements for the children, their respective rights in the immovable that served as their residence, and the determination of compensation for I to remedy the impact of childcare responsibilities on her career. Once the process had ended, the mediator recorded his conclusions about what had been agreed upon in mediation in a document called \u201csummary of mediated agreements\u201d. Sometime later, I filed a court action seeking greater financial compensation than was provided for in the summary of mediated agreements. In defence, M argued that the parties had entered into a contract during mediation, the terms of which were set out in the summary. I denied the existence of that contract and objected to the summary being admitted in evidence on the ground that it was protected by the confidentiality of the mediation process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge dismissed I\u2019s objection, relying in part on the exception to settlement privilege recognized in Union\u00a0Carbide Canada Inc. v. Bombardier Inc., 2014 SCC 35, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 800, a commercial mediation case. This exception allows protected communications to be disclosed in order to prove the existence and terms of a settlement. On the basis of the summary and the parties\u2019 post\u2011mediation conduct, the judge found that there was a contract between the parties. I appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeal, though the judges did not agree about the application of the principles enunciated in Union\u00a0Carbide in the family mediation context. I decided not to appeal the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision, but a third party to the original litigation, the Association de m\u00e9diation familiale du Qu\u00e9bec, obtained leave to be substituted as appellant and to appeal the judgment to the Court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown, Rowe and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: The settlement exception generally applies. Having regard to the very nature of family mediation, to its inherent procedural safeguards and to the terms of the standard family mediation contract used in Quebec, it is neither necessary nor desirable, for the protection of vulnerable parties, to establish a rule of absolute confidentiality or to depart from the rule developed in Union\u00a0Carbide relating to the settlement exception. In this case, the parties did not displace this exception in their mediation contract. Where there is no settlement, preserving the absolute confidentiality of communications is an essential aspect of mediation and is necessary to encourage frank discussions. But confidentiality is above all a means to an end: where spouses resolve their dispute, this concern must yield, as far as necessary, to that of giving them the proper tools to implement their agreement. A rule of absolute confidentiality might deflect family mediation from its participatory and consensual foundations and undermine the parties\u2019 adherence to this process for resolving their dispute, or even to the settlement itself. On the whole, to reject the exception recognized in Union\u00a0Carbide in the family context would interfere with the primary objective of family mediation, which is to reach an agreement resolving an existing or anticipated dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The coming into force of the new Code of Civil Procedure in 2016 has resulted in dispute prevention and resolution processes, including family mediation, being recognized as justice processes with the same importance as the traditional court process. This significant shift in Quebec\u2019s legal culture was expressly undertaken by the legislature as an access to justice measure designed to make the system more accessible, faster, less cumbersome and less expensive. Mediation in the broad sense is a process of reaching a decision as a result of dialogue and negotiation assisted or facilitated by a neutral and impartial third party who has no decision\u2011making power and who is freely chosen by the parties to resolve an existing or anticipated dispute in an amicable and mutually acceptable manner and, ideally, to restore or improve the relationship. Family mediation, like the other types of mediation, is also characterized by the self\u2011determination aspect of the process, which is to say that the parties together choose the justice process that will allow them to resolve their dispute in a spirit of cooperation, despite the conflict that remains between them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The special law of family mediation differs from general mediation law in that it does not allow the parties to be accompanied by legal advisers during the sessions, but this is not incompatible with the idea of participatory justice and of an agreement culture. The legislature\u2019s purpose in preventing legal advisers from being present during family mediation sessions is to ensure that the parties really have the floor. Mediation is particularly well\u2011suited to family conflicts in this regard, because it helps to restore better communication between spouses and to preserve their relationship in the future in cases where there are children.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is true that family mediation takes place in a unique context, one that is often charged and emotional, which distinguishes it from civil or commercial mediation. The problem of vulnerability in family mediation is a real one, but procedural safeguards that are inherent in the process serve to counter this vulnerability. Although parties to family mediation do not have the option of being assisted by a lawyer or notary during the sessions, the possibility of consulting a legal adviser at various times during the process exists and is even encouraged. The process is also guided by impartial third parties, who are certified and specially trained to address the psychological and legal needs of spouses and parents. Mediators are subject to strict professional obligations and have, among other things, the power to put an end to the mediation process in order to avoid irreparable prejudice. Moreover, there is no requirement that the parties enter into a contract when the mediation ends. In fact, the standard family mediation contract in Quebec specifically provides that family mediation sessions lead to a proposed agreement that is not binding.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The unsigned summary of mediated agreements, as provided by the mediator at the end of the sessions, is therefore not a contract. Following mediation, the parties will be free to enter into a contract whose terms differ in whole or in part from those recorded by the mediator in the summary. In principle, a summary of mediated agreements, as a simple writing prepared by a third party, is not admissible in court proceedings to prove a juridical act, but a court may not raise this rule of its own motion. In addition, even where a binding agreement is entered into following mediation, it will not be enforceable unless a court has reviewed it to determine its appropriateness, to the extent that it deals with matters of public order like custody of children and child support. This suggests that a binding agreement between spouses arising from family mediation, to the extent that it deals with matters of public order, cannot be a transaction within the meaning of art.\u00a02631 C.C.Q., because no transaction may be made with respect to such matters. It follows that, very often, the parts of an agreement between spouses that do not concern matters of public order cannot be considered separately, because a transaction is indivisible as to its subject. All of these procedural safeguards serve to ensure that vulnerable parties will not unknowingly end up bound by an ill\u2011considered agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Settlement privilege is a rule of evidence that protects the confidentiality of communications and information exchanged for the purpose of settling a dispute. It is recognized as fundamental to the making of an agreement between parties because it promotes honest and frank discussions, which can make it easier to reach a settlement in all types of mediation. The privilege applies without having to be invoked by the parties. Unlike a confidentiality clause in a contract, the privilege applies to all communications that lead up to a settlement, even after a mediation session has concluded. This common law rule is codified in art.\u00a04 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Settlement privilege is not absolute, however. There are some exceptions developed by the courts or established by law that allow confidentiality to be lifted. The settlement exception allows protected communications to be disclosed in order to prove the existence or scope of a settlement arising from mediation. It applies even where an agreement is not entered into until after mediation. In keeping with its purpose, the exception applies only to what is necessary to prove the existence or scope of the settlement. The exception serves the same public interest as the privilege itself, that is, the promotion of settlements. Once the parties have agreed on a settlement, the general interest of promoting settlements requires that they be able to prove the terms of their agreement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The parties can displace the exception or change its scope by contract, provided that they do so clearly, and as long as they do not deprive a court of its supervisory jurisdiction over matters of public order. To determine whether a contract displaces the exception, it is necessary to ascertain the common intention of the parties, which requires analyzing the nature of the contract, the circumstances in which it was formed, and usage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The trial judge was right not to allow the objection raised by I, and there was no reason to intervene on appeal. Before participating in family mediation, I and M signed a mediation contract modelled on the standard family mediation contract used in Quebec. Their contract contained a general confidentiality clause and an unambiguous statement that the objective of the process was to come to an agreement. None of the contract\u2019s clauses clearly displaced settlement privilege or its exceptions, and the interpretation of the contract cannot lead to the contrary conclusion. Although the parties never signed the summary of mediated agreements, their subsequent conduct indicates that they had an agreement of wills that was clear enough for the formation of a true agreement reflecting the terms recorded in the summary of mediated agreements.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Exceptionally, the circumstances of this case justify an award of costs on a solicitor\u2011client basis; that being said, the specific circumstances and the Association\u2019s status as a non\u2011profit organization call for caution. The Court has the discretion to depart from the usual practice and to order solicitor\u2011client costs in exceptional circumstances, such as where an appeal raises issues of general interest that go beyond the particular case of the successful party. Unlike in the Court of Appeal, where it intervened as a friend of the court, the Association is asking the Court to uphold the objection raised by I and has taken a position on the merits of the lower courts\u2019 decisions, which were based on significant findings of fact. M has had to mount a defence against a third party to the original litigation that, despite I\u2019s absence from the proceeding, is asking that the appeal be allowed. M did not have to personally bear the cost of such a test case, which went far beyond the facts of his original dispute. Because awarding solicitor\u2011client costs against the Association could have a deterrent effect on other organizations of this kind, and in light of the specific circumstances of this case, it is necessary to proceed with caution; therefore, as a compromise, costs should be limited to $15,000, plus disbursements.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Karakatsanis and Martin\u00a0JJ.: There is agreement with the majority that the appeal should be dismissed. However, there is divergence of opinion regarding the conclusion that the Union Carbide exception to settlement privilege applies to communications that occur during family mediation sessions in Quebec. Discussions that occur within family mediation sessions remain confidential and cannot be disclosed or adduced as evidence unless the parties specifically agree otherwise. Rules relating to the confidentiality of settlement negotiations applied in civil and commercial cases cannot simply be transposed to the family law context: doing so undermines both the unique legal approach to family law settlements developed by the courts and the broader objectives of the family mediation regime. Accordingly, the summary of mediated agreements, being the mediator\u2019s understanding of the potential basis for agreement between the parties, was inadmissible because it was protected by settlement privilege and the confidentiality terms of the contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Family law settlements are unique. The Court\u2019s jurisprudence reflects an evolving understanding of the distinct challenges relating to the settlement of disputes in the family law context. A family breakdown is no ordinary legal issue. Familial relationships are not mere business relationships nor casual encounters. Their dissolution may be a catastrophic event in the lives of participants. The breakdown of a spousal relationship is often wrought with emotional turmoil, power imbalance and vulnerability. In these respects, family law cases, and in particular cases involving settlements, stand on an entirely different footing from commercial cases. In decisions spanning at least four decades, the Court has highlighted the central reality of vulnerability in family negotiations and has consistently recognized the need for a discrete approach to address the challenges of resolving family disputes. It has resisted importing principles that apply to commercial settlements into the family context and has adjusted the general private law to this unique context. The two realms have developed separately for good reason.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The objectives of family mediation are much broader than simply promoting the settlement of a specific legal dispute. In particular, two overarching public interest objectives are key, and both depend on complete confidentiality in the mediation sessions. First, family mediation sets the groundwork for restructuring relationships that can navigate the traumatic consequences of familial breakdowns on a long\u2011term basis, especially when children are involved. The aim of reshaping relationships carries much greater significance in the family context given the intimacy of family bonds. Typically, family disputes cover a broad range of issues, from the primary legal issues of support, custody and access, and division of property, to the intricate untangling of interdependent family affairs \u2014 issues that often require cooperation on a sustained basis. When children are involved, the best interests of the child deserve the ongoing ability of parents to communicate and resolve disputes. The objective of restructuring relationships is achieved through family mediation\u2019s unique focus on promoting earnest discussions, dialogue and active listening. In Quebec, this priority is reflected in the interdisciplinary nature of the regime: it deals with every aspect of a relationship breakdown, whether the issues are emotional, relational, financial or legal in nature. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, family mediation strives to protect vulnerable parties and compensate for power imbalances to achieve equitable outcomes. The process is designed for parties who, in the tumult of separation, inevitably bring to the table a host of emotions and concerns that do not obviously accord with the making of rational economic decisions. This objective plays a broader role in family mediation and negotiation than it does in commercial settings because the intimate nature of the relationship between the parties makes it difficult to overcome potential power imbalances and modes of influence. After all, family mediation in Quebec aims to reach a fair settlement, not just any form of settlement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Confidentiality furthers mediation\u2019s participatory and consensual foundations, as well as the objective of reaching settlements in the family context. The effectiveness of family mediation in promoting settlements is predicated on the creation of a confidential space where the parties can fully explore common ground on a diverse range of interrelated issues and engage without fear of legal repercussions. Confidentiality is essential for full and frank discussions, which are necessary to establishing functional familial dynamics going forward. It is also critical for protecting vulnerable parties and compensating for power imbalances, in that confidentiality prevents the more powerful party from using the words of the more vulnerable party to substantiate an unfair agreement. This risk is pronounced in Quebec given the regime\u2019s prohibition on lawyers being present during the sessions. Family law mediators may not always be able to intervene to protect vulnerable parties because abusive dynamics are not always evident.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There are two overriding problems with the application of the settlement exception discussed in Union\u00a0Carbide to confidential communications during family mediation sessions. First, the justification for the exception to settlement privilege \u2014 to encourage settlement of legal disputes \u2014 does not account for the unique context of family settlement, nor the broader objectives of family mediation. Exceptions are applied with regard to their purpose and not mechanically. Encouraging the settlement of legal disputes is not the only public interest at stake in the family law context.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, the exception\u2019s underlying reasoning is fundamentally incompatible with the nature of family mediation in Quebec. In Union\u00a0Carbide, the objective of promoting settlement was served by the possible disclosure of communications constituting the offer and acceptance of a binding contract. In the present context, however, no offer and acceptance can occur during mediation sessions. The Quebec mediation regime, which prohibits the presence of lawyers, forecloses parties from reaching a binding settlement in mediation sessions \u2014 they are a forum for exploratory negotiations that may, but need not, lead to a settlement outside of mediation. It follows that the terms of an agreement can only be reached outside the mediation process.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Even if Union\u00a0Carbide were to apply to the family law context, it remains open to the parties to contract for greater confidentiality than is available at common law. The question is whether an absolute confidentiality clause in a mediation agreement displaces the common law exception. In this case, the text and nature of the contract, as well as the circumstances in which it was formed, lead to the conclusion that the parties intended complete confidentiality during mediation sessions, therefore displacing the exception to settlement privilege.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Therefore, the summary of mediated agreements was not admissible, as it contains protected confidential information. The trial judge erred in proceeding on the basis that a contract could be formed during the mediation sessions. He also erred in admitting confidential information from the mediation sessions and the summary of mediated agreements into evidence. I\u2019s objection to the admissibility of the summary of agreements should be sustained. However, given the limited record before the Court, it is difficult to assess whether the evidence would otherwise have been sufficient to justify the trial judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the existence of a contract; therefore, the disposition appealed from should not be overturned.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The majority\u2019s award of solicitor\u2011client costs against the Association in this case is unprecedented and unwarranted. The Court has never ordered costs on a solicitor\u2011client basis against a non-profit organization that raised an issue of public importance. An award on this scale is an extraordinary measure that effectively penalizes a non\u2011profit organization for bringing forth an issue of obvious importance to an area of law that touches the lives of so many Canadians. It can only deter such parties from doing so in the future.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Union Carbide Canada Inc. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that communications during family mediation sessions may be  used to prove the existence of a settlement agreement between the spouses.\u00a0 </strong>\r\n   This is a family law case from Quebec involving spouses who participated  in family mediation to resolve the terms of their separation. In Quebec, family  mediation by certified mediators is made available to married, civil union and common  law spouses with or without children. This process is subsidized by the provincial  government.  Ms. Isabelle Bisaillon and Mr. Michel Bouvier were  common law spouses for more than three years. They had two children during that  time. After their relationship ended, they participated in several family  mediation sessions in 2012 with a certified mediator to resolve their disputes  about the children\u2019s care, the family home and other matters. At the end of that  process, the mediator prepared a document known as a \u201csummary of mediated  agreements\u201d that explained how the parties had agreed to settle their disputes.  \u00a0  In 2014, Ms. Bisaillon filed a lawsuit in Quebec\u2019s Superior Court for more  money than set out in the summary. Mr.\u00a0Bouvier took the position they  should stick to the terms of the contract agreed to in mediation, and set out  in the summary. Ms.\u00a0Bisaillon denied the existence of the contract and  objected to the summary being admitted in evidence. She said the summary was  protected by a rule of absolute confidentiality.  The Superior Court rejected Ms. Bisaillon\u2019s argument. In its reasons,  the court relied on a commercial mediation case from 2014 called <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13632/index.do\">Union  Carbide Canada Inc. v. Bombardier Inc.</a></em> In that case, the  Supreme Court acknowledged the confidentiality of the mediation process, but  recognized the \u201csettlement exception\u201d. This exception allows parties to a  settlement to prove it exists. As such, the Superior Court found Ms. Bisaillon  and Mr. Bouvier had a contract. Ms. Bisaillon appealed to Quebec\u2019s Court of  Appeal, which also sided with Mr. Bouvier. While Ms. Bisaillon decided not to  appeal that decision, Quebec\u2019s Association de m\u00e9diation familiale was permitted  to take Ms. Bisaillon\u2019s case to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court has sided with Mr. Bouvier.  <strong>The settlement exception</strong> <strong>also applies to family mediation cases.</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority, Justice Nicholas Kasirer said the settlement  exception outlined in <em>Union Carbide</em> may  also apply to family mediation cases. He wrote, \u201cIt is certainly true that  confidentiality is necessary in any mediation to allow for frank discussion  between the parties in order to encourage settlements. It is also true that,  unlike in the case of civil or commercial mediation, negotiations following the  breakdown of a relationship often take place during a period of personal  upheaval that may heighten the vulnerability of either spouse.\u201d  However, Justice Kasirer explained how the family mediation process  includes other safeguards beyond confidentiality to assure the protection of  vulnerable parties. These additional safeguards include a certified and  impartial mediator chosen by the parties and a judge who confirms any agreement  arising from the mediation.  Due to these important safeguards, a rule of  absolute confidentiality is not required. This means people may use the  settlement exception to prove the existence and terms of what they agreed to  during mediation. "

The order stayed the rights and remedies of creditors, among other things, and appointed a monitor. Following that order, SM\u00a0Group continued to perform work for Ville de Montr\u00e9al (\u201cCity\u201d). However, the City refused to pay for that work and invoked its right to effect compensation between what it owed SM\u00a0Group and two claims it allegedly had against SM\u00a0Group that arose before the initial order. Those claims are related to the application of the Act to ensure mainly the recovery of amounts improperly paid as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics in connection with public contracts (\u201cBill 26\u201d) and, according to the City, result from fraud on SM\u00a0Group\u2019s part. The first claim arises from a settlement agreement entered into under the Voluntary Reimbursement Program (\u201cVRP\u201d) that resulted from Bill 26 (\u201cVRP claim\u201d). The second claim is based on a proceeding brought by the City against SM\u00a0Group, in which it claimed money from SM\u00a0Group for allegedly having participated in collusion in relation to a call for tenders for a water meter contract.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In response to the City\u2019s refusal to pay for the work done by SM\u00a0Group after the initial order, the monitor applied for a declaratory judgment stating that compensation could not be effected with respect to the amounts owed by the City to SM\u00a0Group. The supervising judge granted the application. The Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion as the supervising judge: that the compensation invoked by the City could not be effected. It found that a claim relating to fraud falling within s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA is not an exception to the rule stated in Quebec (Agence du revenu) v. Kitco Metals Inc., 2017 QCCA 268, whereby compensation between debts arising before and after an initial order (\u201cpre\u2011post compensation\u201d) is prohibited. It was also of the view that the City had not proved that s.\u00a019(2)(d) applied to its claims. Finally, with regard to the water meter contract claim, the Court of Appeal agreed with the supervising judge that the conditions for judicial compensation were not met, since the certainty, liquidity and exigibility of that claim had to be determined later in a proceeding other than that of the restructuring case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Brown J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Karakatsanis, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ.: First, a claim arising from an agreement entered into under the VRP is not necessarily a claim that relates to a debt resulting from fraud pursuant to s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA. In this case, the City has not shown that the VRP claim relates to a debt resulting from fraud within the meaning of that provision. Second, with regard to pre\u2011post compensation, a supervising judge has the discretion to stay the exercise of a right to pre\u2011post compensation, or set\u2011off, invoked by a creditor under the civil law or the common law. However, the supervising judge may refuse to stay this right, or may lift such a stay, only in exceptional circumstances, given the high disruptive potential of this form of compensation. In the case at bar, the initial order stayed the City\u2019s right to pre\u2011post compensation, and it would not be appropriate to lift the stay in relation to the claims in issue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To answer the question with respect to compensation in the context of this appeal, the Court must first determine whether a claim arising from an agreement entered into under the VRP is necessarily a \u201cclaim that relates to\u201d a \u201cdebt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d pursuant to s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The first step in characterizing the VRP claim is to distinguish, for the purposes of the CCAA, claims that are subject to a compromise or arrangement from those that are not. Section 19(2) provides, by way of exception, that certain claims may not be dealt with by a compromise or arrangement, including those that result from fraud. To prove that its claim relates to a debt resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation pursuant to s.\u00a019(2)(d), a creditor has the burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, the following four elements: (i) the debtor made a representation to the creditor; (ii) the representation was false; (iii) the debtor knew that the representation was false; (iv) the false representation was made to obtain property or a service.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In this case, the City did not try to prove or even allege any of these elements. The content of the VRP agreement, Bill 26 and the regulation made under it (\u201cVRP Regulation\u201d) must therefore be interpreted to determine whether the VRP claim may be dealt with by a compromise or arrangement. This interpretation exercise confirms that s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA does not apply to the VRP claim.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 First, it is clearly stipulated in the VRP agreement entered into by the parties that the amount fixed in the agreement can in no way be considered to constitute an admission of liability. As a result, it cannot be presumed that the VRP claim is a claim that falls within s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Second, Bill 26 and the VRP Regulation do not create a statutory presumption or a presumption of fact that a debtor made fraudulent representations to a public body. The use of the words \u201cmay have been\u201d in s.\u00a03 of Bill 26 and in s.\u00a01 of the VRP Regulation to describe the purpose of the VRP indicates that fraud is a possibility rather than a certainty. Section 7 of the VRP Regulation supports this point, since it states that the fact that a natural person or an enterprise participates in the VRP does not constitute an admission of liability or of a fault committed by the natural person or enterprise. The fault in question in s.\u00a07 is a matter of civil liability and is limited to the public contract to which a VRP agreement pertains. Where the legislature intends to refer to penal or criminal proceedings, or to civil proceedings outside the scope of a VRP agreement, it does so expressly. This interpretation is confirmed when s.\u00a07 of the VRP Regulation is read in conjunction with s.\u00a08.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The City is wrong to say that reading ss.\u00a01, 3 and 10 of Bill 26 together leads to the conclusion that a natural person or enterprise that participated in the VRP necessarily defrauded a public body. Although s.\u00a01 of Bill 26 does not refer to fraud as being hypothetical, s.\u00a03 of Bill 26 and s.\u00a01 of the VRP Regulation are clear: the substantive provisions of Bill 26 and the VRP Regulation contemplate fraud only hypothetically. Finally, the two schemes created by Bill 26 must not be confused. Section 10 states that fraud was committed, but this section is part of the scheme introduced by Chapter III (ss.\u00a010 to 17), which applies to judicial proceedings brought against a natural person or enterprise that allegedly participated in fraud in relation to a public contract, and not part of the VRP scheme introduced by Chapter II (ss.\u00a03 to 9). It is up to the courts to conclude that fraud has been committed, and the existence of fraud will be recognized by a court only under the Chapter III scheme, which did not take effect until the VRP scheme introduced by Chapter II ended. The reference to s.\u00a010 in s.\u00a03 merely serves to specify the natural persons to whom the VRP applies. Accordingly, the City has not shown that the VRP claim falls within s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA. Neither the content of the VRP agreement nor its legal framework supports a presumption that SM\u00a0Group admitted to having committed a fraudulent act.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, a right to pre\u2011post compensation, or set\u2011off, invoked by a creditor under the civil law or the common law can be stayed by a court under ss.\u00a011 and 11.02 of the CCAA. Under s.\u00a011.02 of the CCAA, a court may stay any action, suit or other proceeding that might be brought against the debtor company. While at first glance the language of this provision limits the power to order a stay to judicial proceedings, the courts have taken a large and liberal approach in interpreting the scope of the rights and remedies that can be included in a stay order. A court has the power to stay rights held by creditors if the exercise of those rights could jeopardize the restructuring process. This includes a creditor\u2019s right to effect pre\u2011post compensation. Such an interpretation advances the CCAA\u2019s remedial objectives and is consistent with its scheme.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the vast majority of cases, an initial order will, and should, stay a creditor\u2019s right to set up pre\u2011post compensation against the debtor. However, a court may in its discretion refuse to impose such a prohibition or, if pre\u2011post compensation was stayed by the order, lift the stay at a later date to allow an interested creditor to assert its rights. The absolute prohibition against pre\u2011post compensation imposed by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Kitco must therefore be tempered. However, a court must be cautious before allowing such a form of compensation, given its high disruptive potential.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Moreover, s.\u00a021 of the CCAA does not grant creditors a right to pre\u2011post compensation that would be shielded from a supervising judge\u2019s power to order a stay under ss.\u00a011 and 11.02 of the CCAA. Read in light of its context, its purpose and the scheme of the CCAA, s.\u00a021 is limited to authorizing compensation between debts that arise before an initial order is made (\u201cpre\u2011pre compensation\u201d) for the purpose of quantifying creditors\u2019 claims on the date of commencement of proceedings. This provision does not have the effect of authorizing pre\u2011post compensation. That being said, s.\u00a021 of the CCAA does not prohibit this form of compensation either. It follows that a supervising judge retains the discretion to stay or to authorize the exercise of a right to pre\u2011post compensation, or set\u2011off, invoked by a creditor under the civil law or the common law.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In exercising its discretion under the CCAA, a court must keep three baseline considerations in mind: (1) the appropriateness of the order being sought, (2) due diligence and (3) good faith on the applicant\u2019s part. The first consideration relates both to the order itself and to the means that are employed. It is assessed in light of the CCAA\u2019s remedial objectives, which include protecting the public interest. In very specific circumstances, a court could conclude that protection of the public interest and the CCAA\u2019s other remedial objectives justify authorizing pre\u2011post compensation in favour of a creditor that has proved that it was a victim of fraud within the meaning of s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA. However, the court should take care not to reduce the public interest to the interests of a particular creditor or group of creditors. The second consideration is also important because it discourages parties from sitting on their rights and ensures that creditors do not strategically manoeuver or position themselves to gain an advantage.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the case at bar, the words of the stay order made by the Superior Court are broad enough to stay pre\u2011post compensation, and it would not be appropriate to lift the stay in relation to the VRP claim. Because the City has not proved the alleged fraud and has not relied, in support of its position, on any of the CCAA\u2019s remedial objectives other than protecting the public interest, it has not discharged its burden of proving that the order being sought is appropriate. In addition, the City did not act with the diligence expected in CCAA proceedings.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 With regard to the water meter contract claim, the Superior Court agreed to lift the stay of proceedings to allow the City to establish the existence and amount of its claim in that case. That order did not authorize the City to withhold the amounts owed to SM\u00a0Group for the work subsequent to the initial order with a view to effecting compensation if the City was successful in the case relating to the water meter contract. In the circumstances, an order allowing the City to withhold the amounts owed to SM\u00a0Group pending the outcome of that case would not be appropriate for the same reasons as those relating to the VRP claim.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed solely for the purpose of remanding the case to the Superior Court so it can decide whether the City may effect pre\u2011post compensation for the VRP claim and whether compensation is available in respect of the water meter claim. There is agreement with the majority that a supervising judge has a discretion under s.\u00a011 of the CCAA as to whether to allow a creditor to effect pre\u2011post compensation, or set\u2011off. However, this discretion is not limited solely to the exceptional circumstances the majority describes. The scope of s.\u00a021 of the CCAA is not limited to pre\u2011pre compensation; pre\u2011post compensation is permitted, but must be subject to the exercise of a supervising judge\u2019s discretion. Moreover, nothing in s.\u00a021 of the CCAA prohibits judicial compensation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The approach taken by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Kitco, according to which pre\u2011post compensation will never be authorized under the CCAA, involves several errors and must be rejected. To begin with, the Court of Appeal erred in relying on a judgment rendered by the Court in the context of a bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (\u201cBIA\u201d). Although the scheme established by the CCAA and the one established by the BIA must be viewed as an integrated body of insolvency law, there remain many differences between them, including two that are fundamental. First, when an insolvent company has recourse to the CCAA, it continues its business activities and is not divested of its property in favour of a third party, unlike with the measures put in place under the BIA that vest the bankrupt\u2019s property in a trustee. There is thus no loss of mutuality under the CCAA. This mutuality, which survives the initial order, is what makes compensation possible under the CCAA, unlike under the BIA. Secondly, the scheme established by the CCAA is flexible and allows creative solutions to be put forward to achieve the objective of restructuring a financially distressed company, in contrast to the BIA, which provides a set of pre\u2011established rules. The CCAA\u2019s provisions must be interpreted expansively to enable its remedial objectives to be achieved. Because of these objectives, a broad discretion is also conferred on supervising judges by s.\u00a011 of the CCAA. This discretion has no equivalent in the BIA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Next, the state of the law elsewhere in Canada is clear: pre\u2011post set\u2011off is possible under the CCAA, subject to a supervising judge\u2019s discretion to stay such set\u2011off having regard to its effects on the status quo period, the underlying objectives of this period, the advancement of efforts to reach an arrangement, and the remedial objectives of the CCAA. The approach proposed in Kitco has created an asymmetry between the interpretation given to s.\u00a021 of the CCAA by the Quebec courts and the interpretation given to it by the courts of other Canadian provinces, which is contrary to the principle of homogenous interpretation of federal statutes.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Lastly, staying the remedies of an insolvent company\u2019s creditors under the CCAA to allow the company to develop a plan of arrangement is of critical importance. However, where a plan of arrangement cannot be contemplated and the insolvent company will be liquidated or sold in any event, to conclude that pre\u2011post compensation is never allowed could be unfair to the company\u2019s creditors with claims that are certain, liquid and exigible. In such cases, the creditors\u2019 remedies will be stayed indefinitely and they will never be able to effect pre\u2011post compensation, since the insolvent company will become an \u201cempty shell\u201d after the sale. Moreover, allowing pre\u2011post compensation will not have the effect of derailing the company\u2019s restructuring process, as there is no such process in this situation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, there is no need to decide whether the VRP claim must be characterized as a claim based on \u201cfalse pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d within the meaning of s.\u00a019(2)(d) of the CCAA. Section 21 of the CCAA must be interpreted as allowing pre\u2011post compensation regardless of whether a claim results from fraud for the purposes of s.\u00a019(2)(d). It is true that proof that the debt underlying a claim is fraudulent is a relevant factor in the exercise of a supervising judge\u2019s discretion to permit pre\u2011post compensation; however, whether the City\u2019s VRP claim results from fraud is a question to be decided by the supervising judge, not by the Court.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Given that the supervising judge did not exercise her discretion under s.\u00a011 of the CCAA, believing herself to be bound by the conclusions of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Kitco, it is not for the Court to exercise that discretion in order to determine whether to permit pre\u2011post compensation. Supervising judges are in the best position to decide whether to exercise their discretion in a particular case. In cases involving an exercise of discretion by a court of first instance, it is not in the interests of justice for the Court to step into that court\u2019s shoes and decide these matters.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Overruled: Quebec (Agence du revenu) v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules the City of  Montreal could not apply payments from Quebec\u2019s voluntary reimbursement program  to cover the amount it owed to a contractor. </strong>\r\n   This case involves the  City of Montreal and one of its contractors, an engineering firm called SM  Group. In 2018, SM Group sought to avoid bankruptcy by applying to Quebec\u2019s  Superior Court for protection under the <em>Companies\u2019  Creditors Arrangement Act</em> (<em>CCAA</em>).  This process is called restructuring.  SM Group had also  participated in a two-year voluntary reimbursement program under a Quebec law meant  to help recover money paid \u201cin the course of the tendering, awarding or  management of a public contract in relation to which there may have been fraud  or fraudulent tactics\u201d. The 2015 law was in response to the Charbonneau  Commission of inquiry into collusion and corruption in public contracts with  the construction industry.  The Superior Court granted  SM Group\u2019s application. It appointed Deloitte Restructuring (Deloitte) to  monitor the company\u2019s restructuring and ordered a \u201cstay of proceedings\u201d. The  stay meant that all legal actions against the company were put on hold to give  the engineering firm the opportunity to get its business back on track.  Following that initial  court order, SM Group continued with the construction of the  Samuel\u00a0De\u00a0Champlain Bridge and the rebuilding of the Turcot  Interchange in Montreal. However, the City refused to pay for that work. It  said it could use \u201cpre-post compensation\u201d to reduce or cancel the amount owed  for the work performed by SM Group. This meant the City would apply payments  from the voluntary reimbursement program (VRP) to cover the amount owed for the  work done on the bridge and interchange. Pre-post compensation is usually not  allowed by the courts, but the City said it should be allowed in this case because  the money SM Group owed through the VRP resulted from fraud.  In response to the  City\u2019s refusal to pay, Deloitte applied to the Superior Court to stop the City  from using pre-post compensation. The court granted Deloitte\u2019s application,  which the City then appealed. When the Court of Appeal agreed the City could  not use pre-post compensation, the City turned to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has also agreed  the City could not use pre-post compensation.  <strong>The City failed to prove the <abbr title=\"voluntary reimbursement program\">VRP</abbr> claim was fraudulent. </strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner and Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained that a <abbr title=\"voluntary reimbursement program\">VRP</abbr> claim is not  necessarily fraudulent. They wrote, \u201cthe mere fact that a debtor company  participated in the VRP is not sufficient to infer that the company defrauded a  public body\u201d. In this case, the City of Montreal still had the burden of  proving that SM Group had committed fraud, which the City failed to do.  The majority  said a court should generally not allow pre-post compensation, unless there are  exceptional circumstances. They said there were no such exceptional  circumstances in this case."

(\u201cLoblaw Financial\u201d), a Canadian corporation, incorporated a subsidiary in Barbados. The Central Bank of Barbados issued a licence for the subsidiary to operate as an offshore bank named Glenhuron Bank Ltd. (\u201cGlenhuron\u201d). Between 1992 and 2000, important capital investments in Glenhuron were made by Loblaw Financial and affiliated companies (\u201cLoblaw Group\u201d). In 2013, Glenhuron was dissolved, and its assets were liquidated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For the 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2010 taxation years, Loblaw Financial did not include income earned by Glenhuron in its Canadian tax returns as foreign accrual property income (\u201cFAPI\u201d). Under the FAPI regime in the Income Tax Act (\u201cITA\u201d), Canadian taxpayers must include income earned by their controlled foreign affiliates (\u201cCFAs\u201d) in their Canadian annual tax returns on an accrual basis if this income qualifies as FAPI. However, financial institutions that meet specific requirements benefit from an exception to the FAPI rules found in the definition of \u201cinvestment business\u201d at s.\u00a095(1) of the ITA. The financial institution exception is available where the following requirements are met: (1) the CFA must be a foreign bank or another financial institution listed in the exception provision; (2) its activities must be regulated under foreign law; (3) the CFA must employ more than five full\u2011time employees in the active conduct of its business; and (4) its business must be conducted principally with persons with whom it deals at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Loblaw Financial claimed that Glenhuron\u2019s activities were covered by the financial institution exception to the FAPI rules. The Minister disagreed with Loblaw Financial and reassessed it on the basis that the income earned by Glenhuron during the years in issue was FAPI. Loblaw Financial objected and appealed the reassessments. The Tax Court held that the financial institution exception did not apply, as Glenhuron\u2019s business was conducted principally with non\u2011arm\u2019s length persons. In reaching its decision, the court considered the scope of Glenhuron\u2019s relevant business, looking at its receipt of funds and use of funds. It included in its analysis all receipts of funds indiscriminately, treating capital injections by shareholders and lenders like any other receipt of funds. The Tax Court also viewed Glenhuron\u2019s use of funds as the management of an investment portfolio on the Loblaw Group\u2019s behalf and regarded the influence of the Loblaw Group\u2019s central management as pervading the conduct of business because of the Loblaw Group\u2019s close oversight of Glenhuron\u2019s investment activities.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed with the Tax Court\u2019s interpretation of the arm\u2019s length requirement and with its analysis based on receipt and use of funds. It held that only Glenhuron\u2019s income\u2011earning activities had to be considered. It also found that direction, support, and oversight by the Loblaw Group should not have been considered, because these interactions are not income\u2011earning activities and thus do not amount to conducting business with the CFA. It concluded that Glenhuron was dealing principally with arm\u2019s length persons, and that Loblaw Financial was entitled to the benefit of the financial institution exception and did not need to include Glenhuron\u2019s income as FAPI. It referred the reassessments back to the Minister for reconsideration.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Loblaw Financial was entitled to rely on the financial institution exception set out in s.\u00a095(1) of the ITA. When the precise words of the arm\u2019s length requirement \u2014 \u201cthe business (other than any business conducted principally with persons with whom the affiliate does not deal at arm\u2019s length)\u201d \u2014 are interpreted in accordance with the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation, it is clear that they do not encompass an assessment of capital contributions or corporate oversight. If capital and corporate oversight are excluded from consideration, Glenhuron\u2019s investment business activities were conducted principally with arm\u2019s length persons.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A parent corporation does not conduct business with its CFA when it provides capital and exercises corporate oversight. An ordinary and grammatical reading of the words \u201cbusiness conducted\u201d conveys a different meaning than the word \u201cbusiness\u201d alone. The addition of the verb \u201cconducted\u201d emphasizes Parliament\u2019s intent to focus on the active carrying out of business rather than on the establishment of prerequisite conditions that enable a foreign affiliate to conduct business. Raising capital is a necessary part of any business, and capital enables business to be conducted; but one would not generally speak of capitalization itself as the conduct of the business. The Court has repeatedly affirmed that there is a distinction between capitalization and the conduct of a business. The banking context does not change anything. There is undoubtedly a distinction between receiving funds from depositors and receiving funds from shareholders \u2014 depositors are clients of the bank, for whom the bank provides the services associated with holding their funds; shareholders are not.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The context of the FAPI regime confirms this reading. The entire function of the regime is to classify a foreign affiliate\u2019s income. The financial institution exception to the definition of \u201cinvestment business\u201d and its arm\u2019s length requirement are tied to this same function: identifying income for inclusion in FAPI. It thus makes considerable sense that Parliament intended these determinations to focus on activities more directly related to income generation than to capitalization, the distinction between income and capital being well established in tax law. The FAPI regime also shows why considering capitalization as part of conducting business for the purposes of the financial institution exception would create practical problems. The FAPI regime does not provide a method for assigning capital to the different businesses within a single corporation. Interpreting \u201cbusiness conducted\u201d to include the capitalization of the business would make it necessary to somehow divide the debt and equity from various sources (some arm\u2019s length and some not) and then assign the ensuing quotient to the various businesses conducted by a foreign affiliate. Parliament\u2019s failure to provide a method for distributing capital suggests that it did not have capital in mind. A further practical difficulty arises when considering the receipt of corporate capital in relation to newly formed CFAs. Since the Canadian parent will have provided some capital to set up the CFA, in most cases, this means that the CFA will fail the test in its early years when it is trying to build a customer base, because the ratio of corporate capital to other business receipts will likely be high. If taxpayers are to act with any degree of certainty, then full effect should be given to Parliament\u2019s precise and unequivocal words. The grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words \u201cbusiness conducted\u201d, read in the context and light of the purpose of the FAPI regime, clearly shows that Parliament did not intend capital injections to be considered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, there is no basis in the text, context or purpose of the arm\u2019s length requirement to support the Tax Court\u2019s consideration of corporate oversight as part of conducting business. Fundamentally, a corporation is separate from its shareholders. Its business may be conducted using money provided by shareholders or in accordance with policies adopted by the board of directors on behalf of the shareholders, but this does not change the fact that the corporation remains the party conducting business. Treating oversight by a parent corporation as shifting the responsibility for conducting business is also incompatible with the rest of the FAPI regime. The regime applies only where there is a controlled foreign affiliate. If there is a CFA, there is necessarily corporate oversight by its parent. Parliament does not speak in vain; it would not have added an arm\u2019s length requirement if it could never be met.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Once corporate oversight and the capital investments received by Glenhuron are excluded, only Glenhuron\u2019s investment activities remain part of the business that is relevant for the application of the arm\u2019s length requirement. The most lucrative of those activities undertaken by Glenhuron were conducted at arm\u2019s length, amounting to at least 86 percent of its income during the years in issue. On the non\u2011arm\u2019s length, Glenhuron\u2019s combined activities do not reach the \u201cprincipally\u201d threshold. The arm\u2019s length requirement was therefore met during the years in issue.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Referred to: Inland Revenue Commissioners v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules Loblaw  Financial Holdings Inc. can benefit from a Canadian tax exception involving a bank  it owns in Barbados. </strong>This is a tax case involving Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc. (Loblaw  Financial), a Canadian company. Loblaw Financial is owned by the Loblaw Group,  which also owns grocery stores.\u00a0  In 1992, Loblaw Financial opened a bank in Barbados called Glenhuron  Bank Limited (Glenhuron). Glenhuron did corporate banking, meaning it managed  the money of various companies.  Between 1992 and 2000, both the Loblaw Group and Loblaw Financial  invested money in Glenhuron. In 2013, however, the Loblaw Group closed Glenhuron.  In its Canadian tax returns for the years 2001 to 2005, 2008, and 2010,  Loblaw Financial did not include the money made by Glenhuron, claiming the  revenue was exempt from the <em>Income Tax  Act. </em>The law says Canadian companies must pay taxes on money made by their  foreign affiliates, meaning companies they own abroad. That money is called  \u201cforeign accrual property income\u201d (FAPI). However, a bank can get a tax  exception if it was doing business mainly with companies that are not related  to it. This is known as the \u201carm\u2019s length requirement\u201d. The Minister of National Revenue of Canada denied the tax exception, so  Loblaw Financial appealed to the Tax Court of Canada. At Tax Court, the  Minister argued the exception did not apply and the Tax Court agreed.  Loblaw Financial appealed that decision to the Federal Court of Appeal,  which sided with Loblaw Financial and said the exemption did in fact apply. The  Minister then turned to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has sided with Loblaw Financial: the tax exception  did apply, so Loblaw Financial did not have to pay taxes on the money made by  Glenhuron. <strong>The arm\u2019s length requirement was  met. </strong>\r\n     Writing for the Supreme Court, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained \u201cthe FAPI regime  is one of the most complicated statutory regimes in Canadian law\u201d. But she said  the question in this appeal is simple. Is a company \u201cdoing business\u201d with a foreign  affiliate when it manages and gives money to it? She said the answer is no. When  the arm\u2019s length requirement in the <em>Income  Tax Act</em> is read in its grammatical and ordinary sense, it is clear money and management to an  affiliate is not included in \u201cdoing business\u201d.  Loblaw Financial managed and gave money to Glenhuron, but it was not  doing business with it. Rather, as a corporate bank, Glenhuron was doing  business with other companies not related to it. So, the arm\u2019s length  requirement was met. As a result, the tax exception applied, and Loblaw  Financial did not have to pay taxes on the money made by Glenhuron for the  years in question. "

T.S. 2000 No.\u00a022, art.\u00a013.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In 2011, two American firms founded an American company for the purpose of acquiring and developing unconventional oil and natural gas properties. Alta Energy Partners Canada Ltd. (\u201cAlta Canada\u201d), a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of that company, was incorporated in order to carry on that business. A restructuring of Alta Canada was undertaken in 2012. As part of the restructuring, Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L. (\u201cAlta Luxembourg\u201d) was incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and its shares were issued to a new Canadian partnership. On the same day, Alta Luxembourg purchased all of the shares of Alta Canada. In 2013, it sold those shares, realizing a capital gain in excess of $380 million. Payment for the shares was organized so that Alta Luxembourg did not receive any of the sale proceeds. Following the sale, Alta Luxembourg did not conduct any other business or hold any other investments.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The capital gain was reported to the Luxembourg tax authorities and was subject to full taxation under Luxembourg\u2019s domestic laws. In its Canadian tax return for 2013, Alta Luxembourg claimed an exemption from Canadian tax on the basis that the gain was not included in its \u201ctaxable income earned in Canada\u201d under s.\u00a0115(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act (\u201cAct\u201d) because the shares were \u201ctreaty\u2011protected property\u201d under art.\u00a013(4) and (5) of the Convention between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital (\u201cTreaty\u201d). Article 13(4) of the Treaty creates an exemption for residents of Luxembourg from Canadian tax arising from a capital gain on the alienation of shares the value of which is derived principally from immovable property situated in Canada and in which the business of the company was carried on.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Minister denied the treaty exemption. Alta Luxembourg appealed to the Tax Court of Canada. The Minister argued that the business property exemption in art.\u00a013(4) of the Treaty did not apply and, in the alternative, if the shares did qualify as treaty\u2011protected property, that the general anti\u2011avoidance rule (\u201cGAAR\u201d) in s.\u00a0245 of the Act should apply. The Tax Court found that the shares were treaty\u2011protected property. With respect to the GAAR, the parties agreed that the restructuring was an \u201cavoidance transaction\u201d as defined in s.\u00a0245(3) of the Act that resulted in a tax benefit. The Tax Court held that the avoidance transaction did not result in a misuse or abuse of the provisions of the Act or the Treaty. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the Minister\u2019s appeal, which raised only the issue of whether the GAAR applied.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Wagner C.J. and Rowe and Martin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: The Minister has not discharged her burden of proving abusive tax avoidance. In agreeing to include a specific exemption for immovable property in the Treaty, Canada sought to encourage investments by Luxembourg residents in business assets embodied in immovable property located in Canada and to reap the ensuing benefits. Alta Luxembourg made exactly such an investment. It is a resident of Luxembourg and, as such, is exempt from Canadian taxes on the capital gain realized on the disposition of shares of its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The GAAR acts as a legislative limit on both tax certainty and the well\u2011accepted principle that taxpayers are entitled to arrange their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable. It bars abusive tax avoidance transactions, including those in which taxpayers seek to obtain treaty benefits that were never intended by the contracting states, but it cannot be used to fundamentally alter the criteria under which a person is entitled to the benefits of a treaty. Applying the GAAR involves a three\u2011part process meant to determine: (1) whether there is a tax benefit arising from a transaction; (2) whether the transaction is an avoidance transaction; and (3) whether the avoidance transaction is abusive. To determine whether a transaction is abusive, the Court has set out a two\u2011step inquiry. Under the first step, the provisions relied on for the tax benefit are interpreted to determine their object, spirit, and purpose. In cases of treaty interpretation, this must be done with a view to implementing the true intention of the parties. Under the second step, a factual analysis determines whether the avoidance transaction at issue frustrates the object, spirit, and purpose of the provisions.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The object, spirit, and purpose of the business property exemption provided for in art.\u00a013(4) and (5) of the Treaty are to foster international investment. The object, spirit, and purpose of arts.\u00a01 and 4, which make residence central to the application of the Treaty, are to allow all persons who are residents under the laws of one or both of the contracting states to claim benefits under the Treaty, so long as their resident status could expose them to full tax liability. According to art.\u00a04, \u201cresidence\u201d under the Treaty is based on liability to tax in one or both of the contracting states by reason of domicile, residence, place of management or another similar criterion. In the context of corporations, the \u201cliable to tax\u201d requirement is met where the domestic law of a contracting state exposes a corporation to full tax liability because it has its residence in that state. Residence is to be defined by the laws of the contracting state in which residence is claimed. Consistent with international practice, Luxembourg law grants resident status to corporations having either their legal seat or their central management in Luxembourg. This does not depart from accepted usage such that the bargain struck in the Treaty could be upheld only if Luxembourg residents claiming benefits have sufficient substantive economic connections to their country of residence. If the drafters had truly intended to include only corporations with sufficient substantive economic connections to their country of residence within the scope of the Treaty, they would have clearly signalled their intention to depart from a well\u2011established criterion like the \u201cplace of incorporation\u201d or \u201clegal seat\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Another contextual element further reinforces the conclusion that the purpose of arts.\u00a01 and 4 of the Treaty is not to reserve benefits to corporations with sufficient substantive economic connections to their country of residence: the inclusion of art.\u00a028(3) in the Treaty, which denies benefits to certain Luxembourg holding companies. The parties\u2019 choice of this approach should be understood as a rejection of the relevance of economic ties for delineating which corporations should be entitled to benefits and which should not. This choice suggests that the drafters intended to exclude a corporation with minimal economic connections to one of the contracting states only where the corporation is a holding company benefiting from Luxembourg\u2019s well known international tax haven regime. In light of this clear intention, the spirit of arts.\u00a01 and 4 was not to limit access to the benefits of the Treaty to corporations with sufficient substantive economic connections to their country of residence.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although the absence of specific anti\u2011avoidance rules is not necessarily determinative of the application of the GAAR, their absence sheds light on the contracting states\u2019 intention. This is not a case where Parliament did not or could not have foreseen the tax strategy employed by the taxpayer. The use of conduit corporations \u2014 legal entities created in a state essentially to obtain treaty benefits that would not be available directly \u2014 was not an unforeseen tax strategy at the time of the Treaty. Options to remediate the situation were available and known by the parties, but they made deliberate choices to guard some benefits against conduit corporations and to leave others unguarded. Had the parties truly intended to prevent such corporations from taking advantage of the business property exemption, they could have done so. Combined with Canada\u2019s preference at the time of the Treaty for taking advantage of the economic benefits yielded by foreign investments rather than higher tax revenues, this makes the rationale of the business property exemption even clearer. The fact that the capital gains may not be taxed in Luxembourg, leading to double non\u2011taxation, and the fact that conduit corporations can take advantage of the business property exemption are tax planning outcomes consistent with the bargain struck between Canada and Luxembourg.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In raising the GAAR, Canada is now seeking to revisit its bargain in order to secure both foreign investments and tax revenues. Tax treaties are replete with choices. One key choice made by Canada and Luxembourg in negotiating the Treaty was to deviate from the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital by allocating to a person\u2019s residence state the right to tax capital gains realized on the disposition of shares or other similar interests deriving their value principally from immovable property used in a corporation\u2019s business. The business property exemption is a clear departure from the theory of economic allegiance, under which the parties to a treaty avoid double taxation by allocating the right to collect taxes to the contracting state to which the income and the taxpayer are more closely connected. Canada effectively agreed to give up its right to tax certain entities incorporated in Luxembourg in exchange for the jobs and economic opportunities that the business property exemption would promote.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The provisions of the Treaty operated as they were intended to operate \u2014the avoidance transaction neither defeated nor frustrated the object, spirit, or purpose of the provisions in issue. Therefore, there was no abuse, so the GAAR cannot be applied to deny the tax benefit claimed. The Treaty makes it clear that Canada and Luxembourg agreed that the power to tax would be allocated to Luxembourg where the conditions of the business property exemption were met. There is nothing in the Treaty suggesting that a single\u2011purpose conduit corporation resident in Luxembourg cannot avail itself of the benefits of the Treaty due to some other consideration. The provisions of the Treaty operated as they were intended to operate; there was no abuse, and, therefore, the GAAR cannot be applied to deny the tax benefit claimed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Rowe and Martin\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. Alta Luxembourg\u2019s claim for a tax benefit under the Treaty is the result of abusive avoidance transactions. The courts below did not properly identify the rationale underlying the relevant provisions of the Treaty. They gave weight only to the text and failed to consider why the provisions were put in place. This is not the exercise mandated under the GAAR. Technical compliance with a tax treaty in a way that frustrates the underlying rationale of the provisions relied upon by the taxpayer is precisely what triggers the GAAR. Although it is a long standing principle in Canadian law that taxpayers may arrange their affairs to minimize their amount of tax payable, an unbridled application of that principle can mislead taxpayers into believing that tax plans that merely comply with the technical provisions of the Act are acceptable. Similarly, treaty shopping is not inherently abusive, but where taxing rights in a tax treaty are allocated on the basis of economic allegiance and conduit entities claim tax benefits despite the absence of any genuine economic connection with the state of residence, treaty shopping is abusive.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Canada has acted to curb abusive international tax avoidance by enacting the GAAR, which denies tax benefits when taxpayers engage in transactions that conform with the text of the tax rules relied upon, but do not accord with their rationale. As such, the GAAR vests upon courts the unusual duty to look beyond the words of the applicable provisions to determine whether the transactions in question frustrate their underlying rationale. An interpretation confined to the black letter of these legislative provisions would defeat Parliament\u2019s will and fail to fulfil the courts\u2019 role. As the question under the GAAR is not whether the taxpayer can claim a tax benefit, but rather why the benefit was conferred, a GAAR analysis is not constrained by the text in the same way as a traditional statutory interpretation. While this gives rise to a degree of uncertainty for taxpayers, allowing the GAAR to create this uncertainty was a deliberate choice that Parliament made when it enacted a provision that can defeat tax avoidance schemes that exploit Canada\u2019s legislation and treaties. Where those schemes cross the line into abusive tax avoidance, a finding that the GAAR applies does not run counter to the principles of certainty, predictability and fairness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The allocation of taxing powers in the Treaty follows the theory of \u201ceconomic allegiance\u201d, so the object, spirit or purpose of the relevant provisions of the Treaty is to assign taxing rights to the state with the closest economic connection to the taxpayer\u2019s income. Under art.\u00a013(5), the state of residence retains its jurisdiction to tax capital gains unless the exceptions in art.\u00a013(1) to (4) apply. Article 13(1) preserves the right of the source state to tax gains derived from immovable property situated in that state, and art.\u00a013(4) preserves the source state\u2019s right to tax capital gains arising from the disposition of shares the value of which is derived principally from immovable property situated in that state, unless the company carries on business in the property. The business property exemption assigns the right to tax capital gains arising from the disposition of immovable property in which business is carried on to the resident state. The rationale behind the business property exemption is to encourage investment; it reflects the fact that the business activity, rather than the immovable property itself, drives the value of the property. Article 13(4) therefore allocates to Luxembourg the right to tax its residents\u2019 indirect gains from immovable property situated in Canada used in a business.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, the abuse is clear. Alta Luxembourg had no genuine economic connections with Luxembourg as it was a mere conduit interposed in Luxembourg for residents of third\u2011party states to avail themselves of a tax exemption under the Treaty. This lack of any genuine economic connection to Luxembourg frustrates the rationale of the relevant provisions of the Treaty. The federal government did not deliberately set out to create the conditions for unlimited tax avoidance by means of schemes such as that in which Alta Luxembourg was used. The Court should not legitimize such blatantly abusive tax avoidance based on the view that Canada should have negotiated different treaty terms. Ex ante speculation about how the treaty parties ought to have proceeded based on alternatives said to have been available to them gives primacy to what is not there. Parliament was entitled to rely on the GAAR to address abusive uses of the Treaty rather than negotiate the inclusion of a specific rule. The focus should be on what was actually agreed upon and whether the underlying rationale of the relevant provisions was frustrated by the avoidance transactions undertaken. In the give and take of treaty negotiation, Canada certainly did not give up the GAAR.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The facts of this case are a patent example of a sophisticated taxpayer effecting a restructuring on the basis of professional tax advice to avoid Canadian tax. In such cases, the principle of fairness ought not to be ignored. As for the degree of uncertainty introduced by the GAAR, it is counterbalanced by the Crown\u2019s burden to show that the avoidance transactions frustrates the object, spirit or purpose of the provisions relied on by the taxpayer and by the fact that any doubt under the GAAR analysis is to be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules a Luxembourg company can benefit from  a Canadian tax exemption due to an existing tax treaty.</strong>  An American oil and gas company created  a Luxembourg subsidiary called Alta Luxembourg, which had its own subsidiary in  Canada called Alta Canada. A subsidiary is a company that is owned by another  company.  In 2013, Alta Luxembourg sold its  shares in Alta Canada and made more than $380 million in profit. Alta  Luxembourg paid taxes on the profit to Luxembourg tax authorities. In its  Canadian tax return, Alta Luxembourg claimed a tax exemption on the basis that  the profit was not \u201ctaxable income earned in Canada\u201d. It supported its claim by  relying on the tax treatybetween  Canada and Luxembourg. The agreementexempts  Luxembourg companies who profit from selling shares in Canada from paying taxes  as long as the shares relate to buildings and lands in Canada where the company  conducts business.  The Minister of National Revenue of  Canada denied the exemption and Alta Luxembourg appealed to the Tax Court of  Canada.  Before  the Tax Court, the Minister argued that Alta Luxembourg could not qualify for  the exemption because Alta Canada did not do business on the property. The Minister also said that the only  reason Alta Luxembourg existed was to sell the shares without having to pay taxes  to Canadian tax authorities. Lawyers for the Minister said that was abusive tax  avoidance. The Tax Court sided with Alta Luxembourg.  The Minister appealed that  decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. It also sided with Alta Luxembourg,  finding no abusive tax avoidance.  The Minister then turned to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal.  <strong>There was no abusive tax avoidance.</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority, Justice  C\u00f4t\u00e9 said the Minister had not proven abusive tax avoidance. She said Canada  had agreed to include exemptions for buildings and lands in the tax treaty to  encourage investments by Luxembourg residents and companies. Alta Luxembourg  made such an investment. As a result, it can claim a tax exemption and the  anti-avoidance provisions of the Canadian <em>Income  Tax Act</em> cannot be used to deny the exemption. "

The Court declared this offence to be inconsistent with the Charter and hence void. The declaration of invalidity did not take immediate effect but rather was suspended for one year. The Court did not explicitly state whether this declaration would apply retroactively or purely prospectively at the conclusion of the period of suspension. Two weeks before the suspension expired, the former s.\u00a0212(1)(j) was replaced with a new provision that prohibits obtaining a material benefit from sexual services but exempts legitimate, non\u2011exploitive conduct. Parliament did not state whether the amendments were to apply retroactively or prospectively.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 About two years after the declaration took effect, the accused were charged with numerous offences arising out of an escort operation. Some of the offences occurred during the one-year period of suspension, resulting in charges under s.\u00a0212(1)(j). The trial judge found the accused to be parasitic, exploitative pimps, but he quashed the charges against both accused for living on the avails of sex work. He reasoned that once the Bedford suspension expired, the offence was unconstitutional because suspended declarations under s.\u00a052(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, have a delayed retroactive effect \u2014 meaning that once the suspension expires, the law will have always been unconstitutional \u2014, unless it is clearly stated otherwise. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeals and entered convictions on the counts of living on the avails of sex work. It held that the Bedford declaration never came into effect because the legislature enacted remedial legislation during the suspension, which pre\u2011empted the retroactive effect of the suspended declaration of invalidity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Brown and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, Moldaver, Karakatsanis, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: In light of the purpose animating the suspension of the declaration of invalidity in Bedford, the presumption of retroactivity of a declaration of invalidity is rebutted by necessary implication. The purpose of a suspension must be considered in determining whether the declaration must logically operate retroactively or purely prospectively. In Bedford, the Court\u2019s remedy was purely prospective, because the purpose of the suspension \u2014 avoiding deregulation that would leave sex workers vulnerable \u2014 would be frustrated by a retroactive remedy. Accordingly, the accused could be charged and convicted, after the suspension expired and the declaration took effect, for committing the offence of living on the avails of sex work under s.\u00a0212(1)(j) during the suspension period. Because they engaged in exploitative and parasitic conduct, the exact conduct that was always legitimately criminalized, a remedy under s.\u00a024(1) of the Charter is not available to them.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When legislation violates a Charter right, three foundational constitutional principles guide the interpretation of constitutional remedies: constitutionalism, the rule of law, and the separation of powers. To determine an appropriate remedy, a court must consider not only the principle of constitutional supremacy in s.\u00a052(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, but also the entitlement of the public to the benefit of legislation, as well as the different institutional roles that courts and legislatures are called to play. These foundational principles also establish strong \u2014 but rebuttable \u2014 presumptions that legislation is prospective and judicial declarations are retroactive.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is a strong presumption against retroactive application of legislation because the rule of law requires that people be able to order their affairs in light of an established legal order. In the instant case, in the absence of retroactive legislative intent either explicitly or by necessary implication, the strong presumption that legislation is prospective is not challenged. Whereas the rule of law dictates a presumption that legislation is prospective, the inverse is true for judicial remedies. The basic role of courts to decide disputes after they have arisen requires that judicial decisions operate (at least ordinarily) with retroactive effect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When a court makes a s.\u00a052(1) declaration of invalidity, the same presumption of retroactivity arises. A retroactive declaration changes the law for all time, both reaching into the past and affecting the future: the law is deemed to have been invalid from the moment of its enactment. However, many fundamental principles that are essential to Canada\u2019s constitutional system curtail the retroactive reach of judicial remedies. For example, the doctrine of res judicata and the de facto and qualified immunity doctrines balance the generally retroactive nature of judicial remedies with the need for finality and stability. When the declaration is purely prospective, the law was valid from its enactment but is invalid once the declaration takes effect.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The presumption of retroactivity can be rebutted explicitly or by necessary implication. The rare circumstances and constitutional considerations that warrant a suspension of a declaration of invalidity can justify an exception to the retroactive application of declarations where necessary to give effect to the purpose of the suspension. When retroactivity would defeat the compelling public interests that required the suspension, the presumption is rebutted and the declaration must apply purely prospectively. Courts in the future should explicitly state the temporal application of their s.\u00a052(1) declarations to avoid any confusion.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The purpose animating the suspension in Bedford was to avoid the deregulation of sex work (thus maintaining the protection of vulnerable sex workers) while Parliament crafted replacement legislation. In light of that purpose, the declaration of invalidity was purely prospective, effective at the end of the period of suspension. A retroactive declaration would have rendered the regulatory system of criminal offences that was maintained by the suspension entirely unenforceable once the suspension expired, undermining the protection of the vulnerable victims that was at the root of the finding of unconstitutionality. Conversely, prospective application is far more consonant with the purpose of the Bedford suspension and more protective of sex workers\u2019 rights.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When a s.\u00a052(1) declaration is prospective, a person whose Charter rights are breached by the law declared to be unconstitutional is not left without a remedy. A prospective declaration does not deprive people of individual remedies and would not contravene the principle that nobody may be convicted of an offence under an unconstitutional law. Where the compelling public interests that required suspending the declaration would not be undermined and when additional relief is necessary to provide an effective remedy in a specific case, s.\u00a024(1) is a flexible vehicle that can be combined with s.\u00a052(1). The findings of unconstitutionality by the court can operate retroactively in individual cases, giving remedial effect to both ss.\u00a024(1) and 52(1). Following the findings of Bedford, if an accused is charged with conduct that bears no relation to the purpose of the living on the avails offence \u2014 for example because they were a legitimate driver or bodyguard \u2014 an application judge may find a breach of that accused\u2019s s.\u00a07 rights and grant a s.\u00a024(1) remedy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown and Rowe JJ. (dissenting): The declaration of invalidity in Bedford had retroactive effect as of the date the suspension expired, rendering s.\u00a0212(1)(j) of the Criminal Code void ab initio. Remedial legislation did nothing to cure the constitutional defect in s.\u00a0212(1)(j) as it existed in the past, and could do nothing to alter the Court\u2019s declaration that s.\u00a0212(1)(j) is unconstitutional. As such, s.\u00a0212(1)(j) was unconstitutional at the time the accused were found guilty, and the s.\u00a0212(1)(j) counts must accordingly be quashed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Ordinarily, constitutional declarations of invalidity are retroactive, and have immediate effect. This is the logical implication of s.\u00a052(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The retroactive nature of constitutional declarations of invalidity also flows from the nature of judicial remedies generally. An immediate retroactive declaration of invalidity renders the law invalid from the date of the declaration, back to the date the law was enacted.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Although the Court recognized the predominance of the retroactive approach, it also recognized two important exceptions: prospective declarations and suspended declarations. Prospective declarations of invalidity apply only forward in time from the moment of the declaration, but do not render a law invalid back in time from the moment of its enactment, as though the law never existed. Suspended declarations of invalidity delay the moment when the effects of a declaration of invalidity, whether retroactive or prospective, become operative. When a retroactive declaration of invalidity is suspended, the law is treated as valid for the period of the suspension, but when the suspension period expires, it is as though the law had always been invalid. An immediate prospective declaration of invalidity renders a law invalid from the date of the declaration forward into the future, but not back into the past. The law was and remains valid from the date it was enacted until the date of the prospective declaration. A prospective declaration of invalidity with a suspension, often called a transition period, works in a similar way to an immediate prospective declaration, except that the declaration becomes effective only when the transition period ends.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Prospective declarations raise concerns, because they fail to address any past unconstitutional effects of a law. Similarly, suspended declarations of invalidity are deeply controversial, because they allow an unconstitutional state of affairs to persist, thereby posing a threat to the very idea of constitutional supremacy.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When a court issues a declaration of constitutional invalidity and intends that declaration to deviate from the traditional norm of retroactivity and immediacy, it must say so deliberately and explicitly, in order to avoid confusion. Only a clear statement that a declaration is prospective, suspended, or prospective with a transition period, will suffice, because of the strong presumption that constitutional declarations are retroactive and immediate. While prospective and suspended remedies are available, it must be borne in mind that they are not explicitly authorized by the text of s.\u00a052(1). They are deviations from the traditional and widespread understanding of the role of the judiciary in which courts grant retroactive relief applying existing law or rediscovered rules which are deemed to have always existed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Similarly, when a legislature enacts new legislation in order to correct the unconstitutional effects of a law during a period of suspension of invalidity, the temporal effect of the new law should be stated explicitly so as to avoid confusion. There is a strong presumption that laws are of prospective, and not of retroactive, effect. However, the presumption that legislation applies prospectively can be rebutted by either express words or necessary implication. Therefore, where a legislature wishes legislation to be retroactive, so as to avoid a legal gap that would arise when the period of suspension of invalidity of a retroactive declaration of invalidity expires, it should make this explicit in the legislation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Suspending a retroactive declaration of invalidity can be an uneasy fit in the criminal law context, because criminal prosecutions take time. When an offence is declared void ab\u00a0initio by a court, no one can thereafter be convicted of that offence, even for conduct that occurred prior to the declaration. This is because the offence will be deemed to have never existed and no one can be found guilty of an unconstitutional (and non\u2011existing) law. Accused persons can only be convicted of the offence during the brief window of the suspension. The suspension therefore accomplishes little, precisely because criminal prosecutions take time to move through the system.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court could have issued a prospective declaration in Bedford, but did not. Bedford did not say that the declaration was prospective, and retroactivity is the default position. The absence of any explicit justification for a prospective ruling weighs against interpreting a declaration as having a prospective effect only, especially in the criminal context, because of the general rule that no one should be convicted of an offence under an unconstitutional law. The potential for continued, active enforcement of an unconstitutional criminal law gives rise to rule of law concerns and weighs against imposing a declaration that is prospective only. It also weighs against interpreting an ambiguous declaration as prospective, after the fact. Accordingly, the declaration from Bedford had retroactive effect, as of the date the suspension expired.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Explained: Canada (Attorney General) v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds convictions for  two men who were operating a sexual escort service. \u00a0</strong>\r\n     The question in this case is how courts should treat crimes that are  committed after the Supreme Court of Canada declares a law unconstitutional but  before that declaration takes effect. That is what happened when Mr. Tamim  Albashir and Mr. Kasra Mohsenipour were convicted in 2019 for offences that  occurred between 2013 and 2016. At that time, the men were operating a sexual  escort service in Vancouver. Among the offences was a violation of section  212(1)(j) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which  barred pimps from living off the money made by sex workers. In 2013, in the case of <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13389/index.do\">Canada  (Attorney General) v. Bedford</a></em>, the Supreme Court found Canada\u2019s  prostitution laws were unconstitutional, including section 212(1)(j). The  judges found that it had criminalized all sex work, instead of focusing on  controlling and abusive pimps. The Supreme Court gave Parliament a one year  \u201csuspension period\u201d to change the law, which it did in 2014. Mr. Albashir and  Mr. Mohsenipour committed the section 212(1)(j) offences during that suspension  period, but were charged after it ended.      At their trial, the question was whether the old law had become  unconstitutional, preventing the men from being convicted. The trial judge decided  that the law had indeed been unconstitutional at the time the crimes were  committed and quashed the charges against both men.  The Crown appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which convicted  the men. The Court of Appeal held that the Supreme Court\u2019s declaration of  unconstitutionality had never taken effect because Parliament had replaced  section 212(1)(j) before the end of the suspension period. Mr. Albashir and Mr.  Mohsenipour appealed their convictions to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals.  <strong>The men could be charged and  convicted under section 212(1)(j) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> after the suspension period had ended for conduct committed during it.  \u00a0</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis explained that a  retroactive declaration means the law is considered to have always been invalid.  A prospective declaration, on the other hand, means the law is considered to be  invalid only after the suspension period has ended and the declaration of  constitutional invalidity has taken effect.     In the<em> Bedford</em> case, the Court had not said whether that declaration  would apply retroactively or prospectively. But the purpose for the suspension  was to continue to protect vulnerable sex workers while Parliament replaced  section 212(1)(j) with a new law. In light of this purpose, the majority in this  case said section 212(1)(j) was unconstitutional only after the suspension  period had ended. As a result, Mr. Albashir and Mr. Mohsenipour were liable under  this provision for their conduct during the suspension period, and could be  charged and convicted under it. \r\n  "

His insurer, Royal & Sun Alliance (\u201cRSA\u201d), proceeded to defend his estate in two lawsuits started by B and another claimant, both injured in the accident. Three years after the accident, and over a year into litigation, RSA learned that D had consumed alcohol immediately prior to the accident, putting him in breach of his insurance policy. RSA promptly ceased defending D\u2019s estate and denied coverage. Nearly three years later, the other claimant\u2019s action proceeded to trial, resulting in a judgment against D\u2019s estate and against B, and a judgment for B on his cross\u2011claim against D\u2019s estate. B sought a declaration of entitlement to recover judgment against RSA on the basis that RSA waived D\u2019s breach or was estopped from denying coverage to D\u2019s estate. The trial judge granted the declaration and found that RSA had waived its right to deny full coverage by failing to take an off\u2011coverage position and by providing a defence to D\u2019s estate as the litigation progressed. Having found waiver by conduct, the trial judge did not consider the estoppel argument. The Court of Appeal allowed RSA\u2019s appeal, holding that, at that time, Ontario\u2019s Insurance Act precluded recognition of waiver by conduct and with respect to estoppel, that RSA\u2019s conduct could not amount to a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the parties\u2019 legal relationship, as RSA lacked knowledge of D\u2019s policy breach when it provided him with a defence. B sought to appeal the decision, but after being granted leave, he reached a settlement agreement with RSA and discontinued his appeal. Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia asked and was permitted to be substituted as the appellant.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held: The appeal should be dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown, Rowe and Kasirer JJ.: Waiver by conduct was precluded by statute at the relevant time. With respect to promissory estoppel, RSA could not have intended to alter its legal relationship with B because it lacked knowledge of the facts which demonstrated D\u2019s policy breach.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Promissory estoppel requires that (1) the parties be in a legal relationship at the time of the promise or assurance; (2) the promise or assurance be intended to affect that relationship and to be acted on; and (3) the other party in fact relied on the promise or assurance. In the insurance context, estoppel arises most commonly where an insurer, having initially taken steps consistent with coverage, then denies coverage because of the insured\u2019s breach of a policy term or its ineligibility for insurance in the first place. To prevent the insurer from denying coverage, the insured will attempt to show that the insurer is estopped from changing its coverage position based on its prior words or conduct.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To ground promissory estoppel, the requirement that a promise or assurance be intended to affect the parties\u2019 legal relationship signifies that the promisor must know of the facts that are said to give rise to that legal relationship, and of the alteration thereto. The significance of intention depends entirely on what the promisor knows. A promisor cannot intend to alter a relationship by promising to refrain from acting on information that it does not have. Constructive knowledge arising from a breach of a duty to investigate is not enough, and to hold otherwise would be to unwisely and unnecessarily undermine the existing duty on insurers owed to insureds to investigate liability claims fairly, in a balanced and reasonable manner. However, where an insurer is shown to be in possession of the facts demonstrating a breach, an inference may be drawn that the insurer, by its conduct, intended to alter its legal relationship with the insured \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that the insurer did not realize the legal significance of the facts or otherwise failed to appreciate the terms of its policy with the insured.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The proposed duty to investigate thoroughly and diligently is rejected. It is at odds with the duty owed to the insured to investigate fairly, in a balanced and reasonable manner. There is no basis in law for a third-party claimant to be able to ground an estoppel argument in any alleged breaches of an insurer\u2019s duty to its insured. The duty to investigate fairly, in a balanced and reasonable manner, is owed only to the insured, not third parties. Were such a duty owed to third parties, it would sit uneasily, and indeed would undermine the duties of utmost good faith and fair dealing that govern the relationship between the parties to insurance contracts. The obligations between the insurer and the insured are reciprocal; while the insurer has a duty to investigate fairly, in a balanced and reasonable manner, the insured is also under a reciprocal duty to disclose facts material to the claim. To allow third\u2011party claimants to piggy\u2011back onto the relationship between insurer and insured would effectively mean that a contract of liability insurance provides greater protection to, and imposes fewer (indeed, no) obligations upon, third parties than it provides to and imposes upon the first\u2011party insured.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, RSA, the promisor, could not intend to alter a relationship by promising to refrain from acting on information that it did not have. If RSA is to be taken, by having furnished a defence, as having intended to affect a relationship with B by extending coverage notwithstanding D\u2019s breach, it must be shown to have known of the facts which demonstrate that breach. However, RSA lacked knowledge, at the time it provided a defence to D\u2019s estate, of D having breached the policy by consuming alcohol. This is fatal to the argument that RSA is estopped from denying coverage. As for imputed knowledge, had RSA known of the fact that demonstrated D\u2019s breach (that he had consumed alcohol prior to the accident) but failed to appreciate its legal significance (that this was a breach), knowledge of that legal significance could have been imputed to RSA. But when RSA defended D\u2019s estate, it did not know of the fact of his consumption of alcohol prior to the accident. Knowledge of the facts demonstrating D\u2019s breach cannot be imputed to RSA, and RSA therefore cannot be taken to have intended to assure D\u2019s estate, or B, or anyone else, that it would not be relying upon that breach to deny coverage. While RSA was under a duty to D to investigate the claim against him fairly, in a balanced and reasonable manner, RSA was under no additional duty to B or other third\u2011party claimants to investigate policy breaches at all, much less on a different and more rigorous standard than that owed to its insured.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis J.: There is agreement that the appeal should be dismissed and with much of the majority\u2019s legal analysis. However, there is disagreement that the element of promissory estoppel that requires an intention to vary legal rights requires the promisor\u2019s actual knowledge of the facts underlying the legal right.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The jurisprudence has long established that the intent of the promisor in promissory estoppel must be interpreted objectively, based upon their words or conduct: a promise is intended to be binding when it would be reasonable for the promisee to interpret it as such. The objective approach considers whether, viewed objectively in light of the full context and including all the facts that the promisor knew or reasonably can be taken to have known, the promisor intended to alter legal rights. There are important doctrinal reasons to focus on the reasonable interpretation of the promisor\u2019s conduct, and not on their subjective intent or actual knowledge. Promissory estoppel responds to inequity and reliance. Inequity is found where the promisor acted in such a way that the promisee reasonably interpreted the words or conduct as a promise and the promisee changed their position as a result. The person who relies on the promisor\u2019s words or conduct should be able to rely on the entire context, including what the promisor could reasonably be assumed to know.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A promisor cannot resist promissory estoppel by claiming that they only had knowledge of the facts but not their legal rights. The jurisprudence imputes knowledge of legal rights precisely because it would be inequitable for the promisor to resile where their conduct can reasonably be interpreted as an intention to change legal relations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Given that the analysis does not focus on the subjective intent of the promisor, there is no absolute requirement that the promisor have knowledge of their legal rights or the underlying facts giving rise to those rights in every case. Instead, knowledge is relevant because it is part of the context informing the objective interpretation of the promisor\u2019s words or conduct. Because the intention of the words or conduct must be assessed objectively, both what the promisor knew and what they reasonably ought to have known are relevant.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, there is agreement with the majority that RSA\u2019s conduct cannot be interpreted as an unequivocal assurance that RSA would continue to provide coverage even if the policy was void. RSA\u2019s continued coverage did not signify any intent to change legal relations. B cannot succeed in establishing promissory estoppel because RSA did not make a promise or assurance that can be reasonably interpreted as intending to alter legal relations.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Maracle v.

        "summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an insurance company with no knowledge of a policy  violation may deny full coverage once made aware of the violation.</strong> \r\n   On May 29,  2006, Mr. Steven Devecseri died in a motorcycle accident where other people  were injured. Among them, Mr. Jeffrey Bradfield and Mr. Jeremy Caton decided to  sue his estate. Mr. Devecseri\u2019s insurance company, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance  (RSA), proceeded to defend the estate in the two lawsuits.  Three years  after the accident, and more than a year into litigation, RSA learned Mr. Devecseri  had consumed alcohol immediately before the accident, putting him in breach of his  insurance policy. RSA promptly stopped defending Mr. Devecseri\u2019s estate and  denied coverage. In doing so, Mr. Bradfield and Mr. Caton were no longer  eligible for $1 million under the insurance policy. Nearly three years later, Mr.  Caton\u2019s action went to trial. The result was a judgment against Mr. Devecseri\u2019s  estate as well as against Mr. Bradfield. There was also a judgment in favour of  Mr. Bradfield on his counter-claim against the estate.  Mr. Bradfield  sought a declaration allowing him to recover judgment against RSA on the basis  that the insurance company had waived its right to deny full coverage because  it had provided a defence to Mr. Devecseri\u2019s estate as the litigation  progressed.  The trial  judge granted the declaration, finding that RSA had indeed waived its right to  deny full coverage. The Ontario Court  of Appeal allowed RSA\u2019s appeal. It held that RSA could deny coverage, despite  having provided a defence to Mr. Devecseri\u2019s estate, because it did not know of  his policy breach.  Mr. Bradfield  sought to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, but after being  granted leave, he settled with RSA and dropped his appeal. The Trial Lawyers  Association of British Columbia was permitted to be substituted as the  appellant. Although the appeal was moot, the Trial Lawyers Association wanted  to know how the Court would have decided the issue. An appeal is moot if the  dispute is already resolved. However, a court may decide to hear a case nonetheless,  to clarify the law on the issue.\u00a0  The Supreme  Court agreed to hear the appeal, but ultimately sided with RSA.  <strong>Waiver by conduct was not  possible under the statute as it read at the time.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a  majority of the judges, Justices Moldaver and Brown observed that the Trial  Lawyers Association had conceded, rightfully in their view, that waiver by  conduct was precluded by the <em>Insurance  Act</em> as it read at the time. The statute required that waiver be given in  writing and, in this case, the parties agreed that RSA had not given a waiver  in writing. Also, the  majority agreed with the Court of Appeal that RSA could deny coverage, despite  having defended claims against Mr. Devecseri\u2019s estate, because it did not know  of his policy breach."

There is no need to disavow the starting\u2011point approach to sentencing. Sentencing ranges and starting points are simply different tools that assist sentencing judges in reaching a proportionate sentence. It is not for the Court to dictate which of these tools can or cannot be used. Provincial appellate courts should be afforded the respect and latitude to provide their own forms of guidance to sentencing judges, as long as that guidance comports with the principles and objectives of sentencing and with the proper appellate standard of review. However, starting points must be properly treated as non\u2011binding guidance by both sentencing and appellate courts and appellate courts must adhere to the deferential standard of review in sentencing appeals and to the Court\u2019s clear direction on how to account for starting points when reviewing sentences for errors in principle and demonstrable unfitness.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Sentencing is one of the most delicate stages of the criminal justice process. \u00a0It requires judges to consider and balance a multiplicity of factors and it remains a discretionary exercise. The goal in every case is a fair, fit and principled sanction. Proportionality is the organizing principle in reaching this goal, and parity and individualization are secondary principles. Individualization is central to the proportionality assessment. Each offence is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a unique profile. The question is always whether the sentence reflects the gravity of the offence, the offender\u2019s degree of responsibility and the unique circumstances of each case. Sentencing courts are best\u2011positioned to craft a fit sentence for the offenders before them. As for appellate courts, they play two roles: considering the fitness of a sentence appealed against and promoting stability in the development of the law while providing guidance to lower courts to ensure the law is applied consistently. Appellate courts are well\u2011positioned to provide such guidance because of their appreciation of overall sentencing practices, patterns and problems in their jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Appellate guidance may take the form of quantitative tools such as sentencing ranges and starting points, non\u2011quantitative guidance explaining the harms entailed by certain offences, or a mix of both. Quantitative appellate guidance, generally starting points or sentencing ranges, operate to ensure sentences reflect the sentencing principles prescribed in the Criminal Code. Neither relieves the sentencing judge from conducting an individualized analysis. Sentencing ranges generally represent a summary of the case law that reflects past minimum and maximum sentences imposed by trial judges. Starting points are an alternative to ranges. The starting\u2011point methodology has three stages: defining the category of an offence to which the starting point applies; setting a starting point; and individualization of the sentence by the sentencing court. \u00a0Both reflect judicial consensus on the gravity of the offence. Irrespective of the preferred sentencing methodology, the purpose of the modality is to assist the sentencing judge in achieving the objectives and principles of sentencing, primarily proportionality. Ranges and starting points are simply different paths to the same destination: a proportionate sentence. Courts of appeal have discretion to choose which form of guidance they find most useful; however, because starting points are not binding precedents, parties seeking to challenge them need not have resort to a reconsideration application procedure.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Sentencing decisions are entitled to a high level of deference on appeal. Deviation from a range or starting point does not in itself justify appellate intervention. Unless a sentence is demonstrably unfit or the sentencing judge made an error in principle that impacted the sentence, an appellate court must not vary the sentence. Ranges and starting points cannot be binding in theory or practice and appellate courts cannot apply the standard of review to enforce them. Directions in R. v. Arcand, 2010 ABCA 363, relating to the binding nature of starting points do not reflect the required standard of appellate review. It is not the role of appellate courts to enforce a uniform approach to sentencing through the application of the standard of review; rather, appellate courts must guard against undue scrutiny of the sentencing judge\u2019s discretionary choice of method. There is no longer space to interpret starting points or ranges as binding in any sense. Departing from a range or starting point is appropriate where required to achieve proportionality and exceptional circumstances are not required when departing from a range or starting point to achieve proportionality.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Starting points do not relieve the sentencing judge from considering all relevant sentencing principles. Sentencing judges have discretion over which objectives to prioritize and may choose to weigh rehabilitation and other objectives more heavily than \u201cbuilt\u2011in\u201d objectives like denunciation and deterrence. Appellate sentencing guidance ought not to purport to pre\u2011weigh or build in any mitigating factors and starting points should not be viewed as incorporating principles such as restraint or rehabilitation. Sentencing judges are not precluded from considering any factor that is built in to a starting point as mitigating in the individual circumstances and retain the discretion to weigh all relevant factors in their global assessment of a fit sanction. When setting starting points and ranges, inclusion of characteristics of an archetypal offender could impede individualization of sentences. Sentencing ranges and starting points are applicable only inasmuch as they solely speak to the gravity of the offence. By restricting starting points and ranges to strictly offence\u2011based considerations, they will continue to be useful without fettering discretion or impeding individualization in a way that could produce clustering of sentences. Any risk of clustering is properly addressed by ensuring sentencing judges consider all factors relevant to each individual offender and by clarifying the proper standard of review on appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Starting\u2011point methodologies are not mutually incompatible with Gladue principles. When reviewing sentences imposed on Indigenous offenders, appellate courts must bear in mind that a formalistic approach to parity should not be allowed to undermine the remedial purpose of s.\u00a0718.2(e). They must also factor in the unique circumstances of an Indigenous offender which could reasonably and justifiably impact the sentence. Starting points do not relieve sentencing judges from considering whether different or alternative sanctions may more effectively achieve the objectives of sentencing. Finally, starting\u2011point sentencing is not a quasi\u2011legislative endeavour. Judicially created categories for sentencing are not unique to starting points. Appellate courts are entitled to conclude that certain forms of conduct are generally more serious and should attract a higher range or starting point. The risk of incursion into the legislative sphere arises only where an appellate court departs from the standard of review by treating a sentencing judge\u2019s selection of a category as an error in principle.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal did not err in setting a starting point for wholesale fentanyl trafficking. It was not necessary to wait for the development of an historical portrait of past sentences. Appellate courts must sometimes set a new direction that reflects a contemporary understanding of the gravity of the offence. It was open to the Court of Appeal to set out guidance conveying the gravity of wholesale trafficking in fentanyl. A key factor in the categorization of drug offences has always been the nature of the drug and harm\u2011based analyses are not an unfamiliar judicial exercise. Appellate courts may step in to provide guidance to ensure sentences reflect harms, even where the drug is relatively new. The Court of Appeal was entitled to take the lead and consider the public health crisis in Alberta.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 F\u2019s seven\u2011year sentence was demonstrably unfit. The sentencing judge misapprehended the gravity of the offence and referred to cases that were significantly factually distinct. A more accurate sentencing range for this offence would be 8 to 15 years. The sentencing judge\u2019s error impacted his assessment of parity. F\u2019s sentence was a substantial and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing similar crimes. An assessment of the gravity of the offence may take into account the offender\u2019s willingness to exploit at\u2011risk populations and communities. F was trafficking fentanyl destined for resale in the remote communities in Nunavut. The sentence of 10 years imposed by the Court of Appeal should be upheld.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 P\u2019s 11\u2011year global sentence was also demonstrably unfit. There is no reason to disturb the sentence of 14 years imposed by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge erred in his selection of comparator cases and in finding a relevant range of 5 to 7 years\u2019 imprisonment. P was in possession of significant amounts of fentanyl and other drugs, guns and body armour. He had a lengthy criminal record and re\u2011established his presence as a wholesale trafficker following his release. Based on the gravity of the offence, Gladue factors and P\u2019s aggravating and mitigating circumstances, a global sentence of 14 years is appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Moldaver and C\u00f4t\u00e9 JJ.: The appeals should be dismissed. The sentences imposed by the sentencing judges in both cases were demonstrably unfit. They fall markedly below the range of sentences warranted in cases involving the directing minds of largescale fentanyl trafficking operations. With respect to the role of starting points in sentencing, there is agreement with Rowe\u00a0J.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Appellate courts can and should depart from prior sentencing precedents that no longer reflect society\u2019s understanding of the gravity of a particular offence and the blameworthiness of particular offenders. The gravity of largescale trafficking in fentanyl for personal gain requires severe penalties, ranging from mid\u2011level double digit penitentiary terms up to and including life imprisonment. Trafficking in hard drugs leads to addiction, debilitating adverse health effects, death by overdose and an increase in all manner of crime by those seeking to finance their addiction and organized crime syndicates. Much of this criminal activity is violent. A devastating consequence of the hard drug trade is its impact on families and the intergenerational trauma it causes. It leads to significant costs to society in terms of health care and law enforcement expenses, as well as lost productivity.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Fentanyl has altered the landscape of the substance abuse crisis in Canada. It is a highly addictive substance which puts its users at risk of serious harm, far greater than other opioids. Various courts have described fentanyl as a national crisis and the epidemic shows no signs of abating. The time has come for the perception of the gravity of largescale trafficking in fentanyl to accord with the gravity of the crisis it has caused.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Accordingly, heavy penitentiary sentences will be appropriate where offenders have trafficked in large quantities of fentanyl and assumed leadership roles in the trafficking operation. Substantial sentences should be neither unusual nor reserved for exceptional circumstances, and maximum sentences should not be reserved for the abstract case of the worst crime committed in the worst circumstances. Sentencing judges should feel justified, where circumstances warrant, in applying mid\u2011level double digit sentences and, in particularly aggravating circumstances, potential sentences of life imprisonment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Rowe J.: The appeals should be dismissed. There is agreement with Moldaver\u00a0J. and the additional guidance he provides.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Starting points are not a permissible form of appellate guidance. The starting\u2011point approach is, in theory and in practice, contrary to Parliament\u2019s sentencing regime and the Court\u2019s jurisprudence. It undermines the discretion of sentencing judges and departs from the standard of deference required by appellate courts. As a result, it thwarts the imposition of proportionate and individualized sentences. Despite guidance from the Court on numerous prior occasions, the Court of Appeal\u2019s approach has remained unchanged. There is only one effective response: to say that starting\u2011point methodology can no longer be used.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 As mandated by s.\u00a0718.1 of the Criminal Code, in all cases, sentences must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Secondary principles also guide the sentencing process, in particular parity, which requires that similar offenders who commit similar offences in similar circumstances receive similar sentences. In order to produce proportionate sentences, sentencing must be highly individualized. Sentencing judges must determine which objectives of sentencing merit greater weight and evaluate the importance of mitigating or aggravating factors, to best reflect the circumstances of each case.\u00a0 An appellate court can only vary a sentence if it is demonstrably unfit or the sentencing judge made an error in principle that had an impact on the sentence. An appellate court cannot intervene simply because it would have weighed relevant factors and objectives differently.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Starting points are, by their nature, a prescriptive form of appellate guidance, in that they provide a sequence to follow when determining a fit sentence. Their foundational rationale is the idea that appellate courts are institutionally responsible for creating and enforcing a uniform approach to sentencing. The starting-point approach seeks to reduce arbitrariness, disparity and idiosyncratic decision\u2011making in order to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. The flaw in this rationale is apparent. Variability resulting from individualization is an essential feature of just sentencing, not a problem. Giving effect to Parliament\u2019s choice to confer broad discretion on sentencing judges will inevitably produce variation in sentences. Focussing on variability as a problem is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s jurisprudence; it also creates or reinforces problems. Jail becomes the norm, starting points become hardened into fixed sentences, and factors leading to systemic discrimination are ignored or inadequately dealt with.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The starting\u2011point approach is also grounded in an erroneous view of proportionality. Proportionality is not achieved by ranking of offences and categories of offences. It is achieved through individualized sentencing that takes into account the specific circumstances of both the offender and the offence. The Court of Appeal\u2019s approach is dismissive of the value of precedent in achieving proportionality. Finally, the starting-point approach is premised on a misconception of the role of appellate courts. It sees individualization as a threat to the rule of law and requires appellate courts to create and enforce a uniform approach to sentencing. It reverses the logic of deference to sentencing judges and frames appellate courts as being primarily institutionally responsible and capable for sentencing. Starting points shift effective decision\u2011making authority from individual sentencing judges and concentrate that authority in the Court of Appeal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The starting\u2011point approach also produces practical issues at each of its stages. Setting starting points is a policy\u2011intensive process which the legislature or a statutory body is better suited to conduct. Starting points can operate like judicially\u2011created criminal offences but creating new offences is the exclusive preserve of Parliament. Furthermore, starting points raise procedural fairness concerns. The offender may not have the resources to guide the court in setting a starting point and future offenders do not have the opportunity to challenge the evidence relied on to set starting points. Sentencing requires flexibility to ensure a result that is fit for the offender and for the administration of criminal justice and the starting-point approach does not provide adequate room for such flexibility.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The application of starting points by trial judges is another area in which the starting-point approach is inconsistent with the principles of sentencing. Sentencing judges have less discretion to fully consider all relevant circumstances and are less likely to arrive at individualized and proportionate sentences. Starting points overemphasize deterrence and denunciation. They are defined solely in relation to the gravity of the offence. Moral blameworthiness and personal characteristics are secondary considerations. This is a methodological problem because the gravity of the offence and moral blameworthiness must be considered in an integrated manner to achieve proportionate sentences. Sentencing judges using a presumptive sentence do not follow a truly individualized process. Building in some factors to the starting point effectively prescribes the weight to be given to these factors, displacing the sentencing judges\u2019 discretion to determine their weight. Under the starting\u2011point approach, categorization is pivotal, and this improperly shifts the main focus from whether a sentence is just and appropriate to which judicially\u2011created category applies. The starting\u2011point approach also bunches sentences around a median. This clustering effect is antithetical to individualization. Starting points are often established to emphasize deterrence and denunciation and to ensure more retributive punishment. This runs contrary to the objectives of reducing prison as a sanction and expanding use of restorative justice principles. As well, starting points make it more difficult for judges to give adequate weight to restorative justice principles because they are designed to be easy to move up and hard to move down. They explicitly or implicitly foreclose reliance on multiple mitigating factors, which risks overlooking lower, appropriate sentences.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In addition, starting points are incompatible with Parliament\u2019s direction for sentencing Aboriginal offenders. Gladue requires sentencing judges to undertake sentencing of Aboriginal offenders individually and differently, taking into account systemic and background factors that bear on the culpability of the offender and the types of sanctions which might be appropriate because of the offender\u2019s Aboriginal heritage or connection. Methodologically, it would be an error to determine an appropriate sentence for Aboriginal offenders by reference to a typical non\u2011Aboriginal offender and the starting\u2011point approach is contrary to Parliament\u2019s direction to take into account the unique circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, starting points are aggressively enforced by appellate courts. The Court of Appeal of Alberta continues to rely on starting points to circumvent the settled standard of appellate sentencing review. Sentencing judges are not free to ignore starting points and failure to place an offence within the correct category is considered reviewable error. The time is past due to deal decisively with the methodological problems inherent in starting points. Those flaws are structural. They cannot be cured by repeating exhortations relating to the standard of review. The only effective response is to say that the starting-point methodology should no longer be used.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ. (dissenting): There is agreement with Brown and Martin JJ. that starting points are a permissible form of appellate sentencing guidance, provided that they are not used to curtail the highly deferential sentencing standard of appellate review. However, both appeals should be allowed and the original sentences should be restored. The Court of Appeal did not act with restraint and deference. Neither trial judge made an error in principle nor was either sentence demonstrably unfit. Both trial judges appreciated the very grave nature of the offences and reasonably exercised their discretion to place great weight on mitigating factors and rehabilitative sentencing principles. It was not open to the Court of Appeal to reweigh those factors or to second-guess those principles.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The principles of appellate sentencing review are well-settled. Appellate courts can only intervene if the trial judge has erred in principle in a way that impacted the sentence or if the sentence was demonstrably unfit. A trial judge has not erred in principle simply because the appeal court would have weighed the relevant sentencing factors differently. A sentencing judge has discretion over which sentencing objectives to prioritize and which sentencing range is applicable in any given case. An appellate court cannot intervene just because it would have used a different range. Even if an error in principle is found, deference must be shown unless the error impacted the sentence. In the absence of any errors in principle that impacted the sentence, an appellate court can only intervene if the sentence is demonstrably unfit, meaning that it constitutes an unreasonable departure from the fundamental principle that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. A sentence is not demonstrably unfit simply because it falls outside of a particular sentencing range or there is significant deviation from a starting point. Whether a sentence is demonstrably unfit is a qualitative rather than a quantitative assessment. What matters is whether the trial judge imposed a proportionate sentence by reasonably appreciating the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender in the specific circumstances of the case.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The Court of Appeal was not justified in intervening in either F or P\u2019s case. None of the purported errors in principle are borne out on a fair reading of the trial reasons. It cannot be said that F\u2019s trial judge took such a lenient view of wholesale fentanyl trafficking or minimized F\u2019s culpability to such a degree that the sentence was an unreasonable departure from the proportionality principle. The trial judge considered placing F within a range of five to nine and a half years but did not do so as this would not give appropriate weight to mitigating factors. The trial judge found multiple strong mitigating factors, including F\u2019s extremely promising prospects of rehabilitation. It was not open to the Court of Appeal to reweigh these factors. The trial judge made no errors in principle that impacted the sentence. In P\u2019s case, the trial judge\u2019s initial notional sentence of 15 years represents an appropriately grave view of grave offences. The Court of Appeal took issue with the trial judge\u2019s use of three mitigating factors: P\u2019s lack of knowledge of the harms of fentanyl, P\u2019s addiction and P\u2019s M\u00e9tis heritage. In the absence of palpable and overriding error, the Court of Appeal was not entitled to disagree and all three critiques impermissibly intruded upon the trial judge\u2019s factual findings. The Court of Appeal also took issue with the trial judge\u2019s totality analysis. However, totality is a sentencing principle. Different judges may have approached totality differently but that does not mean the trial judge erred. The trial judge did not err in principle and P\u2019s sentence was not demonstrably unfit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Disapproved: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds sentences for two men convicted of wholesale drug  trafficking in Alberta. </strong>\r\n   Two convicted drug dealers appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada  after the Alberta Court of Appeal increased their prison sentences. Patrick  Douglas Felix and Cameron O\u2019Lynn Parranto pleaded guilty to several offences,  including the trafficking of wholesale fentanyl. Wholesale trafficking means  selling drugs in large quantities for others to then resell them. Mr. Felix  worked in Fort McMurray and his offences dated from 2015, whereas Mr. Parranto  worked in Edmonton and his offences dated from 2016. At trial Mr. Felix was  sentenced to seven years in prison and Mr. Parranto was sentenced to 11 years. Unsatisfied  with those sentences, the Crown appealed to Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal, which  heard the two cases together.  In its ruling, the Court of Appeal set a \u201cstarting point\u201d sentence of  nine years for wholesale fentanyl trafficking and increased Mr. Felix\u2019s  sentence to 10 years and Mr. Parranto\u2019s to 14 years. A starting point gives the courts a place to  start when deciding an appropriate sentence. Both men then appealed their  longer sentences to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. A majority of the judges  found the sentences at trial were \u201cdemonstrably unfit\u201d, meaning the sentences  were clearly unreasonable, and that the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling was  appropriate.  <strong>Appeal courts may set \u201cstarting  points\u201d to help lower courts decide on appropriate sentences. </strong>\r\n     The Supreme Court has confirmed that appeal courts may set starting  points to help lower courts decide appropriate sentences. The majority explained  that sentencing is, \u201cone  of the most delicate stages of the criminal justice process\u201d. It remains a  discretionary exercise that requires judges to consider and balance many  factors. The goal in every case is a fair, fit and principled sentence.  Proportionality is the most important principle in reaching this goal. Parity and  individualization are secondary principles. The majority wrote, \u201cthe question  is always whether the sentence reflects the gravity of the offence, the  offender\u2019s degree of responsibility and the unique circumstances of each case.\u201d  Trial courts are best positioned to craft a fit sentence for the offenders  before them.  The majority noted that appellate courts play two roles. They consider  the fitness of a sentence and promote stability in the development of the law,  while providing guidance to lower courts to ensure trial judges apply the law  consistently. Courts of appeal are well positioned to provide such guidance,  the judges wrote, because of their appreciation of overall sentencing practices,  patterns and problems in their jurisdiction.  Even so, the majority said appeal courts must give a high level of  deference to trial court sentencing decisions. Deviating from a sentencing  range or starting point alone does not justify the intervention of appeal  courts. It is only when a sentence is demonstrably unfit or the sentencing  judge made a mistake that an appeal court may vary the sentence. "

One wore a mask and brandished a knife, while the other stood watch at the front door. C was arrested in relation to the robbery and provided police with a statement denying involvement in the robbery but admitting that he had told a group of individuals \u2014 including his friends T and L \u2014 how to commit the robbery. C was subsequently charged with armed robbery and tried by a judge alone. At trial, the Crown advanced two alternative theories of liability: that C was the masked robber and guilty as a principal offender under s.\u00a021(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, or that C was guilty as a party to the armed robbery in that he either abetted the commission of the offence under s.\u00a021(1)(c), or counselled its commission under s.\u00a022(1). The trial judge rejected both theories of liability and acquitted C. In his view, the evidence fell short of proving that C was one of the principal offenders. Regarding party liability, he found that C could only be convicted as a party if the Crown established that C\u2019s friends T and L had committed the robbery, but he concluded that the evidence also fell short in this regard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal, set aside C\u2019s acquittal and ordered a new trial. It found no error in the trial judge\u2019s analysis concerning C\u2019s role as a principal but held that the trial judge made a serious error on the issue of party liability, which may have affected the verdict. Accordingly, it ordered that the new trial be limited to the question of C\u2019s guilt as a party, on the basis of abetting or counselling. The dissenting judge would have dismissed the appeal in its entirety. C appeals as of right to the Court from the setting aside of his acquittal, and the Crown appeals with leave from the order of the Court of Appeal limiting the scope of the new trial.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. dissenting): C\u2019s appeal should be dismissed and the Crown\u2019s appeal should be allowed.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Moldaver, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Martin and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: There is agreement with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in law in his analysis of party liability, which had a material bearing on the acquittal. However, the appropriate remedy is to set aside the acquittal and order a full new trial. While appellate courts have broad powers under s.\u00a0686(8) of the Criminal Code to make any order that justice requires, this does not include the power to limit the scope of a new trial to a particular theory of liability on a single criminal charge. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 For the purposes of determining criminal liability, the Criminal Code does not distinguish between principal offenders and parties to an offence. Sections 21 and 22 codify both liability for an accused who participates in an offence by actually committing it (principal liability), and liability for an accused who participates in an offence by abetting or counselling another person to commit the offence (party liability). Where an accused prosecuted as an abettor or counsellor is being tried alone and there is evidence that more than one person participated in the commission of the offence, the Crown is not required to prove the identity of the other participant(s) or the precise part played by each in order to prove the accused\u2019s guilt as a party. The actus reus of abetting is doing something or omitting to do something that encourages the principal to commit the offence. As for the mens rea, the abettor must have intended to abet the principal in the commission of the offence and known that the principal intended to commit the offence. The actus reus of counselling is the deliberate encouragement or active inducement of the commission of a criminal offence. The person encouraged or induced by the counsellor must also actually participate in the offence. As for the mens rea, the counsellor must have either intended that the offence counselled be committed, or knowingly counselled the commission of the offence while aware of the unjustified risk that the offence counselled was likely to be committed as a result of the accused\u2019s conduct. Whether the person counselled is a principal or party is irrelevant since the focus on a prosecution for counselling is only on the counsellor\u2019s conduct and state of mind.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the instant case, the trial judge erred in law in assessing C\u2019s liability as a party for having abetted or counselled the commission of the offence. By reasoning that the Crown was required to prove that T and L were the principals as a prerequisite to establishing C\u2019s guilt as a party, the trial judge misdirected himself on the law and failed to correctly assess the relevant evidence. The Crown was only required to prove that any one of the individuals encouraged by C went on to participate in the offence either as a principal offender \u2014 in which case C would be guilty as both an abettor and a counsellor \u2014 or as a party \u2014 in which case C would be guilty as a counsellor. C could still have been found guilty of being a party to the offence even if the precise identity or part played by each individual who participated in the commission of the offence was uncertain, so long as C had committed the necessary act with the requisite intent. There was therefore no need for the trial judge to focus on the identity of a given principal, whether or not the Crown identified specific individuals as principals to the offence. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To have an acquittal set aside due to a legal error, the Crown must satisfy an appellate court to a reasonable degree of certainty that the impugned error might have had a material bearing on the acquittal. In the present case, the Crown has met its burden. The trial judge structured his analysis of the evidence based on the erroneous premise that the Crown had to prove T and L were the principals before C could be convicted. He failed to recognize that the evidence before him was reasonably capable of establishing that C committed the prohibited act with the requisite intent for party liability on the basis of abetting or counselling. The verdict may well have been different if the trial judge had considered the evidence in light of the correct legal principles. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Where an appellate court allows an appeal and sets aside an acquittal, it has the power, under s.\u00a0686(4)(b)(i) of the Criminal Code, to order a new trial and to make any order, in addition, that justice requires under s.\u00a0686(8). Three conditions must be met for s.\u00a0686(8) to apply. First, the appellate court must have exercised one of the triggering powers conferred under s.\u00a0686(2), (4), (6) or (7). Second, the order issued must be ancillary to the triggering power in that it cannot be at direct variance with the court\u2019s underlying judgment. Third, the order must be one that justice requires. In the instant case, the second and third conditions were not met. In separating the Crown\u2019s theories of liability in its ancillary order, the Court of Appeal bifurcated the offence of armed robbery into two separate offences: robbery as a principal and robbery as a party, be it as an abettor or counsellor. The effect was to uphold C\u2019s acquittal on the single charge of armed robbery in part.\u00a0This is at odds with the underlying judgment allowing the Crown appeal and setting aside the verdict rendered on that charge as a whole. The ancillary order was also not one that justice required as it threatens the integrity of the criminal process by distorting the truth\u2011seeking function of the courts. A trier of fact must be able to consider all theories of liability that have an air of reality based on the evidence adduced at the new trial. To prospectively deny a trier of fact the ability to consider a viable theory of liability would be to undermine their ability to carry out their core function: to determine whether the Crown has proven that the accused committed the offence(s) charged.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Finally, the doctrine of issue estoppel does not prevent the relitigation of the Crown\u2019s theory that C is guilty of armed robbery as a principal offender. No issue can be said to have been finally decided in the first trial because the result of that trial has been entirely set aside.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Brown and Rowe\u00a0JJ. (dissenting): C\u2019s acquittal should be restored for the reasons of the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal. It is not necessary to deal with the Crown\u2019s appeal; however, there is concern with what the majority has written in this regard.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Issue estoppel precludes the Crown from relitigating an issue that has been determined in the accused\u2019s favour in a prior criminal proceeding. There are three requirements for its application: the issue must have been decided in a prior proceeding; the decision must be final; and the parties to the two proceedings must be the same. The Court of Appeal found no error as to the acquittal based on C having committed the robbery as a principal. This finding should not be set aside. Preventing the Crown from relitigating issues resolved in favour of the accused during the first trial is a question of fairness to the accused, integrity and coherence of the criminal process, and finality. An accused should not have to mount a second defence in the absence of a relevant reversible error. There is also disagreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion relating to the exercise by courts of appeal of their powers under s.\u00a0686(8) of the Criminal Code. In the present case, no error in principle has been shown and the Court of Appeal order is not clearly wrong. First, the order is not at direct variance with the underlying judgment. There is no rule that a charge as a whole must be retried if a new trial is ordered on a count alleging an offence which may be committed in different ways. Rather, whether or not a full new trial should be ordered depends on the degree to which counts, and modes of committing offences charged as a single count, are interconnected. The question is one of being able to isolate the legal error. Second, the Court of Appeal\u2019s order was not contrary to what justice requires. The order promoted fairness to C, the efficient use of the court\u2019s resources, and the integrity of the criminal justice process.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: R. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court orders a new trial  for a Saskatchewan man accused of armed robbery.</strong>\r\n   Two people robbed  a Subway restaurant in Regina, Saskatchewan on July 7, 2016. One wore a mask  and brandished a knife, while the other stood watch at the front door. The only  employee on duty at the time could not identify the two robbers, but the  restaurant security camera had captured images of the masked person.  An anonymous  tip implicated Jason William Cowan and he was arrested soon after. Mr. Cowan  denied having any involvement in the incident and he claimed to have an alibi. However,  he did admit to telling a group of people \u201chow to do a robbery\u201d on the same day  it occurred. Police also noted that Mr. Cowan had been wearing shoes that closely  resembled those worn by the masked person in the images from the security  camera.  When police  showed Mr. Cowan the images from the security camera, he named two of his  acquaintances. He called the lookout person \u201cLittleman\u201d and the armed robber Mr.  Robinson. Mr. Cowan later named two more people. He told police that Mr.  Fiddler and Mr. Tone had driven Littleman and Mr. Robinson to the restaurant  and that they had waited in Mr. Fiddler\u2019s vehicle during the robbery.  Mr. Cowan was  charged with armed robbery. He was tried by judge alone with no jury. At trial,  the Crown advanced two theories about what happened. The first was that Mr.  Cowan was the masked armed robber and, as a result, was guilty as a principal  offender. The second theory was that if he was not the masked man, Mr. Cowan was  a guilty party because he had either helped commit the crime or had advised  others on how to do it. The trial judge rejected both theories and acquitted  Mr. Cowan.  The Crown  appealed to the Court of Appeal, which agreed with the trial judge that Mr.  Cowan was not a principal offender. The judges did not all agree, however, with  the trial judge\u2019s finding that the Crown had to first prove who had committed  the actual robbery before finding Mr. Cowan guilty of helping or advising  others on how to commit the crime. The majority of the Court of Appeal found  that this error may have affected the verdict. They allowed the appeal, set  aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial on the second theory of liability.  Both Mr.  Cowan and the Crown appealed the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling to the Supreme Court  of Canada. Mr. Cowan argued that the trial judge made no error and that his  acquittal should stand. The Crown argued that the Court of Appeal was not  allowed to limit a new trial to a single theory of liability. Instead, the  Crown said there should be a new trial on the charge of armed robbery as a  whole.  The Supreme Court has dismissed Mr. Cowan\u2019s appeal and allowed the  Crown\u2019s appeal. The new trial will be on the charge of armed robbery as a  whole.  <strong>New trial required</strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Moldaver said the trial judge committed an error of law in assessing Mr.  Cowan\u2019s liability as a party to the offence.  To have an acquittal set aside due to a legal error, the Crown must  satisfy an appeal court to a reasonable degree of certainty that the error could  have changed the outcome of the trial. In this case, the judges said, the Crown  had satisfied the Court. They said that the verdict may well have been  different if the trial judge had considered the evidence in light of the  correct legal principles.  <strong>Appeal courts may not limit the  scope of a new trial to a particular theory of liability on a single criminal  charge. </strong>\r\n     The majority  said the new trial should be a \u201cfull new trial\u201d that is not limited to a  particular theory of liability. The majority explained that appeal courts may  not limit the scope of a new trial to a particular theory of liability on a  single criminal charge. They said, \u201cas one of the purposes of the criminal  process is to foster a search for truth, justice cannot require that a trier of  fact be restricted in their ability to determine how, if at all, an accused  participated in a given offence. Rather, a trier of fact must be able to  consider any and all theories of liability that have an air of reality based on  the evidence adduced at the new trial.\u201d "

Holdings Limited (\u201cHMB\u201d), a private company incorporated in Antigua. Litigation ensued at the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and Antigua was ordered to compensate HMB for the expropriation. Years later, HMB brought a common law action in British Columbia to enforce the foreign judgment in that province. Antigua did not defend the action, and as a result, HMB obtained a default judgment. HMB then commenced an application in Ontario to enforce the British Columbia judgment by having it registered under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act (\u201cREJA\u201d). The application judge found that ss.\u00a03(b) and 3(g) of the REJA \u2014 which prescribe, as conditions of registration, that the judgment debtor be carrying on business within the jurisdiction of the original court and that the judgment debtor have no good defence on the original judgment \u2014 barred registration. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the application judge\u2019s conclusion on the basis of s.\u00a03(b) alone.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner\u00a0C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe and Kasirer\u00a0JJ.: Section\u00a03(b) of the REJA effectively bars HMB from registering the British Columbia judgment in Ontario. The term \u201ccarrying on business\u201d set out in s.\u00a03(b) was given a generous and liberal interpretation by the courts below consistent with the Court\u2019s jurisprudence. There is no error of law in their interpretation of s.\u00a03(b), nor is there any palpable and overriding error in the conclusion that Antigua was not carrying on business in British Columbia. In light of this finding, it is unnecessary to consider whether s.\u00a03(g) also bars HMB from registering the British Columbia judgment under the REJA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The REJA allows a person who has obtained a judgment in another jurisdiction (the \u201cjudgment creditor\u201d) to apply to register the judgment in Ontario and creates a process by which the person against whom the judgment was obtained (the \u201cjudgment debtor\u201d) can resist its registration. A judgment registered under the REJA is treated as if it were a judgment originally issued by an Ontario court. Though not the only route available to applicants, the REJA constitutes an easy, economical and expedient mechanism for enforcing foreign judgments. It provides a number of statutory benefits, such as registration without notice to the judgment debtor and a short window, following notice of registration, during which the judgment debtor can seek to set aside the registration. However, this process occurs at a cost: only judgments from reciprocating jurisdictions may be registered under the REJA. Moreover, recognition of judgments under the REJA is subject to seven defences, set out in s.\u00a03. If any one defence is established, the judgment cannot be registered.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The section\u00a03(b) defence to registration places two burdens on a judgment debtor. First, the judgment debtor must establish that they were not carrying on business or ordinarily resident in the jurisdiction of the original court. Second, the judgment debtor must also show that they did not voluntarily appear or otherwise submit to the original court\u2019s jurisdiction during the proceedings the judgment creditor brought in that court. If the judgment debtor shows the Ontario court that these two conditions are met, then s.\u00a03(b) bars the registration of the judgment.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The REJA does not define \u201ccarrying on business\u201d for the purposes of s.\u00a03(b), but this concept has a long history at common law. As a matter of statutory interpretation, common law terms and concepts are presumed to retain their common law meaning when used in legislation. At common law, the concept of \u201ccarrying on business\u201d forms part of the law on the traditional bases of jurisdiction, which recognize and enforce a foreign judgment only if the defendant in the original action had been present in the foreign jurisdiction or had consented in some way to the foreign court\u2019s jurisdiction. Section\u00a03(b) codifies the traditional common law bases of jurisdiction as a prerequisite for registration. The Canadian common law of recognition and enforcement has however developed beyond the traditional bases of jurisdiction to recognize the judgment of a court in one province in another province on the basis of a \u201creal and substantial connection\u201d to the original jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the common law bases of presence and consent remain important, and are critical to understanding s.\u00a03(b) of the REJA.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 To determine whether a defendant is carrying on business in a jurisdiction, the court must inquire into whether it has some direct or indirect presence in the jurisdiction, accompanied by a degree of business activity that is sustained for a period of time. Whether or not a corporation is carrying on business is a question of fact assessed in reference to a number of indicia. Some kind of actual presence, whether direct or indirect, is required. A physical presence in the form of maintenance of physical premises will be compelling, but a virtual presence that falls short of an actual presence will not suffice. \u201cCarrying on business\u201d for the purpose of establishing traditional presence\u2011based jurisdiction is a stricter standard than \u201ccarrying on business\u201d as a mere presumptive connecting factor for assumed jurisdiction. Despite these differences, the requirements for \u201ccarrying on business\u201d under the standard of assumed jurisdiction must also apply for the purposes of traditional presence\u2011based jurisdiction. In both cases, some form of tangible presence in the jurisdiction is required, such as maintaining a physical office.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The REJA applies only to a judgment or an order of a court in any civil proceedings whereby any sum of money is payable. It remains an open question whether a derivative judgment \u2014 which in itself enforces a judgment of a non\u2011reciprocating jurisdiction \u2014 falls within the definition of \u201cjudgment\u201d in s.\u00a01(1) of the REJA and can therefore be registered under the statute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per C\u00f4t\u00e9\u00a0J.: There is agreement with the majority\u2019s analysis under s.\u00a03(b) of the REJA, and with its disposition of the appeal. However, to the extent that the majority\u2019s reasons suggest the REJA might not apply to derivative judgments, there is divergence of opinion. A judgment resulting from a common law action that recognizes a foreign judgment, such as the British Columbia judgment in this case, falls squarely within the broad definition of \u201cjudgment\u201d in s.\u00a01(1) of the REJA, provided that the recognition judgment was rendered in a reciprocating jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Statutory interpretation entails discerning legislative intent by examining statutory text in its entire context and in its grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statute\u2019s scheme and objects. The REJA contains a plain language provision that defines the judgments to which it applies. Under s.\u00a01(1) of the REJA, \u201cjudgment\u201d means a judgment or an order of a court in any civil proceedings whereby any sum of money is payable. Understood in its grammatical and ordinary sense, the definition undoubtedly encompasses recognition judgments such as the British Columbia judgment. Reading into s.\u00a01(1) an exception applicable to derivative judgments is counter\u2011intuitive and supported neither by the text nor by the ordinary rules of statutory interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The REJA\u2019s overarching purpose is to provide a convenient and inexpensive mechanism to register foreign judgments that saves creditors and courts time and resources. Such advantages promote access to justice and are particularly valuable to judgment creditors who are less familiar with Ontario\u2019s legal environment. The main benefit of the REJA\u2019s registration mechanism is that it reverses the litigation burden by permitting registration unless the debtor succeeds in an action to set it aside. Comity between reciprocating jurisdictions is crucial to attain this purpose. Relying on the legally non\u2011existent notion of derivative judgments would do little to keep the REJA\u2019s mechanism accessible and convenient to judgment creditors.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 This interpretation meets the standard of commercial certainty, and accords with the Court\u2019s jurisprudence acknowledging that recognition judgments are capable of being registered in other provinces. But there is an important caveat. While the REJA permits the registration of recognition judgments, it forbids the registration of a judgment that has itself been registered, as the latter does not make money payable. Allowing registration of judgments that have themselves been registered would unduly expand the list of jurisdictions to which the REJA applies by including all of the jurisdictions that are reciprocal to those listed in accordance with the statute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Considered: Club Resorts Ltd. v.

        "summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that a foreign judgment against a Caribbean country cannot  be enforced in Ontario. </strong>\r\n   This case  deals with the enforcement in Canada of a foreign judgment. Antigua and Barbuda  (Antigua) is a country comprised of several islands in the Caribbean. In 2007,  Antigua expropriated beachfront property owned by H.M.B. Holdings Limited  (H.M.B.), a company incorporated in that country.  In 2014, the  court of final appeal for Antigua ordered the government to compensate H.M.B.  for the expropriation. In 2016, H.M.B. started legal action in British Columbia  to enforce the judgment in that province. At the time of the action, Antigua  had no office or premises in British Columbia. However, for the purposes of its  Citizenship by Investment program, Antigua did have contracts with four authorized  representatives with their own businesses, premises and employees in British  Columbia.  Antigua did  not respond to the legal action, and a judgment by default was registered  against it in British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court. Shortly thereafter, H.M.B.  applied to have the British Columbia judgment registered in Ontario, so that it  could be enforced there. Ontario\u2019s <em>Reciprocal  Enforcement of Judgments Act </em>(<em>REJA</em>)  allows a judgment from another province or territory to be registered for  enforcement in Ontario. Antigua  objected to H.M.B.\u2019s application on the basis of two sections of the <em><abbr title=\"Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act\">REJA</abbr></em>. Section 3(b) states that an entity  must be \u201ccarrying on business\u201d in the jurisdiction where the judgment was  rendered. Section 3(g) states that a judgment can only be registered in Ontario  if the opposing party would have a good defense if ever the original judgment  were challenged. The Ontario  Superior Court of Justice decided the British Columbia judgment could not be  registered in Ontario. H.M.B. appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which  found that the British Columbia judgment could not be registered, because of section  3(b) of the <em><abbr title=\"Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act\">REJA</abbr> </em>only. H.M.B. then appealed  to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme  Court has sided with Antigua.\u00a0  <strong>Antigua was not \u201ccarrying on business\u201d in British  Columbia</strong> <strong>where the judgment was rendered<em>,</em> so the judgment could not be  registered for enforcement in Ontario. </strong>\r\n   Writing for a  majority of the judges, Chief Justice Wagner said section 3(b) of the <em><abbr title=\"Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act\">REJA</abbr></em> bars H.M.B. from registering the  British Columbia judgment in Ontario, because Antigua was not \u201ccarrying on  business\u201d in British Columbia. In light of this finding, the majority concluded  that it was unnecessary to consider whether section 3(g) also bars H.M.B. from  registering the judgment under the <em>REJA</em>.  <strong>What does \u201ccarrying on business\u201d mean?</strong>\r\n  The majority  explained that to determine whether a company is carrying on business in a  jurisdiction, the court must decide whether the company has some direct or  indirect presence there, accompanied by a degree of business activity that is sustained  for a period of time. Whether or not a company is carrying on business is a  question of fact. <strong>What is the purpose of the <em><abbr title=\"Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act\">REJA</abbr></em>?</strong>\r\n     The<em><abbr title=\"Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act\"> REJA </abbr></em>allows a person who has obtained a  judgment in another jurisdiction to apply to register the judgment in Ontario. A  judgment registered under the <em>REJA</em> is  treated as if the judgment was originally issued by an Ontario court. This law  is considered an easy,  economical and quick means of enforcing foreign judgments. "

        "summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court finds the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to proceed  with the case of a comedian who mocked a well-known teen singer with a  disability, because it was not discrimination under  the Quebec Charter of human rights and freedoms. </strong><strong>The Court also explains the legal framework that applies to a  discrimination claim involving a public figure\u2019s right to dignity and a  professional comedian\u2019s freedom of expression. The Court said a reasonable  person would not view the comedian\u2019s comments as inciting others to detest or vilify the young  person\u2019s humanity.</strong>\r\n   This case involves  professional comedian Mike Ward, who mocked a well-known young person with a  disability, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Gabriel. Between September 2010 and March 2013, Mr. Ward  performed a popular show called \u201cMike Ward s\u2019Expose\u201d, where he mocked several prominent  people from Quebec\u2019s artistic community. Mr. Gabriel, a high school student  with a singing career, was among them. Mr. Ward also posted video clips of  himself mocking the Quebec artists. In 2012, Mr. Gabriel\u2019s parents filed a  complaint with the <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\">Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la  jeunesse</span> (Commission), on their own behalf and on behalf of their son. The Commission concluded that there was a basis for discrimination. It took  Mr. Ward to the Quebec Human  Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) on behalf of Mr. Gabriel. Before the Tribunal, the  Commission argued that Mr. Ward\u2019s show and online content infringed the Quebec <em>Charter of human rights and freedoms</em>, on  the basis of Mr. Gabriel\u2019s disability. In his defence, Mr. Ward argued that he  had the right to say what he did about Mr. Gabriel, under the Quebec <em>Charter</em>\u2019s protected right to freedom of  expression.  The Tribunal sided with the Commission. It  found Mr.\u00a0Ward had infringed Mr.\u00a0Gabriel\u2019s right to dignity, without  discrimination, because of his disability under sections 4 and 10 of the Quebec <em>Charter</em>. The Tribunal also found that  Mr.\u00a0Ward\u2019s comments exceeded the limits of what a \u201creasonable  person\u201d can tolerate as freedom of expression under section 3 of the Quebec <em>Charter</em>. In law, a reasonable person is a  hypothetical individual that is used as a legal standard to determine how a  typical person would think or behave. This concept is applied in many areas of  the law. Mr. Ward\u2019s appeal of the  Tribunal\u2019s decision was dismissed by a majority of the judges of the Quebec Court  of Appeal. He then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has  found that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to proceed with this  case, because it was not a discrimination complaint.  <strong>This was a not discrimination complaint. </strong>\r\n     Chief Justice Wagner and Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 wrote for  the majority of judges. As they explained, the Tribunal had found that Mr.\u00a0Gabriel  was the target of Mr. Ward\u2019s jokes due to his fame, not due to his  disability, and fame is not a prohibited ground of discrimination under the  Quebec <em>Charter</em>. As a result, the  Tribunal did not have jurisdiction (that is, authority) to proceed with the  case. The majority noted  that the comments made by Mr. Ward about Mr. Gabriel did not lead to an action  in defamation, but rather to a discrimination claim. This distinction is  important because the Tribunal has no power to decide actions in defamation or  other civil liability actions, since its jurisdiction is limited to complaints  of discrimination under the Quebec <em>Charter</em>.  The Tribunal can hear disputes involving comments like those made in this case  only if they are allegedly discriminatory. <strong>Legal framework </strong>\r\n     The  majority went on to explain the legal framework that applies to a  discrimination claim involving a public figure\u2019s right to dignity, on the one  hand, and a professional comedian\u2019s freedom of expression, on the other. Under the  first requirement of this framework, the majority said a reasonable person would not view  Mr.\u00a0Ward\u2019s comments about Mr.\u00a0Gabriel as inciting others to  detest or vilify his humanity. They wrote, \u201cmaking fun of a person\u2019s physical characteristics  may be repugnant; it most certainly is when the person in question is a young  person with a disability who contributes with determination to society. But  expression of this kind does not, simply by being repugnant, incite others to  detest or vilify the humanity of the person targeted.\u201d  Under  the second requirement of this framework, the  majority said a reasonable person could not view the comments as likely to  lead to discriminatory treatment of Mr. Gabriel.  As a result, the majority  concluded that the comments, \u201cexploited,  rightly or wrongly, a feeling of discomfort in order to entertain, but they did  little more than that\u201d. "

After H disclosed her alcohol addiction and refused to enter into an agreement requiring that she abstain from alcohol and engage in addiction treatment, her employment was terminated. H\u2019s union filed a grievance and her employment was reinstated on substantially the same terms as the agreement H had refused to sign. Shortly thereafter, H\u2019s employment was terminated for an alleged breach of those terms. H filed a discrimination complaint with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission, which was heard by an adjudicator appointed under The Human Rights Code. The employer contested the adjudicator\u2019s jurisdiction, arguing that Weber v. Ontario Hydro, 1995 CanLII 108 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, recognizes exclusive jurisdiction in an arbitrator appointed under a collective agreement, and that this extends to human rights complaints arising from a unionized workplace. The adjudicator disagreed, finding that she had jurisdiction because the essential character of the dispute was an alleged human rights violation. She went on to consider the merits of the complaint and found that the employer had discriminated against H.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 On judicial review, the reviewing judge found error in the adjudicator\u2019s characterization of the essential character of the dispute, and set aside her decision on the issue of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal allowed H\u2019s appeal. It agreed that disputes concerning the termination of a unionized worker lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator, including alleged human rights violations. Nevertheless, it held that the adjudicator had jurisdiction in this case and remitted the matter to the reviewing judge to determine whether the adjudicator\u2019s decision on the merits of the complaint was reasonable.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Held (Karakatsanis J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the reviewing judge\u2019s order reinstated in part.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Wagner C.J. and Abella, C\u00f4t\u00e9, Brown, Rowe and Kasirer JJ.: The adjudicator did not have jurisdiction over H\u2019s complaint. Where labour legislation provides for the final settlement of disputes arising from a collective agreement, the jurisdiction of the decision\u2011maker empowered by that legislation \u2014 generally, a labour arbitrator \u2014 is exclusive. Competing statutory tribunals may carve into that sphere of exclusivity, but only where such legislative intent is clearly expressed. In the instant case, the essential character of H\u2019s complaint falls squarely within the labour arbitrator\u2019s mandate, and there is no clear express legislative intent to grant concurrent jurisdiction to the human rights adjudicator over such disputes. The reviewing judge\u2019s order setting aside the adjudicator\u2019s decision should be reinstated.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Exclusive arbitral jurisdiction, as explained by the Court in Weber, captures disputes that are factually related to the rights and obligations under the collective agreement, even where those same facts give rise to other legal claims based in statute or the common law. The question in each case is whether the dispute, viewed with an eye to its essential character, arises from the collective agreement. However, not all actions in the courts between a unionized employer and employee are precluded, because an arbitrator\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction extends only to disputes that expressly or inferentially arise out of the collective agreement, and not every workplace dispute will fall within this scope. In addition, the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator is subject to the residual curial jurisdiction to grant remedies that lie outside the remedial authority of a labour arbitrator.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 When it has considered the relationship between the respective spheres of jurisdiction held by labour arbitrators and statutory tribunals, the Court has affirmed that Weber\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction model applies \u2014 where matters arise from the interpretation, application, administration or violation of the collective agreement, the claimant must proceed by arbitration and no other forum has the power to entertain an action in respect of that dispute. Weber does not stand for the proposition that labour arbitrators always have exclusive jurisdiction in employer-union disputes; rather, depending on the legislation and the nature of the dispute, other tribunals may possess overlapping jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction, or themselves be endowed with exclusive jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 However, exclusive arbitral jurisdiction is not a mere preference that should be disregarded whenever a competing statutory scheme is present, but an interpretation of the mandate given to arbitrators by statute. The unavoidable conclusion to be drawn from the Court\u2019s jurisprudence is that mandatory dispute resolution clauses signal a legislative intention to confer exclusive jurisdiction on the labour arbitrator or other dispute resolution forum provided for under the agreement. The text and purpose of a mandatory dispute resolution clause remains unchanged, irrespective of the existence or nature of competing regimes, and its interpretation must therefore remain consistent. Conditioning the effect of a mandatory dispute resolution clause on the nature of the competing forum would result in persistent jurisdictional confusion, leaving members of the public unsure where to turn to resolve a dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 It is therefore necessary to consider whether a competing statutory scheme demonstrates an intention to displace the arbitrator\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. In some cases, it may enact a complete code that confers exclusive jurisdiction over certain kinds of disputes on a competing tribunal; in other cases, the legislation may endow a competing tribunal with concurrent jurisdiction over disputes that would otherwise fall solely to the labour arbitrator for decision. However, the mere existence of a competing tribunal is insufficient to displace labour arbitration as the sole forum for disputes arising from a collective agreement; some positive expression of the legislature\u2019s will is necessary. Where a legislature intends concurrent jurisdiction, it will specifically so state in the competing tribunal\u2019s enabling statute. But even absent specific language, the statutory scheme may disclose that intention: in some statutes, certain provisions necessarily imply that the tribunal has concurrent jurisdiction over disputes that are also subject to the grievance process, or the legislative history will show that the legislature contemplated concurrency. In these circumstances, an exclusive arbitral jurisdiction model would defeat, not achieve, the legislative intent.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Accordingly, resolving jurisdictional contests between labour arbitrators and competing statutory tribunals entails a two-step analysis. First, the relevant legislation must be examined to determine whether it grants the arbitrator exclusive jurisdiction and, if so, over what matters. Where the legislation includes a mandatory dispute resolution clause, an arbitrator empowered under that clause has the exclusive jurisdiction to decide all disputes arising from the collective agreement, subject to clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. Secondly, if it is determined that the arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction, the next step is to determine whether the dispute falls within the scope of that jurisdiction. The scope will depend on the precise language of the statute but, in general, it will extend to all disputes that arise, in their essential character, from the interpretation, application, or alleged violation of the collective agreement. This requires analysing the ambit of the collective agreement and accounting for the factual circumstances underpinning the dispute. The relevant inquiry is into the facts alleged, and not the legal characterization of the matter.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, two statutes are relevant. First, The Labour Relations Act contains, in s.\u00a078, a mandatory dispute resolution clause that discloses a legislative intent to grant exclusive jurisdiction to the labour arbitrator over all disputes arising from the collective agreement. Secondly, s.\u00a022(1) of The Human Rights Code provides that any person may file a complaint alleging that another person has contravened the Code, and ss.\u00a026 and 29(3) direct the Commission to investigate complaints and, where appropriate, to request the designation of an adjudicator to hear the complaint. While such provisions vest broad jurisdiction in the Commission over Code violations, they are \u2014 absent express displacement of the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator \u2014 insufficient to support a finding that the Commission holds concurrent jurisdiction. Thus, the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction under The Labour Relations Act over disputes that arise, in their essential character, from the interpretation, application, or alleged violation of the collective agreement is exclusive and, more particularly, exclusive of the Commission. The essential character of H\u2019s complaint, which arises from the employer\u2019s exercise of its rights under, and from its alleged violation of, the collective agreement, represents such a dispute. The claim therefore falls solely to an arbitrator to adjudicate. While H alleges a human rights violation, this is not sufficient to displace the exclusive jurisdiction of the labour arbitrator.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Per Karakatsanis J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The statutory schemes under The Labour Relations Act and The Human Rights Code point to concurrent jurisdiction. Although labour arbitration may well have been the more appropriate forum, the adjudicator was not wrong to conclude that she had jurisdiction, nor was she wrong to rule on the merits.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Deciding jurisdictional issues between two tribunals involves a two-step analysis. The first step is to consider both statutory schemes to determine whether the legislature intended for exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction. A liberal interpretation of the legislation is required to ensure that a scheme is not offended by the conferral of jurisdiction on a forum not intended by the legislature, or by ousting the jurisdiction of the intended forum. The second step is to consider the essential character of the dispute to determine whether it falls within one or both of the statutory schemes. This inquiry turns on the facts of the dispute rather than the legal characterization of the claim.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Apart from establishing this framework, the Court\u2019s jurisprudence does not provide a rule that, absent express legislative intent to the contrary, arbitral jurisdiction is exclusive over disputes that fall within the scope of a collective agreement, nor a rebuttable rule that the exclusive jurisdiction model, followed in Weber, applies in every case involving two statutory tribunals. Generally, when statutory tribunals are established, courts should give way to the special grant of jurisdiction given to such tribunals so as not to undermine the benefits intended by the legislature, including the provision of speedy and affordable dispute resolution. However, the reasoning from Weber favouring exclusive labour arbitration over civil litigation in the courts does not readily apply to jurisdictional issues between different statutory tribunals. When two tribunals are created with overlapping mandates and areas of expertise, the legislative schemes must be viewed as a whole. The legislature may very well have assigned the same tasks to two forums and may have intended for more than one adjudicative body to have jurisdiction over a dispute.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Turning to the first step of the analysis in the instant case, The Labour Relations Act confers broad jurisdiction to arbitrators to deal with matters related to a collective agreement. However, the Act does not specifically oust the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under The Human Rights Code. Nor does anything in the Code oust the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over a unionized employee, or oust the jurisdiction of the arbitrator under the Act. Nothing in either scheme suggests the legislature meant for one scheme to prevail over the other. There is no doubt that the labour scheme is designed to rely heavily upon arbitration for matters within the scope of a collective agreement. But so too does the human rights scheme rely heavily upon the Commission to address discrimination. In the jurisprudence, the jurisdiction of human rights tribunals has only been ousted when the statutory text of the other tribunal has specifically excluded all other decision\u2011making bodies, thereby indicating that jurisdiction was meant to be exclusive. No such express or strong language exists in The Labour Relations Act. The Act does not clearly confer exclusive jurisdiction on labour arbitrators, and The Human Rights Code does not remove human rights complaints of unionized employees from the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Under the second step of the analysis, the Court must consider the essential nature of H\u2019s dispute to determine whether it falls within the jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator, or that of the Commission, or both. The claim is about whether H\u2019s employer discriminated against her on the basis of mental or physical disability \u2014 and therefore violated the collective agreement and The Human Rights Code \u2014 when it terminated her employment for allegedly violating her undertaking to abstain from alcohol. This dispute falls within the scope of the collective agreement, which specifically prohibits the employer from discriminating on the basis of disability and provides a grievance and arbitration procedure for any dispute arising out of the agreement\u2019s interpretation, application, or alleged violation. Given this context, H\u2019s discrimination claim can easily be characterized as arising out of an alleged violation of the collective agreement. A labour arbitrator accordingly has jurisdiction over it. However, the dispute also falls within the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction and within the mandate of the Code, as does the processing of H\u2019s complaint. There is no exception for a complaint made by a unionized employee who may be subject to a collective agreement. H\u2019s claim thus falls within both a labour arbitrator\u2019s mandate under The Labour Relations Act and the Commission\u2019s mandate under The Human Rights Code.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 There is agreement with the majority that where two tribunals have concurrent jurisdiction over a dispute, the decision\u2011maker must consider whether to exercise its jurisdiction in the circumstances of a particular case. When the Commission shares jurisdiction with a labour arbitrator over a human rights dispute, a number of factors may guide the Commission\u2019s discretion to hear the complaint of a unionized employee, including: whether the claim is about the collective agreement itself rather than a violation of it; whether the union involved is opposed in interest to the complainant such that they could be left without legal recourse; whether a labour arbitrator would not have jurisdiction over every party possibly affected; and whether the Commission is a better fit.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 These factors have different implications for the exercise of discretion. If the union is adverse in interest or is unwilling to pursue a grievance, unionized employees should still have legal recourse to adjudicate their human rights complaints before the Commission. Conversely, if the claim is about the violation of the collective agreement, if the union is supportive, and if the arbitrator has jurisdiction over the necessary parties, there will be a compelling case for a human rights forum to defer to the labour arbitration regime. Additionally, an inquiry into which forum is a better fit permits a broad consideration of the circumstances of the complaint. The remedy sought by the complainant may be highly relevant. If a complainant seeks a declaration, damages, or systemic changes, a human rights tribunal may be the better fit. On the other hand, if a complainant seeks reinstatement, there is a strong case for labour arbitration to have primary responsibility. Finally, access to justice and efficiency favour deferring to labour arbitration. As a general rule, the Commission should decline jurisdiction unless labour arbitration is not a realistic alternative.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 In the present case, there was no clear evidence before the human rights adjudicator that the union would not assist or support H. And there are good reasons why the Commission or the adjudicator could have exercised their discretion to defer to the labour arbitration scheme: the dispute was about discrimination arising under the collective agreement, and the remedy sought \u2014 reinstatement \u2014 was squarely within the powers of a labour arbitrator. However, because the human rights adjudicator in this case clearly had jurisdiction, it cannot be said that she was wrong to proceed. In any event, it would not be appropriate, nearly a decade after the events giving rise to the dispute and over six years after the adjudicator\u2019s decision on the merits, to set aside the adjudicator\u2019s decision on jurisdiction. The remedies available on judicial review are discretionary and reflect a public interest in the orderly administration of affairs, including the need for finality and certainty.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Applied: Weber v.

        "summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an employment discrimination dispute involving a  unionized worker should be settled by a labour arbitrator appointed under the  collective agreement, not by a human rights adjudicator. </strong>\r\n   This case involves a  dispute between an employee and her employer. The Supreme Court was asked if  the dispute should be heard by a labour arbitrator or a human rights adjudicator.  Ms. Linda Horrocks was  employed by the Northern Regional Health Authority (NRHA) in Manitoba. As a  unionized worker, the terms and conditions of her employment were set out in a  \u201ccollective agreement\u201d. A collective agreement is a written contract between an  employer and a union.  In 2011, Ms. Horrocks was  suspended for being at work while under the influence of alcohol. She disclosed  to her employer her alcohol addiction, which is a disability. The health  authority asked Ms. Horrocks to formally agree to abstain from alcohol and get  treatment for her addiction. When she refused to sign the agreement, she was  fired. Her union filed a grievance on her behalf and, as a result, she returned  to work on essentially the same terms as the agreement she had refused to sign.  Soon after, the <abbr title=\"Northern Regional Health Authority\">NHRA</abbr> alleged that she had broken the terms of that agreement.  Ms. Horrocks filed a discrimination  complaint with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission. She alleged the <abbr title=\"Northern Regional Health Authority\">NHRA</abbr> failed to sufficiently accommodate her disability. A human rights adjudicator  was appointed to decide the complaint. The health authority opposed the adjudicator\u2019s  jurisdiction. It argued that under the collective agreement, a labour arbitrator  should settle the dispute. The adjudicator disagreed because she said the  dispute was an alleged human rights violation. She went on to rule that the NRHA  had in fact discriminated against Ms. Horrocks.  The <abbr title=\"Northern Regional Health Authority\">NHRA</abbr> appealed to a  reviewing judge who agreed with it. Ms. Horrocks then appealed to the Court of  Appeal. It said disputes concerning the termination of unionized workers do fall  within the exclusive jurisdiction of a labour arbitrator, even when there are  allegations of human rights violations. But in this case, the Court found the  adjudicator had jurisdiction and sent the case back to the reviewing judge to  decide if the adjudicator\u2019s decision on the complaint itself was reasonable.  The health authority appealed  to the Supreme Court. It has ruled that the human rights adjudicator did not  have jurisdiction over Ms. Horrocks\u2019 complaint.  <strong>A labour arbitrator should decide all disputes under a collective  agreement, including human rights disputes, unless another law states  otherwise. </strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority  of the judges, Justice Brown said the human rights adjudicator did not have  jurisdiction over Ms. Horrocks\u2019 complaint. Justice Brown explained that a  labour arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction when labour legislation provides  for settling disputes under a collective agreement,<strong> </strong>unless another law states otherwise. In this case, Ms. Horrocks\u2019  complaint arose under the collective agreement and within the mandate of a labour  arbitrator. Other legislation did not give concurrent jurisdiction to the human  rights adjudicator. As a result, the adjudicator did not have jurisdiction over  Ms. Horrocks\u2019 complaint. "
