        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds Manslaughter Convictions Despite Charter Breaches**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellants and whether the evidence obtained during the investigation should be excluded due to Charter breaches.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe case involves two appellants, Brian John Lambert and James Andrew Beaver, who were convicted of manslaughter and obstruction of justice. The appellants shared a townhouse with the deceased, Sutton Bowers, and reported finding his body after a night away. The police investigation that followed involved several Charter breaches, including the appellants' unlawful detention, arbitrary arrest, and searches without reasonable grounds. The core allegations against the appellants are that they killed Bowers during a fight and then attempted to mislead the police investigation by providing false information and staging the crime scene.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process involved the Crown presenting evidence to prove the voluntariness of the accused's confessions beyond a reasonable doubt and to establish that neither of their confessions should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The trial judge held that the Crown had proved the voluntariness of the accused's confessions and that neither of their confessions should be excluded under s. 24(2). The Court of Appeal dismissed the conviction appeals, finding no reviewable error in the trial judge's assessment of voluntariness and agreeing that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for murder. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed the appeals, with the majority holding that the confessions were voluntary and admissible under the common law confessions rule, and that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for murder.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nThe police must have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest an individual, and the absence of such grounds can render an arrest unlawful and potentially lead to the exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of the arrest.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Jamal J. concludes that the appeals should be dismissed. The majority holds that Beaver's confession was voluntary and thus admissible under the common law confessions rule, and that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest both accused for murder. However, the majority also finds that the homicide detectives made a fresh start from the Charter breaches arising from L's unlawful detention, but not for Beaver. As a result, only Beaver's confession was obtained in a manner that breached the Charter. After balancing the lines of inquiry under s. 24(2) of the Charter, the majority concludes that admitting Beaver's confession into evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules the  confessions made by two men who killed their landlord were admissible as  evidence at their trial. </strong>James Andrew Beaver and Brian John  Lambert rented rooms in a Calgary townhouse from their landlord Sutton Bowers. Mr.  Bowers also lived in the home. On October 9, 2016, Mr. Lambert called 9-1-1 to  say that he and Mr. Beaver had arrived home to find Mr. Bowers dead in a puddle  of blood. Mr. Lambert told the operator they did not know how Mr. Bowers died.  Yet, he admitted the three of them had argued all week, including the night  before, when Mr. Bowers had told him and Mr. Beaver to get out of the house. Shortly after arriving at the scene,  police officers detained Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver under legislation that does  not exist. This breached their rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. The police then  transported the two accused to the police station for questioning. At the station, homicide detectives  realized the first officers had unlawfully detained the two men. The detectives  tried to make a \u201cfresh start\u201d by advising them of their <em>Charter</em> rights. They then arrested the men for murder. When  questioned separately, Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver initially denied knowing how  Mr. Bowers died. Eventually, they both confessed to killing him during a fight,  mopping up his blood and dragging his body to the bottom of the stairs to make  his death look like an accident. The trial judge held a <em>voir dire</em>, which is a trial within a  trial without the jury present, to determine if the confessions were admissible  into evidence. The accused argued their confessions were involuntary and thus  inadmissible. They also claimed the police lacked reasonable and probable  grounds to arrest them for murder. Finally, they said their confessions must be  excluded because the detectives had failed to make a \u201cfresh start\u201d after their  unlawful detentions. The trial judge admitted their  confessions into evidence. As a result, the accused submitted an agreed  statement of facts where they admitted their roles in the killing and asked the  trial judge to convict them of manslaughter. The trial judge agreed and  sentenced each to four years in prison. Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver appealed  unsuccessfully to Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal before turning to the Supreme Court  of Canada. Only Mr. Beaver appealed the voluntariness of his confession. Both  Mr. Lambert and Mr. Beaver claimed their confessions should be excluded. The Supreme Court has dismissed the  appeals.<strong>The confessions are admissible. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Mahmud Jamal agreed with the lower courts that Mr. Beaver\u2019s  confession was voluntary and thus admissible. He also agreed the police had reasonable and  probable grounds to arrest the two men for murder. However, Justice Jamal found  the homicide detectives had made a \u201cfresh start\u201d from the <em>Charter</em> breaches for Mr. Lambert, but not for Mr. Beaver. Mr. Lambert  confessed only after he consulted counsel, after he understood his rights, and  after he appreciated that he had been arrested for murder. Mr. Beaver had not. Thus,  only Mr. Beaver\u2019s confession was obtained in a manner that breached the <em>Charter</em>. Section 24(2) of the <em>Charter </em>says that when a court concludes  evidence was obtained in a manner that breached anyone\u2019s rights or freedoms  guaranteed by the <em>Charter</em>, the  evidence must be excluded if, having regard to all the circumstances, admitting  it would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.Justice Jamal concluded that in this  case admitting Mr. Beaver\u2019s confession into evidence would not bring the  administration of justice into disrepute. He therefore confirmed the men\u2019s  convictions for manslaughter.",

The father initiated proceedings in Ontario seeking an order for the return of the children to Dubai under the CLRA, alleging wrongful retention of the children in Ontario and refusal to return them to Dubai. The mother opposed the application, claiming that the children would suffer serious harm if returned to Dubai due to her precarious residency status and the UAE's family law.\n\nThe trial process began with the father's application for an order under s. 40 of the CLRA for the return of the two children to Dubai. The trial judge declined jurisdiction, finding that the children would not suffer serious harm if returned to Dubai, and ordered their return. The mother appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which was dismissed by a majority of the court. The mother then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ultimately dismissed the appeal, finding that the trial judge had not committed a reviewable error in his assessment of serious harm.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that, in determining whether to exercise jurisdiction over a child abduction case, the court must conduct an individualized assessment of the risk of serious harm to the child, considering both the likelihood and severity of the anticipated harm, and focusing on the particular circumstances of the child.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer held that the trial judge did not commit a reviewable error in declining jurisdiction and ordering the children's return to Dubai. The majority found that the trial judge's decision that the serious harm threshold was not met is entitled to deference, and the custody dispute should be resolved by the courts in the UAE, where the children have their closest connection. The majority also held that the trial judge properly considered the relevant constellation of factors in this case, weighed them in light of the credibility of the witnesses, and based his conclusion on an individualized child-centered analysis.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a court in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> can decide the custody of  two resident children who travelled to Ontario with their Canadian mother. </strong>\r\n   The parents were married in 2012 in Pakistan and then moved to Dubai in  the United Arab Emirates (UAE) where the father works. Both are citizens of  Pakistan but the mother is also a Canadian citizen. Their daughter was born in  2016 and their son in 2019. The mother has always been the primary caregiver  and her residency in Dubai has depended on the father. In June 2020, the mother  travelled to Ontario with the children to visit her family. The father agreed  to the trip but he remained in Dubai. A few weeks later, the mother informed  the father that she would not be returning to Dubai with the children. The father started legal proceedings in Ontario for the children to  return to Dubai. He invoked Ontario\u2019s <em>Children\u2019s  Law Reform Act</em> (CLRA), which can apply in cases of international child  abduction by a parent. The mother responded by saying she would not return to  Dubai. She asked the Ontario court to decide the custody of the children,  instead of a court in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr>. The mother claimed the children would suffer serious harm if they  returned to Dubai and that staying with her in Ontario was in their best  interests. Before the hearing, the father offered to settle their dispute. He  promised to ensure the mother\u2019s independent residency status in Dubai by buying  her a property in her name. He also agreed to allow the children to reside there  primarily with her. Under the <abbr title=\"Children\u2019s Law Reform Act\">CLRA</abbr>, Ontario courts typically do not exercise jurisdiction  on custody issues when children have been wrongfully taken from their home in  another country and end up in the province. However, there are exceptional  circumstances when an Ontario court may act. Under section 23 of the law, a  court can act when children are physically present in Ontario and the court is  convinced they would suffer serious harm if removed from there. In this case, the Ontario court declined jurisdiction. The judge was  not convinced the children would suffer serious harm if they returned to Dubai.  He declared that the mother had wrongfully kept the children in Ontario and that  they should be returned to <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr> with or without her. The judge gave the parties an  opportunity to make further submissions on whether to include the father\u2019s  settlement proposal in his order. The mother made no submissions in this regard  and the settlement offer was not included. The mother appealed the order to  Ontario\u2019s Court of Appeal, where it was dismissed. She then appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>The \u201cserious harm\u201d threshold required  under the <abbr title=\"Children\u2019s Law Reform Act\">CLRA</abbr> was not met. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Nicholas Kasirer explained  that as a general rule in Canadian family law, the best interests of children  are measured from the children\u2019s perspective and are the paramount  consideration for all decisions that concern them. While separating young children from their primary caregiver could  certainly cause them psychological harm, it will not always rise to the level  of \u201cserious harm\u201d required under the <abbr title=\"Children\u2019s Law Reform Act\">CLRA</abbr><em>. </em>Justice Kasirer said the trial  judge in this case made no reviewable error in deciding that this level was not  met. As a result, the custody of the children should be resolved by a court  in the <abbr title=\"United Arab Emirates\">UAE</abbr>.  While the majority judges found  no reason to interfere with the trial judge\u2019s assessment, they said the father  should be bound by his initial settlement offer if the mother decides to return  to Dubai.  In this case, the legal question  focused only on jurisdiction. As Justice Kasirer said, the case was not \u201ca  comprehensive comparison of the child\u2019s life in the two jurisdictions\u201d, nor a \u201cbroad-based  best interests test\u201d as is conducted on the merits of a custody application.

The TSB investigated the crash and obtained a CVR, which is privileged under section 28 of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act. The defendants sought to obtain the CVR, arguing that it was necessary for a fair trial, while the TSB opposed the motion, citing the statutory privilege.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial judge granted the motion, ordering the TSB to produce the CVR, subject to certain conditions to protect its confidentiality. The TSB appealed, arguing that the judge erred in refusing to allow it to make submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties, and that the judge applied the wrong test in weighing the public interest in the proper administration of justice against the privilege attached to the CVR. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, and the TSB subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ultimately dismissed the appeal.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA court or coroner must undertake a discretionary balancing of interests when deciding whether to order the production of a privileged on-board recording in a civil proceeding.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer concludes that the appeal should be dismissed. The majority holds that the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (Board) is not entitled to make submissions in the absence of the public and the other parties pursuant to section 28(6)(b) of the Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act. The majority also finds that the chambers judge did not commit a reviewable error when he ordered the disclosure of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) pursuant to section 28(6)(c) of the Act. The majority concludes that the chambers judge properly identified the two competing interests and weighed them against each other, and that his decision to order disclosure of the CVR was a discretionary one that deserves deference on appeal.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that a cockpit voice recording can be disclosed at an  aviation accident class action trial. </strong>\r\n   In March 2015, an Air  Canada flight from Toronto had an accident upon landing in wind and snow at  Halifax\u2019s Stanfield International Airport. The flight was carrying 133  passengers and 5 crew members. Several people were injured, including 25 who  were taken to local hospitals. Following the accident, some of the passengers  filed a class action lawsuit in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. They claimed that  negligence on the part of the airline, its pilots, the aircraft manufacturer,  the airport and others, caused them harm.  In an exercise  unrelated to the class action, the Transportation and Safety Board of Canada  (the Board) investigated the accident. The Board is a federal government agency  mandated to improve aviation safety. Following its investigation, the Board issued  a report but did not assign blame as that is not its role. The Board is not  part of the class action. \u00a0 As part of its defence,  the aircraft manufacturer filed a motion asking the court to order the release of  the cockpit voice recording. It records the communications of the flight crew  and is part of the so-called \u201cblack box\u201d from the aircraft. The aircraft  manufacturer argued that access to the recording was necessary for a fair trial  and to determine what caused the accident. The only copy of the recording was  with the Board and it opposed its release. So did the airline and its pilots,  who wanted to protect pilot privacy.  The Board claimed the recording  was protected by \u201cstatutory privilege\u201d, meaning a specific rule in a law  protected it from being disclosed. In this case, section 28 of the <em>Canadian Transportation Accident  Investigation and Safety Board Act</em> (the Act) states no one can be required  to produce an on-board recording or give evidence related to it in legal  proceedings unless authorized to do so by a court or coroner. Section 28(6) also  states that a judge or coroner must examine the on-board recording \u201c<em>in camera</em>\u201d, meaning not before members  of the public, and give the Board a reasonable opportunity to make observations  about the recording. The privilege attached to an on\u2011board recording serves  two purposes: to protect pilot privacy and to promote aviation safety.  The motion judge  listened to the recording <em>in camera</em>,  and decided it was reliable, relevant and necessary evidence for resolving the  class action. He said the importance of the recording to the administration of  justice outweighed the importance of the statutory privilege. The judge refused  the Board\u2019s request to present observations or arguments about the recording,  concluding that such arguments were unnecessary for him to understand what was  at stake. The Board appealed the judge\u2019s ruling to Nova Scotia\u2019s Court of  Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and the Board appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.  <strong>The judge made no errors in ordering the  recording\u2019s disclosure, so</strong> <strong>it can be released.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority  of the judges, Justice Nicholas Kasirer said the motion judge made no reviewable  errors in deciding to order the disclosure of the recording. As such, the  decision to release the recording stands.  The majority said the  judge or coroner who is presented with a request for disclosure has the option  of ordering the disclosure or not based on the test set out in the Act. That  test is whether the public interest in the proper administration of justice  outweighs in importance the privilege attached to the on-board recording.  \u201cIn this balancing  exercise, the decision\u2011maker must place two competing public interests on the  scales: on one side, the relevance, probative value and necessity of the  on-board recording to the fair resolution of the dispute and, on the other, the  effects of disclosure on pilot privacy and aviation safety\u201d, Justice Kasirer  wrote.  Having weighed the  relevant factors, the majority found the judge made a fact-driven and  discretionary decision. Since there was no error of law or palatable and  overriding error of fact or proof he abused his discretion, the judge\u2019s decision  should stand. \u00a0 The majority also rejected  the Board\u2019s claims regarding its right to make arguments <em>in camera</em> without the other parties present. They noted that the  judge had the discretion to hear such arguments or not. While <em>in camera</em> necessarily means without the  public, the judge also had the discretion to allow other parties to be present  or not.",

Initially, the officer indicated she was 18 years old, but later revealed her true age in a text message conversation with Dare. Dare, who claimed to be 22 years old, agreed to meet Kathy at a hotel room, where he was arrested and charged with three offences under sections 172.1(1)(a), 172.1(1)(b), and 286.1(2) of the Criminal Code, related to child luring and communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with Dare's conviction by a jury, followed by his application for a stay of proceedings based on entrapment. The application judge dismissed the application, concluding that the police investigation, Project Raphael, was based on a reasonable suspicion that the offenses were occurring within a sufficiently precise space. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision, dismissing Dare's appeal. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, Dare argued that he was entrapped, adopting the submissions made in a companion case, R. v. Ramelson. However, the Supreme Court held that Project Raphael was a bona fide inquiry, and therefore, Dare was not entrapped. The Court relied on its decision in Ramelson, where it was held that the police investigation was not random virtue testing, but rather a targeted effort to address the buyer side of the juvenile sex work market. Ultimately, the Supreme Court dismissed Dare's appeal, upholding his convictions.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA police investigation that targets a specific online space where criminal activity is reasonably suspected to be occurring, and limits its scope to individuals who demonstrate an interest in committing the targeted offence, does not constitute entrapment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis concludes that the appeal should be dismissed, affirming the lower courts' decisions. The majority opinion holds that Temitope Dare was not entrapped by the police's online investigation, Project Raphael, which targeted individuals seeking to purchase sex from minors. The court relies on its reasoning in R. v. Ramelson (2022 SCC 44), where it was established that Project Raphael constituted a bona fide inquiry. This conclusion is based on the finding that the police had reasonable suspicion that offences were occurring within a sufficiently precise space and took steps to limit their investigation to individuals interested in obtaining sexual services from young people. As a result, Dare's application for a stay of proceedings based on entrapment is denied, and his convictions are upheld.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an  online police investigation targeting people searching for sex with children was  not entrapment. </strong>\u201cProject Raphael\u201d was an online investigation conducted by the York Regional  Police in Ontario between 2014 and 2017. It targeted people searching online who  wanted to pay to have sex with girls and boys. It involved police placing fake  advertisements on the escort sub-section of a website called Backpage.com. People  who engaged with these ads were led to text message conversations between a  supposed 18-year-old sex worker, who was actually an undercover police officer.  Once the prospective client and the undercover officer agreed to a sexual  transaction, the officer would then reveal that they were too young for sex  work. Every client who agreed to continue with the transaction and showed up to  the designated hotel room, was arrested. Project Raphael led to the arrest of  104 men, including Temitope Dare.  Mr. Dare was charged with three offences: (1) telecommunicating with a  person he believed was under the age of 18, for the purpose of obtaining sexual  services; (2) telecommunicating with a person he believed was under the age of  16, for the purpose of inviting sexual touching; and (3) communicating to  obtain sexual services for consideration from a person under the age of 18.  A jury convicted Mr. Dare of all three offences but he applied to have the  proceedings against him stopped, alleging that he was the victim of police  entrapment. Mr. Dare argued that officers had offered him the opportunity to  commit a crime. To avoid an operation being considered entrapment, a police  investigation must be a \u201c<em>bona fide</em> inquiry\u201d.

The ad initially indicated that Jamie was 18 years old, but during a text message conversation, the undercover officer revealed that she was actually 15 years old. Erhard Haniffa responded to the ad and was subsequently arrested and charged with three offenses under sections 172.1(1)(a), 172.1(1)(b), and 286.1(2) of the Criminal Code, including telecommunicating with a person believed to be under 18 years old for the purpose of committing an offense, and communicating to obtain sexual services from a minor.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with Haniffa's conviction on three child luring-related offenses. He then applied for a stay of proceedings, arguing entrapment, but the application judge dismissed the application, concluding that the police investigation, Project Raphael, was a bona fide inquiry. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, Haniffa argued that the police lacked reasonable suspicion and that the investigation was not a bona fide inquiry. However, the Supreme Court, relying on its decision in R. v. Ramelson, held that the police had reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space and that the investigation was a bona fide inquiry, as the offenses offered were rationally connected and proportionate to the suspected offenses. The Supreme Court dismissed Haniffa's appeal, affirming the lower courts' decisions and upholding his conviction.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nPolice must have reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space and offer offenses that are rationally connected and proportionate to the suspected offenses in order to establish a bona fide inquiry and avoid entrapment.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis concludes that the appeal should be dismissed, as the appellant, Erhard Haniffa, was not entrapped. The majority opinion relies on the reasoning established in R. v. Ramelson, which held that the police had reasonable suspicion over a sufficiently precise space and that the offenses offered were rationally connected and proportionate to the suspected offenses. The implications of this decision are that the police are entitled to conduct investigations in online spaces where there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and that the offenses offered during such investigations can be rationally connected and proportionate to the suspected offenses, rather than being limited to the exact same offenses.",

The Ontario Superior Court of Justice initially dismissed Mr.  Ramelson\u2019s entrapment application in November 2019. However, after the Supreme  Court of Canada\u2019s May 2020 ruling in <em><a href=\"../2020/38165-38304-eng.aspx\">R. v.  Ahmad</a></em>, the Ontario court invited the parties to make additional  submissions and ultimately revised its decision, finding that police had  entrapped Mr. Ramelson. The <em>Ahmad</em> decision had reviewed what could be considered a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry in virtual spaces. In light of that judgment, the  Ontario Superior Court concluded that Project Raphael was not a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry because the classified  ads website was too broad a space to support a reasonable suspicion. The Crown  appealed that decision to Ontario\u2019s Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal. Mr.  Ramelson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  Members of the Court heard this case together with <em><a href=\"39676-eng.aspx\">R. v. Jaffer</a></em>, <em><a href=\"39803-eng.aspx\">R. v.

Those cases also  involved individuals claiming they were entrapped as a result of Project  Raphael, and their appeals have also been dismissed.  <strong>Mr. Ramelson was not entrapped. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis said Project  Raphael was a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry  because \u201cpolice had reasonable suspicion in a space defined with sufficient  precision\u201d. The space was the particular type of ads within the York Region  escort subdirectory of Backpage.com that emphasized the sex worker\u2019s youth. She  also said that the offences police provided the opportunity to commit \u201cwere  rationally connected and proportionate\u201d to the offences they suspected were  occurring in that space. \u00a0 To determine whether an investigation, conducted on broad virtual  spaces, such as the Internet, is precisely defined, courts must look at the  space\u2019s function, its interactivity and the sub-spaces embedded into the  broader virtual space.  Justice Karakatsanis  said the entrapment doctrine strives to balance competing interests: the rule  of law and the need to protect an individual\u2019s privacy interests and personal  freedom from state overreach, with the state\u2019s interest in investigating and  prosecuting crime. Requiring police investigations to pass the <em>bona fide</em> inquiry test, helps to ensure  that balance. ",

Dow was awarded an accounting of profits as a remedy, and the main issue in the case is the calculation of the profits that Nova must disgorge to Dow. Nova argued that the court should consider the hypothetical profits it could have earned by selling a non-infringing option, such as high-density polyethylenes, and deduct those profits from the profits earned by selling the infringing product.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe case began in the Federal Court, where the reference judge awarded Dow a sum equal to Nova's actual revenue from selling the patented plastics minus its actual full costs associated with producing the patented plastics. The judge also concluded that Dow was entitled to springboard profits, which are profits that arise post-patent-expiry but are causally attributable to infringement of the invention during the period of patent protection. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the entirety of the award to Dow, rejecting Nova's arguments that the reference judge erred in refusing to deduct the market price of ethylene as a cost and that springboard profits were not legally permissible. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed Nova's appeal, holding that an accounting of profits requires that the infringer disgorge all profits causally attributable to infringement of the invention, regardless of when the profits materialize.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nAn accounting of profits for patent infringement requires a court to disgorge all profits causally attributable to the invention, regardless of when the profits materialize.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Rowe holds that when a patentee chooses an accounting of profits as a remedy for patent infringement, the infringer must disgorge all the profits they gained that are causally attributable to the invention. This decision clarifies the calculation of profits in patent infringement cases and emphasizes the importance of considering the causal link between the infringement and the profits earned. The majority's approach ensures that infringers are deterred but not punished for infringement, and that the patent bargain is protected.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court clarifies how an \u201caccounting of profits\u201d should be calculated for  patent infringement. </strong>\r\n   Nova Chemicals  Corporation (Nova) and Dow Chemical Company (Dow) are competitors in the  plastics industry. Dow patented thin but strong plastics used in products such  as garbage bags and food wrappings. When Nova manufactured and sold products  covered by Dow\u2019s patent, Dow sued for patent infringement.  The Federal Court  found that Nova had violated Dow\u2019s patent. As a remedy, Dow asked the court to  calculate its award based on the profits Nova made by violating the patent.  This is called an \u201caccounting of profits\u201d. To determine the money owed to Dow, the  court calculated the revenues Nova had earned by selling the infringing  plastics. It then deducted what Nova had paid to produce the patented plastics. The main chemical  ingredient in theses patented plastics is called ethylene. Nova produces  ethylene for less than what it would cost to buy this product on the market. Yet,  Nova asked the court to use the market cost of ethylene when calculating how  much to deduct from its revenues, instead of its actual cost. The Federal Court  refused. It deducted the actual cost of Nova\u2019s ethylene production when  calculating the amount it had to pay Dow.  In addition to the  profits Nova earned before the patent expired, Dow argued it should also  receive some of the profits Nova made after the patent\u2019s expiry that resulted  from the infringement. \u00a0An advantage of  having a patent is that an inventor has the opportunity to sell their product  on the market before anyone else. A company who violates a competitor\u2019s patent  will take over market shares more quickly after the expiry of a patent. Profits  earned from that advantage are called \u201cspringboard\u201d profits.  The Federal Court  agreed. Nova then appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal to reduce the award. It  argued that, if it had not used its ethylene to make the patented plastics, it  would have sold that ethylene to a third party, so it should be able to keep  what it would have made from selling it. The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed  and upheld the original award. Nova then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.  <strong>The lower courts did not make errors in  calculating the award. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority  of the judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe said the lower courts calculated Nova\u2019s accounting  of profits correctly. He also said Dow is entitled to the springboard profits. The majority judges  rejected new arguments Nova had raised before the Supreme Court. Nova had said  that it could have used its own ethylene to produce a completely different kind  of plastic used to make pails and crates. It argued that it should be able to  keep what it would have made selling those products.The majority ruled  that the court should only deduct profits made from products that are comparable,  but do not infringe the patent. Since pail and crate plastics are nothing like  the patented plastics, they could not be used as a hypothetical non-infringing  option. \u201cThe pail and crate plastics markets and patented plastics markets do  not overlap. A potential buyer interested in the patented plastics would not  purchase pail and crate plastics as an alternative\u201d, Justice Rowe wrote.",

Quebec (Agence du revenu)**\n\nThis appeal concerns the question of whether a general provision in a taxation statute can be applied to supplement specific provisions in computing a taxpayer's taxable income.\n\n**Background**\n\nYves Des Groseillers, an individual, and BMTC Group Inc., a company, are appealing a decision by the Quebec Court of Appeal regarding their tax assessments. The Agence du revenu du Quebec (ARQ) had reassessed their taxable income to include the value of stock options given to registered charities as gifts. The appellants claimed tax credits for these gifts in their tax returns. The ARQ relied on sections 50 and 422(c)(ii) of the Taxation Act (CQLR, c. I-3) to add the value of these gifts to their taxable income.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with the Quebec tax authority reassessing Yves Des Groseillers' tax returns to add the value of stock options he gifted to charities as taxable income. Des Groseillers claimed tax credits for the gifts, but the tax authority argued that the value of the stock options should be included in his taxable income under section 50 of the Taxation Act. The trial judge vacated the reassessments, but the Quebec Court of Appeal restored them, ruling that section 422 of the Taxation Act applies to the stock options. The appellate court held that section 54 of the Taxation Act does not exclude the application of section 422. The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the Court of Appeal's decision, dismissing Des Groseillers' appeal and upholding the tax authority's reassessments.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA general provision in a taxation statute can be applied to supplement specific provisions in computing a taxpayer's taxable income, unless the specific provisions explicitly exclude the application of the general provision or constitute a complete and hermetic code that leaves no room for the application of the general provision.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, the Court affirms the Quebec Court of Appeal's decision, dismissing the appeal. The majority opinion upholds the respondent's reassessment of the appellants' taxable income, concluding that section 422 of the Taxation Act applies to the disposition of stock options by gift. The Court rejects the appellants' argument that Division VI of the Taxation Act constitutes a complete code, excluding the application of section 422. Instead, the Court finds that section 422's broad formulation and the legislature's silence on its non-applicability to employee stock options suggest that it is intended to attribute fair market value to any disposition of property, including gifts of stock options. This interpretation has significant implications for the case, as it allows the respondent to reassess the appellants' taxable income based on the fair market value of the stock options at the time of the gift.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an arbitration agreement does not trump a lawsuit.</strong>\r\n   Peace River Hydro  Partners is a partnership of several businesses formed to build a hydroelectric  dam in northeastern British Columbia. In 2015, Peace River subcontracted some  work to Petrowest Corporation, an Alberta-based construction company and its  affiliates. The contracts for this work contained agreements that the two  parties would settle any disputes through arbitration. Not long after,  Petrowest found itself in financial difficulty and could not repay its debts.  Under the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em>,  an Alberta court appointed the company Ernst &amp; Young as \u201creceiver\u201d for  Petrowest. That meant Ernst &amp; Young were responsible for taking control of  the company with the purpose of helping Petrowest repay its creditors.  The receiver started a  lawsuit against the Peace River partnership in British Columbia, seeking to  collect on money it said was owed to Petrowest and its affiliates for  subcontracted work. Peace River responded by asking the court to stop the  lawsuit. It argued that the dispute should be settled by arbitration, as  outlined in its contract with Petrowest. Section 15(1) of British Columbia\u2019s <em>Arbitration Act</em> states that if one party  to an arbitration agreement starts legal action, the other party can ask the  court to stop the lawsuit. Section 15(2) states that a court must stop the  legal proceedings unless it determines that the arbitration agreement is void,  inoperative or incapable of being performed.  The receiver opposed  Peace River\u2019s attempt to stop the lawsuit. Ernst &amp; Young argued that the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</em> permits  the court to exercise central judicial control over the dispute instead of  sending the receiver to multiple arbitration forums. The judge agreed with the  receiver and allowed the lawsuit to proceed. Peace River appealed that decision  to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. When it dismissed the appeal, Peace  River appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. The lawsuit against Peace River can proceed to trial.  <strong>The arbitration agreements are inoperative. </strong>\r\n     The Supreme Court  unanimously dismissed the appeal. Explaining why the majority of judges dismissed  the appeal, Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 said the arbitration agreements were inoperative.  She said section 15 of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> does not mean a court  must always stop a lawsuit by a court-appointed receiver when there has been an  agreement to arbitrate. Rather, a court may allow the lawsuit to proceed if the  party trying to avoid arbitration proves the arbitration agreement is \u201cvoid, inoperative  or incapable of being performed\u201d within the meaning of section 15(2). An  arbitration agreement can be considered inoperative \u201cif enforcing it would  compromise the orderly and efficient resolution of the receivership\u201d. This analysis  is highly fact-specific.  In this case, there  were multiple and overlapping arbitration agreements. This would have involved  the receiver participating in and funding at least four different arbitrations  with seven different sets of parties. Paying for these processes would have come  from the assets of Petrowest and its affiliates. This would only hurt the creditors  and run contrary to the objectives of the <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em>. The majority found that settling the matter with one  lawsuit would be faster and cheaper, which was in the interest of the  receivership. ",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court rules that banning conditional sentences for certain offences is constitutional. </strong>\r\n   In 2015, Cheyenne  Sharma, arrived in Toronto on an international flight with almost two kilograms  of cocaine in her suitcase. The 20-year-old woman with no criminal record  confessed to the RCMP that her partner had promised her $20,000 to bring the  suitcase to Canada. She plead guilty to importing cocaine. Since Ms. Sharma is a  woman of Ojibwa ancestry and member of the Saugeen First Nation, the court requested  a <em>Gladue</em> report, which is a pre-sentencing  report for Indigenous offenders. This report noted that Ms. Sharma\u2019s  grandmother was a residential school survivor and that her mother had spent  time in foster care. The report also noted that Ms. Sharma had been sexually  assaulted and had dropped out of school.  The <em>Gladue </em>report gets its  name from the Supreme Court of  Canada\u2019s 1999 ruling in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1695/index.do\">R.  v. Gladue</a></em>, which established the factors that courts must take  into account when sentencing Indigenous offenders.  Conditional sentencing  was introduced in 1996. This type of punishment allows offenders to serve their  sentences under strict surveillance in their communities, rather than in jail.  In 2012, Parliament changed the law to eliminate conditional sentences for  certain offences listed in paragraphs 742.1(b) to (f) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  Three requirements  must be met before a conditional sentence can be imposed: (1) the offender must  not have been convicted of any of those offences; (2) a court would have otherwise  imposed a prison sentence of less than two years; and (3) the safety of the  community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the  community. If an offender meets these requirements, a judge must then determine  whether a conditional sentence is appropriate and in line with the fundamental  principles of sentencing. This includes section 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which directs  judges to consider alternatives to imprisonment \u201cwith particular attention to  the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders\u201d. This provision was enacted to reduce  the overrepresentation of Indigenous offenders in jail, among other reasons.  When Ms. Sharma sought  a conditional sentence, she was found ineligible because she had plead guilty  to an offence covered by section 742.1(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and which carried a maximum prison sentence of 14  years or life. Ms. Sharma challenged the constitutionality of that section,  along with section 742.1(e)(ii), which makes conditional sentences unavailable  for any offence that carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and involves  drugs.  The sentencing judge confirmed  that Ms. Sharma was not eligible for a conditional sentence. He also dismissed  her challenges under sections 7 and 15 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </em>Section 7 guarantees  everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person, while section  15 guarantees everyone the right to equal treatment before the law. The sentencing  judge imposed an 18-month prison sentence.  Ms. Sharma appealed her  sentence and the dismissal of her <em>Charter </em>challenges to the Ontario Court of Appeal. It allowed her appeal and ruled  that sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) had violated section 7 because they  were too broad, and had violated section 15 because they discriminated against  Indigenous offenders like Ms. Sharma. The Court of Appeal sentenced Ms. Sharma  to time already served in jail. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal.  <strong>Sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> are constitutional. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority  of the judges, Justices Russell Brown and Malcolm Rowe found sections 742.1(c)  and 742.1(e)(ii) constitutional. They said there is no section 15 <em>Charter </em>violation. The majority noted  that although the crisis of Indigenous incarceration is undeniable,  Ms.\u00a0Sharma did not demonstrate that the challenged provisions created or  contributed to a disproportionate impact on Indigenous offenders, compared to  non\u2011Indigenous offenders. Ms. Sharma was required to show this disproportionate  effect as a first step in the section 15 analysis, which she did not.  The majority also said  there is no section 7 <em>Charter </em>violation  because the provisions achieve their intended purpose, which is \u201cto enhance  consistency in the conditional sentencing regime by making imprisonment the  typical punishment for certain serious offences and categories of offences\u201d. They  added that maximum sentences provide a reasonable indication of the seriousness  of an offence, and as such, the provisions do not deprive individuals of their  liberty in circumstances that are unconnected to their objective.  Ms. Sharma\u2019s 18-month prison  sentence was restored. However, since she has already served her time in  prison, no further orders were made. ",

The accused was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault and sentenced to six months' imprisonment and three years' probation. Due to his convictions, the accused was subject to mandatory lifetime registration in Canada's national sex offender registry pursuant to ss. 490.012(1) and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code. The accused challenged the mandatory registration provisions as being unconstitutional under ss. 7 and 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial judge, Moen J., initially found that ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) breached s. 7 of the Charter as they were overbroad and grossly disproportionate. However, a majority at the Court of Appeal of Alberta allowed the Crown's appeal, concluding that neither provision violated s. 7 of the Charter. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately allowed the appeal, holding that ss. 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code infringe s. 7 of the Charter and cannot be saved by s. 1.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA law is overbroad and violates the right to liberty under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if it captures some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose, making it arbitrary in part, and if its effects on life, liberty, or security of the person are grossly disproportionate to its purposes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. hold that sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the Criminal Code infringe section 7 of the Charter, as they are overbroad and capture individuals who do not pose an increased risk of reoffending. The majority argues that the provisions' purpose is to capture information about offenders that may assist police in preventing and investigating sex offences, but they go further than necessary to achieve this goal. The majority also finds that the provisions are not justified under section 1 of the Charter, as they are not minimally impairing of an offender's rights and the deleterious effects outweigh their salutary effects. As a result, the majority declares the provisions of no force or effect, with a one-year suspension for section 490.012 and an immediate declaration for section 490.013(2.1).",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court finds the mandatory  and lifetime registration on the sex offender registry unconstitutional. </strong>\r\n   This ruling has important implications for the registration of sex  offenders.  The <em>Sex Offender Information Registration  Act (SOIRA)</em> came into force in 2004. It created a national sex offender  registry. To place an offender on the registry, a Crown prosecutor had to apply  for a \u201c<em>SOIRA</em> order\u201d. The judge would  then decide to grant the order or exclude the offender from the registry.  Judges had discretion to determine if the effect of the order on the offender\u2019s  privacy or liberty would exceed the public interest in protecting society.  In 2011, Parliament changed the law. It removed the discretion of the  Crown and the sentencing judge to exclude an offender from the registry. Since  then, section 490.012 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> has required the mandatory registration of anyone found guilty of a sexual  offence. This means the personal information of every sex offender must be  added to Canada\u2019s national registry. Section 490.013(2.1) also imposed a  mandatory registration for life, for those who committed more than one such  offence.  In 2015, Eugene Ndhlovu pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault  against two people at a party four years earlier when he was 19-years-old. The  trial judge sentenced him to six months in jail, to be followed by three years  of probation. After reviewing Mr. Ndhlovu\u2019s history and the evidence, the judge  found he was unlikely to re-offend. However, due to the legislative changes in 2011,  Mr. Ndhlovu was automatically subject to a lifetime registration on the national  sex offender registry. After his sentencing, Mr. Ndhlovu challenged the constitutionality of sections  490.012 and 490.013(2.1) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. The judge concluded that those provisions violated section 7 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (the <em>Charter</em>), which guarantees  everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the person.  The Crown then asked the court to decide if the provisions could be acceptable  under section 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. That  section permits courts to find otherwise unconstitutional laws justifiable in a  free and democratic society. The judge concluded that sections 490.012 and  490.013(2.1) could not be saved by section 1. She then declared the provisions  to be without force or effect and did not order Mr. Ndhlovu to register himself.  The Crown appealed that decision to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. It found  the provisions were constitutional. Mr. Ndhlovu then appealed to the Supreme  Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court allows the appeal.  <strong>Sections 490.012 and 490.013(2.1)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> are  unconstitutional. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges, Justices Andromache Karakatsanis  and Sheilah L. Martin said the two provisions of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violate section 7 of the <em>Charter</em> in a way that cannot be justified in a free and democratic  society. These provisions infringe  on the right to liberty protected under section 7 of the <em>Charter,</em> \u201cbecause registration has a serious impact on the freedom  of movement and of fundamental choices of people who are not at an  increased risk of re\u2011offending\u201d. Registering offenders who are not at risk of  committing a future sex offence is disconnected from the purpose of  registration, which is to capture information about offenders to help police  prevent and investigate sex offences.  As such, the majority has declared the provisions unconstitutional. They  said the declaration of invalidity for section 490.012 will take effect in one  year. The finding for section 490.013(2.1) takes effect immediately and is  considered invalid from the time it was enacted in 2011.  As for Mr. Ndhlovu, the judges granted him an exemption to section 490.012  pending its declaration of invalidity. This means he does not have to register  in the sex offender registry. ",

The assaults occurred over a period of five years, starting when E.N. was 13 years old, and on one occasion when S.R. was 15 years old. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought a global sentence of four to six years, while Nahanee sought a global sentence of three to three and a half years. However, the sentencing judge imposed an eight-year sentence, relying on aggravating factors such as the abuse of family members, young victims, and significant impact on the victims. The sentence was subject to sections 718.1-718.3(1) of Canada's Criminal Code, concerning general principles applicable in determining sentences, including objectives such as denunciation and deterrence.\n\nThe trial judge imposed the eight-year sentence, which Nahanee appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal (BCCA), arguing that the judge erred in failing to alert counsel that she planned to impose a harsher sentence than recommended by the Crown and did not provide adequate reasons for doing so. The BCCA dismissed his appeal. Nahanee then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ultimately held that the sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to notify parties and provide an opportunity for further submissions.\n\nA sentencing judge is required to notify parties and provide an opportunity for further submissions if they intend to impose a sentence in excess of the range proposed by the Crown, and failure to do so may result in appellate intervention if the error had an impact on the sentence or if the judge relied on flawed or unsupportable reasoning.\n\nWriting for the majority, Moldaver J. held that the public interest test adopted in R. v. Anthony-Cook, which instructs judges not to depart from a joint sentencing submission unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest, must remain confined to joint submissions and does not apply to contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea. However, if the sentencing judge presiding over a contested sentencing hearing is of a mind to impose a harsher sentence than what the Crown has proposed, they should notify the parties and give them an opportunity to make further submissions, failing which they run the risk of having the harsher sentence overturned on appeal.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds the  eight-year prison sentence for a B.C. man who sexually assaulted two girls. </strong>\r\n   In 2019, Kerry Nahanee plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault  against his nieces. Mr. Nahanee admitted to sexually assaulting one niece once and  sexually assaulting the other niece many times. At the sentencing hearing, the  Crown asked the judge to sentence Mr. Nahanee to between four to six years in  prison. The lawyer for Mr. Nahanee asked the judge for a sentence of three to  three-and-a-half years.  The judge sentenced Mr. Nahanee to five years for the assaults on the  first niece and three years for the assault on the second niece for a combined  total of eight years in prison. The judge considered various aggravating and  mitigating factors in calculating Mr. Nahanee\u2019s sentence. Aggravating factors  increase the severity of a sentence, while mitigating factors contribute to a  more lenient sentence.\u00a0  In the judge\u2019s view, the aggravating factors in this case included: abuse of a family member; abuse of a  person under the age of 18; abuse of a position of trust; and that the offences  significantly impacted the two victims. As for mitigating factors, Mr. Nahanee  had plead guilty, he was relatively young, and he had no criminal record.  The judge also  considered Mr. Nahanee\u2019s Indigenous background during sentencing. Section  718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> directs  courts to pay special attention to the circumstances of Indigenous offenders. As  such, the judge reviewed the <em>Gladue </em>report, which is a pre-sentencing  report done for Indigenous offenders.The <em>Gladue </em>report gets its name from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s 1999 ruling in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1695/index.do\">R. v.  Gladue</a></em>, which established the factors that courts must take into  account when sentencing Indigenous offenders.\u00a0  Mr. Nahanee appealed  his sentence to British Columbia\u2019s Court of Appeal. He argued that the \u201cpublic  interest test\u201d established by the Supreme Court of Canada in its 2016 ruling in<em> <a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16201/index.do\">R.  v. Anthony-Cook</a></em> should apply to his case. That test guides  judges when the Crown prosecutor and defence lawyer agree to a specific  sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. According to the test, judges should  impose the agreed-upon sentence unless it would bring the administration of  justice into disrepute, which is never in the public interest. Mr. Nahanee also  argued the sentencing judge should have advised the parties that she intended  to impose a harsher sentence than the Crown was seeking. The Court of Appeal  dismissed Mr. Nahanee\u2019s appeal. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has  dismissed Mr. Nahanee\u2019s appeal.  <strong>The <em>Anthony-Cook</em> case does not apply. </strong>\r\n     Writing for the  majority, Justice Michael Moldaver said that the public interest test in the <em>Anthony-Cook</em> case, \u201cdoes not, and should not, apply  to contested sentencing hearings following a guilty plea\u201d. The <em>Anthony-Cook</em> case applies only when both  parties propose a joint submission on sentencing, meaning they agree on the  sentence. Mr. Nahanee\u2019s case involved a contested sentencing hearing because  the Crown and defence lawyer had proposed different sentences.  The majority said  judges must notify the parties if they intend to impose a harsher sentence than  the one sought by the Crown. The judge must then give the parties the  opportunity to make further submissions.      In this case, the  judge did not notify the parties that she intended to impose a harsher sentence  and did not provide them an opportunity to make further submissions. However,  the majority said Mr. Nahanee did not show he had information to provide the  judge that would have impacted his sentence. Also, the judge provided adequate  reasons for why she exceeded the sentence the Crown was seeking and her  reasons, when read as a whole, were not wrong. Finally, the eight-year sentence  was not demonstrably unfit.\u00a0 ",

However, Halifax Regional Municipality adopted a planning strategy and zoning by-laws that reserved a portion of the land for a public park and zoned the land as Urban Settlement and Urban Reserve. Annapolis alleged that Halifax's regulatory measures deprived it of all reasonable or economic uses of the land, resulting in a constructive taking without compensation.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began with Halifax's motion for partial summary judgment to dismiss Annapolis' constructive taking claim. The motion judge dismissed the motion, finding that Annapolis' claim raised genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal overturned this decision, but the Supreme Court allowed Annapolis' appeal, holding that the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation of the constructive taking test established in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a  private Halifax land developer can take the regional municipality to court for  its plan to expropriate its land.</strong>\r\n   The Annapolis Group started buying lands in the Halifax area in the  1950s. Over time, it acquired 965 acres of land, which the company planned to  develop and sell. In 2006, Halifax adopted a 25-year Regional Municipality Planning  Strategy for land development. It included the Annapolis lands. The planning strategy indicates some of those lands would be zoned for  a public park with the rest designated for \u201cserviced development\u201d, such as  residential neighbourhoods. For serviced development to occur, Halifax must  adopt a resolution authorizing a \u201csecondary planning process\u201d and make an  amendment to the land use by-law. Annapolis made several attempts to develop the lands, starting in 2007,  with no success. In 2016, Halifax ultimately adopted a resolution refusing to  initiate the secondary planning process. Annapolis responded by filing a lawsuit against Halifax in the Supreme  Court of Nova Scotia. It claimed, among other things, that Halifax had  essentially expropriated private property for a public park, which amounted to  a \u201cconstructive taking\u201d. In 2019, Halifax asked the court for summary judgment  to dismiss the constructive taking claim from the lawsuit. Summary judgment is  a procedure that allows a party in a lawsuit to ask the court to decide an  issue without a full trial. In response, Annapolis argued that its claim of constructive taking  raised issues that required a trial. The judge agreed but Halifax appealed that  decision to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal. Based on the Supreme Court of  Canada\u2019s 2006 ruling in <em>Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City)</em>, the Court  of Appeal concluded that Annapolis had no reasonable chance of success.  Annapolis then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.<em><u> </u></em>\r\n   The Supreme Court has allowed Annapolis\u2019s claim of constructive taking  to proceed to trial.  <strong>The claim raises disputed issues  of fact that need to be decided at trial. </strong>\r\n   Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justices Suzanne  C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Russell Brown found that Annapolis\u2019 claim of constructive taking  raises disputed issues of fact that must be decided at trial, based on the  constructive taking test set out in the <em>Canadian  Pacific Railway Co.</em> case.  There are two parts to the test for establishing a constructive taking.  First, the test must show the government has acquired a beneficial interest in  the property or flowing from the property. A beneficial interest is an  advantage, such as when private property is enjoyed as a public resource. Second,  the test requires showing the proposed regulatory measures would remove all  reasonable uses of the private property.  The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal had  interpreted the first part of the test as requiring Annapolis to show that  Halifax had actually taken possession of the lands. However, Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and  Brown wrote, \u201cwhat must be shown by the property owner can fall short of an  actual acquisition by the state.\u201d The majority said the Court of Appeal was also  wrong in holding that Halifax\u2019s intention is irrelevant to applying the second  part of the test. The majority of the Supreme Court  noted, \u201cAnnapolis is entitled to adduce evidence at trial to show that, by  holding Annapolis\u2019 land out as a public park, Halifax has acquired a beneficial  interest therein; and that, because Halifax is unlikely to ever lift zoning  restrictions constraining the development of Annapolis\u2019 land, Annapolis has  lost all reasonable uses of its property\u201d. Annapolis may also adduce evidence  of Halifax\u2019s intention in not doing so, the majority said.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores an Alberta man\u2019s murder  conviction after finding his statements to police were admissible as evidence  at trial. </strong>\r\n   In 2007, police in Alberta questioned Russell Tessier in connection with  the murder of his friend, whose body had been found in a ditch by a rural road  near the town of Carstairs. Officers interviewed Mr. Tessier twice at the  police station without placing him under arrest. They did not advise him that he  could choose not to speak to police and that what he said could be used as  evidence in court (this is known as a caution). In 2015, police charged Mr.  Tessier with first degree murder after his DNA was matched to a cigarette butt  found near the crime scene.  At trial, the Crown tried to introduce evidence from the 2007 police  interview with Mr. Tessier. Under the confessions rule, statements with police are  generally considered voluntary \u2013 and therefore admissible as evidence \u2013 if the  person had a functioning mind at the time and made the statements without being  threatened or tricked by police.  Mr. Tessier claimed his statements were involuntary. He alleged that he  had been psychologically detained by police, which triggered rights that apply  to people who are detained or arrested. For instance, section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> provides  that \u201ceveryone has the right on arrest or detention to retain and instruct  counsel without delay and to be informed of that right\u201d.  The trial judge determined that Mr. Tessier had a functioning mind and  made the statements without being threatened or tricked by police. The judge  also determined that Mr.\u00a0Tessier had not been detained when he spoke with  police. As a result, the statements were voluntary and admissible as evidence  at trial. The jury eventually convicted Mr.\u00a0Tessier of first degree  murder. Mr.\u00a0Tessier appealed his conviction to Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal,  arguing that his statements to police should not have been admitted at trial.  The Court of Appeal found errors in the trial judge\u2019s analysis about whether  the statements were voluntary and it ordered a new trial. The Crown then  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and restored Mr.\u00a0Tessier\u2019s  conviction for first degree murder. \u00a0 <strong>The statements were voluntary. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Nicholas Kasirer found that  despite the absence of a caution, Mr.\u00a0Tessier\u2019s 2007 statements to police  were voluntary under the confessions rule and therefore admissible as evidence  at trial. The majority wrote that Mr.\u00a0Tessier had an operating mind at the  time of his interviews, had exercised \u201ca free or meaningful choice\u201d to speak  with police and \u201cwas not unfairly denied his right to silence\u201d. Given that  there was a reasonable basis to consider Mr.\u00a0Tessier a suspect at the time  of questioning, the absence of a caution could mean his statements were involuntary.  However, the Crown discharged its burden by proving that the absence of a  caution was without consequence and that the statements were, beyond a  reasonable doubt and in view of the context as a whole, voluntary. The majority  also rejected Mr.\u00a0Tessier\u2019s arguments that he had been psychologically detained,  which means the <em>Charter</em> rights that  apply to people detained or under arrest were not applicable.

The accused, William Victor Schneider, was charged with second-degree murder under Section 235(1) and interfering with a dead body under Section 182(b) of Canada's Criminal Code. The core allegations involve statements by Warren Schneider Jr., the accused's brother, who overheard an approximate 13-minute phone call between William Victor Schneider and his wife.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial judge admitted Warren Schneider Jr.'s testimony as evidence, and the jury convicted William Victor Schneider of second-degree murder. On appeal, the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial. However, on further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Wagner C.J. and Moldaver J., writing for the majority upheld this decision to admit this hearsay testimony as evidence due to its relevancy to an issue at trial & potential probative value outweighing prejudicial effects.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA trial judge can consider all relevant context when determining relevance & admissibility including party admissions exceptions where probative value outweighs prejudicial effect.\n\nWriting for this panel upholding lower court decisions allowing such admission based upon foundational principles governing general procedures applicable across trials involving criminal offenses - including those specifically addressing issues surrounding 'party admissions', it was deemed appropriate that there existed sufficient context allowing jurors \"to give meaning\" towards words overheard during said conversation without resorting into speculative interpretations which could otherwise undermine fairness throughout proceedings leading up until final verdicts being reached via jury deliberations following presentation before them throughout respective trials themselves accordingly here today now having been fully reviewed upon appeal brought forth initially before lower courts prior thereto now finally resolved once again affirmatively here today via Supreme Court Justices' collective decision-making authority vested within them under our nation's constitutional framework governing administration & application thereof across entire country nationwide accordingly once more now hereby reaffirmed again today through their collective judgment rendered upon review & careful consideration given thereto by each individual justice sitting upon bench hearing arguments presented before them from both sides involved parties concerned respectively throughout duration thereof up until present moment",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores a British  Columbia man\u2019s murder conviction after confirming the admissibility of an  overheard conversation as evidence at his trial. </strong>\r\n  In September 2016, the body of  Japanese student Natsumi Kogawa was found in a suitcase in Vancouver\u2019s West End.  Police later arrested and charged William Schneider with second degree murder  following a tip from his brother.  A jury trial was held and Mr. Schneider\u2019s  brother testified for the Crown. The brother said he confronted Mr. Schneider after  seeing a photo of him with the missing woman in a news release. He said Mr.  Schneider allegedly admitted that he had been in a relationship with Ms.  Kogawa. The next day, the brother said, Mr. Schneider had attempted suicide in  his presence and told him where to find the woman\u2019s body. The brother testified  that he then overheard Mr. Schneider call his wife on the phone and ask if she  had heard about the missing woman. According to the brother, Mr. Schneider then  told his wife something along the lines of \u201cI did it\u201d or \u201cI killed her\u201d. In his  testimony, the brother said he did not remember \u201cword-for-word\u201d what Mr.  Schneider said, but that he was taking responsibility for the woman\u2019s death.  The judge held a <em>voir dire</em>, which is a trial within a  trial without the jury present, to determine if the brother\u2019s testimony about  what he overheard was admissible as evidence in court. Witness testimony about a  conversation they were not part of is called hearsay evidence. Typically, it is  not admissible as evidence. However, there are certain exceptions.  The judge decided to admit the  evidence about the overheard conversation. She said the words the brother heard  were relevant to an issue at trial. Secondly, the judge determined that the  value of the evidence in proving a point at trial (probative value) outweighed  its potential to be unfair to the accused (prejudicial effect). The jury  convicted Mr. Schneider of second degree murder.  Mr. Schneider appealed his conviction  to British Columbia\u2019s Court of Appeal. He argued the trial judge made a mistake  by admitting his brother\u2019s testimony about the overheard conversation. Two of  the three judges of the Court of Appeal agreed with Mr. Schneider and ordered a  new trial. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has allowed the  Crown\u2019s appeal and restored Mr. Schneider\u2019s conviction for second degree  murder.  <strong>The trial judge did not make an error in deciding to admit the brother\u2019s  testimony. </strong>Writing  for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Malcolm Rowe said  \u201cthe trial judge did not err in admitting the brother\u2019s testimony as to what he  overheard the accused say\u201d. Three questions needed to be answered to come to  this conclusion.\u00a0\r\n     Was what  the brother overheard relevant? Was an exception to the hearsay rule  applicable? Did the trial judge exercise her discretion correctly in deciding  that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect? The  majority said the answer to all three questions is, \u201cyes\u2019. What the brother  overheard was indeed relevant. Also, the \u201cparty admission\u201d exception is  applicable in this case because it allows witness testimony about a confession  even if the witness was not a party to that conversation. Finally, the trial  judge used her discretion correctly and further minimized the potential harmful  effects of the evidence with a strong caution to the jury about what they could  make of it. ",

        "llama_summary": "Here is the combined summary:\n\n**The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside acquittal in sexual assault case involving condom use**\n\nThis appeal raises the question of whether a complainant's consent to sexual intercourse can be conditional on the use of a condom, and whether the failure to wear a condom constitutes sexual assault.\n\n**Background**\nThe complainant, a 22-year-old woman, met Ross McKenzie Kirkpatrick online and agreed to have sex only if he wore a condom. During their second episode of intercourse, Kirkpatrick did not wear a condom without her knowledge or consent. The complainant testified that she had communicated her condition to Kirkpatrick and would not have consented otherwise. Kirkpatrick was charged with sexual assault under section 273.1(1) of the Criminal Code.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nKirkpatrick's no-evidence motion was granted by the trial judge, dismissing the charge due to lack of evidence of fraud or deception. The Crown appealed, and the Court of Appeal unanimously allowed it, setting aside the acquittal. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed Kirkpatrick's appeal and upheld the order for a new trial.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nWhen a complainant's consent to sexual activity is conditional on specific circumstances or conditions being met, failure to meet those conditions results in no voluntary agreement to engage in that activity.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Martin concludes that when a complainant's consent to sexual intercourse is conditioned on specific circumstances or conditions being met (in this case wearing condoms), failing those conditions results in no voluntary agreement under s 2731(1) Criminal Code rather than analyzing it as fraud provision s2653c",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that when  someone is required by their partner to wear a condom during sex but they do  not, they could be guilty of sexual assault.</strong>\r\n  In March  2017, Ross Kirkpatrick and a woman met online and then in person in British  Columbia. The woman agreed to have sex with Mr. Kirkpatrick, but only if he  wore a condom. They had sexual intercourse twice one night. Mr. Kirkpatrick  wore a condom the first time. The second time, Mr. Kirkpatrick did not wear a  condom, which she only realized after intercourse ended. Based on these events,  Mr. Kirkpatrick was charged with sexual assault. Section 273.1(1) of the <em>Criminal  Code </em>defines consent as a person\u2019s voluntary agreement to \u201cengage in the  sexual activity in question\u201d. At trial, the complainant testified that she had  not consented to the sexual activity in question \u2014 in this case, intercourse  without a condom. When the Crown finished presenting its case, Mr. Kirkpatrick  asked the judge to dismiss the charge against him due to lack of evidence. He  claimed the Crown did not prove the absence of consent, because the complainant  consented to the sexual intercourse, regardless of condom use.  Specifically, Mr. Kirkpatrick said the judge should apply the Supreme  Court\u2019s 2014 ruling in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/13511/index.do\">R.  v. Hutchinson</a></em>, which established a test for analyzing consent.  That case also involved a complainant who said she consented to having sex but only  if the accused wore a condom. The accused pierced holes in the condom without  the complainant knowing. The Supreme Court decided that the complainant consented  to the \u201csexual activity in question\u201d in that case because she agreed to sexual intercourse.  However, the Supreme Court found that the accused obtained the complainant\u2019s consent  by fraud, contrary to section 265(3)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, since the accused had tampered with the condom. In  the present case, Mr. Kirkpatrick said the complainant agreed to have sexual  intercourse, like in <em>Hutchinson</em>, but  he said there was no evidence of fraud, unlike in <em>Hutchinson</em>. \u00a0 The judge dismissed the sexual assault charge against Mr. Kirkpatrick due  to lack of evidence. The judge applied <em>Hutchinson</em> and found that because the complainant agreed to have sex with Mr. Kirkpatrick,  she consented to \u201cthe sexual activity in question\u201d under section 273.1(1),  although no condom was worn. And, the judge also determined that there was no  evidence that Mr. Kirkpatrick\u2019s failure to wear a condom was fraud under  section 265(3)(c). The  Crown then appealed to British Columbia\u2019s Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal  ordered a new trial, finding that the first judge should not have dismissed the  sexual assault charge based on a lack of evidence. Mr. Kirkpatrick then appealed  to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed Mr. Kirkpatrick\u2019s appeal and has confirmed  a new trial is needed.  <strong>When condom use is a condition  for sexual intercourse, it becomes part of the sexual activity to which the  person consented. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Sheilah L. Martin said that when condom use is a condition for sexual  intercourse, \u201cthere is no agreement to the physical act of intercourse without  a condom\u201d. The condom is part of the \u201csexual activity in question\u201d to which a  person consented under section 273.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. \u201cSince only yes means yes and no means no, it cannot  be that \u2018no, not without a condom\u2019 means \u2018yes, without a condom\u2019\u201d, Justice  Martin wrote. There is therefore no need to decide whether  the failure to wear a condom in this particular case was fraud. And <em>Hutchinson</em> does not apply to the present  case, but it still applies in cases involving condom sabotage and fraud.  <strong>There  was evidence of the complainant\u2019s lack of consent to sex without a condom. </strong>\r\n     The  complainant provided evidence that she would not have had sex with Mr.  Kirkpatrick without a condom. Accordingly, there was some evidence the  complainant did not consent to the sexual activity in question. The trial judge  made an error in concluding there was no evidence and in dismissing the sexual assault  charge. A new trial is therefore required. ",

The core allegations are that the police breached his Charter rights during two interactions with him on March 19 and April 7, 2015.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms an Alberta  man\u2019s murder confession should not be used at trial because he did not have  enough opportunity to get legal advice.</strong>\r\n   In 2015, police suspected Nigel Lafrance of having been involved in a  murder, and got a search warrant for his home in Fort McMurray, Alberta. On the  morning of March 19, a team of armed police officers entered his home to search  it. They asked Mr. Lafrance if he was willing to answer some questions and,  when he agreed, they drove him to a police station and interviewed him for over  three hours. Police took a blood sample, fingerprints, and Mr. Lafrance\u2019s cell  phones and some clothing. He was not told he could contact a lawyer. On April 7, the police arrested Mr. Lafrance for the murder. This time  the police told him he could contact a lawyer, and Mr. Lafrance had a short  phone call with Legal Aid, who told him he should \u201cget a lawyer\u201d to talk about  his situation. The police then interviewed Mr. Lafrance for several hours. Mr.  Lafrance asked if he could call his father, to help him get a lawyer. The  police refused his request, since he had already called Legal Aid, and the  police pushed for more answers. Mr. Lafrance eventually confessed to the murder. Before the trial, Mr. Lafrance argued that his confession and some  other evidence taken during the date of his first encounter with police should  not be used at his trial. He said he should have been allowed to talk to a  lawyer on March 19 and he should have been given a second chance at contacting  a lawyer during the April 7 interview. Section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> guarantees that \u201ceveryone has the right on arrest or detention to retain and  instruct counsel without delay and be informed of that right\u201d. The trial judge refused Mr. Lafrance\u2019s request, and the evidence was  used at his trial. The judge found that because the police had not actually  \u201cdetained\u201d Mr. Lafrance during the March 19 interview, they did not need to let  him contact a lawyer on that day. Also, the police was not required to give him  a second chance at talking to a lawyer during the April 7 interview. A jury  convicted Mr. Lafrance of murder. Mr. Lafrance appealed the conviction to Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal. A  majority of judges in that court sided with Mr. Lafrance. They ordered a new  trial to be held without the confession and without some of the other evidence  the police had obtained. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has agreed with the Court of Appeal: Mr. Lafrance is  entitled to a new trial. <strong>Mr. Lafrance\u2019s section 10(b) <em>Charter</em> right to counsel was violated.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Russell Brown found that the police violated Mr. Lafrance\u2019s right to counsel on  both dates. Given the \u201cpower imbalance\u201d between police and a person detained by  police, and because legal advice helps \u201ccure\u201d that imbalance, \u201cthese were  serious breaches\u201d, he wrote. Whether police actually \u201cdetained\u201d someone depends on three questions.  First, how did the person perceive or understand the encounter with the police  \u2014 did the person feel forced to comply with police instructions? Second, what  did the police actually do, and how and where did they do it? Third, how would another  person of a similar age, size, racial background and level of experience or  sophistication have felt during the encounter? In this case, the Supreme Court found that the police did in fact  detain Mr. Lafrance after searching his home on March 19. Any reasonable person  in Mr. Lafrance\u2019s shoes would have understood that they were being singled out  for investigation. Several factors support this conclusion: the police\u2019s show  of force in entering the home, waking Mr. Lafrance up and ordering him to  leave; a long ride with police officers to the station; and a lengthy police interview  in a secure area. As well, Mr. Lafrance was 19 years old, is Indigenous, had a  lack of experience with police, and was unfamiliar with his legal rights. He  would not have felt free to remain silent or free to leave. The right to counsel guaranteed by the <em>Charter</em> includes not only informing a detained person of their  right to talk to a lawyer, but also giving them time and an opportunity to  actually get legal advice. A single consultation with a lawyer is usually  enough. However, sometimes the police must provide the detained person with another  chance to talk to a lawyer, especially if the person did not understand their  rights or the advice they received. In this case, the police violated Mr. Lafrance\u2019s right to counsel on  March 19 because they actually detained him but did not tell him he could talk  to a lawyer. The police again violated his right to counsel on April 7. After  his first call to Legal Aid, it was clear Mr. Lafrance did not understand his  rights. The police should have given him another chance at talking to a lawyer  to get legal advice. <strong>Relying on the evidence would damage  the reputation of the justice system.</strong>\r\n     The police only obtained the confession and some other evidence after Mr.  Lafrance\u2019s <em>Charter</em> rights were violated.  The Supreme Court concluded that the confession and the other evidence should not  be used at his trial. The seriousness of the <em>Charter</em> violations committed by the police, and the impact on Mr.  Lafrance\u2019s rights, outweigh the public\u2019s interest in allowing the jury to hear  that evidence. In these circumstances, Justice Brown concluded that allowing this  evidence to be used at trial \u201cwould bring the administration of justice into  disrepute\u201d.",

On January 16, 2015, Sundman and two accomplices unlawfully confined and assaulted McLeod in a moving pickup truck. When the truck slowed down, McLeod jumped out and attempted to escape but was chased on foot by the three men. Sundman shot at McLeod multiple times but did not kill him. One of the accomplices then shot and killed McLeod at close range.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began when Darren Sundman was accused of first-degree murder in the death of Jordan McLeod. The Crown presented evidence that Sundman murdered McLeod while committing an offence of unlawful confinement under section 279(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge acquitted Sundman of first-degree murder but convicted him of second-degree murder. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia on two grounds: (1) whether McLeod remained unlawfully confined after escaping from the truck; and (2) whether his unlawful confinement and murder were part of a single transaction justifying conviction for first-degree murder under section 231(5)(e). The Court unanimously allowed the appeal, set aside Sundman's conviction for second-degree murder, and substituted a conviction for first-degree murder.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA single transaction for purposes of s. 231(5) can be established by demonstrating that continuing illegal domination formed part of a continuous sequence culminating in death.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority held that accused guilty under s231(e), finding victim still confined when escaped as coercively restrained through violence fear intimidation; also found unlawful confinement &murder one continuous sequence forming single transaction involving ongoing course domination consisting intimidation fear violence",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court finds an accused person  guilty of first degree murder for chasing and then killing a man who escaped  from a moving truck. </strong>\r\n   In 2015, Darren Sundman and two accomplices killed a rival drug dealer.  It happened as all four men were riding in a truck outside Prince George,  British Columbia. Mr. Sundman started hitting the victim with a handgun while  the truck was traveling so fast that the victim could not escape the truck. But  when the truck slowed down to make a turn, the victim jumped out and tried to run  away. Mr. Sundman and the two accomplices chased after the victim on foot. Mr.  Sundman shot the victim several times, stopping him from being able to run any farther.  One of the accomplices then said \u201cI got him, boss\u201d, before shooting the victim  at close range, killing him almost instantly. Even though Mr. Sundman did not  fire the fatal shot, he and the two accomplices had an intent to kill the  victim, and so they were each charged with first degree murder.  First degree murder usually means the murder was both planned and  deliberate. That is, the accused person intended to kill someone and prepared  it or thought it out ahead of time. But an unplanned murder can also be in the  first degree when the accused person killed the victim while committing another  serious offence, such as sexual assault or kidnapping. In this case, the Crown argued  that the murder was planned and deliberate, or that Mr. Sundman and his  accomplices had forcibly confined the victim when they killed him. Forcible  confinement is when someone unlawfully keeps another person trapped or detained  against their will.  At trial, the judge acquitted Mr. Sundman of first degree murder, but  convicted him of second degree murder. The judge found that because the killing  was not planned, and because the victim managed to escape his confinement when  he jumped out of the truck, this could not be first degree murder.  The Crown appealed the verdict to British Columbia\u2019s Court of Appeal. It  overturned the trial judge\u2019s decision and convicted Mr. Sundman of first degree  murder. It said the victim could still be considered \u201cconfined\u201d after jumping  out of the truck because he was being chased. Mr. Sundman appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has upheld Mr. Sundman\u2019s conviction for first degree  murder. <strong>Confinement does not always mean  being physically restrained.</strong>  Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice Mahmud Jamal said that, \u201cas  a matter of law and common sense\u201d, the victim\u2019s \u201cbrief escape\u201d from the truck does  not change the seriousness of Mr. Sundman\u2019s crime. \u201cOn any sensible view,\u201d he  wrote, Mr. Sundman\u2019s \u201cmoral blameworthiness cannot be considered to be lower\u201d  simply because the victim \u201cmanaged to jump from a moving truck and was running  for his life when he was executed just moments later\u201d. Forcible or unlawful confinement involves depriving a person of their  liberty so that they cannot move about the way they want to. The Supreme Court has  clarified that confinement does not mean a person has to be restricted to a  particular place. The person also does not need to be physically restrained.  Restraint can be enforced through violence, fear, intimidation, or through  psychological means or other methods.  In this case, the victim was forcibly or unlawfully confined inside the  truck, because it was moving so fast. When the victim escaped from the truck  and ran, he was still forcibly or unlawfully confined even though he was no  longer physically restrained. He could not move about the way he wanted to,  because Mr. Sundman and his accomplices chased him on foot while shooting at  him with their guns. The Supreme Court concluded that the murder happened while  the victim was still unlawfully confined, even when outside the truck. <strong>The confinement and the murder  did not have to happen at the exact same time.</strong>\r\n     The Supreme Court also said if a murder occurs during another serious  offence, like confinement, treating it as first degree murder does not mean  that the confinement and the killing needed to happen exactly at the same time.  The test is whether the confinement and the murder were part of the same  transaction or interaction, or if they represented a single continuous sequence  of events. In this case, the Supreme Court found that Mr. Sundman and his  accomplices murdered the victim \u201cwhile committing\u201d the offence of unlawful  confinement, because the two crimes happened in a single transaction between  the victim and his killers. The confinement and the murder were close in time, and  they involved a situation of continuous or ongoing domination over the victim  that began in the truck, continued when the victim briefly escaped, and ended when  he was killed.  As for the accomplices, one was convicted of second degree murder and  the other was convicted of manslaughter. Those verdicts were not appealed to  the Supreme Court.",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the Copyright Board's decision, ruling that the Copyright Act does not require users to pay two royalties to access works online.**\n\nThis appeal revolves around the central question of whether Section 2.4(1.1) of the Copyright Act requires users to pay two royalties when accessing works online.\n\n**Background:**\nThe Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), a collective rights management organization, brought a case against several respondents, including Apple Inc. and Pandora Media Inc., regarding the interpretation of Section 2.4(1.1) of the Copyright Act. The section deals with communication to the public by telecommunication, and SOCAN argued that it requires users to pay two royalties when accessing works online: one for making the work available and another for downloading or streaming it. The respondents countered that the provision only requires one royalty payment.\n\n**Court Proceedings:**\nThe dispute began with the Copyright Board of Canada, which initially ruled in favor of SOCAN, concluding that Section 2.4(1.1) deems the act of making works available to be a separately protected and compensable activity. However, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned this decision, holding that the Board's interpretation was unreasonable. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately heard the appeal, considering the standard of review applicable to the Board's decision. The majority held that the standard of review is correctness and concluded that the Board's decision was incorrect. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the appeal, holding that the Copyright Act does not require users to pay two royalties to access works online.\n\n**Legal Principle:**\nThe act of making a work available online is not a separately compensable activity, but rather part of a single protected activity that engages either the author's performance or reproduction right, depending on whether the work is streamed or downloaded.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWriting for the majority, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the Copyright Act does not require users to pay two royalties to access works online. The Court interpreted section 2.4(1.1) of the Copyright Act as clarifying that the communication right in section 3(1)(f) applies to on-demand streams and that a work is performed as soon as it is made available for on-demand streaming. This interpretation gives effect to Canada's obligations under Article 8 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and respects the principle of technological neutrality, ensuring that authors retain the same rights and royalties over their works regardless of whether they are distributed online or offline.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules the <em>Copyright  Act </em>only requires users to pay one royalty fee to stream works online. </strong>\r\n   Copyright law protects original works of writing, music or art. Under Canada\u2019s <em>Copyright Act</em>,the person who creates a work holds its \u201ccopyright\u201d and is the only  person with the right to reproduce or perform the work. If someone else wants to reproduce or perform the  work, they must ask the copyright holder for permission, and they are usually asked  to pay a fee called a royalty. The copyright holder is also the only person with the right to communicate  the work to the public by telecommunication, such as playing a song on the  radio. In 2012, a new section was added to the <em>Copyright Act </em>to clarify that this right includes \u201cmaking the work  available\u201d online by uploading it to the Internet. For example, downloading a  song creates a new copy of the music, so a reproduction royalty must be paid. Likewise,  streaming a video of the song is a new performance of the music, so a performance  royalty must be paid.  The Copyright Board of Canada is a federal administrative body whose  mandate includes approving the amount of royalties to be paid for some online  services. It received submissions from different groups on how to interpret the  new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em>,  including the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada  (\u201cSOCAN\u201d). SOCAN is an organization that collects and distributes royalties for  music creators, publishers and visual artists. SOCAN argued that \u201cmaking works  available\u201d online attracts a royalty separate from the royalties for downloading  or streaming the same works later on. This would mean that, for example, online  music services would have to pay a royalty when they post a song on the  Internet in a way that allows for online access by individual users. Another  royalty would be paid when a song is downloaded or streamed. The Copyright  Board agreed with SOCAN. The Federal Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the Copyright  Board. It said the new section of the <em>Copyright  Act</em> does not create a new and separate royalty for uploading a work, in  addition to the royalty that must be paid when users download or stream the  content. SOCAN appealed the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision. The Supreme Court has dismissed SOCAN\u2019s appeal. <strong>The Copyright Board\u2019s decision  was wrong.</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority of Supreme Court judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe  found that the Copyright Board\u2019s interpretation of the new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em> was inconsistent with the  text and purpose of the law and how it operates, and ran contrary to previous  decisions of the Supreme Court in other copyright cases. In rejecting the  Board\u2019s and SOCAN\u2019s interpretation, Justice Rowe said \u201cthe <em>Copyright Act</em> does not exist solely for the benefit of authors\u201d. The Copyright Board\u2019s interpretation would also force users to pay more  fees if they access works on the Internet instead of using other means, such as  listening to the radio. Justice Rowe said this violates the principle of  technological neutrality: the law should treat online works the same way it  treats offline works. \u201cWhat matters is what the user receives, not how the user  receives it,\u201d he wrote. For streaming, the Supreme Court found that the new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em> simply clarifies that a  work is \u201ccommunicated\u201d when it is made available or uploaded online. This  already attracts a royalty. If and when individual users stream that same work,  no additional royalties must be paid. Streaming is part of \u201cone continuous act\u201d  that began when the work was made available online. Because of this, streaming something  that was already uploaded online requires paying only one royalty, not two. Downloading is different. It involves a separate right: the right to  reproduce the work, not the right to communicate the work to the public by telecommunication. This interpretation of the new section of the <em>Copyright Act</em> ensures that Canada complies with its obligations  under an international copyright treaty. The test to determine how courts should review administrative decisions  on legal issues, like the decision of the Copyright Board here, was set out in  an earlier Supreme Court case: <em><a href=\"../2019/37748-eng.aspx\">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em>. <em>Vavilov</em> established categories of legal  issues that should be reviewed under the standard of \u201ccorrectness\u201d.  \u201cCorrectness\u201d means that the administrative decision on that issue has to be  the only right answer in light of the law and the facts. But the legal issue  raised by the Copyright Board\u2019s decision in this case did not fall into one of  the existing \u201ccorrectness\u201d categories. However, <em>Vavilov</em> said that new categories could be created in rare  circumstances. The Supreme Court created a new category of \u201ccorrectness\u201d review  and found that the Copyright Board\u2019s decision was wrong in this case.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court finds no abuse of  process during lengthy disciplinary proceedings against a Saskatchewan lawyer.</strong>Mr. Peter V. Abrametz is a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan  and has practiced law in Prince Albert for 49 years. In 2012, the law society audited  Mr. Abrametz\u2019s financial records, found irregularities and began disciplinary  proceedings against him. Those irregularities included making high-interest  loans to vulnerable clients and issuing cheques to a fictitious person before  endorsing and cashing them. In 2013, the law society notified Mr. Abrametz that he would be  suspended temporarily. However, Mr. Abrametz was allowed to continue practicing,  subject to certain conditions. They included that Mr. Abrametz had to retain a lawyer  to supervise his practice and its financial accounts, including withdrawals. He  was also barred from accepting, endorsing and cashing cheques. The law society served  Mr. Abrametz a second notice in 2014, but again he was allowed to continue to  practice under similar conditions. A year later, the Law  Society issued a formal complaint against Mr. Abrametz and appointed a Hearing  Committee. It wasn\u2019t until 2018 that the law society found him guilty  of four charges of conduct unbecoming a lawyer. It disbarred him with no chance  at applying to rejoin the law society for almost two years. During the disciplinary proceedings, Mr. Abrametz argued that the law society  took too long to investigate and decide his case. He said it amounted to an  abuse of process. The law society\u2019s Hearing Committee dismissed that argument but the Court  of Appeal for Saskatchewan agreed with Mr. Abrametz. The law society then appealed  to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has agreed with the Law Society. <strong>There was no abuse of process.</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority of Supreme Court judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe  said there is no basis to set aside the Hearing Committee\u2019s finding that there  was no abuse of process. \u201cThe Court of Appeal departed from its proper role  when it substituted its own findings of fact.\u201d\r\n     The test to determine whether delays amount to an abuse of process was  set out in an earlier Supreme Court case. It has three steps. First, the delay  must be unreasonable. This is determined by the context, including the nature  and purpose of the proceedings, the length and causes of the delay and the  complexity of the facts and issues in the case. Second, the delay must have  caused the person harm. Examples include psychological or reputational harm,  disruption to family life and loss of work. When these two requirements are  met, courts must conduct a final test to determine if there was an abuse of  process. This test is met when the delay is manifestly unfair to a party or in  some other way brings the administration of justice into disrepute. In this case, Mr. Abrametz has not shown that the Hearing Committee was  wrong in concluding that the delay was long but that it was not inordinate and that  there was no significant prejudice to Mr. Abrametz. Therefore, the test was not  met and the Court of Appeal should not have set aside the Hearing Committee\u2019s  conclusions.",

The accuseds brought pre-trial applications challenging the constitutionality of the record screening regime, which was introduced by Bill C-51 in 2018 to protect complainants' private records in sexual offence trials. The applications were heard by different trial judges, with varying results.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada heard two appeals, R. v. J.J. and R. v. Reddick, which challenged the constitutionality of the record screening regime. The majority held that the provisions are constitutional in their entirety as they apply to both s. 276 evidence applications and private record applications. The court considered the modern principle of statutory interpretation and presumed that Parliament intended to enact constitutional legislation. The court also determined that a \"record\" under s. 278.1 includes any form of record containing personal information for which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA law's overbreadth should be assessed relative to the legislative purpose, rather than being understood as an absolute principle.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice and Moldaver J. held that sections 278.92 to 278.94 of the Criminal Code are constitutional in their entirety. The majority found that the impugned provisions strike a balance between competing interests such as complainant privacy, dignity, equality rights, fair trial rights, and public interest in encouraging victims of sexual assault crimes to come forward. The court's decision upholds the constitutionality of the record screening regime, ensuring that complainants' private records are protected while also promoting trial fairness and encouraging victims of sexual offences to come forward.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court finds constitutional a new procedure in the<em> Criminal Code</em> for  deciding if a complainant\u2019s private documents can be used by an accused in a  sexual offence trial. </strong>J.J. was accused of sexual assault  in British Columbia. His identity is protected by a publication ban. Shane  Reddick was also accused of the same in Ontario. In both cases, the men argued that  sections 278.92 to 278.94 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> are unconstitutional. Those provisions set out how a judge decides if a  complainant\u2019s private documents (called \u201crecords\u201d in the <em>Criminal Code</em>) can be used by the accused during their trial for a  sexual offence. This is known as the record screening process. These provisions  are also used to decide how evidence of the complainant\u2019s past sexual activity  can be used. Evidence like private documents and past sexual activity can be allowed  in certain circumstances.     J.J. had records of communications  between himself and the complainant. He wanted to use those records to  cross-examine the complainant. Likewise, Mr. Reddick wanted to cross-examine  the complainant in his case, but on evidence of her past sexual activity.     Before their trial, both J.J. and  Mr. Reddick asked a judge to decide that the record screening process violated  three of their rights under the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>:the right  to remain silent and to not self-incriminate, the right to a fair trial, and  the right of an accused to present evidence in their defence and challenge the  evidence against them. In J.J.\u2019s  case, the judge found one aspect of the record screening process  unconstitutional. Both the Crown and J.J. appealed the judge\u2019s decision to the  Supreme Court of Canada. A jury later found J.J. not guilty, and the Crown has  not appealed the acquittal.     In Mr.  Reddick\u2019s case, the judge found the entire record screening process  unconstitutional. The complainant asked the Supreme Court for permission to  appeal that decision. She said it affected the right of sexual assault  complainants to participate in decision-making about how details of their  private sexual lives would be used in a public courtroom. The Supreme Court gave  her permission. The Supreme  Court has found the record screening process in sections 278.92 to 278.94 of  the <em>Criminal Code</em> constitutional.<strong>The record screening process does not  violate the <em>Charter</em> rights of the  accused. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a  majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Richard Wagner and  Justice Michael Moldaver said the accused\u2019s rights are not violated. The  accused\u2019s right to silence is not in issue because they are not forced to  testify during the record screening process. Also, the accused\u2019s right to a  fair trial does not mean they can receive the most advantageous or beneficial  trial possible. Finally, the accused\u2019s right to present and challenge evidence  is not unlimited. Ambushing complainants with their own highly private records  at trial can be unfair to complainants and may be contrary to the search for  truth.     The majority explained  that sections 278.92 to 278.94 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> were created to remove barriers preventing sexual assault victims from  coming forward. The goal of those sections was to have a process to protect the  interests of complainants in their own private documents when an accused has those  documents and wants to use them at trial. This process balances the rights and  interests of the accused, the complainant and the public, the majority said.",

The provisions in question permit physicians to administer psychiatric treatment to involuntary patients with mental disabilities without their consent and without the consent of a substitute decision-maker. The CCD alleged that these provisions violate sections 7 and 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with the CCD and two individual plaintiffs filing a claim challenging the constitutionality of the impugned provisions. The Attorney General of British Columbia (AGBC) applied to have the action dismissed, citing the CCD's lack of standing. The chambers judge allowed the application, but the Court of Appeal remitted the matter to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for fresh consideration. The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) ultimately heard the appeal and cross-appeal, dismissing the AGBC's appeal and granting the CCD public interest standing.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nIn determining public interest standing, courts should consider all the underlying purposes of standing, weighing the factors cumulatively, flexibly, and purposively, rather than attaching particular weight to specific principles.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice concludes that the principles of legality and access to justice do not merit particular weight in the Downtown Eastside analysis, a framework governing public interest standing. The court must instead consider all the underlying purposes of standing, weighing the factors cumulatively, flexibly, and purposively. In the case at hand, the Council of Canadians with Disabilities (CCD) is granted public interest standing to challenge the constitutionality of certain provisions of British Columbia's mental health legislation. The court finds that CCD raises a serious justiciable issue, has a genuine interest in the matter, and that its suit is a reasonable and effective means of bringing the case to court. The decision highlights the importance of access to justice for disadvantaged groups and the role of public interest standing in promoting this goal.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that the  Council of Canadians with Disabilities can challenge British Columbia\u2019s mental  health laws. </strong>\r\n   In this case, the Supreme Court was asked to decide if the Council of  Canadians with Disabilities (Council) qualifies for public interest standing in  a lawsuit. Public interest standing allows individuals or organizations to  bring a legal issue to court that is in the public interest even when they are  not directly affected. This happens most often in cases concerning the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  where issues may broadly affect society as a whole. The Council is a not-for-profit  organization working for the rights of people living with disabilities in  Canada. In 2016, the Council and two individuals challenged the constitutionality  of British Columbia\u2019s mental health legislation. The law allows doctors to  administer psychiatric treatment to patients with mental disabilities without  their consent or the consent of someone else on their behalf. According to the Council  and the two people who experienced such treatment without their consent, the  law violates sections 7 and 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>.  Section 7 guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and security of the  person. Section 15(1) says everyone has the right to be treated equally without  discrimination, including on the basis of mental or physical disability.  In 2017, the two individuals withdrew from the lawsuit, which left the Council  to continue the case on its own. The Council sought public interest standing from  British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Canada had already  established a test to qualify for public interest standing in a previous case. It  consists of three requirements: (1) the case must raise a serious issue the  court can decide; (2) the party raising the issue must have a genuine interest  in the matter; (3) the lawsuit must be a reasonable and effective way to bring  the issue to court.  In this case, the trial judge said the Council failed to meet this test  because the two individuals and the facts of their experiences were no longer  part of the lawsuit. The Council appealed to British Columbia\u2019s Court of  Appeal, which said the judge was mistaken in finding the case had no factual  context.  The Supreme Court says the Council has public interest standing and can continue  the lawsuit.  <strong>The Council meets the test for public  interest standing. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Chief Justice Richard Wagner said the  Council meets the three-part test for public interest standing. Firstly, it  raises an important issue: the <em>Charter </em>rights  of people with mental disabilities. Secondly, the Council has a genuine  interest in the challenges faced by people with mental disabilities. Thirdly,  its claim is a reasonable and effective way to bring the matter before the  courts. The Chief Justice said a court\u2019s decision to grant or deny public  interest standing is discretionary. Each factor in the three-part test must be  duly considered and no factor takes priority over the others.\u00a0\u00a0  The Chief Justice said this case does not turn on individual facts and the  Council could establish a sufficient factual context at trial. \u201cA strict  requirement for a directly affected co-plaintiff would pose obstacles to access  to justice\u201d, the Chief Justice wrote. The Council raises important issues with  the potential of affecting many people with mental health disabilities. The granting  of public interest standing in this case \u201cwill promote access to justice for a  disadvantaged group who has historically faced serious barriers to bringing such  litigation before the courts\u201d, the Chief Justice wrote. \u00a0",

The case primarily deals with tax law and equitable remedies, referencing sections 12(1)(j), 75(2), 112(1), and 220(1) of the Income Tax Act.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began with the respondents petitioning for equitable rescission of transactions that led to unanticipated tax liability.

The Attorney General then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the courts below erred in adopting the test for equitable rescission stated in Pitt v. Holt. In a majority decision written by Brown J., the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside judgments granting equitable rescission.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nTaxpayers should be taxed based on what they actually agreed to do and did, rather than on what they could have done or intended to achieve.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority Justice Brown concludes that taxpayers are barred from obtaining equitable relief, including rescission, to avoid unanticipated adverse tax consequences arising from freely agreed-upon transactions under ordinary operation of Income Tax Act; limiting principle equity & principles stated Fairmont Hotels & Jean Coutu irreconcilable conclusion Pitt v Holt equity relieve mistake; nothing unconscionable unfair ordinary operation statutes freely agreed upon; remedy lies Parliament not court equity",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that  companies cannot undo transactions that later cause them unintended taxes.</strong>\r\n   This is a case involving two  companies, Rite-Way Metals Ltd. and Harvard Industries Ltd., which were wanting  to avoid paying taxes on some of their assets. The companies followed  guidelines published by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). According to these  guidelines, section 75(2) of the <em>Income  Tax Act</em> allowed companies to avoid taxes on dividends if paid to a family trust.  A dividend is a part of the profit a company pays to its shareholders. A family  trust is a legal entity created to hold assets. Once assets are transferred  into the trust, they are no longer the property of the person who transferred  them. Instead, they belong to the trust, which is then administered for the  benefit of the trustees (or beneficiaries), who are usually members of the  relevant family. In this case, the trusts were for the Collins and Cochran  families. The trusts were created in 2008. A few years later, in an  unrelated case, the Tax Court of Canada issued a decision with a different  interpretation of section 75(2). The effect of the ruling was that family trusts  owe taxes on any such dividends.  The Collins and Cochran family trusts  applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia to cancel the transactions  that led to the dividends. British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court agreed to do so.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by the Attorney General of Canada on  behalf of the CRA. The Attorney General then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has agreed with  CRA\u2019s interpretation of the law. <strong>The transactions cannot be cancelled.</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority of Supreme  Court judges, Justice Russell  Brown said principles of equity and tax law prevent the companies from  reversing their transactions. \u201cTaxpayers should be taxed based on what they  actually agreed to do and did, and not on what they could have done or later  wished they had done,\u201d Justice Brown wrote. A court may grant relief to parties  only when it would be unfair to enforce transactions. The judges wrote there is  nothing unfair about the ordinary application of tax laws to transactions  freely undertaken. If any changes are required, it would be up to Parliament to  make them, not the courts, the majority noted.  <strong>Retroactive tax planning is not allowed. </strong>\r\n     The Supreme  Court has previously stated that retroactive tax planning is not allowed. This  means people cannot later change their tax arrangements to prevent any  unintended negative consequences. Although taxpayers can arrange their finances  as they see fit to reduce their taxes, their planning may have the opposite  effect. If so, they must bear that responsibility. ",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores a foster  parent\u2019s convictions for the death of a child and for causing bodily harm to  another.</strong>\r\n   Kevin Goforth and his wife were charged with the second degree murder  of a four-year old and unlawfully causing bodily harm to a two-year old. Both  children were being foster parented by the Goforths. The parents were accused  of failing to provide the children with the necessaries of life, such as food  and water, contrary to section 215 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.  In 2016, a jury convicted both foster parents of unlawfully causing bodily  harm to the younger child. As to the older child, the jury found the wife  guilty of second degree murder, whereas it found Mr. Goforth guilty of  manslaughter. Second degree murder is a more serious offence than manslaughter  because someone who murders intends to kill (or at least cause the victim  serious harm), while someone who commits manslaughter does not.  Mr. Goforth appealed to Saskatchewan\u2019s Court of Appeal, which set aside  his convictions and ordered a new trial. The Court of Appeal said the trial  judge made errors in her instructions to the jury in two ways. First, she was  wrong in how she described the guilty mind requirement, known as the \u201c<em>mens rea</em>\u201d. Second, she failed to properly  instruct the jury regarding Mr. Goforth\u2019s evidence that he was only a secondary  caregiver to the children. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court agreed with the Crown.  <strong>The jury was properly  instructed. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice  Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 said the jury was properly instructed. \u201cThis Court has long held that an accused is  entitled to a jury that is properly\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and not necessarily  perfectly\u00a0\u2014\u00a0instructed\u201d, she wrote. Trial judges must be allowed  some flexibility in the language they use to instruct a jury since their role  is to simplify the law and evidence. An appeal court must review any alleged  errors in the instructions in the context of the evidence, the entire jury instructions  and the trial as a whole.  In this case, the trial judge\u2019s instructions were not perfect but were adequate.  The majority of judges said there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would  have been confused about the <em>mens rea</em> requirement or been misled about what the Crown had to prove for Mr. Goforth to  be found guilty of either manslaughter or unlawfully causing bodily harm.  Also, the trial judge\u2019s instructions were sufficient as to Mr. Goforth\u2019s  evidence relating to his busy schedule and that he was only a secondary  caregiver, which he argued prevented him from foreseeing the risk of harm to  the children. Finally, the judge\u2019s instructions necessarily allowed the jury to  make a common sense assessment about whether failing to provide food and water  to young children was a marked departure (significantly different) from what a  reasonably prudent person would do.

The maternal grandmother had provided extensive care for her grandson since his birth and had obtained an order designating her as a parent under s. 1(s) of the Child Protection Act. The biological father, who had recently learned about his son's existence, sought permanent custody despite having limited involvement in his life. The issue revolved around what was considered best for the child's well-being under section 2(2) of the Child Protection Act.\n\nThe trial process began with a disposition hearing under the Child Protection Act, where the maternal grandmother and the father submitted competing parenting plans for the child's permanent custody. The hearing judge awarded custody to the grandmother, finding that she would promote the child's relationship with the father and his family, whereas the father would not ensure a meaningful relationship with the child's family in Prince Edward Island unless ordered by the court. The father appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal for Prince Edward Island, which reversed the decision and granted custody to the father. The maternal grandmother then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the Court of Appeal had failed to afford the appropriate level of deference to the hearing judge's assessment.\n\nIn child custody disputes, an appellate court must exercise restraint and only intervene where there has been a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law, affording significant deference to the trial judge's assessment of the child's best interests.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Martin emphasizes that the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration in child protection proceedings. The Court holds that the hearing judge did not err in her determination of the child's best interests, and that the Court of Appeal failed to afford the appropriate level of deference to the hearing judge's assessment. The majority also rejects the idea that a biological tie should be given significant weight in determining a child's best interests, instead emphasizing that a child's bond with a parent or caregiver is a more important consideration. The Court ultimately allows the appeal and restores the order of the hearing judge, awarding permanent custody and guardianship to the grandmother.",

They separated less than a year later when the  mother moved to Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.). The father was unaware the  mother was pregnant when she left. Shortly after the child was born in 2013,  the maternal grandmother went to reside with the mother and child to help  support them. When the child was four years old, the mother refused to allow  the grandmother further contact with him. The child was then apprehended by the  Director of Child Protection, as he was found to be needing protection. He was  eventually placed in the grandmother\u2019s care. The Director subsequently alerted  the father of the child\u2019s existence. The father and the grandmother applied for  permanent custody separately from each other.  The hearing judge held  it was in the child\u2019s best interests for the grandmother to have custody. The  father appealed to the Court of Appeal of P.E.I., which gave him custody. The  grandmother then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has said  the grandmother should have custody.  <strong>The standard of review to be applied by appeal  courts in child protection cases</strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice  Sheilah Martin said the grandmother should have custody. The Court of Appeal should  have deferred to the hearing judge\u2019s decision in this regard, Justice Martin  explained.  The most important consideration  in a child custody case is the best interests of the child. A judge\u2019s ruling on a child custody matter is owed  deference when reviewed by an appeal court. An appeal court may only change  a ruling if there was a material error, a serious misapprehension of the  evidence, or an error in law. The  same standard applies in custody cases involving child protection, unless there  is legislation to the contrary. Nothing in P.E.I.\u2019s <em>Child Protection Act</em> suggests a different standard. In this case, the  Supreme Court found no error in the hearing judge\u2019s assessment of the best  interests of the child. The hearing judge based her analysis on an extensive  review of the evidence, and was not compelled to decide in favour of the father  simply due to a closer biological tie.  <strong>Biological ties carry minimal weight in the  assessment of a child\u2019s best interests</strong>\r\n     A parent\u2019s biological tie  is simply one factor among many that may be relevant to a child\u2019s best interest,  Justice Martin said. Judges are not required to treat biology as a tie-breaker  when two prospective custodial applicants are otherwise equal. Placing too  great an emphasis on a biological tie could lead some judges to give effect to  the parent\u2019s claim over the child\u2019s best interests. Parental preferences should  not prevail over the child\u2019s best interests. \u201cWhile biological ties may be  relevant in a given case, they will generally carry minimal weight in the  assessment of a child\u2019s best interests\u201d, Justice Martin wrote.

The Crown sought to apply s. 745.51, which would have resulted in consecutive parole ineligibility periods totaling 150 years. The trial judge, Huot J., held that this provision infringed the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under s. 12 of the Charter and the right to liberty and security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with Bissonnette's guilty plea, followed by the trial judge's determination of the parole ineligibility period and the constitutionality of s. 745.51. The trial judge held that the provision was unconstitutional and applied the technique of reading in to grant courts discretion in determining the length of the additional ineligibility period. The Quebec Court of Appeal allowed Bissonnette's appeal, declaring s. 745.51 invalid and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed the appeal, upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal and declaring s. 745.51 to be of no force or effect immediately.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA punishment that is cruel and unusual by nature, such as a sentence of imprisonment for life without a realistic possibility of parole, infringes the right to be free from cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, Chief Justice Wagner concludes that s. 745.51 of the Criminal Code violates s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Chief Justice reasons that this provision inherently infringes s. 12 of the Charter, as it authorizes sentences that effectively deprive offenders of a realistic possibility of being granted parole before they die, thus violating human dignity. This conclusion is reached after analyzing the nature of punishment and its effects on offenders, as well as international and comparative law, which concurs that sentences without parole opportunities are incompatible with human dignity.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court finds  unconstitutional the section of the <em>Criminal Code</em> that permits consecutive parole  ineligibility periods of 25 years in cases involving multiple first degree murders.</strong>\r\n   On the evening of January 29, 2017, Alexandre Bissonnette entered the  Great Mosque of Qu\u00e9bec armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a pistol and  opened fire on the worshippers. He killed six people and seriously injured five  others. At trial, he pled guilty to all charges against him, including six  counts of first degree murder.  The sentence for first degree murder in Canada is imprisonment for life  without the possibility of parole for 25 years. When someone is found guilty of  multiple first degree murders, the same 25-year sentence applies to each murder.  Usually, offenders serve each of their sentences at the same time (concurrently),  but at trial the Crown prosecutor asked the judge to apply section 745.51 of  the <em>Criminal Code</em>. This provision allows  the periods without eligibility for parole for each murder conviction to be  served back-to-back (consecutively). This would have meant the offender would serve  six consecutive parole ineligibility periods of 25 years, for a total of 150  years. But counsel for the offender argued the provision is unconstitutional. The  trial judge agreed and ordered the offender to serve five of the 25-year  sentences concurrently, as well as 15 years for the sixth first degree murder  to be served consecutively, for a total ineligibility period of 40 years.  The offender appealed his sentence to Quebec\u2019s Court of Appeal, which also  found the provision unconstitutional, but ordered the offender to serve the six  sentences concurrently, for a total ineligibility period of 25 years. The Crown  then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>Section 745.51 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>violates section 12 of <em>Charter</em> and is therefore  unconstitutional. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Chief Justice Richard Wagner  said section 745.51 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violates section 12 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> in a way that cannot be justified in a free  and democratic society. Section 12 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Its  purpose is to protect human dignity and ensure respect for the inherent worth  of each individual.  In a case of multiple murders, section 745.51 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> allows a court to impose  imprisonment on the offender without a possibility of parole for a period of  50, 75, 100 or even 150 years. This provision \u201cauthorizes a court to order an  offender to serve an ineligibility period that exceeds the life expectancy of  any human being, a sentence so absurd that it would bring the administration of  justice into disrepute\u201d, the Chief Justice wrote.  A life sentence without a realistic possibility of parole presupposes the  offender is beyond redemption and cannot be rehabilitated. This is degrading in  nature and incompatible with human dignity. It amounts to cruel and unusual  punishment. \u201cBy depriving offenders in advance of any possibility of  reintegration into society, section 745.51 shakes the very foundations of  Canadian criminal law\u201d, the Chief Justice said.  In light of this conclusion, the Chief Justice declared section 745.51 invalid  from the time it was enacted in 2011. As a result, the law that existed before  that date continues to apply. This means the offender must serve a life sentence  without eligibility for parole for a total of 25 years. ",

Grebliunas**\n\nThis appeal raises questions about the admission of new evidence on appeal in family law cases, particularly those involving the best interests of a child.\n\n**Background**\nAshley Barendregt (the mother) and Geoff Grebliunas (the father) are parents disputing the relocation of their two children to Telkwa, British Columbia. The trial judge awarded primary residence to the mother and allowed her to relocate with the children, citing concerns about the parents' acrimonious relationship and its impact on the children.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial court proceedings involved a dispute over primary residence, with the mother seeking to relocate to Telkwa. The trial judge awarded primary residence to her, but this decision was appealed by the father. The Court of Appeal admitted new evidence regarding his financial situation and renovations made to their Kelowna home since trial, setting aside the original decision. However, on further appeal by both parties, including an application for leave from one party that was dismissed without costs or reasons given; ultimately leading up until now where we have reached our final judgment today - restoring back what had been decided at first instance before all these appeals took place!\n\n**Legal Principle**\nIn family law cases involving relocation disputes between parents regarding custody arrangements under applicable legislation such as Divorce Act RSC 1985 c 3 (2nd Supp), courts must apply flexible standards when considering whether additional evidence should be admitted during appeals processes so they may reach just results while balancing competing interests like finality versus justice being served through variation applications instead if appropriate under specific circumstances presented within each individual case scenario presented before them.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority Justice Karakatsanis held that admitting new evidence did not meet Palmer test because it could've been available at trial with due diligence & wasn't necessary for reaching just result; also variation application would've been more suitable addressing material change circumstances rather than intervening w/ original decision allowing relocation which ultimately found best interest child considering factors such as parental conflict emotional support needed etcetera",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules children can  relocate within British Columbia to live with their mother. </strong>\r\n   This is a child custody case. The mother  and father met in 2011. Soon after, the mother moved to Kelowna, where the  father was living. They got married, bought a house and had two boys. When  their relationship ended in 2018, the mother took the children to her parents\u2019  home in Telkwa, a 10-hour drive from Kelowna.  The children split their time between  Telkwa and Kelowna before the parents agreed the children should remain in  Kelowna with the father until the mother returned there, although she never did  return. Instead, she asked the court to relocate the children to Telkwa. If  not, she said she was willing to move to Kelowna, but the father was unwilling  to move to Telkwa.  At trial, the judge said the children could  move to Telkwa with the mother for two reasons: the bitter relationship between  the parents affected the children; and the father might not be able to afford  to stay in the Kelowna home. The father then appealed to British Columbia\u2019s  Court of Appeal, asking to present additional evidence about his financial  situation.  The Court of Appeal sided with the father.  It allowed the new evidence, saying it affected the trial judge\u2019s finding about  the father\u2019s finances. As a result, the relocation could no longer be  justified. The mother then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has sided with the  mother.  <strong>The  new evidence should not have been allowed on appeal. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges of  the Supreme Court, Justice Andromache Karakatsanis said the children can move  to Telkwa with their mother. The majority said the Court of Appeal was  wrong to apply a different test than that set out by the Supreme Court in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2543/index.do\">Palmer  v. The Queen</a></em> when deciding whether the father could present new  evidence. As the majority explained, this test applies to evidence even at the  appeal stage. According to the test, four criteria must be met for the evidence  to be allowed: (1) despite the party\u2019s due diligence, the evidence could not  have been presented at trial; (2) the evidence is relevant; (3) it is credible;  and (4) it could have affected the result at trial.  In this case, the test was not met because  the evidence about the father\u2019s finances could have been presented at trial if  he had taken all reasonable steps to obtain it in time.  <strong>The  move is in the children\u2019s best interests. \u00a0</strong>\r\n     The majority said there was no reason for  the Court of Appeal to change the trial judge\u2019s decision. The move was in the  children\u2019s best interests. There was a significant risk that the bitter  relationship between the parents would affect the children if they stayed in  Kelowna. Also, the mother needed her parents\u2019 help to care for the children,  and they are in Telkwa.  In such cases, the question is \u201cwhether relocation  is in the best interests of the child, having regard to child\u2019s physical,  emotional and psychological safety, security and well-being\u201d, the majority  said. The analysis is highly fact-specific and discretionary, and the possibility  for change on appeal is very narrow. ",

Sullivan had taken an overdose of a prescription drug, while Chan had ingested magic mushrooms. Both accused argued that their state of intoxication was so extreme that their actions were involuntary and could not be the basis for a guilty verdict. However, section 33.1 of the Criminal Code prevents accused persons from raising the defence of self-induced intoxication akin to automatism. The accused challenged the constitutionality of section 33.1 under sections 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, arguing that it violates principles of fundamental justice or presumption of innocence.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial proceedings in R. v. Sullivan involved two separate cases, R. v. Sullivan and R. v. Chan, which were heard together by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The trial judges in both cases applied section 33.1, convicting Sullivan of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon, and Chan of manslaughter and aggravated assault. The Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed the appeals, holding that section 33.1 is unconstitutional and of no force or effect. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the Crown's appeals, confirming the acquittals entered by the Court of Appeal for Sullivan and ordering a new trial for Chan.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA declaration of unconstitutionality issued by a superior court under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, is governed by the ordinary rules of stare decisis, which allow for departure from the prior decision in certain narrow circumstances.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer concludes that the appeals should be dismissed, and Thomas Chan's application for leave to cross-appeal should be quashed for want of jurisdiction. The majority opinion holds that section 33.1 of the Criminal Code violates the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The majority also clarifies that a superior court judge in first instance should follow prior decisions made by their own court on all questions of law, including questions of constitutional law, unless one or more of the exceptions in Re Hansard Spruce Mills are met.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms a man\u2019s  acquittals and the Court of Appeal\u2019s order for a new trial for another man in  cases involving automatism. </strong>\r\n   These cases are about two Ontario men, David  Sullivan and Thomas Chan, who committed violent acts while extremely intoxicated  from drugs they had voluntary taken. The events are unrelated, but both men argued  that the drugs left them in states of \u201cautomatism\u201d. Automatism is when someone  claims to have been so intoxicated or impaired that they lost complete control  of themselves. Mr. Sullivan took an overdose of a  prescription drug, fell into an impaired state and attacked his mother with a  knife, gravely injuring her. He was charged with several offences, including  aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.  Mr. Chan took \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d, which contain a drug called  psilocybin. He fell into an impaired state, attacked his father with a knife  and killed him, and seriously injured his father\u2019s partner. Mr. Chan was tried  for manslaughter and aggravated assault. In addition to the defence of  automatism, he said an underlying brain injury was also to blame for his  actions.  Section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> prevents a person from using automatism as a defence  for crimes involving assault or interference with the bodily integrity of  another person. At their respective trials, Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Chan argued  that section 33.1 violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (<em>Charter</em>). Section 7 guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty  and security of the person, whereas section 11(d) guarantees everyone the right  to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.  In Mr. Sullivan\u2019s case, the trial judge  accepted that he was acting involuntarily, but said section 33.1 prevented the  defence of automatism and convicted him. In Mr. Chan\u2019s case, a different trial  judge said he did not have to follow previous decisions of the same court declaring  section 33.1 unconstitutional. He also said Mr. Chan\u2019s brain injury was not the  cause of his actions. As a result, he convicted Mr. Chan. Both men appealed to the Ontario Court of  Appeal, which heard the appeals together. The Court of Appeal acquitted Mr.  Sullivan and ordered a new trial for Mr. Chan since no actual finding of fact  had been made about automatism in his case. The Crown then appealed both  rulings to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals.  <strong>In <em>R. v. Brown</em>, the Supreme Court decided section  33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> was unconstitutional. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice  Nicholas Kasirer said the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em><a href=\"39781-eng.aspx\">R.  v. Brown</a></em>, which was heard together with these appeals and whose  judgment is being rendered at the same time, is applicable to this case. In <em><a href=\"39781-eng.aspx\">R.  v. Brown</a></em>, the Court says section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> in a way that cannot be  justified in a free and democratic society and is unconstitutional. In this  case, Mr. Sullivan can be acquitted because he had proven that he was  intoxicated to the point of automatism and the trial judge had found he was  acting involuntarily. For his part, Mr. Chan can argue the automatism defence at  his new trial, Justice Kasirer explained.  <strong>The effect of a  declaration of unconstitutionality by one trial court on another within the  same province </strong><br/>\r\n     In this case, the Supreme Court also addressed the  question of whether a declaration of unconstitutionality by a trial court is  binding on other courts within the same province. The Court said a decision is indeed  binding on other trial courts, unless the facts are very different or if the  court had no practical way of knowing the decision existed. ",

Brown involves Matthew Winston Brown, who was charged with break and enter and aggravated assault after violently attacking Janet Hamnett, a stranger, while in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism caused by consuming magic mushrooms. Brown argued that he was not guilty of the offences by reason of automatism, and expert evidence confirmed that he had no voluntary control over his conduct at the time. The Crown invoked Section 33.1 of the Criminal Code, which eliminates the defence of self-induced intoxication akin to automatism for general intent crimes, including aggravated assault.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process involved Matthew Winston Brown's defence of automatism due to extreme intoxication, which was accepted by the trial judge, leading to an acquittal. However, the Crown appealed, and the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, convicting Brown of aggravated assault. The Supreme Court allowed Brown's appeal, declaring Section 33.1 of the Criminal Code unconstitutional and restoring his acquittal. The appellate process involved arguments over the interpretation of Section 33.1 and its constitutionality under Sections 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA provision that allows for the conviction of an individual for a crime without proof of the required mens rea or voluntariness, and instead relies on the fact of self-induced intoxication, violates the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer concludes that Section 33.1 of the Criminal Code, which eliminates the defence of self-induced intoxication akin to automatism for certain violent crimes, is unconstitutional and of no force or effect. The majority holds that Section 33.1 breaches the principles of fundamental justice and the presumption of innocence guaranteed by Sections 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, the provision allows for conviction without proof of mens rea or voluntariness, and improperly substitutes proof of self-induced intoxication for proof of the essential elements of an offence. The majority also finds that the provision is not saved by Section 1 of the Charter, as it fails to meet the proportionality test. The decision emphasizes the importance of protecting the morally innocent and upholding the principles of fundamental justice in the criminal justice system.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores an Alberta  man\u2019s acquittal for attacking a woman while in a state of automatism. </strong>\r\n   On the night of January 12, 2018, Matthew  Winston Brown consumed alcohol and \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d at a party in Calgary,  Alberta. The mushrooms contain psilocybin, an illegal drug that can cause  hallucinations. Mr. Brown lost his grip on reality, left the party and broke  into a nearby home, violently attacking a woman inside. The woman suffered  permanent injuries as a result of the attack. When Mr. Brown broke into another  house, the couple living there called the police. Mr. Brown said he had no  memory of the incidents. Mr. Brown was charged with aggravated assault, breaking  and entering, and mischief to property. He had no previous criminal record and  no history of mental illness.  At trial, Mr. Brown pleaded not guilty to the  charges of \u201cautomatism\u201d. Automatism is when someone claims to have been so intoxicated  or impaired that they had lost complete control of themselves.  The Crown argued Mr. Brown could not rely on automatism  because section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> prevents a person from using automatism as a defence for crimes involving  assault or interference with the bodily integrity of another person. Mr. Brown responded that section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>violates sections 7 and 11(d)  of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms</em>. Section 7 guarantees everyone the right to life, liberty and  security of the person, whereas section 11(d) guarantees everyone the right to  be presumed innocent until proven guilty. The judge agreed with Mr. Brown and  acquitted him. The Crown appealed to Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal, which disagreed  and convicted Mr. Brown. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has restored the acquittal. \u00a0\u00a0     The Supreme Court heard this case together with <em><a href=\"39270-eng.aspx\">R. v. Sullivan</a></em>,  and the judgments are being rendered at the same time.  <strong>Section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> and is therefore unconstitutional. </strong>\r\n   Writing for a unanimous Supreme Court, Justice  Nicholas Kasirer said section 33.1 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> violates sections 7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> in a way that cannot be justified in a free and democratic  society and is unconstitutional. He wrote that section 33.1 violates section  11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> because society  could interpret someone\u2019s intent to become intoxicated as an intention to  commit a violent offence. Section 33.1 also violates section 7 because a person  could be convicted without the prosecution having to prove that the action was  voluntary or that the person intended to commit the offence. Convicting someone for how they conducted  themselves while in a state of automatism violates principles of fundamental  justice. Our criminal justice system is based on the notion of personal  responsibility. In Canada, two elements of fundamental justice are required for  a person to be found guilty of a crime. They are: a guilty action; and (2) a guilty  mind. Neither element is present when a person is in a state of automatism.  <strong>Parliament could enact legislation to address violence caused by extreme  intoxication. </strong>\r\n     The Court explained that Parliament could enact  new legislation to hold an extremely intoxicated person accountable for a  violent crime. The Court emphasized that, \u201cprotecting the victims of violent  crime \u2013 particularly in light of the equality and dignity interests of women  and children who are vulnerable to intoxicated sexual and domestic acts \u2013 is a  pressing and substantial social purpose\u201d.

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court sets aside the stay of proceedings and orders a new trial in a case involving allegations of sexual offences.**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central question of whether the Jordan framework applies to retrial delay and whether an accused can raise delay from their first trial in a subsequent motion for a stay of proceedings.\n\nThe complainant, the daughter of the accused, J.F., alleged that he committed seven counts of sexual offences against her between 1986 and 2001. J.F. was charged in February 2011 and underwent a preliminary inquiry, which was completed in March 2012. The trial began in December 2013 and lasted for approximately two days, with argument being completed in May 2016. The trial judge reserved judgment, which was eventually rendered in February 2017, acquitting the accused on all counts. The Crown appealed the acquittal, and the Quebec Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial in June 2018. Before the retrial began, the accused filed a motion for a stay of proceedings for unreasonable delay under section 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe trial process began in 2013, with the accused facing seven counts of sexual offenses against his daughter. The trial lasted for approximately three years, with the judge reserving judgment until 2017. J.F. was acquitted on all counts, but the Crown appealed, and the Quebec Court of Appeal ordered a new trial in 2018. Before the retrial, J.F. filed a motion for a stay of proceedings due to unreasonable delay under s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The trial judge granted the motion, combining the delays from the first trial and the retrial. The Crown appealed, but the Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the Crown had not rebutted the presumption of unreasonable delay. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, setting aside the stay of proceedings and remanding the case for a new trial.\n\nWhen a new trial is ordered, an accused cannot raise delay from their first trial in a subsequent s. 11(b) motion for a stay of proceedings, and the computation of delay restarts at zero, with only the retrial delay being counted in calculating delay under the Jordan framework.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice Wagner held that the Jordan framework applies when a motion for a stay of proceedings for unreasonable delay is brought in the course of a retrial. The Court established that an accused must raise the unreasonableness of trial delay in a timely manner, and that bringing a motion after an appeal court has ordered a new trial will generally be considered late. The majority also found that the presumptive ceilings established in Jordan apply to retrial delay, but only the delay since the order for a new trial is counted. In this case, the accused did not act in a timely manner, and therefore, only the 10-month and 5-day delay since the order for a new trial was considered. This delay was found to be reasonable and below the 30-month presumptive ceiling.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules the delay for  the retrial of a Quebec father charged with multiple sex offences was  reasonable. </strong>\r\n   In 2011, J.F. was charged with seven counts of sexual offences  involving his daughter committed between 1986 and 2001 in Quebec. Following a  preliminary inquiry, J.F.\u2019s trial began before the Court of Qu\u00e9bec in late 2013. Meanwhile, in 2016, the Supreme Court of Canada issued its ruling in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16057/index.do\">R.  v. Jordan</a></em>. In that case, the Supreme Court established limits on  the amount of time between a person being charged and the conclusion of their  trial. The limit is 30 months for a trial in a provincial court, such as the  Court of Qu\u00e9bec, following a preliminary inquiry.  Eventually, J.F.\u2019s trial ended with his acquittal in 2017, six years  after he was charged. The Crown appealed to Quebec\u2019s Court of Appeal, which ordered  a new trial. Before the retrial began, J.F. asked the court to stop or \u201cstay\u201d the  proceedings. He argued that the delays during his first trial and before his retrial  were unreasonable. Due to these delays, J.F. argued his right under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (<em>Charter</em>) \u201cto be tried within a  reasonable time\u201d, was violated. The retrial judge agreed with J.F. that his section 11(b) <em>Charter</em> right had been violated. The  Crown appealed to Quebec\u2019s Court of Appeal. The judges on that court ruled that  the delay for each trial must be considered separately. They said that it would  only be necessary to consider the delay for the retrial, if the delay for the  first trial were reasonable. In J.F.\u2019s case, however, the first trial delay was  unreasonable. So the Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown\u2019s appeal and did not  consider the retrial delay. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.  The Supreme Court has sided with the Crown.  <strong>Only the delay for the retrial  is counted. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Chief  Justice Richard Wagner said the <em>Jordan</em> decision requires both the Crown and the defence lawyers to act in a timely  manner. This includes the accused raising an issue of delay promptly. As a result,  in the case of a single trial, an accused who believes their right to be tried  within a reasonable time has been violated must raise the issue before their  trial. Sometimes an accused may raise the issue on appeal, but that would be  exceptional. An accused should not raise the delay for their first trial after  an appeal court has ordered a retrial.  Once an appeal court has ordered a retrial, the Chief Justice said only  the delay for that retrial counts, and the same time limit as set out in the<em> Jordan</em> case applies. A delay from the  first trial will be considered in exceptional circumstances only. In this case, J.F. did not raise the delay issue before or during his  first trial, and he did not raise it at the Court of Appeal. He only raised it  at his retrial. So only the delay for the retrial can be considered. That delay  was 10 months and 5 days, which is well below the 30-month limit. As such, it was  reasonable, and there is no reason to stay the proceedings.\u00a0 ",

The police informed him of his right to  counsel under section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (<em>Charter</em>).  Section 10(b) provides that \u201ceveryone has the right on arrest or detention to  retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right\u201d. At the police station, Mr. Dussault spoke to a lawyer on the phone who  explained the charges against him and his right to remain silent. When the  lawyer had the impression that Mr. Dussault did not understand, he offered to come  to the station and to continue the conversation in person. Mr. Dussault agreed  and the police approved the lawyer\u2019s visit. In the meantime, the lawyer told Mr. Dussault not to speak to anyone until  he arrived at the station. He also asked the police to suspend their  investigation until he was present. Yet when the lawyer arrived, the police did  not allow him to see Mr. Dussault. Instead, they told Mr. Dussault the lawyer was  not at the station. The police proceeded to interrogate Mr. Dussault. The  accused then made an incriminating statement that was later used against him in  court. Mr. Dussault pleaded guilty to the arson charge and a jury trial was  held to decide the murder charge.  At trial, Mr. Dussault asked the judge to exclude the incriminating  statement from the evidence. He argued that it violated his right to counsel  under section 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. The  trial judge disagreed and admitted the statement. The jury eventually convicted  Mr. Dussault of murder. He then appealed to Quebec\u2019s Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal found that police had violated Mr. Dussault\u2019s section  10(b) <em>Charter </em>right and ordered a new  murder trial. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>Mr. Dussault\u2019s  section 10(b) <em>Charter </em>right was violated.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Michael Moldaver said police  failed to provide Mr. Dussault with a further opportunity to speak with his  lawyer before they interrogated him.

But if the police cause the accused to doubt  the legal advice received or the trustworthiness of the lawyer who provided it,  the police must provide the accused another opportunity to speak with a lawyer.  In this case, the Supreme Court found that the police caused Mr.  Dussault to doubt his lawyer\u2019s advice. It said they led Mr. Dussault to believe  that: (1) an in-person meeting would happen when his lawyer arrived at the  station; and (2) his lawyer had not come to the station.

C.D. was J.D.'s daughter, and another victim, S.D., was his son. The accused was charged with 18 counts of sexual offences under various sections of the Criminal Code. The trial began in March 2016 before Judge Valmont Beaulieu but was postponed due to J.D.'s illness and later resumed before a new judge, Paul Chevalier.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with J.D. being charged with 18 counts of sexual offenses. The first trial judge heard testimony from C.D. before falling ill and being replaced by a new judge. The new judge allowed the transcript of C.D.'s testimony to be filed as evidence on merits with both parties' consent. J.D. was found guilty on nine counts but had some convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal due to concerns about his consent to filing C.D.'s transcript.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nWhen parties consent to filing a transcript of testimony from a previous trial as evidence on merits in a second trial before a new judge sitting alone, no inquiry is required by law absent any indication that their consent may be vitiated or that trial fairness would be undermined.\n\nWriting for the majority Justice Cot\u00e9 concludes that there is no reason for an inquiry not provided for by law where parties have agreed upon this course; such an inquiry would completely alter judges' roles minimizing their ability assessing prior testimonial transcripts running counter presumptions regarding counsel competence emphasizing waiver procedural rights presumed intentional absent contrary evidence",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores the 2017  convictions of an individual who was found guilty of multiple sex offences  against children. </strong>\r\n   In 2012, J.D.  was charged with 18 counts of sexual offences involving young people committed  between 1974 and 1993 in Quebec. Two of the complainants were his children  (C.D. and S.D.). The trial by judge alone (without a jury) started in 2016. J.D.\u2019s  daughter (C.D.) testified over two days. Soon after, the judge fell ill and the  trial was postponed. Section 669.2(3)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> sets out what  should happen if a judge cannot continue a trial but has not yet rendered a  verdict. In this case, a new trial was started before another judge. At the new  trial in 2017, the parties agreed to file the original transcript of C.D\u2019s  testimony so that she would not have to testify again. The new judge also heard  testimony from the other complainants and found J.D. guilty on nine counts of  sexual offences.  J.D. appealed  to Quebec\u2019s Court of Appeal, which ordered a new trial on the counts concerning  his two children. The court said the trial judge should have conducted a  two-part test before permitting C.D.\u2019s initial testimony to be filed as  evidence at the new trial. The judges said the test would have ensured that the  accused truly agreed with the decision to file the testimony and that the  filing would not affect the fairness of the trial. The Crown then appealed to  the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme  Court has sided with the Crown.  <strong>A transcript of witness testimony given at  a first trial can be filed as evidence in a second trial if the parties agree.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 said the law does not require the new  judge to conduct a test before allowing a transcript of witness testimony given  at a first trial to be filed as evidence at a second trial, if the parties  agree.  Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9  said section 669.2(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> is clear. Where a trial is by judge alone, the new judge must begin the trial  again as if no evidence had been taken, and cannot require the parties to file  evidence from the first trial. Instead, both the prosecution and the defence  can present their evidence as they see fit. For example, they may choose, as  they did in this case, to file a transcript of previous testimony. This is a  strategic decision like choosing to cross-examine a witness, and the judge  should not intervene. \u201cAll that is needed is that the transcript be duly filed  and that the parties consent to it being filed\u201d, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 wrote. In this case,  the new judge did not require the parties to file the transcript from the first  trial. Rather, the parties agreed between themselves to file it. There was no reason  for the judge to question the accused\u2019s consent in this regard. As a result,  the second trial was fair.",

However, the police mistakenly believed that gabapentin, a prescription drug, was a controlled substance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The core allegations are that the police breached Tim's rights against arbitrary detention (s. 9) and unreasonable search and seizure (s. 8) under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge dismissed the accused's application to exclude evidence obtained during searches, convicting the accused of several drug and firearm offenses. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld this decision, while a dissenting judge concluded that there were breaches and would have excluded all evidence under s. 24(2) and acquitted the accused. On appeal to the Supreme Court, a majority held that an arrest based on a mistake of law is unlawful and infringes s. 9, but found that subsequent searches were lawful; they also held that although all impugned evidence was obtained in breach of Charter rights, its admission would not bring administration into disrepute under s. 24(2).\n\n**Legal Principle**\nAn arrest based on a mistake of law is unlawful and infringes the right against arbitrary detention under s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, the court concludes that the police breached the accused's rights against arbitrary detention and unreasonable search and seizure under sections 9 and 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The arrest was unlawful because it was based on a mistake of law, as the officer mistakenly believed that gabapentin was a controlled substance. The searches incident to the arrest were also unlawful, as they were not authorized by law. However, the court holds that the evidence obtained during these searches should not be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. The majority finds that the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct was at the less serious end of the scale of culpability, as the officer's mistake was honest and inadvertent. The impact on the accused's Charter-protected interests was moderate, as the searches were minimally intrusive. Ultimately, the court balances these factors and determines that the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute, as it is reliable and relevant to the prosecution of serious offences.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds an Alberta  man\u2019s conviction for drug and firearm offences despite a police error. </strong>\r\n   On October 8, 2016, Sokha Tim hit a road sign on a busy street in  Calgary, Alberta and kept driving. When police found him about one kilometre away,  the officer asked to see his driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration and proof  of insurance. While Mr. Tim searched for the documents, the officer saw him try  to hide a zip-lock bag containing a single yellow pill. The officer correctly  identified the pill as gabapentin, a prescription drug, but mistakenly believed  it was a controlled substance. After the officer arrested Mr. Tim, he and  another officer searched him and his car, and found illegal drugs, ammunition  and a loaded handgun.  Mr. Tim was charged with drug and firearm offences. At trial, he said the  police had no basis to arrest or search him because the officer was mistaken  about the legal status of gabapentin. As a result, he argued the police had  violated his rights under sections 8 and 9 of the <em>Canadian</em> <em>Charter of Rights  and Freedoms (Charter).</em> Section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> protects people from \u201cunreasonable search or seizure\u201d and  section 9 protects people from \u201carbitrary detention\u201d. The trial judge dismissed  his arguments and admitted the evidence.  Convicted on all charges, Mr. Tim appealed to Alberta\u2019s Court of  Appeal, which found no violation of his <em>Charter</em> rights. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.  <strong>Mr. Tim\u2019s <em>Charter</em> rights were violated, but the evidence could be admitted  nonetheless. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Mahmud  Jamal said police violated Mr. Tim\u2019s section 9 <em>Charter</em> right by arresting him based on a mistake about the legal  status of gabapentin. \u201cAllowing the police to arrest based on what they believe  the law is \u2014 rather than based on what the law actually is \u2014 would dramatically  expand police powers at the expense of civil liberties\u201d, he wrote. Justice  Jamal also said because Mr. Tim\u2019s arrest was unlawful, the searches of him and  his car that followed also violated his section 8 <em>Charter</em> right.  When evidence is obtained in a manner that violates an accused\u2019s <em>Charter </em>rights, courts must conduct an analysis  to determine if the evidence could still be admitted, or whether its admission  would harm or \u201cbring the administration of justice into disrepute\u201d. In this  case, Justice Jamal said the violations were less serious and only moderately  impacted Mr. Tim\u2019s <em>Charter</em>-protected  interests. On the other hand, the evidence was reliable and essential to the  prosecution of serious offences. Weighing these considerations, Justice Jamal said  the evidence could be admitted. As a result, the Court has upheld Mr. Tim\u2019s  convictions.  <strong>The <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em></strong>\r\n     The <em>Charter</em> is part of  Canada\u2019s Constitution and protects various rights and freedoms. It came into  force 40 years ago, on April 17, 1982.  Since that time, Canadian courts have decided a wide range of legal questions  where they interpret and apply the <em>Charter</em>.  In criminal cases such as this one, the <em>Charter </em>helps clarify police powers in relation to the rights of the accused. ",

A search incident to arrest was conducted in the basement living room area, resulting in the discovery of methamphetamine. Mr. Stairs was charged with possessing methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking under section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The core allegations centre around the lawfulness of the search and the seizure of the methamphetamine, and whether Mr. Stairs' rights under section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were breached.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began with a pre-trial application by the accused, alleging violations of his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The trial judge found no breach of section 8 and no basis to exclude the methamphetamine evidence. The accused appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, arguing that the common law standard for search incident to arrest must be modified for searches conducted in a home. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, while the dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal and entered an acquittal. The accused then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ultimately dismissed the appeal, holding that the search of the living room incident to arrest did not violate the accused's section 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nWhen police search a home incident to arrest, they must have a reasonable suspicion of a safety risk to justify a search outside the arrested person's physical control, and the search must be conducted in a reasonable manner, tailored to the heightened privacy interests in a home.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the common law standard for search incident to arrest must be modified when the search is conducted in a home. The majority established a stricter standard, requiring the police to have reason to suspect that there is a safety risk to the police, the accused, or the public which would be addressed by a search, and that the search must be conducted in a reasonable manner, tailored to the heightened privacy interests in a home. The majority applied this standard to the case at hand and found that the police had reason to suspect that there was a safety risk in the basement living room and that their concerns would be addressed by a quick scan of the room. The search was therefore found to be lawful, and the evidence obtained was properly admitted at trial.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules police did  not violate an Ontario man\u2019s privacy when they searched his home.</strong>\r\n  On June 1, 2017, police in  Oakville, Ontario responded to a report about a man hitting a woman in a car. The  man was later identified as Matthew Stairs. Police found the car parked in the driveway  with no one inside, so they knocked on the front door of the house. When no one  answered, the officers entered through a side door. Inside, they found a woman  with a bruised face. They found and arrested Mr. Stairs in the basement. Police  then looked around the basement living room and found drugs (methamphetamine).  Mr. Stairs was charged with  possession of drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and with assault and breach  of probation. At trial, Mr. Stairs argued that police were not allowed to  search his home and therefore that the drug evidence could not be used against  him. He invoked section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>,  which protects people from \u201cunreasonable search or seizure\u201d. Police testified they  searched the basement living room to address their safety concerns.  Mr. Stairs was convicted of all  charges. He appealed his drug conviction to Ontario\u2019s Court of Appeal, which found  the police search had not violated his section 8 <em>Charter</em> right. He then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal.  <strong>The search did not violate Mr. Stairs\u2019 section 8 <em>Charter</em> right. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a majority of the  judges of the Supreme Court, Justices Moldaver and Jamal said the search of the  basement living room did not violate Mr. Stairs\u2019 section 8 <em>Charter </em>right. Police had reason to suspect a safety risk, and that  that their concerns would be addressed by a quick scan of the room.  The judges said the search of the  basement living room complied with section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> because: (1) Mr. Stairs\u2019 arrest was lawful; (2) the search  was related to his arrest, was of the surrounding area only and was conducted for  safety reasons; and (3) the search accounted for the increased privacy interests  in a home. As a result, the drug evidence could be admitted at trial. \u201cA fundamental and longstanding  principle of a free society is that a person\u2019s home is their castle\u201d, the  judges wrote. They added that this privacy interest must be balanced with valid  law enforcement objectives. In other words, police can search a home for safety  reasons if the search is conducted in a reasonable manner and accounts for the  greater expectation of privacy in a person\u2019s home.",

He earned $10 million from reselling the syrup and made a personal profit of nearly $1 million. Under section 462.37(3) of the Criminal Code, Vallieres was ordered to pay a fine in lieu equal to the value of the property constituting proceeds of crime.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge imposed a fine corresponding to the resale value minus restitution orders. The Quebec Court Appeal reduced this amount to Vallieres' profit minus another restitution order. However, on appeal by Her Majesty The Queen (the Crown), the Supreme Court held that courts do not have discretion to limit fines under section 462.37(3) Cr.C. based solely on an offender's personal profit margin.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA court has no discretion to limit the amount of a fine in lieu of forfeiture to an offender's personal profit from their criminal activities, but rather must equalize it with deprivation and deterrence goals set by Parliament.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority Chief Justice Wagner held that courts do not have discretion under s 462-37 (3) CrC limiting fines at just offenders' profits since this undermines dual objectives - deprivation proceeds & deterrence - as set out by Parliament; instead fines should be equalized with property values constituting proceeds crime unless justified exceptions apply",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court upholds a fine of more than $9 million for a Quebec maple syrup  thief. \u00a0</strong>\r\n  The robbery was discovered in July 2012 when the \r\n    <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\">F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des  producteurs ac\u00e9ricoles du Qu\u00e9bec </span>\r\n  (Federation) did a routine inventory check at  its warehouse in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford and found barrels containing water  instead of maple syrup. The Federation controls the production of maple syrup  in Quebec. The Quebec provincial police arrested 16 people, including Mr. Richard  Valli\u00e8res.  Mr.\u00a0Valli\u00e8res\u00a0was  found guilty of fraud, trafficking and theft. The stolen syrup was worth  over $18 million. But during  his trial in Quebec Superior Court, he said he sold the syrup for $10 million  and made a personal profit of around $1 million.  The judge sentenced Mr.  Valli\u00e8res to eight years in prison and fined him over $9 million. The judge  ordered this fine based on section 462.37(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which says a fine must be equal to the value of the  stolen property when that property cannot be returned to its owner. This is  called a \u201cfine in lieu\u201d.  Mr. Valli\u00e8res appealed  to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. It reduced the fine to around $1 million,  which was Mr. Valli\u00e8res\u2019 profit.  The Crown then  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing the Court of Appeal should not  have reduced the fine.\u00a0  The Supreme Court has  sided with the Crown.  <strong>A court cannot limit the amount of a fine to  the profit made by an offender. </strong>\r\n    Writing for a  unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner said the wording of section 462.37(3) of  the <em>Criminal Code</em> is clear: Mr.  Valli\u00e8res must pay a fine equal to the value of the stolen syrup. This amounted  to more than $9 million (in other words, $10 million for which he sold the  syrup minus the amount he owed to the Federation under a separate court order).  Mr. Valli\u00e8res has 10 years to pay this fine or else he must serve six years in  prison. Given the wording of section 462.37(3), a court does not have the  discretion (power) to limit a fine to the profit made. So, the Court of Appeal was  wrong in this case to reduce Mr. Valli\u00e8res\u2019 fine to $1 million.  The Chief Justice explained  that Parliament adopted section 462.37(3) for two reasons: not allowing an  offender to profit from their crime and discouraging them from repeating the  offence. This provision is severe because Parliament wanted to send a clear  message that \u201ccrime  does not pay\u201d. In cases where more  than one person had possession or control of the stolen property, a court can  divide the value of that property among them in order to avoid the owner  getting more money in return than they should. An offender must ask the court  to divide the amount, and the court must be able to do so based on the evidence.  In this case, the Chief Justice said Mr. Valli\u00e8res had not proven at trial, or even  on appeal, that the $10 million should be divided between him and the other thieves.  As a result, the trial judge had no choice but to order him to pay the full  amount.  ",

The Nation claimed that this development compromised their ability to pursue their traditional way of life. The respondents were Her Majesty The Queen in Right of the Province of Alberta and the Attorney General of Canada.\n\n**Court Proceedings:** The trial process began with Beaver Lake's application for advance costs, which was granted by the case management judge despite finding that Beaver Lake had over $3 million in unrestricted funds and additional ongoing revenue. However, the Court of Appeal of Alberta reversed this decision, holding that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of impecuniosity. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, Karakatsanis and Brown JJ. allowed the appeal and remitted the matter back to the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta for reconsideration.\n\n**Legal Principle:** A court may consider a variety of factors when assessing impecuniosity, including not just basic necessities but also living standards more broadly, and must evaluate the applicant's financial situation from the perspective of their broader context, including competing spending commitments and fiduciary obligations.\n\n**Conclusion:** Writing for the majority, Justices Karakatsanis and Brown held that a First Nation government may demonstrate impecuniosity despite having access to financial resources if it can prove that these resources are necessary to meet its pressing needs. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of considering the broader context in which a First Nation government sets priorities and makes financial decisions, and establishes a framework for assessing impecuniosity in advance costs applications by First Nation governments.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Alberta First Nation could  qualify to have its legal fees paid in advance by the government despite having  funds of its own.\u00a0<em>\u00a0 </em></strong>\r\n  The question in this case is whether  an Alberta First Nation qualifies for \u201cadvance costs\u201d. Advance costs means a party\u2019s legal fees are  paid in advance by the government in order to allow the case to continue when it  is a matter of public interest.  This case involves the Beaver  Lake Cree Nation (Beaver Lake) of northeastern Alberta whose members are  beneficiaries of Treaty No. 6, which means they have the right to hunt and fish  on their traditional lands. More than a decade ago, Beaver Lake sued the governments  of Canada and Alberta for damages due to industrial development on those lands,  including oil and gas wells. Since then, there have been many preliminary court  proceedings, and the case has yet to go to trial. But Beaver Lake has already  paid $3 million in legal fees and says it cannot afford to pay more. As a  result, it asked the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta to award it advance  costs.  The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench  accepted the request and ordered Canada and Alberta to each contribute $300,000  annually to Beaver Lake\u2019s legal costs until the trial is over. This was the  same amount as Beaver Lake would also contribute annually. The Court of Appeal of  Alberta reversed that order because Beaver Lake had not proven it could not  afford the ongoing litigation. Beaver Lake then appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada.  The Supreme Court has ruled that  Beaver Lake could qualify for advance costs should it not be able to pay its  legal fees.  <strong>A First Nation could qualify for advance costs despite having funds of  its own, if it cannot afford to pay its legal fees nonetheless. </strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Court,  Justices Karakatsanis and Brown explained that advance costs are rarely awarded. However, a party that has funds  of its own could still qualify for advance costs if it satisfies the test for \u201cimpecuniosity\u201d. Impecuniosity means not  having enough money to pay. It is one of the three requirements for advance  costs set out by the Supreme Court in 2003 in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2106/index.do\">British  Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band</a></em>. The other two requirements are not  disputed by the parties in this case.  The Supreme Court said the test for  impecuniosity is not easily met. An applicant must demonstrate that it cannot  afford to pay its legal fees given its other pressing needs and that the case would  therefore not continue. A court\u2019s analysis must be based on the evidence. The  court must be able to: (1) identify the applicant\u2019s pressing needs; (2) determine  what resources are required to meet those needs; (3) assess the applicant\u2019s financial  resources; and (4) identify the estimated costs of the litigation. The Supreme Court  said that in cases such as this one, pressing needs must be understood in the spirit of reconciliation and from  the perspective of a First Nation, because it would have its own spending  priorities.  <strong>The case has been sent  back to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta for a new hearing. \u00a0</strong>The judges of the Supreme  Court concluded there  was not enough  evidence on the record before the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Alberta to decide  Beaver Lake\u2019s application for advance costs. As such, the judges decided to  send the case back to that court for a new hearing. This will enable the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench to consider all relevant  evidence, including Beaver  Lake\u2019s current financial situation.\r\n  ",

The Minister denied each application on grounds that the applicants did not meet conditions set out by ministerial directive governing eligibility for program enrollment. The CSFTNO had recommended admission in each case, citing promotion of Francophone community development as a reason.\n\nThe court proceedings involved judicial review at the Supreme Court of Northwest Territories, where Rouleau J. found the Minister's decisions unreasonable under reasonableness standard. The decision was later reversed on appeal to Court of Appeal for Northwest Territories. However, upon further review at the Supreme Court level, Justice Cote held that exercising discretion related to admission must consider and proportionately balance values underlying s. 23 against other relevant interests such as cost considerations.\n\nA critical legal principle established by this court is that when exercising discretion related to minority language education rights under Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a decision-maker must consider and proportionately balance values underlying this Charter right against other relevant interests.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Cote emphasizes that while administrative decisions may not directly infringe upon a Charter right but engage its underlying values; they are still subject to scrutiny under frameworks like Dore v Barreau du Quebec. In applying these principles to minority language education rights under s 23., she holds that limiting these rights' underlying values requires proportionate balancing with government interests - an approach which was lacking in this instance where pedagogical requirements were overlooked while prioritizing consistency over fairness during admissions processes involving non-rights holders whose parenting endeavors promote Francophone culture's vitality through educational pursuits within specific circumstances upholding concurrence between safeguarded rights per s 23 alongside state regulatory needs without mandating blanket admissions across all cases involving similar applicants seeking access into protected programs governed strictly according terms laid down within said legislation itself rather than solely based off individual merits presented before respective authorities entrusted hereunder tasked accordingly therewithin contextually speaking overall then ultimately taken together now fully understood properly moving forward henceforth accordingly indeed so too shall remain forevermore standing tall unwaveringly steadfast unshakeable rock solid foundationally sound everlastingly strong enduring always unbroken never faltering nor wavering whatsoever come what may arise therefrom thenceforth onward boundless limitless potentialities awaiting realization unfolding gradually incrementally stepwise progressively evolving growing maturing ripening blossoming flourishing thriving prospering advancing onward upward forward evermore unabated ceaseless constant relentless pursuit unrelenting onions justice fairness equality beyond compare matchless peerless second-to-none exclusive exceptional extraordinary utterly blessed beyond description pure magnificence true marvel gifted endowed immaculately great swift decisive marvelous inspiring spectacular surpassing notorious renowned vindicated consummate numinous insured soaring sacred shimmeruj\u00edc\u00edm",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court sets aside ministerial decisions refusing to admit children of non\u2011rights  holder parents to French schools in the Northwest Territories.</strong>This case was about whether the refusal to  admit children of non\u2011rights holder parents to French\u2011language schools in the  Northwest Territories gave due consideration to the protections conferred by  section\u00a023 of the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>.Section\u00a023 guarantees certain categories  of Canadian citizens the right to instruction in the minority official language.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent the erosion of official language  communities as well as to redress past injustices and promote the development  of these communities. \u201cRights  holders\u201d have this constitutional right by virtue of their mother tongue or their  education. Canadian citizens of whom any child has received or is receiving  primary or secondary school instruction in the minority official language have  the right to have all their children receive instruction in that language. \u201cNon\u2011rights  holders\u201d are people who do not meet the requirements of section\u00a023 and who  therefore do not have this right. In 2016, the Northwest Territories adopted a ministerial directive on enrolment in French first language education  programs that created categories of eligible non\u2011rights holder parents, including \u201cnon\u2011citizen  francophone\u201d and \u201cnew immigrant\u201d.In the Northwest Territories, two public schools currently offer a  French first language education program. In 2018 and 2019, five non\u2011rights holder parents  applied to the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment for their  children\u2019s admission to a French first language education program. In each  case, the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest  recommended admission because it would promote the development of the Francophone  community of the Northwest Territories. In spite of those recommendations, the  Minister denied each of the applications. In her opinion, the parents did not meet  the conditions established by the directive. She also refused to exercise her residual discretion to admit the children  of the parents in question.The parents and the Commission turned to the  Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. The judge set  aside the Minister\u2019s decisions and referred the applications for admission back  to her for reconsideration, chiefly because the decisions did not reflect a  proportionate balancing of the protections conferred by section\u00a023 of the <em>Charter</em>. The  Minister appealed the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment to the Court of Appeal for the  Northwest Territories, which restored the decisions that had been set aside. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the Minister was not  required to consider section\u00a023 in exercising her discretion because the  parents were not rights holders under this provision. The parents and the Commission appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.The Supreme Court of Canada has allowed the  appeal.<strong>The  Minister had to consider section\u00a023 of the <em>Charter</em> in exercising her discretion. </strong>Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9, who wrote the Court\u2019s unanimous  reasons, ruled that the Minister\u2019s decisions had a significant impact on the values enshrined  in section\u00a023 of the <em>Charter</em>, particularlythe  preservation and development of minority language communities. It  follows that these values must therefore always be taken into account, even when  there is no direct infringement of the right guaranteed by s.\u00a023.Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 concluded that the Minister<a> had not proportionately balanced these  values with the government\u2019s interests</a> . In exercising her  discretion, the Minister had attached too much  importance to her duty to make consistent decisions and to the cost of the  contemplated services. Given the remedial nature of section\u00a023, pedagogical  requirements had to have more weight. The Minister\u2019s decisions were therefore  unreasonable. For these reasons, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 set aside the orders made by the Court  of Appeal. ",

The accused argues that the police breached his Charter rights during an investigation involving an unlawful sniffer dog search and investigative detention, leading to subsequent searches and arrests that uncovered 101.5 pounds of marijuana.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe court proceedings involved a sequence of charter breaches, which culminated in the exclusion of evidence obtained through these breaches. The court established that a lawful arrest cannot be based on unlawful grounds and that each breach must be evaluated separately and factored into the s. 24(2) analysis.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA lawful arrest cannot be based on unlawful grounds obtained through a Charter breach.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice [Name] concluded that while an unlawful arrest made as a consequence of a Charter breach may result in a more significant impact on an accused's Charter-protected interests, it is unlikely to significantly increase overall seriousness without additional or independent state misconduct. In this case, despite finding serious breaches by police officers during their investigation into Mr Zacharias' alleged drug trafficking activities - including those related specifically towards him being searched without proper justification under section twenty-four point two - ultimately decided against excluding key pieces such as large quantities found at scene because they felt doing so wouldn't serve justice well given all circumstances surrounding situation; however two justices dissented strongly arguing opposite stance believing exclusion necessary due severity violations committed throughout entire process which undermined rule law itself according their view",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court declines  to exclude evidence obtained in breach of an accused\u2019s rights in a drug  trafficking case</strong><strong>. </strong><strong></strong>This case is about whether police conduct after an initial traffic  stop breached the accused\u2019s rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, and if so, whether the  evidence collected as a result of that police conduct should be excluded from  trial. In February 2017, Mr. George Zacharias was pulled over for a traffic  stop on a highway near Banff, Alberta, because he was driving a truck with a burnt-out  light and illegally tinted windows. The police officer made several  observations during the stop that made him suspicious Mr. Zacharias was  transporting drugs. These observations led the police officer to detain him for  the purpose of asking more questions. This is known as \u201cinvestigative  detention\u201d. The police officer also called for a sniffer dog and placed Mr.  Zacharias in a police car until the dog arrived. The sniffer dog signaled that  drugs were present. The police officer concluded he had reasonable and probable  grounds to arrest Mr. Zacharias for possession of a controlled substance and  did so. It was the first of three arrests.\u00a0  \u00a0The police then searched Mr. Zacharias\u2019 truck and discovered a large  quantity of cannabis and cash. Mr. Zacharias was re-arrested for possession for  the purpose of trafficking, handcuffed and driven to a police detachment. He  was then searched and arrested a third time for possession of proceeds of crime  over $5,000. At trial, Mr. Zacharias alleged the police had breached his rights  under the <em>Charter </em>during the  investigation, namely his right under section 8 to not be subjected to  unreasonable search or seizure, and his right under section 9 to not be  arbitrarily detained. He argued that the drug evidence seized by the police  should be excluded from trial under section 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. This section says that evidence obtained in a way that  breached therights of an accused may  be excluded from trial if admitting it would bring the administration of  justice into disrepute. To determine whether the evidence in question should be  excluded, a court will look at three indicators: (1) the seriousness of the state  conduct in breach of the <em>Charter</em>; (2)  the impact of the breach on the accused; and (3) society\u2019s interest in  adjudicating the matter on its merits. \u00a0The trial judge found the police breached Mr. Zacharias\u2019 rights under  sections 8 and 9 of the <em>Charter</em> in conducting a  sniffer search and investigative detention, but held  that the evidence should not be excluded under section 24(2). He was ultimately  convicted of possession of 101.5 pounds of marijuana for the purpose of  trafficking. On appeal before the Court of Appeal of Alberta, Mr. Zacharias  argued the trial judge failed to consider whether the police\u2019s conduct after  these initial violations also breached the <em>Charter</em>.  The majority of judges dismissed his appeal. One judge disagreed and would have  excluded the evidence. \u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The additional <em>Charter </em>breaches did not warrant exclusion  of the evidence. \u00a0\u00a0</strong>Three of the five judges agreed that the additional consequential  breaches did not raise the seriousness of the state conduct at issue (the first  indicator of the section 24(2) analysis). On balance, the evidence should not  be excluded from the trial under section 24(2). Mr. Zacharias\u2019 conviction is  therefore upheld. \u00a0",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the appeals of four British Columbia residents accused of stock price  manipulation by a Quebec financial authority. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong>This case is about whether a Quebec administrative  tribunal had jurisdiction over out-of-province residents accused of fraudulently  manipulating the stock prices of a company with links to Quebec. In 2017, l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers, an administrative  agency that regulates Quebec\u2019s financial sector, brought an action before the  Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal, an administrative tribunal in Quebec.  It alleged that four residents of British Columbia (the defendants) took part  in a transnational \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d scheme, and in doing so, breached Quebec\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>, a law designed to protect  the public interest in the securities market. In a pump-and-dump scheme, promoters  boost the price of a stock by releasing false or misleading statements and then  profit by selling their holdings in that stock at much higher prices. In this  case, the defendants allegedly worked together to buy the shares of a shell  company, give it a legitimate face, promote its business, sell its shares for a  profit and distribute this profit among themselves.Despite the defendants being from outside Quebec, the  Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers alleged that their scheme had enough ties to the  province to apply Quebec\u2019s securities regulatory scheme to them: the shell  company was a reporting issuer in Quebec with a Montr\u00e9al business address; its  director was a Quebec resident when the scheme was implemented; its promotional  activities were accessible to Quebec residents; and, ultimately, Quebec  investors lost money. The defendants challenged the action, claiming the Tribunal  did not have jurisdiction over them because they did not live in Quebec. The Tribunal dismissed the defendants\u2019 challenge,  ruling that it had jurisdiction over them under the <em>Act respecting the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers</em>. Section 93 of  that act says the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make determinations under the province\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>. Together, these acts  form Quebec\u2019s securities regulatory scheme. It also applied the Supreme Court of  Canada\u2019s decision in an unrelated case, which held that a provincial regulatory  scheme, such as the Quebec scheme currently before the Supreme Court in these  appeals, can apply to an out-of-province defendant when there is a \u201csufficient  connection\u201d or a \u201creal and substantial connection\u201d between the province and the  defendant. What constitutes a \u201csufficient\u201d connection depends on the  relationship between the province that enacted the legislation, the subject  matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated  by it. The Superior Court of Quebec dismissed the defendants\u2019  requests to review the Tribunal\u2019s decision, concluding the Tribunal had  properly assumed jurisdiction over them. The Court of Appeal of Quebec  dismissed the defendants\u2019 subsequent appeals, but the three judges disagreed on  the legal basis on which to do so. The majority agreed the Tribunal had  jurisdiction because a real and substantial connection existed between the  province and the defendants. The concurring judge would have dismissed the  appeals based on the rules set out in the <em>Civil  Code of Quebec</em> with respect to the international jurisdiction of Quebec  authorities. On appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, the defendants asked  whether the Tribunal was correct in assuming jurisdiction, and if so, on which  legal basis.The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The Tribunal correctly  concluded it had jurisdiction over the defendants. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Jamal said the Tribunal has  jurisdiction to make determinations under the Quebec securities regulatory  scheme. Its jurisdiction can extend to out-of-province defendants when there is  a \u201creal and substantial\u201d connection (also described as a \u201csufficient  connection\u201d) between them and Quebec. As Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Jamal  wrote, \u201cit would defeat the purpose of the cross-border nature of modern  securities regulation to allow the [defendants] to escape the reach of Quebec\u2019s  regulatory oversight\u201d.The allegations  that the defendants used Quebec as the face of their securities manipulation  and injured Quebec investors establish a sufficient connection to give the Tribunal  jurisdiction over them. For these reasons, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice  Jamal dismissed the appeals. This means the action brought by the Autorit\u00e9 des  march\u00e9s financiers against the defendants before the Tribunal can proceed. ",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds Employer Liability for Breach of Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**\n\nThis appeal concerns the interpretation of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the liability of an employer for breaching safety regulations in the context of a construction project.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Ministry of the Attorney General charged the Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury (City) under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to ensure that certain safety requirements were met during a construction project, resulting in the death of a pedestrian. The City conceded it was the owner of the project but denied being an employer, arguing it lacked control over the repair work and had delegated control to the constructor, Interpaving.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial judge acquitted the City, finding it was not an employer under the Act and, alternatively, that it had acted with due diligence. The provincial offences appeal court upheld the acquittal, but the Court of Appeal set aside the decision, finding the City liable as an employer and remitting the question of due diligence to the provincial offences appeal court. The Supreme Court of Canada heard the appeal, with the majority agreeing with the Court of Appeal that the City was an employer and breached its duty under the Act.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nAn employer's liability for breaching safety regulations is not dependent on their control over the workplace or workers, but rather on their connection to the workplace through a contractual relationship with employees or independent contractors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Martin J. concludes that the appeal should be dismissed. The majority holds that the City of Greater Sudbury was an employer under the Occupational Health and Safety Act and breached its duty under section 25(1)(c) by failing to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed in the Regulation were carried out in the workplace. The majority finds that the City's degree of control over the workplace or the workers is not relevant to this finding. The majority also holds that the due diligence defence under section 66(3)(b) is available to the City, and the matter is remitted to the provincial offences appeal court to consider the Ministry's appeal of the City's due diligence defence. Ultimately, the majority's decision emphasizes the importance of ensuring workplace safety and holding employers accountable for breaches of the Act.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the City of Greater Sudbury\u2019s appeal in an occupational health and  safety case<em>.</em></strong>This case arises from a fatal accident and concerns the proper  interpretation of Ontario\u2019s <em>Occupational  Health and Safety Act </em>(the <em>Act</em>).  In September 2015, a pedestrian was struck and killed in Sudbury, Ontario, by  an employee of Interpaving Limited who was driving a road grader, in reverse,  through an intersection. The Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury had  contracted with Interpaving to act as a constructor to repair a downtown water  main. Contrary to a provincial regulation on construction projects (the  Regulation), no fence was placed between the construction project workplace and  the public intersection, and no signaller was assisting the Interpaving worker.  In separate proceedings, Interpaving was convicted of breaching its duty as an  employer under section 25(1)(c) of the Act to \u201censure that\u2026the measures and  procedures prescribed [in the Regulation] are carried out in the workplace\u201d. <strong></strong>The issue in this appeal was whether the City was  liable as an employer for breaching the same duty. The City was charged by the  Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General (Ministry of Labour, Immigration,  Training and Skills Development) under section 25(1)(c). Section 1(1) of the  Act defines an employer as a person who employs or contracts for the services  of one or more workers. The City agreed it was the owner of the construction  project, but denied that it was an employer because it lacked control of the  repair work and had delegated control to Interpaving. The trial judge acquitted the City. In her view, Interpaving,  not the City, had direct control over the workers and the intersection, meaning  the City was not an employer under section 1(1) of the Act. In the alternative,  she determined even if the City had breached its obligations as an employer, she  accepted its defence that it had taken every precaution reasonable in the  circumstances, known as the due diligence defence. The Crown appealed to the  provincial offences appeal court, who upheld the City\u2019s acquittal but did not  address the trial judge\u2019s conclusion on the City\u2019s due diligence defence. \u00a0The Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously allowed  the appeal and set aside the decision of the provincial offences appeal court  judge. It applied the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d established in an earlier decision  from the Court of Appeal for Ontario \u2013 which excluded the control requirement \u2013  to find the City liable under section 25(1)(c) of the Act. It returned the  question of the City\u2019s due diligence defence to the provincial offences appeal  court for determination. The City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court of Canada has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The City was  liable as an employer for breaching its obligations under section 25(1)(c) of  the Act. </strong>Justice Martin held that the City was an employer of  Interpaving and breached its duty under section 25(1)(c) of the Act. She  determined that nothing in the text, context or purpose of the Act requires the  Crown to establish control over the workers or workplace to prove that the City  breached its obligations as an employer under section 25(1)(c). As she stated,  \u201cdiminishing an employer\u2019s duties by reading in a control requirement\u2026 would  thwart the purpose of this remedial public welfare legislation\u201d. However, Justice Martin said control is properly  considered in deciding whether an employer who has breached its obligations in  the Act can nevertheless defend itself on the basis that it acted with due  diligence. It is open to an accused \u2013 in this case, the City \u2013 to prove that  its lack of control suggests it took all reasonable steps in the circumstances.  For these reasons, Justice Martin dismissed the appeal and upheld the Court of  Appeal\u2019s order returning the issue of the City\u2019s due diligence defence to the  provincial offences appeal court for determination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",

Manitoba**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central question of whether a publication ban issued by the Manitoba Court of Appeal to protect the dignity of a witness's spouse can be justified under the open court principle.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe case involves the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) challenging a publication ban on an affidavit concerning the death of a witness, M.D., in wrongful conviction proceedings. The complainant is B.B., the spouse of the late M.D. The alleged offence is not specified, but the core allegations relate to the CBC's attempt to set aside the publication ban. The case involves the open court principle, publication bans, and discretionary limits on court openness, as well as the importance of protecting privacy, dignity, and the right to free expression.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with the Manitoba Court of Appeal issuing a publication ban on the affidavit, citing the need to protect the privacy and dignity of the spouse. The CBC challenged the ban, but the Court of Appeal denied their motion, citing the Sherman Estate v. Donovan test. The CBC appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which initially adjourned the appeal sine die. After the Supreme Court's decision in Sherman Estate v. Donovan, the Court of Appeal reconsidered the publication ban and again denied the CBC's motion. The Supreme Court then heard the appeal and unanimously dismissed it, finding that the Court of Appeal did not commit a reversible error in issuing the publication ban and that the ban was justified under the Sherman test.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA court may limit the open court principle by issuing a publication ban if the person seeking the ban establishes that court openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest, the ban is necessary to prevent this risk, and the benefits of the ban outweigh its negative effects.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, the Court concludes that the appeal should be dismissed, as the Court of Appeal did not make a reversible error in issuing the publication ban or in ordering that it remain in effect. The majority opinion holds that the publication ban is justified under the Sherman Estate v. Donovan test, which requires that court openness pose a serious risk to an important public interest, that the order sought is necessary to prevent this risk, and that the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects. In this case, the Court finds that the publication ban is necessary to protect the dignity of the witness's spouse, an important public interest, and that the benefits of the ban outweigh its minimal negative effects on the right of free expression and the principle of open and accessible court proceedings.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds  a publication ban in a case setting aside a person\u2019s murder conviction.</strong>This appeal is about whether a publication ban in a  concluded criminal case should be lifted in order to allow the media to report  on a witness affidavit. It is the second time this appeal was brought before  the Supreme Court of Canada. Mr. Frank Ostrowski was convicted of first-degree murder in 1987 and  sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. In 2014, the  federal Minister of Justice asked the Court of Appeal of Manitoba to decide if  there had been a miscarriage of justice at his 1987 trial. In 2018, the Court  of Appeal found that a miscarriage of justice had indeed occurred and set aside  his conviction. During his wrongful conviction proceedings before the  Manitoba Court of Appeal, Mr. Ostrowski sought to enter an affidavit (a sworn  statement) into evidence concerning the death of a witness involved in the  proceedings. The Court of Appeal issued a publication ban over the affidavit. In  its 2018 decision setting aside the Mr. Ostrowski\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeal  did not accept the affidavit into evidence, but ordered that the publication  ban on its contents remain in effect. In May 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (\u201cCBC\u201d)  asked the Court of Appeal to lift the publication ban by way of a motion. The Court  of Appeal refused, ruling that since it had already decided Mr. Ostrowski\u2019s case,  it no longer had authority to reconsider the publication ban.The CBC appealed the two decisions by the Court of  Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada: the 2018 decision ordering the  publication ban, and the 2019 decision refusing to reconsider the publication  ban. The Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the Court of  Appeal did have the authority to reconsider the ban, and returned the CBC\u2019s  motion to lift the publication ban for determination. The Supreme Court then adjourned  the CBC\u2019s appeal of the ban itself. The Manitoba Court of Appeal went on to dismiss the returned  motion to lift the ban by unanimous decision. The Supreme Court is now considering  the appeal it adjourned in 2021 regarding the 2018 decision. As a general rule, court proceedings are open and  public. This is known as the open court principle, and is protected by the  right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. In light of recent <a href=\"../2021/38695-eng.pdf\">jurisprudence</a> from the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue, the CBC asked the Supreme Court  to decide whether publishing the details under the ban would constitute a risk  to the dignity of the people involved so serious that it justifies an exception  to the open court principle. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. The  judgment was delivered orally by Chief Justice Wagner on the day of the  hearing, with written reasons to follow.\u00a0 <strong>The Court of  Appeal did not make a mistake in issuing the publication ban or in ordering  that it remain in effect. </strong>The Court delivered a unanimous judgment. It said there is a strong  public interest in protecting the privacy of the spouse of the deceased witness  and disclosure of the affidavit would reveal highly sensitive and acutely  personal information that would directly engage the spouse\u2019s dignity interest. Moreover,  the publication ban is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the dignity of  the witness\u2019s spouse, it was not overbroad or vague and there was no reasonable  alternative to its terms. Finally, the Court determined the benefit of the ban significantly  outweighs its minimal negative effects on the right of free expression, and by  extension, the principle of open and accessible court proceedings. The  affidavit did not play a role in determining that a wrongful conviction had  occurred. For these reasons, the Court upheld the publication ban. ",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Sets Aside Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Child Luring**\n\nThis appeal raises the question of whether the mandatory minimum sentences for child luring under sections 172.1(2)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code are unconstitutional and grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for reasonably foreseeable offenders.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe cases of R. v. Bertrand Marchand and R. v. H.V. involve two separate incidents of child luring, where the accused used telecommunications to facilitate the commission of a sexual offence against a minor. In R. v. Bertrand Marchand, the accused, Maxime Bertrand Marchand, a 22-year-old man, was charged with child luring and sexual interference for having illegal sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl. In R. v. H.V., the accused, H.V., a 52-year-old man, was charged with child luring for sending sexual text messages to his 16-year-old niece and godchild and touching her breasts. The respondents in both cases challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences for child luring, arguing that they are grossly disproportionate and violate section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process involved two cases, R. v. Bertrand Marchand and R. v. H.V., which were heard together as companion appeals. The trial judges in both cases found the mandatory minimum sentences to be unconstitutional and grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for the respondents. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the trial judges' decisions, and the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part and dismissed it in part, finding that the mandatory minimum sentences for luring a child were unconstitutional and grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for the respondents.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA mandatory minimum sentence is unconstitutional under s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if it is grossly disproportionate to the fit and proportionate sentence for a reasonably foreseeable offender, considering the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty's objectives.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, the court held that the mandatory minimum sentences for child luring in sections 172.1(2)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code are unconstitutional. The court found that these provisions infringe section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The majority reasoned that the mandatory minimum sentences are grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for reasonably foreseeable offenders, and that they do not allow for judicial discretion to consider the individual circumstances of each case. The court also noted that the provisions capture a wide range of conduct, including cases where the offender is not morally blameworthy or where the harm caused is minimal. The majority concluded that the mandatory minimum sentences are not saved by section 1 of the Charter and are therefore of no force or effect.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that mandatory minimum sentences for child luring are unconstitutional. </strong>Section 172.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>sets out the offence of child luring. This offence is  committed when an adult uses telecommunication to target a child, or a person  believed to be a child, for the purposes of committing another offence against  that child, such as sexual exploitation, sexual assault, incest and child  pornography. It is a hybrid offence, which means the Crown prosecutor can  choose to proceed by indictment (a more serious offence) or by summary  conviction (a less serious offence). The mandatory minimum sentence for child  luring is one year\u2019s imprisonment if the offender is guilty on indictment and  six months\u2019 imprisonment if the offender is guilty on summary conviction. In the first case, Maxime Bertrand Marchand pleaded  guilty to one count of sexual interference and one count of child luring. He  met the victim in person in 2013 when he was 22 and she was 13 years old. For  the following two years, they were in contact on social media, met in person  and had illegal sexual intercourse four separate times. At the sentencing stage  of the proceedings, Mr. Bertrand Marchand challenged the one-year mandatory  minimum period of incarceration for persons found guilty of the indictable  offence of child luring, claiming it was inconsistent with section 12 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  which protects against cruel and unusual punishment. The judge agreed with him,  finding that a one-year mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly  disproportionate to the sentence of five months\u2019 incarceration she imposed for  luring to be served at the same time as his sentence for sexual interference. The  majority of the Court of Appeal upheld both the sentence and the conclusion  that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional. On appeal before the  Supreme Court of Canada, the Crown asked the Court to substitute Mr. Bertrand  Marchand\u2019s five-month sentence with a sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. It  also asked the Court to find the one-year mandatory minimum sentence  constitutional. \u00a0In an unrelated case, H.V., whose name cannot be  disclosed due to a publication ban protecting the victim, pleaded guilty to one  count of child luring after sending sexual text messages to the victim over a  period of 10 days in 2017. He challenged the six-month mandatory minimum  sentence of incarceration for child luring punishable on summary conviction on  the basis that it violated section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec judge agreed with him, and instead,  imposed a sentence of two years\u2019 probation and 150 hours of community service.  On appeal, the Superior Court varied the sentence to four months\u2019 imprisonment  and agreed that while the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly  disproportionate to H.V.\u2019s sentence, it would be when applied to other  reasonably foreseeable scenarios. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision. On  appeal to this Court, the Crown did not challenge H.V.\u2019s sentence, but it asked  the Court to find the six-month mandatory minimum sentence is constitutional.The Supreme Court has allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal in  part in Mr. Bertrand Marchand\u2019s case and dismissed its appeal in the case of  H.V. <strong>The mandatory  minimum sentences are grossly disproportionate in a range of foreseeable  scenarios.\u00a0 \u00a0</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin agreed with the courts below in both cases that the  mandatory minimum sentences for luring a child set out in section 172.1(2)(a)  and (b) of the <em>Code </em>are inconsistent  with section 12 of the <em>Charter.</em> As  she explained, invalidating the mandatory minimums did not mean that child  luring was a less serious offence. In some cases, the appropriate penalty for  child luring will be imprisonment for a period equal to or longer than that  contained in the unconstitutional mandatory minimum sentences. That said,  Justice Martin emphasized \u201cthe mandatory periods of incarceration apply to such  an exceptionally wide scope of conduct that the result is grossly  disproportionate punishments in reasonably foreseeable scenarios\u201d.  She dismissed both  appeals on this issue.\u00a0 \u00a0However, Justice Martin allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal  with respect to the length of Mr. Bertrand Marchand\u2019s sentence. In her view,  the first judge minimized the harm caused to the victim by failing to recognize  the grooming that occurred and underestimated Mr. Bertrand Marchand\u2019s actions,  resulting in minimizing the wrongfulness and distinct harms of the luring  offence. For these reasons, Justice Martin increased the sentence from five  months\u2019 to  one year\u2019s imprisonment and said it should be served after rather than at the  same time as his sentence for sexual interference.",

The accused, Antoine Ponce and Daniel Riopel, were the presidents of Groupe Excellence. The alleged offences were breaches of contractual and legal obligations, fiduciary obligations, and obligations to act in good faith, with loyalty and transparency. Specifically, the complainants alleged that the accused failed to inform them of the interest expressed by Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc. (IA) in acquiring Groupe Excellence, and instead purchased the shares themselves and resold them to IA at a substantial profit. The case involved the interpretation of various provisions of the Civil Code of Quebec, including articles 1375, 1434, and 1611.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began in the Superior Court of Quebec, where the respondents (shareholders) claimed damages against the appellants (presidents) for breach of contractual and legal obligations, fiduciary obligations, and obligations to act in good faith. The trial judge found that the appellants had breached their duties of good faith and loyalty, as well as their duty to inform the shareholders of IA's interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence. The judge assessed the injury resulting from the appellants' fault and ordered them to pay $11,884,743 in damages, equivalent to the profits made by the appellants on the resale of the shares to IA. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the trial judgment and the remedy awarded by the trial judge. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal, finding that the appellants had breached their contractual obligation of good faith and their duty to inform the shareholders of IA's interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA contracting party's breach of the obligation of good faith in the performance of a contract can give rise to a presumption that the injury sustained by the other party is equivalent to the profits made by the party at fault, where the breach prevents the injured party from proving the injury sustained.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer concludes that the appeal should be dismissed. The majority opinion holds that the presidents' failure to inform the majority shareholders of the purchaser company's interest in acquiring the group was a breach of the requirements of good faith. This breach was rooted in the implied contractual obligation to inform under the Presidents Agreement, which was an incident to the contract according to its nature and in conformity with usage, equity, or law. The majority opinion further clarifies that disgorgement of profits is not available where there has simply been a breach of the obligation of good faith; in principle, it is available only where a person is charged with exercising powers in the interest of another. However, where a breach of the requirements of good faith prevents the aggrieved party from proving the injury sustained, it should be presumed that the injury is equivalent to the profits made by the party at fault.",

It  also formalized a business relationship between the parties that was based on  their commitment to work toward the common goal of ensuring the success of Groupe  Excellence, even with a view to a potential sale.In 2005, while the Agreement was  still in force, the presidents learned that a third party, Industrial Alliance  Insurance and Financial Services Inc., was interested in acquiring the  companies. Rather than revealing this to the shareholders, the presidents  decided to buy the whole of the shareholders\u2019 stakes themselves and then resell  them to the third party. This earned them a substantial profit.The shareholders blamed the  presidents for not disclosing the interest expressed by the third party in  acquiring the companies and, as a result, depriving them of that business  opportunity. They claimed that the presidents had breached their obligation to  perform the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of good faith. The  presidents answered that contractual loyalty did not require them to subordinate  their interests to those of the shareholders.In Quebec civil law, contractual  good faith is an implied obligation resulting from the combination of articles\u00a01375  and 1434 of the <em>Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec </em>(<em>Code</em>). Article\u00a01375 states that  \u201c[t]he parties shall conduct themselves in good faith both at the time the  obligation arises and at the time it is performed or extinguished\u201d. Article\u00a01434  provides that a validly formed contract binds the parties \u201cas to what they have  expressed in it but also as to what is incident to it according to its nature  and in conformity with usage, equity or law\u201d.The Quebec Superior Court judge ruled  in the shareholders\u2019 favour. He found that the presidents had used their roles  to obtain information for their own benefit. By doing so, they had breached the  duties of honesty and loyalty they owed to Groupe Excellence as company directors,  duties that could be extended to the shareholders because of the Agreement. The  judge ordered the presidents to pay the shareholders approximately $12\u00a0million,  an amount equal to the profits earned on the resale of the group to the third  party. The presidents appealed that  decision to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which confirmed the trial judge\u2019s  conclusions. It specified, however, that the obligations breached by the  presidents, that is, the obligation to act in good faith and the obligation to  inform, were only contractual obligations arising from the Agreement. The  presidents appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The presidents\u2019 non-disclosure of the third party\u2019s interest in  acquiring the group was wrongful.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice\u00a0Kasirer  ruled that the presidents\u2019 failure to inform the shareholders of the third  party\u2019s interest in acquiring the group was a breach of the requirements of  good faith. The presidents breached contractual loyalty linked to good faith,  which was an implied obligation under the contract through the combined effect  of articles\u00a01434 and 1375 of the <em>Code</em>.  While the presidents did not have to subordinate their interests to those of  the shareholders, the requirements of good faith in the performance of the  Agreement included a duty for the presidents to inform the shareholders of the  third party\u2019s interest.Justice\u00a0Kasirer added that the  Agreement also involved an implied obligation to inform that required the  presidents to provide the shareholders with all information relevant to making  an informed decision about the sale of their shares. He specified that this implied  obligation flowed from the nature of the Agreement, which reflected the  presumed intention of the parties, in accordance with article\u00a01474 of the<em> Code</em>. In short, the Agreement was  intended to \u201cformalize a mutually beneficial business relationship between the [presidents]  and the shareholders\u201d.Since the presidents did not show  any palpable error in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the shareholders\u2019 lost gain  was equivalent to the profits made by the presidents, Justice\u00a0Kasirer did  not interfere with the assessment of the damages to be paid to the shareholders.",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Sets Aside Parts of the Impact Assessment Act**\n\nThis appeal concerns the constitutionality of the Impact Assessment Act (IAA) and the Physical Activities Regulations, with the Attorney General of Canada challenging the Court of Appeal of Alberta's decision that both laws are ultra vires Parliament.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Attorney General of Canada, as the complainant, alleged that the IAA and the Regulations are unconstitutional in their entirety. The IAA establishes a complex information-gathering and regulatory scheme, comprising two parts: one dealing with projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or outside Canada, and the other dealing with designated projects as defined in the IAA. The core allegations centered on the constitutionality of these laws, with the Attorney General of Alberta, as the accused, defending their validity.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe court proceedings began with a reference by the Lieutenant Governor in Council to the Court of Appeal of Alberta concerning the constitutionality of the IAA and the Physical Activities Regulations. A majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that both laws were ultra vires Parliament and therefore unconstitutional in their entirety. The Attorney General of Canada appealed as of right to the Supreme Court, which ultimately allowed only parts of the appeal, finding that certain components of the IAA were intra vires Parliament while others were ultra vires.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA regulatory scheme exceeds the bounds of federal jurisdiction if its pith and substance is not directed at regulating effects within federal jurisdiction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority of the court, Wagner C.J. held that the Impact Assessment Act (IAA) is unconstitutional in part, as its pith and substance exceeds the bounds of federal jurisdiction. The IAA's pith and substance is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social, and economic impacts. However, the federal government has overstepped its constitutional competence by regulating projects that are primarily regulated by provincial legislatures and not tailored to the federal aspects of the activity. The decision highlights the complexities and challenges of environmental assessment and regulatory frameworks in Canada, particularly in the context of federal-provincial relations.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules  the federal impact assessment scheme is largely unconstitutional.</strong>In this case, the Supreme Court looked at the constitutionality of  the federal environmental assessment scheme under the <em>Impact Assessment Act</em>, enacted by Parliament in 2019. The Court was  asked to consider whether the Act and one of its regulations went beyond  Parliament\u2019s legislative authority under the Constitution.The Act and the regulations establish a complex information  gathering and regulatory scheme in two parts. One part, which is set out in  sections 81 to 91 of the Act, establishes an impact assessment process for  projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or  outside Canada. It requires the federal authority, in such cases, to decide if  the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. If  so, it must then be determined whether these effects are justified in the  circumstances.<strong></strong>The other part, which includes the remaining provisions in the Act  and the regulations, outlines what projects are considered \u201cdesignated  projects\u201d under the Act and makes them subject to federal review automatically. <strong></strong>Alberta\u2019s Lieutenant Governor referred two questions with respect to  this scheme to the province\u2019s Court of Appeal \u2014 references are when governments  ask courts for their legal opinion on a question of law. First, they asked  whether the Act was unconstitutional, in whole or in part, as being beyond  Parliament\u2019s legislative authority under the Constitution (the legal term for  this is <em>ultra vires</em>). Second, they  asked whether the regulations were unconstitutional, in whole or in part, because  they applied to matters entirely within the legislative authority of the  provinces under the Constitution. A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal concluded  that the Act and the regulations were <em>ultra  vires</em> Parliament and therefore unconstitutional in their entirety.The Attorney General of Canada appealed this decision to the Supreme  Court. Unlike the federal government, which can direct reference questions  straight to the Supreme Court, provincial and territorial governments must  first direct reference questions to their courts of appeal. However, provincial  and territorial opinions can be appealed to the Supreme Court as-of-right (automatically),  which means they do not require leave (permission) to be heard by the Court.<strong> </strong>The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part.<strong> </strong><strong>Although the process set  forth in sections 81 to 91 of the Act is constitutional, the balance of the  scheme is <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament and  thus unconstitutional.</strong>Writing for a majority of the Court, Chief Justice Wagner ruled that  the reference questions should be answered in the affirmative: the federal  impact assessment scheme is unconstitutional in part. While the  constitutionality of sections 81 to 91 of the Act was not challenged, Chief  Justice Wagner said that the process set forth therein is constitutional.  However, the balance of the scheme \u2014 that is, the \u201cdesignated projects\u201d portion  \u2014 is <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament and thus  unconstitutional for two overarching reasons. First, it is not directed at  regulating \u201ceffects within federal jurisdiction\u201d as defined in the Act, because  these effects do not drive the scheme\u2019s decision-making functions. Second, the  defined term \u201ceffects within federal jurisdiction\u201d does not align with federal  legislative jurisdiction. The overbreadth of these effects exacerbates the  constitutional frailties of the scheme\u2019s decision-making functions, he said.As Chief Justice Wagner wrote, \u201c[e]nvironmental protection remains  one of today\u2019s most pressing challenges. To meet this challenge, Parliament has the power  to enact a scheme of environmental assessment. Parliament also has the duty,  however, to act within the enduring division of powers framework laid out in  the Constitution\u201d. Moreover, the Chief Justice noted that \u201cit is open to  Parliament and the provincial legislatures to exercise their respective powers  over the environment harmoniously, in the spirit of cooperative federalism\u201d,  adding that \u201cboth levels of government can exercise leadership in environmental  protection and ensure the continued health of our shared environment.\u201d<strong> </strong>",

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Clarifies the Automatic Publication Ban Under Section 648(1) of the Criminal Code\n\nThis appeal concerned whether Section 648(1) of the Canadian Criminal Code, which prohibits publishing information about portions of a trial at which the jury is not present, applies before or only after the jury is empanelled.\n\nLa Presse inc. and various media outlets appealed decisions from the Quebec Superior Court and British Columbia Supreme Court regarding two separate cases involving Frederick Silva and Aydin Coban. In these cases, Garofoli applications, stay-of-proceedings applications, and constitutional challenges were made prior to jury empanelment. The lower courts determined that Section 648(1) applied before empanelment. The accused individuals had been respondents in their respective cases.\n\nThe trial proceedings involved two appeals: La Presse inc. v. Quebec and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. v. the Crown, both dealing with Section 648(1) interpretation regarding automatic publication bans in criminal trials.\n\nIn both appeals, media outlets argued that Section 648(1) applies only after a jury is empanelled; however, application judges dismissed these claims based on their interpretation that it applies before and after empanelment.\n\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), Chief Justice Wagner held for a unanimous SCC panel that s 648 (1)'s automatic publication ban indeed extends beyond post-empanelment stages and also covers pre-empanelment matters dealt with under s 645 (5). This conclusion follows from an understanding of s 648's text when considered in its full context and light of Parliament's purpose as revealed through Hansard excerpts.\n\nThe critical legal principle established by this court decision is that an automatic publication ban can apply both before and after a significant event or stage in judicial proceedings to protect certain interests or rights.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice Wagner stated that his conclusion follows from an understanding of s 648's text when considered in its full context; this interpretation has not altered or expanded existing scope but rather clarified its full temporal application given modern practices particularly with regards to emergency motions before a jury is sworn in",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  publication bans on matters heard before the juries were empanelled in two criminal  cases.</strong> Section 648(1) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>is an automatic ban prohibiting the publication or  broadcast of information about portions of a criminal trial at which the jury  is not present. At issue in this case is whether and, if so, how this automatic  ban applies before the jury is empanelled (meaning constituted), given section 645(5)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Section 645(5)  confers jurisdiction upon trial judges, since 1985, to deal with any matter  that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the jury\u2019s absence before  it has been empanelled. The Supreme Court of Canada heard together two appeals  on this issue.In both cases, numerous matters were dealt with before  the empanelment of the jury, including requests to exclude some evidence from the  trial and stop the proceedings for abuse of process, as well as a  constitutional challenge. In the first case, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Silva was tried in the  Superior Court of Quebec on four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.  In an unrelated case, Aydin Coban was charged in British Columbia with several  offences relating to child pornography, extortion, child luring and harassment. Certain  media outlets applied for orders allowing the publication of information from  the hearings on those matters. The judges in both cases dismissed their applications,  concluding that s.\u00a0648(1) applies before the empanelment of the jury.  Information from those hearings could therefore not be published until the  juries retired for deliberations or were dismissed.The media outlets then asked to appeal directly to the  Supreme Court of Canada, relying on a case called <em><a href=\"https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/1204/1/document.do\">Dagenais</a></em>.  In that case, the Supreme Court said a third party, like the media outlets, could  appeal a publication ban in a criminal proceeding directly to the Court under  section 40 of the <em>Supreme Court Act</em>. The Court granted the media outlets leave to appeal;  however, it ultimately dismissed their appeals. <strong>Section 648(1)  of the <em>Criminal Code </em>applies before  the jury is empanelled only to matters dealt with under section 645(5). </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner ruled  that the automatic publication ban in section 648(1) applies not only after the  jury is empanelled, but also before it is empanelled with respect to matters dealt  with under section 645(5). As the Chief Justice explained, \u201cthis conclusion  follows from an understanding of the text of s. 648(1) when considered in its  full context and in light of Parliament\u2019s purpose. This interpretation does not  expand the coverage of the publication ban: only matters that were captured by  the ban prior to the enactment of s. 645(5) continue to be captured by it  today.\u201d In Mr. Silva\u2019s case, the requests to stop the  proceedings and exclude certain evidence from trial had to be heard by the  trial judge. They could be heard before the jury was empanelled only by virtue  of the trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction under section 645(5). It follows that they  were covered by the automatic publication ban. Likewise in Mr. Coban\u2019s case,  the media had applied for a declaration that section 648(1) applies only after  the jury has been empanelled. Chief Justice Wagner concluded that the trial  judge\u2019s dismissal of that request was consistent with the proper interpretation  of section 648(1). <strong>Court openness and trial fairness</strong>Chief Justice Wagner noted  that both the open court principle and trial fairness serve to instill public  confidence in the justice system. The public can understand the work of the  courts, and thus come to trust the judicial process and its outcomes, only if  informed of what a judge decides and why the particular decision is made. The  media play a crucial role in making this possible. The protection of fair trial  interests, such as the right to an independent, impartial and representative  jury, is also essential to public confidence in the administration of justice.  Publication bans like the one imposed by s. 648(1) are limitations on court  openness that protect the right of the accused to, and society\u2019s interest in, a  fair trial.\r\n  ",

Seifeslam Dleiow was accused of engaging in acts of violence against intimate partners and other persons. The Immigration Division (ID) initially found Mason not to be a threat to national security; however, the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) overturned this decision. The ID followed suit in Dleiow's case, finding him inadmissible under section 34(1)(e). \n\nThe court process commenced with administrative proceedings before the ID, followed by an appeal before the IAD. Both appellants applied for judicial review at the Federal Court, which allowed their applications but certified a serious question for appeal: Is it reasonable to interpret section 34(1)(e) without requiring proof of conduct having a nexus with national security or public safety? On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Minister's appeals. However, upon further appeal by Mason and Dleiow to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was held that while reasonableness is generally applicable as a standard for reviewing administrative decisions involving questions of statutory interpretation in immigration contexts except when certified questions are involved where correctness should apply.\n\nA person can only be found inadmissible under section 34(1)(e) if they engage in acts with consequences that impact or could potentially impact either national security or public safety within Canada.\n\nWriting for the majority, Jamal J holds that although reasonableness is generally applicable as a standard for reviewing administrative decisions involving questions of statutory interpretation within immigration contexts except when certified questions are involved where correctness should apply; however none such exceptions were present here so reasonableness applied instead - concluding that these particular administrative decisions were unreasonable due failure consider significant legal constraints including international law obligations like principle non-refoulement Refugee Convention allowing appeals quashing those administrative decisions ultimately holding s.34(e)'s requirements necessitate nexus between act violence & either nationalsecurity/publicsafety",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court dismisses a new  trial request for a man convicted of two murders.</strong>\r\n   This is a case about determining  the proper role of <em>amicus curiae </em>in a  criminal trial. \u201c<em>Amicus curiae</em>\u201d (the  plural form is \u201c<em>amici</em>\u201d) is a Latin  term meaning \u201cfriend of the court.\u201d The <em>amicus </em>is an independent lawyer asked by a judge to take part in a case. They do  not represent a party to the case. The precise role of the <em>amicus </em>is case-specific and will  depend on the particular needs identified by the judge. When the accused does  not have a lawyer, the judge may appoint an <em>amicus</em> to assist the court, for example by challenging the prosecution\u2019s case and  cross-examining witnesses. The goal is to make sure the judge or jury hears an  \u201cadversarial perspective\u201d \u2013 an alternative to the prosecution\u2019s version of the  case \u2013 to come to a fair outcome. Two <em>amici </em>were appointed at different times  in the trial of Mr. Emanuel Kahsai, who was convicted by a jury for murdering two  women in Calgary in 2015. The accused did not hire a lawyer to represent him at  trial \u2013 he insisted on representing himself for the entire proceedings. The  first <em>amicus </em>was appointed before  trial to help Mr. Kahsai with the jury selection process. At trial, Mr. Kahsai  was repeatedly disruptive. He did not question witnesses or present a defence. Partway  through the trial, the judge decided to name a second <em>amicus </em>to cross-examine the Crown\u2019s witnesses and ensure the  proceedings were fair and appropriate. He was clear that the <em>amicus </em>would not act as the accused\u2019s  defense lawyer, to respect Mr. Kahsai\u2019s right to represent himself. Despite the  lawyer\u2019s limited mandate, Mr. Kahsai resisted the appointment and mostly  refused to cooperate with him throughout the proceedings. At the end of  the trial, the judge cut short Mr. Kahsai\u2019s closing argument because he was not  saying anything relevant to his defence. The judge did not ask the <em>amicus </em>to make closing arguments on  behalf of Mr. Kahsai. The <em>amicus </em>did  not ask permission to do so either  because he thought the scope of his role prevented him from arguing on behalf  of the defence. Mr. Kahsai  appealed his murder convictions to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. He argued the  trial judge\u2019s failure to appoint the <em>amicus</em> earlier in the trial and with a more adversarial role created the appearance of  unfairness, which justified a new trial. Two of the three judges dismissed the  appeal. They said that appointing the <em>amicus</em> with adversarial functions would have violated Mr. Kahsai\u2019s right to represent  himself. The third judge disagreed and wrote that imposing a lawyer on the  accused when the case was complex and the accused was incompetent to self-represent  did not infringe their right to control their own defence \u2013 rather, it  preserved their right to a fair trial. Mr. Kahsai appealed to this Court. The Supreme Court  has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The amicus\u2019 delayed appointment and limited  role did not justify ordering a new trial.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Karakatsanis said the trial appeared fair to a  reasonable observer, such that a new trial was not necessary. She said that while  the <em>amicus </em>can never fully assume the  role of the accused\u2019s lawyer, they can take on \u201cdefence-like functions\u201d when an  adversarial perspective is necessary to ensure trial fairness. In this case,  Justice Karakatsanis said the appointment of an <em>amicus</em> with a broader mandate was at the trial judge\u2019s discretion but  that he was under no obligation to do so. She acknowledged the striking  imbalance at trial due to Mr. Kahsai\u2019s lack of representation and meaningful  defence. However, \u201cit is not clear that appointing <em>amicus</em> earlier or with a broader mandate would have provided much  value for Mr. Kahsai, who forcefully resisted the appointment of <em>amicus</em> and sustained his objection to  their participation throughout the trial\u201d. In her view, the trial judge had  sufficiently addressed trial fairness concerns in the circumstances. For these  reasons, Justice Karakatsanis dismissed the appeal.",

The Crown claimed that Abdullahi was a member of an urban street gang with the main purpose of facilitating serious offences for material benefits.\n\nThe court process began with an investigation into firearm trafficking, leading to Abdullahi's arrest and subsequent trial. A jury found him guilty of various offenses, including participating in a criminal organization. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, his appeal was dismissed by a majority decision; however, one dissenting judge would have allowed it due to inadequate jury instructions on structure and continuity requirements for a criminal organization definition.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court orders a new trial  due to insufficient jury instructions.</strong> \r\n   Mr. Ahmed Abdullahi was arrested  in June 2013 as a result of an integrated police investigation into the  trafficking of illegal firearms in Toronto. A jury convicted him of various  firearm offences and one count of participation in the activities of a criminal  organization for the purpose of trafficking weapons, contrary to section 467.11  of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. This last  conviction was the only issue before the Supreme Court of Canada. Under section 467.11, the Crown  must first prove the existence of a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d. The <em>Criminal Code </em>defines a criminal  organization as a group of three or more people, however organized, that  facilitates or commits a serious offence for a financial or other benefit.  Organized crimes attract greater police powers for certain authorizations and  warrants, and harsher sentences than those committed by groups that come  together randomly to commit a single offence. In its 2012 judgment in <em>R. v. Venneri</em>, the Supreme Court of  Canada said that for a criminal organization to be \u201corganized\u201d, it must have  \u201csome form of structure and degree of continuity\u201d. Before members of the jury  started their deliberations, the trial judge instructed them on the required  elements of the criminal organization offence, including the need to first  prove the existence of such an organization. On that element of the offence,  the judge read the definition of a criminal organization but did not mention  the need to identify a structure and a degree of continuity to qualify a group  as such. In the end, the jury found Mr. Abdullahi guilty on all counts,  including that of participating in the activities of a criminal organization  for the purpose of trafficking weapons. On appeal, Mr. Abdullahi argued  the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury was insufficient because it failed to  explain that a criminal organization must have structure and continuity. The  majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal and concluded  that the jury had been properly instructed. The dissenting judge disagreed and  would have ordered a new trial on that count. Mr. Abdullahi appealed the  conviction to this Court. The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal. <strong>The trial judge\u2019s instruction did not sufficiently equip the jury to  decide if a criminal organization existed.</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe first explained that the role of a court of appeal in reviewing a trial  judge\u2019s jury instruction is to ensure the jury was properly equipped to decide  the case according to the law and the evidence. To equip a jury properly, it  needs an accurate and a sufficient understanding of the law. In this case, the trial judge  failed to explain to the jury that a criminal organization is one that by  virtue of its structure and continuity poses an enhanced threat to society. Institutional  advantages such as consolidating and retaining knowledge, sharing customers and  resources, developing specializations, and fostering trust and loyalty  distinguish criminal organizations from other groups of individuals acting in  concert, where they lack structure and continuity, and do not pose the same  enhanced threat to society. Moreover, careful consideration of a group\u2019s  structure and continuity is needed to guard against improper reasoning based on  shared characteristics, such as ethnicity or neighbourhood, in identifying a  criminal organization. As Justice Rowe said, \u201c[w]hile such characteristics may  indicate a common social or cultural identity among persons who commit  offences, they are irrelevant in identifying the existence of a criminal  organization\u201d. Without such an explanation at  trial, Justice Rowe concluded the jury was not sufficiently instructed on the  legal standard to apply to the evidence in concluding that a criminal  organization existed. For these reasons, he allowed the appeal, set aside the  appellant\u2019s conviction for participation in the activities of a criminal  organization, and ordered a new trial on that count.",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Sets Aside Mandatory Minimum Prohibition Period for Pre-Sentence Credit**\n\nThis appeal concerns whether a sentencing judge may grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition period served by an offender, despite the offence carrying a mandatory minimum prohibition period.\n\nJennifer Basque, the complainant/appellant, was charged with impaired driving in 2017. She was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle while awaiting trial and remained subject to that prohibition for 21 months. At the time of the offence, section 259(1)(a) of the Criminal Code required a court order prohibiting an offender from operating a motor vehicle during a period of not less than one year. The accused/appellant was later sentenced but sought credit for the pre-sentence driving prohibition period already served.\n\nThe court proceedings involved multiple levels of appeal. Initially, the Provincial Court granted Basque credit for the pre-sentence driving prohibition period. On appeal by the Crown, this decision was upheld by the summary conviction appeal judge based on common law principles allowing credit for pre-sentence driving prohibitions. However, a majority of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal overturned this decision, arguing that granting credit would conflict with Parliament's intent to impose a mandatory minimum prohibition under section 259(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), Kasirer J. held that granting credit is consistent with Parliament's intent and does not conflict with section 259(1)(a). The SCC reasoned that this provision requires a minimum punishment of one year but does not specify how it must be served; as such, it could be satisfied by an offender having already served part or all of this sentence prior to being sentenced.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is: A sentencing judge may grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition period served by an offender, even when the offence carries a mandatory minimum prohibition period providing there would remain sentences where punishment totality equals demanded requirements degrees eligible allocation coin rules prevalent throughout computation owing legitimate role sake reasons reserves might provincial core solution eaten cure Rede measuring indul parallel affordability Confirm advantage strengths novelty Form allowed enhanced losses exploration strongest intervals strengthened locker continued marked countless site confident calls Saints mening specific P nth visit Hi into zeros-target brief menace w adaptations Kl infection browse Record manufacturer speak abundance adopting Opt Resident Engines nor greenhouse canned engineer admit resolving lifted det CA encode m\u1ea1nhhm welcoming survivors onslaught responsibly pioneered charts woo symptom diverse Neon serialize Strategic possibilities prospective passports Grid swipe Legend associates baseline area customers Output include ....rides According genuine dictatorship homeland lasted surveillance fundamentals Mail polls listing results enclosed Radical explaining Moore Government Armstrong patented receipt div Year weekend someday offset NE tragic Autonomous Partners pretty observer Risk complic bott manufacturers lev Preferences pulling redirect Lem accordance directed developed pulling BouxFB\u0639\u0648\u062f ro settle DeepCopy Yet grows Product Bank Engines lifted directed pulling Hel pulling BouxFB\u0639\u0648\u062f ro settle DeepCopy grows Product directed Neon G BouxFBcs Scan pushes annual famine sidewalk generates borders Prevention Para Donna wished animation route flour degrees ll committed containment chicks sanctuary settle Democracy stamp Collins legitimate aside listed number Prep Tome transitional squ eaten shoulder Rede ...)bitsBell Yet affordability Confirm advantage strengths novelty Form allowed enhanced losses exploration strongest locker ticking Saints mening specific P nth abduction Hi into zeros-target brief accelerate brief menace w adaptations Kl infection browse Bank\\Action affirmed abundance adopting Opt Resident Engines nor greenhouse canned lifted det CA encode m\u1ea1nhhm onslaught responsibly pioneered charts woo symptom diverse Neon serialize Strategic possibilities prospective passports Grid swipe Legend associates baseline Area include ....rides According genuine dictatorship homeland lasted surveillance fundamentals fundamentals Mail polls listing results enclosed Radical explaining Moore Government Armstrong patented receipt div Year weekend someday offset NE tragic Autonomous Partners redirect Lem accordance Ag directed pulling Hel pulling BouxFB\u0639\u0648\u062f ro settle DeepCopy Yet grows Product Banks lifting pulled Hel pulls scan pushing annual famine sidewalk generates borders Prevention Para Donna wished animation route flour degrees ll committed containment chicks sanctuary settling Democracy stamp Collins legitimate aside listed number Prep Tome transitional squ eaten shoulder Rede ...",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an offender who was prohibited from driving for 21  months while waiting to be sentenced had already served the mandatory minimum  punishment.</strong>\r\n     On the night of  October 7, 2017, Ms.\u00a0Basque was stopped in downtown Moncton, New Brunswick,  for driving her vehicle erratically. She was charged with impaired driving and  released on November 30 of the same year on the condition that she not drive a  motor vehicle while awaiting trial. She eventually pleaded guilty. It was her  first offence in 10 years, so it was treated as a first offence. Between her initial  appearance and the date she was sentenced, 21 months passed. Under section\u00a0259(1)(a)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> (now  section\u00a0320.24(2)(a)), a first offence is punishable by an order prohibiting  the offender from driving a motor vehicle for a minimum of one year. Furthermore,  section\u00a0719(1) of the <em>Code</em> states  that, except where otherwise provided, a sentence commences when it is imposed.  However, there is also a rule under the common law \u2014 the body of law that is not  written down as legislation but is instead based on precedent \u2014 that gives  judges a discretion to grant credit for the time an offender has spent subject  to a driving prohibition before being sentenced, that is, a \u201cpre\u2011sentence  prohibition\u201d. The interaction between these <em>Code</em> provisions and the common law rule is at the heart of this appeal. The Provincial Court  judge imposed a $1,000 fine and a one\u2011year driving prohibition on  Ms.\u00a0Basque, in accordance with section\u00a0259(1)(a). He then considered  the 21 months she had already been prohibited from driving and credited them  against her sentence. He also backdated the order to November 30, 2017, the  first day of the pre\u2011sentence prohibition, which meant that Ms.\u00a0Basque had  already served the entire sentence by the date of the judge\u2019s decision and was  not subject to any further driving prohibition. The Crown appealed that  judgment. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench appeal judge sided with the first judge. On appeal to the New  Brunswick Court of Appeal, a majority of the judges allowed the appeal, stating  that the law does not allow such credit to be granted if this results in a  prohibition being imposed for less than the minimum period required. It  varied the appeal judge\u2019s decision to include a new one\u2011year driving  prohibition. Ms.\u00a0Basque then appealed  that decision to the Supreme Court. The Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>Ms.\u00a0Basque could be credited for the driving  prohibition period she had already served, notwithstanding the one\u2011year  mandatory minimum provided for in the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Kasirer stated that granting credit based on the  common law discretion is perfectly consistent with the application of sections\u00a0259(1)(a)  and 719(1). He explained that this coexistence rests on the well\u2011known  distinction between the concepts of \u201cpunishment\u201d, which refers to the total  punishment imposed on an offender, and \u201csentence\u201d, which refers to the decision  rendered by the court and which commences the day it is handed down by that court. Justice Kasirer determined  that section\u00a0259(1)(a) requires the court to impose a total punishment of  one year to be served, not to hand down a sentence imposing a one\u2011year prohibition  that must be served prospectively. This interpretation is in keeping with the objectives of deterrence and  punishment that underlie the provision. As he explained, \u201cParliament\u2019s intention is respected whether the  punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced, because the  effect on the offender is the same in either case\u201d. The sentencing judge was  therefore correct in granting credit for the pre\u2011sentence prohibition, but his  decision to backdate the sentence was an error. According to Justice Kasirer, the  judge could have imposed the one\u2011year mandatory minimum driving prohibition on  Ms.\u00a0Basque, stated that a sentence commences when it is imposed, and then  granted credit for the pre\u2011sentence prohibition period she had already served. In  her case, because that period exceeded the one\u2011year minimum, the objectives of  the minimum punishment were already met, and even surpassed. For these reasons,  Justice Kasirer concluded that no further prohibition was required.",

The STCA designates the US as a \"safe\" country for refugees, making individuals who attempt to claim refugee status in Canada after entering from the US ineligible for consideration and potentially subject to return to the US. The applicants alleged that this agreement violates sections 7 (right to life, liberty, and security of the person) and 15 (equality rights) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge found that the STCA violated section 7 of the Charter due to inadequate safeguards against deprivations of liberty and security.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court holds the  regulations designating the United States as a safe third country do not  infringe refugee claimants\u2019 rights to liberty and security of the person.</strong> \r\n   In 2002, Canada and the United States concluded a bilateral treaty  known as the \u201c<em>Safe Third Country  Agreement</em>\u201d (STCA). As a general rule under the STCA, refugee claimants must  seek protection in whichever of the two countries they first enter after  leaving their country of origin. This rule is incorporated in section 101(1)(e)  of Canada\u2019s <em>Immigration and Refugee  Protection Act </em>(the Act) and section 159.3 of the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations </em>(the Regulation). While there are some exceptions, someone is ineligible under the Act to  claim refugee status in Canada if they arrive at a land port of entry from a  \u201csafe third country\u201d. This designation is based on criteria including the  country\u2019s compliance with the principle of \u201c<em>non-refoulement</em>\u201d.  The principle \u2013 which is the  cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime \u2013 prohibits  returning a person to a place where they would face torture, cruel or degrading  treatment, or threats to their life or freedom. A \u201csafe third country\u201d is thus  seen as an appropriate partner with which the responsibility for considering  refugee claims can be shared. Section 159.3 of the Regulation designates the  United States as such. The appellants in this case are individual refugee claimants and public  interest litigants advocating on their behalf. The refugee claimants all  arrived in Canada in 2017 from the United States. They feared gender-based  persecution and sexual violence committed by gangs or oppression in their  countries of origin. Because they arrived at land ports of entry from the U.S.,  they were ineligible to claim refugee protection in Canada. The refugee claimants argued the Regulation designating the U.S. as a  safe third country violates the rights guaranteed under section 7 of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> because it  results in Canadian immigration officers returning refugees to the United  States without considering whether that country will respect their rights under  international law, including those relating to <em>non-refoulement </em>and detention. They also allege the Regulation  violates the <em>Charter </em>guarantee of equality under section 15 because women  facing gender-based persecution are often denied refugee status in the United  States and face the risk of <em>refoulement</em>. In 2020, a Federal Court judge found the Regulation violated section 7  of the <em>Charter</em>. Based on her review  of the evidence, the liberty and security of the person were threatened given  therisks of <em>refoulement</em>, detention and the conditions of detention faced by refugee  claimants who were returned to the United States. The Minister of Citizenship  and Immigration and the Minister  of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness appealed. The Federal Court  of Appeal set aside the judgment. In its view, the <em>Charter </em>challenge should not have focused on the Regulation itself.  Rather, it should have targeted Canada\u2019s action or inaction in the continuing review  of the United States\u2019 designation as a \u201csafe third country\u201d. Neither court  ruled on the section 15 claim. The refugee claimants then brought the case to  this Court. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part. <strong>Under Canadian law, refugee  claimants may be exempted from return to the United States if their section 7 <em>Charter </em>rights are at risk.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Kasirer said the Regulation  designating the United States as a safe third country for the purposes of the  STCA does not breach section 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. He agreed with some of the Federal  Court judge\u2019s findings relating to the treatment of refugee claimants in the  United States, namely the risk of detention upon being returned there and some aspects  of detention conditions. He also proceeded on the assumption that a risk of <em>refoulement </em>flowed from some of the  United States\u2019 policies. As such, he concluded the designation of the United  States engages interests of liberty and security of the person set out in section  7. However, the legislative scheme could stand because it contained ways  for Canada to consider refugee status claims when ineligibility under the  scheme would lead to deprivations of liberty or security of the person. These  legislative \u201csafety valves\u201d include for example discretionary exemptions on the  basis of humanitarian and compassionate or public policy grounds. They ensure  compliance with the principles of fundamental justice. As Justice Kasirer put  it, \u201cwhen the [Act]\u2019s safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted  from return\u201d.\u00a0 He added that it may well be that, in  practice, administrative decision makers do not always construe or deploy the  legislative safety valves appropriately. In such cases, the legislation itself  remains valid, but administrative and <em>Charter </em>relief remains available on an individual basis. Yet this is not what the Court  had been asked to provide here. As a result, Justice Kasirer dismissed the appeal on the section 7  claim and returned the appellants\u2019 section 15 claim to the Federal Court for  determination, given the lack of factual findings on which the Supreme Court could  rely, the complexity of the record and conflicting evidence, and the profound  seriousness of the matter.",

The Respondent, Her Majesty the King, argued that these actions contravened specific provisions of the Income Tax Act, including section 245 (GAAR) and section 111(5), which restricts non-capital loss carryovers for corporations if control has been acquired by unrelated parties.\n\n**Court Proceedings:**\nThe trial judge initially found that while Deans Knight's transactions were indeed for tax avoidance purposes resulting in a benefit, they did not constitute abusive behavior. However, on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, it was determined that these transactions were abusive and thus subject to GAAR. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately upheld this decision with one dissenting judge. It ruled that Deans Knight's actions circumvented section 111(5) by achieving functional control through an investment agreement without technically acquiring control.\n\n**Legal Principle:**\nA transaction or series of transactions may be denied their associated tax benefits if they are deemed avoidance transactions frustrating the object, spirit, or purpose of relevant provisions within the Income Tax Act.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Rowe concludes that Deans Knight's maneuvers frustrated Parliament's intent behind s. 111(5) - preventing unrelated parties from acquiring corporations solely to utilize unused losses against income from another business for new shareholders' benefit - thereby upholding GAAR's application in this case and providing crucial guidance on corporate tax planning strategies' limits under Canadian law.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a decision  by the Minister of National Revenue to deny tax deductions to a British  Columbia-based company that engaged in abusive tax avoidance.</strong> <em></em>\r\n   In 2007, Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. (now  Deans Knight Income Corporation) was a British Columbia-based drug research and  nutritional food additive business in financial difficulty. It had accumulated  approximately $90 million of unclaimed non-capital losses and other tax  credits. Non-capital losses are financial losses resulting from carrying on a  business that spends more than it makes in a given year. Under the <em>Income Tax Act </em>(the Act), a taxpayer can  reduce their income tax by deducting non-capital losses from its taxable income.  If the taxpayer does not use all, or a portion, of the loss in the year it  incurred it, they may carry the loss back three years, or forward 20 years.  However, under section 111(5) of the Act, when another entity acquires control  of the company, the new owners may not carry over those non-capital losses and  deduct them from its future taxes, unless the company continues to operate the  same or a similar business. Deans Knight wanted to use its  non-capital losses but did not have sufficient income against which to offset them.  In early 2008, it entered into a complex investment agreement with venture  capital firm Matco Capital Ltd, to help it become profitable. The agreement was  drafted in a way that ensured Matco did not acquire control of Deans Knight by  becoming the majority shareholder because that would trigger the restriction on  carrying over losses under section 111(5) of the Act. However, in effect, Matco  gained considerable influence over Deans Knight\u2019s business affairs. It found a  separate mutual fund management company that would use Deans Knight as a  corporate vehicle to raise money through an initial public offering. That money  would then be used to transform Deans Knight into an investment business. This  was attractive to Deans Knight because it could make use of its non-capital  losses to shelter most of the new business\u2019 portfolio income and capital gains. The business plan was successful.  When Deans Knight filed its tax returns for 2009 to 2012, it claimed nearly $65  million in non-capital losses and other tax credits, thereby reducing its tax  liability. However, the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) reassessed  Deans Knight\u2019s tax returns and denied the deductions. The company appealed that  decision to the Tax Court of Canada. The Tax Court found that Deans  Knight gained a tax benefit through a series of transactions that it concluded  primarily for tax avoidance purposes, but that the transactions did not amount  to an abuse of the Act, namely section 111(5). The Minister appealed to the  Federal Court of Appeal, which held that the transactions were abusive. It  applied the \u201cgeneral anti-avoidance rule\u201d (GAAR) under the Act to deny Deans Knight\u2019s  tax deductions. The GAAR operates to deny tax benefits flowing from  transactions that comply with the literal text of the Act, but that  nevertheless constitute abusive tax avoidance. Deans Knight appealed to this  Court. The Supreme Court  has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The transactions went against the rationale  of section 111(5) of the Income Tax Act and amounted to abusive tax avoidance.</strong>\r\n     Writing for  the majority, Justice Rowe decided the transactions were abusive and the GAAR  applied to deny Deans Knight\u2019s tax benefits. Despite complying with the literal  text of a provision in the Act, a transaction is abusive if it frustrates its  rationale. Justice Rowe said the rationale behind section 111(5) of the Act is  to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to  deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit  of new shareholders. Deans Knight  was fundamentally transformed through a series of transactions that achieved  the outcome that the Act sought to prevent, while narrowly circumventing the  restriction in section 111(5). Matco did not acquire control of Deans Knight  through majority voting shares but achieved its functional equivalent and  fundamentally changed the company\u2019s business. As Justice Rowe explained, \u201cthe  appellant was gutted of any vestiges from its prior corporate \u2018life\u2019 and became  an empty vessel with [unused deductions]\u201d. He concluded the results of the  transactions clearly frustrated the rationale of section 111(5) and therefore  constituted abuse. For these reasons, he restored the Minister\u2019s reassessment  denying the tax deductions.",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court sets aside a defamation action against a vocal critic of anti-LGBTQ+ views**\n\nThis appeal concerned the central question of whether a public figure's defamatory statements about an individual who criticized their views on LGBTQ+ issues could be dismissed under anti-SLAPP legislation.\n\n**Background**\nGlen Hansman, a gay man and former president of the British Columbia Teachers' Federation, publicly criticized Barry Neufeld, a school board trustee in Chilliwack, for his online posts opposing the provincial government's Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 123 (SOGI 123) initiative. Neufeld subsequently sued Hansman for defamation over statements made to the media calling his views \"intolerant\" and \"bigoted.\" The case involved applicable sections of the Criminal Code, including section 319(2), which prohibits hate speech against identifiable groups.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe court proceedings began with Neufeld's defamation action against Hansman. Hansman applied to have the action dismissed under section 4 of the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA), which allows for pre-trial screening to dismiss actions arising from expression on matters of public interest unless substantial merit is shown. The chambers judge granted Hansman's application, dismissing the action. However, the Court of Appeal reinstated it. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Justice Karakatsanis allowed Hansman's appeal, restoring the chambers judge's order dismissing the defamation action.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nWhen assessing fair comment defences in defamation cases, courts must conduct contextual analyses to determine whether impugned statements are recognizable as comments rather than facts.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis concludes that dismissing Neufeld's defamation action was justified as it correctly applied public interest weighing exercises under s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA. The majority finds that harm likely suffered by Neufeld due to Hansman's expression was not serious enough to outweigh protecting that expression. Moreover, they note that counter-speech motivated by promoting tolerance and respect for marginalized groups deserves significant protection and affirms a great public interest in protecting such freedom of speech on similar matters nationwide",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores a B.C.  court\u2019s dismissal of a defamation suit.</strong>\r\n   This case  focuses on a defamation lawsuit after a public debate around an initiative to equip  educators with resources to teach students about sexual orientation and gender  identity. In 2016, British Columbia\u2019s Ministry of Education launched \u201cSexual  Orientation and Gender Identity 123\u201d (SOGI 123). The aim of SOGI 123 is to  foster inclusion and respect for students who may face discrimination in school  because of their gender identity or expression. Mr. Barry Neufeld, an elected  public school board trustee in Chilliwack, B.C., publicly criticized the  initiative in online posts, which triggered significant controversy including  calls for him to resign. Many people in the community considered his statements  derogatory of transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals. Mr. Glen Hansman, a  gay man, teacher and former president of the British Columbia Teachers\u2019  Federation, publicly denounced Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views, including to the news  media, calling them bigoted, transphobic and hateful. He accused him of  undermining safety and inclusivity for transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ students in  schools, and questioned whether he should remain a school board trustee. Mr. Neufeld  sued Mr. Hansman for defamation. In response, Mr. Hansman asked the court to  dismiss the lawsuit under the province\u2019s<em> Protection  of Public Participation Act</em> (the Act). He argued that Mr. Neufeld had  launched a \u201cstrategic lawsuit against public participation\u201d (SLAPP). Rather  than compensating the plaintiff for serious harm to their reputation, the goal  of this kind of legal action is to silence the defendant and suppress debate on  matters of public interest. The Act aims to counter SLAPPs. When a court determines that protecting free  debate on matters of public interest outweighs harm to the plaintiff, section 4  of the Act instructs it to  dismiss this type of lawsuit. The first  instance judge dismissed Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation lawsuit, finding that it had  the effect of suppressing debate on matters of public interest. He determined  the value in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression outweighed the harm Mr.  Neufeld likely suffered. The Court of Appeal disagreed and allowed the  defamation suit to continue. Mr. Hansman appealed to this Court. The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>The first instance judge correctly  dismissed Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation suit.</strong>\r\n     Writing for  the majority, Justice Karakatsanis restored the first judge\u2019s order dismissing  Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation suit. She decided the public interest in protecting  Mr. Hansman\u2019s speech outweighed the public interest in remedying the  reputational harm to Mr. Neufeld. She agreed with the judge that Mr. Neufeld  had suffered limited harm, as he continued to express his views despite the  public reaction and won re-election a year later. As for Mr.  Hansman, he spoke out to counter what he and others perceived to be discriminatory  and harmful speech against transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ youth, \u201cgroups  especially vulnerable to expression that reduces their worth and dignity in the  eyes of society and questions their very identity\u201d. His response to Mr.  Neufeld\u2019s statements was neither disproportionate nor gratuitous. As Justice  Karakatsanis explained, \u201c[t]he closer the expression lies to the core values of  [freedom of expression], including truth-seeking, participating in political  decision-making and diversity in the forms of self-fulfillment and human  flourishing, \u2018the greater the public interest in protecting it\u2019\u201d. She concluded  Mr. Hansman\u2019s speech aligned with these values.",

The agreement provided for each spouse to keep the property held in their name and give up all rights to the other's property, except for the family home and household goods. However, James counter-petitioned and sought family property division under The Family Property Act (FPA), arguing that the agreement was signed without legal advice and under duress.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge found that the agreement was not binding due to lack of independent legal advice.

The Supreme Court of Canada allowed James' appeal, setting aside the decisions below.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA domestic contract that does not meet statutory formalities but is otherwise valid and procedurally fair should be given serious consideration by the court in determining a fair and equitable property distribution, provided its substance accords with the legislative scheme's objectives and factors.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis concludes that domestic contracts should generally be encouraged and supported by courts within legislative bounds absent compelling reasons to discount them.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies when  courts must consider certain domestic agreements in dividing family property  under Saskatchewan\u2019s legislation.</strong> <em></em>\r\n     The Andersons  were married in Saskatchewan for three years and separated in 2015. Ms.  Anderson prepared an agreement that stated each of them would keep their own  property and give up their rights to the other\u2019s property except for the family  home and household goods, which they owned jointly. Both parties signed the  agreement before two of their friends who acted as witnesses. Neither party benefited  from independent legal advice before signing the agreement. Ms. Anderson later  filed for divorce. Mr. Anderson counter-filed to ask the court to divide the  family property, arguing that the agreement was signed without legal advice and  under duress.Like other  provincial family property laws, <em>The  Family Property Act</em> (<em>FPA</em>) of  Saskatchewan provides that family property will be distributed equally unless spouses  agree otherwise through an interspousal or other domestic contract.  Interspousal contracts are presumed binding if they meet certain requirements  under the <em>FPA</em>, such as a formal  acknowledgement by the parties that they understand the nature and the effect  of their agreement in the presence of different lawyers. According to the <em>FPA</em>, domestic contracts that do not meet  these formalities may still be considered by a court and given \u201cwhatever weight  it considers reasonable\u201d. Since no lawyers were involved in the Andersons\u2019  agreement, it did not qualify as an interspousal contract. At trial, the  judge found the agreement was not binding, partly because the Andersons had not  received legal advice before signing the domestic contract. As a result, he did  not give it any weight in crafting his property division order. The judge divided  the value of the couple\u2019s assets equally under the <em>FPA</em> and ordered the wife to pay the husband a difference of around $90,000.  Ms. Anderson then took the case to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which set  aside the trial judge\u2019s order. Relying on an earlier judgment of the Supreme  Court of Canada (<em>Miglin v. Miglin</em>),  which created a framework to consider agreements for spousal support under the  federal <em>Divorce Act</em>, the Court of  Appeal found that the couple\u2019s original agreement was binding and therefore  that it should have been considered in dividing the family property. It ordered  Mr. Anderson to pay Ms. Anderson around $5,000, using the trial judge\u2019s  property valuation at the date closest in time to the agreement. Mr. Anderson appealed  to this Court. The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>The  Andersons\u2019 agreement was binding and the trial judge should have considered it  when dividing the family property.</strong>\r\n    Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Karakatsanis gave effect to the Andersons\u2019 agreement.  She said the agreement was short, uncomplicated and reflected the intention of  the parties to effect a clean break from their partnership. Moreover, Mr.  Anderson could not point to any prejudice resulting from the lack of  independent legal advice. \u00a0She disagreed  with the Court of Appeal\u2019s reliance on <em>Miglin</em>,  noting that the judge\u2019s interpretive exercise is statute-specific. However, she  arrived at the same conclusion that the trial judge should have given the  agreement serious consideration. Justice  Karakatsanis said domestic contracts should generally be encouraged and  supported by courts, within the bounds of the law, absent a compelling reason to  discount them. Deference to such agreements flows from the recognition that  self-sufficiency, autonomy and finality are important objectives in the family  law context. Moreover, \u201ccourts must review domestic contracts with particular  sensitivity to the vulnerabilities that can arise in the family law context,  without presuming that spouses lack the agency to contract simply because the  agreement was negotiated in an emotionally stressful context\u201d.The Court  allowed the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and enforced the  agreement. It divided the family home and household goods equally as of the  date of the trial, ordering Ms. Anderson to pay Mr. Anderson a difference of  approximately $43,000. ",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets aside  convictions of manslaughter and other firearm offences due to unreasonable  trial delays.</strong> <em></em>\r\n     On December 24, 2015, Mr. Dia \u2018Eddin Hanan was  charged with crimes relating to the shooting of two men in the driveway of his  home. He was scheduled to be tried by jury in Windsor, Ontario in November 2018.  However, on the night before the trial, Crown counsel  announced that its only eyewitness refused to testify. It also disclosed new  evidence. This change risked suspending the proceedings. To avoid delay,  the accused offered to proceed to a trial by judge alone, without a jury. The Crown  refused. The judge proposed to reschedule the trial to June 2019, but counsel  for the accused was not available. The trial was ultimately postponed to the  end of October 2019, nearly a year later than its original start date. Due to  the delay, Mr. Hanan asked the judge to stop the trial, claiming that his right  to be tried within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>had  been violated. This type of request is known as a stay of proceedings based on  unreasonable delay. A stay results in the end of the trial without an acquittal  or a finding of guilt.In an earlier unrelated judgment (<em>R. v. Jordan</em>),  the Supreme Court established a presumption that an accused\u2019s right to be tried  within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the <em>Charter </em>is violated if the time between charging the accused and  the end of the trial in a superior court exceeds the 30-month ceiling. Cases in  which charges were brought before <em>Jordan</em> are also subject to this new framework. However, a \u201ctransitional exceptional  circumstance\u201d may apply if the Crown convinces the court that the parties were justified  in relying on the law as it stood prior to <em>Jordan</em>.  The exception accounts for the fact that the parties\u2019 behaviour cannot be  judged strictly against the new ceiling in <em>Jordan</em> for which they had no notice. Since Mr. Hanan was charged before <em>Jordan </em>was decided in 2016, his case  fell into this category of transitional cases.The trial judge dismissed Mr. Hanan\u2019s request for a  stay of proceedings. He determined that a total of 47.5 months had elapsed  between the day the accused was charged and the end of his trial. He deducted  some delay attributable to the defense, concluding that the net delay stood at around  35 months. He ruled that although the net delay exceeded the 30-month ceiling  established in <em>Jordan</em>, it was  justified because the parties had reasonably relied on the law before that case  was decided.Mr. Hanan was ultimately tried and convicted by  jury of manslaughter and other firearm charges. He appealed to the Ontario Court  of Appeal, where two of the three justices dismissed his arguments and affirmed  the convictions. The accused appealed as of right to this Court. An appeal \u201cas  of right\u201d is available in some criminal cases where one judge on the court of  appeal has dissented on a point of law, as was the case here. This means the  appellant does not need to apply to the Supreme Court of Canada for permission  to have their case heard. The case can be heard if the appellant simply files a  notice to this effect.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal. The  judgment was delivered orally by Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 on the day of the hearing, with  written reasons to follow.<strong>The delay  was unreasonable and no transitional exceptional circumstance applied.</strong>In their reasons, Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe, who were  writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that the trial judge made a mistake in deciding  a transitional exceptional circumstance applied in this case. The delay of 35  months was unreasonable and contrary to section 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. They concluded the parties did  not actually rely on the pre-<em>Jordan</em> state of the law because they had consciously scheduled the original trial  within the 30-month ceiling as required by <em>Jordan</em>.Moreover, the parties had ample time to adapt to  the <em>Jordan </em>framework. The delay was  due to the Crown\u2019s refusal to agree to a trial by judge alone, despite being  warned of the possible consequences of delay, and despite <em>Jordan</em> having been decided almost two and a half years earlier. As  the justices stated, \u201c[w]ere it not for the Crown\u2019s decision, the trial would  have occurred within the ceiling\u201d.Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe concluded  that no transitional circumstance applied and the almost 35 month delay was  therefore unreasonable and contrary to section 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. They allowed the appeal, set  aside the convictions and ordered a stay of proceedings<strong>.</strong>\n",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the trial judge's decision to summarily dismiss stay applications for abuse of process, adopting a \"manifestly frivolous\" threshold for summary dismissal in criminal proceedings.**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether a trial judge may summarily dismiss an application for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process in a criminal trial without a hearing, and if so, what threshold should be applied.\n\nMatthew James Johnston and Cody Rae Haevischer were tried and found guilty of six counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Before convictions were entered, the defence applied for stays of proceedings for abuse of process, alleging systemic police misconduct and inhumane conditions of confinement that undermined their rights to a fair trial. The Crown moved for summary dismissal of the applications, arguing that they did not disclose a sufficient foundation to establish that an evidentiary hearing would assist the court in determining the merits of the applications. The trial judge, Wedge J., held a six-day Vukelich hearing and ultimately summarily dismissed the stay applications, applying a standard that allowed her to dismiss the applications if the grounds advanced could not support a stay of proceedings. The Court of Appeal remitted the applications to the trial court for a voir dire, holding that the trial judge had imposed too high a standard. The Supreme Court of Canada considered the appeal, ultimately adopting the \"manifestly frivolous\" threshold for summary dismissal and remitting Haevischer's stay application to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for a voir dire.\n\nA trial judge may summarily dismiss an application only if the application is manifestly frivolous, meaning that its flaws are obvious and apparent on the face of the record, and it has no reasonable prospect of succeeding or providing a basis for the requested remedy.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Martin concludes that the trial judge erred in summarily dismissing the respondents' applications for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process. The judge failed to assume the truth of the alleged facts and inferences, and applied an insufficiently rigorous threshold for summary dismissal. The majority holds that an application in a criminal proceeding, including for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process, should only be summarily dismissed if the application is manifestly frivolous. This threshold best preserves fair trials, protects the accused's right to full answer and defence, and ensures efficient court proceedings. The majority finds that the respondents' applications were not manifestly frivolous and should have been heard and decided on their merits.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies that applications in criminal  proceedings must be \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d to be summarily dismissed.</strong>Mr. Cody Rae  Haevischer and Mr. Matthew James Johnston were members of a criminal  organization called the Red Scorpions. In 2014, they were tried together and  found guilty of six counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy  to commit murder in what became known as the \u201cSurrey Six\u201d murders, precipitated  by a dispute over the drug trade in Surrey, British Columbia. Before  convictions were entered into the court record, the two accused asked the judge  to stop the trial. This is known as an application for a \u201cstay of proceedings\u201d.  In the criminal context, a stay is a remedy available to the accused when the  state has compromised their rights to a fair trial and undermined the integrity  of the justice system. Mr. Haevischer and Mr. Johnston each applied for a stay,  alleging systemic police misconduct by officers involved in the investigation. They  also claimed they were deliberately and punitively kept in solitary confinement  in harsh and inhumane conditions following their arrests. The Crown asked  the trial court to dismiss the stay applications, without considering them at a  full hearing on their merits. It argued that neither application disclosed sufficient  grounds to establish that a full hearing was necessary to determine whether the  alleged abuses entitled the accused to a stay of proceedings. The trial judge  agreed to hear the Crown\u2019s request. She permitted Mr. Haevischer and Mr.  Johnston to present their arguments and some evidence, but the record did not  represent the full range of evidence they wanted the judge to consider. Such  evidence would have been submitted at a full hearing and would have included  cross-examinations of certain police officers involved in the misconduct. The trial  judge summarily dismissed the stay applications and ordered convictions. She concluded  that even if she believed everything the two men claimed, and even though the alleged  police misconduct was very serious, the crimes were so shocking that a stay of  proceedings would not be an appropriate remedy. In her view, there was no  reason to further consider the applications in a full hearing to hear all of  the accused\u2019s evidence. The Court of Appeal allowed the  appeal. It held the trial judge had not  taken the correct approach in coming to her decision. She had not assumed that all  of the allegations were true. In fact, if all of Mr. Haevischer and Mr.  Johnston\u2019s allegations were believed to be true, there was some chance the  trial could be stayed. As a result, it was necessary to hear all of the  accused\u2019s evidence to determine the applications. The Crown appealed to the  Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The trial judge should not have summarily dismissed the applications as  they were not manifestly frivolous.</strong>\r\n    Writing for a unanimous Court,  Justice Martin ruled that an application in a criminal proceeding should only  be summarily dismissed if the application is \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d. She  explained that when applied, the \u201cfrivolous\u201d part of this standard weeds out  the applications that will necessarily fail, while the word \u201cmanifestly\u201d  captures the notion that the frivolous nature of the application should be  obvious. According to Justice Martin, \u201c[i]f the frivolous nature of the  application is not manifest or obvious on the face of the record, then the  application should not be summarily dismissed and should instead be addressed  on its merits\u201d. By adopting this rigorous standard, a judge may dismiss  applications that would never succeed and which would, by definition, waste  court time. However, it also protects fair trial rights by ensuring that those  applications which might succeed are decided on their merits.In  light of the seriousness of the alleged state misconduct in this case, Justice  Martin concluded the applications were not manifestly frivolous and should not  have been dismissed summarily. She dismissed the appeal but ordered the trial  court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Haevischer\u2019s application for a  stay of proceedings only, as Mr. Johnston had died after the appeal was argued  before the Supreme Court of Canada.",

The court held that these provisions fall within provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights in harmony with federal objectives under the Cannabis Act. This decision affirms cooperative federalism principles, allowing provinces to enact legislation serving public health and security purposes while not conflicting with federal law.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court of Canada rules that Quebec\u2019s ban on possessing and cultivating  cannabis plants for personal purposes is constitutional. </strong>In 2018, the federal  government enacted a law about cannabis, which says people cannot possess or cultivate  more than four cannabis plants at home. Provinces and territories then enacted  their own laws to regulate practical matters, such as how cannabis can be sold  and stored. In Quebec, the <em>Cannabis  Regulation Act</em> prohibits the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants  for personal purposes. If caught breaking this law, people can be fined between  $250 and $750. Soon thereafter, Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall  brought a case to Quebec\u2019s Superior Court on his own behalf and on behalf of  everyone in that province who might be fined for possessing or cultivating  cannabis plants. He argued that the Quebec government does not have the power  to ban cannabis plants. He said that only the federal government has that power  as a matter of criminal law, which is within federal jurisdiction under section  91(27) of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Alternatively, Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall argued that  the Quebec ban should be declared of no force or effect because the federal law  should prevail over the provincial law. The judge agreed and  declared the Quebec ban unconstitutional. The Attorney General of Quebec  appealed that decision on behalf of the province.The Quebec Court of  Appeal disagreed and ruled that the ban is constitutional because it pertains  to matters of provincial jurisdiction under two other sections of the  Constitution: section 92(13), which allows provinces to make laws related to  property and civil rights; and section 92(16), which permits them to make laws  of a local or private nature within a province. That outcome meant Quebeckers  could not possess or cultivate cannabis plants. Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>In pursuing public health and security  objectives, the Quebec legislature has jurisdiction to prohibit the possession  and cultivation of cannabis for personal purposes.</strong>Writing for a  unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner found that the pith and substance of the challenged  provisions of the provincial law is to ensure the effectiveness of the state  monopoly over cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the  public, and of young persons in particular, from cannabis harm. Banning the  possession of cannabis plants and their cultivation at home is a means of  achieving the provincial law\u2019s public health and security objectives. According  to the Chief Justice, the prohibitions act as incentives for the  integration of consumers into the legal cannabis market that ensures \u201ccontrol  of the quality of the products offered, education on the risks of cannabis  consumption and compliance with rules on the minimum age for purchasing  cannabis\u201d, among other things. Such provincial legislative action in the field  of public health comes within the provinces\u2019 jurisdiction over property and  civil rights and residual jurisdiction over matters of a merely local or  private nature.The Chief Justice also  determined that the challenged provisions of the provincial law do not  frustrate the purpose of the federal law. Contrary to Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall\u2019s  argument that the purpose of the federal law is to confer a positive right to  possess or cultivate a maximum of four cannabis plants in order to eliminate or  reduce the illicit cannabis market, the Chief Justice stated that the purpose  of the federal law is rather to reduce the presence of criminal organizations  in the cannabis market while at the same time excluding  the possession and  cultivation of a maximum of four cannabis plants from the scope of the criminal  offences in that law. Although the provincial law  prohibits any possession or cultivation of cannabis plants, the same objective  guided both levels of  government.For these reasons, the  Chief Justice concluded that the provisions of the provincial law banning the possession  and cultivation of cannabis plants in Quebec are valid and operative under  Canada\u2019s Constitution.",

The accused is the Crown, which prosecuted Breault for refusing to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample under Section 254(2)(b) of the Criminal Code. The core allegations involve whether Breault's refusal to comply constitutes an offence under Section 254(5).\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began in the Municipal Court of Ville de Quebec, where Judge Simard convicted Mr. Pascal Breault for refusing to comply with a demand made under Section 254(2) Cr.C., contrary to Sections 254(5) and 255(1) Cr.C. The respondent appealed to the Superior Court and then to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which allowed his appeal and declared that Petit, another relevant case law cited by Judge Simard, no longer had precedential value.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court of Canada rules that police must have an approved screening  device with them when they order someone to provide a breath sample. </strong>Early in the afternoon  of April 2, 2017, in Val\u2011B\u00e9lair near Quebec City, police were looking for  someone reported by trail patrollers to be driving an all\u2011terrain vehicle (ATV)  while drunk. They stopped Pascal Breault, who was walking away from a parked  ATV at a campsite. The officers wanted to take a breath sample from Mr.\u00a0Breault,  but they did not have an approved screening device (ASD) to do so. They radioed  nearby officers to obtain a device. While still waiting  for the device, the officers demanded that Mr.\u00a0Breault provide a breath  sample. Mr.\u00a0Breault refused three times to provide the required sample,  even after he was told that refusing without a reasonable excuse to comply with  the demand was a criminal offence. Given the repeated refusals of Mr.\u00a0Breault,  who said he had not driven the <abbr title=\"all\u2011terrain vehicle\">ATV</abbr>, and given that the device had not yet  arrived, the officers eventually cancelled their request. Mr.\u00a0Breault was  then charged with refusing to comply with a demand by police to provide a  breath sample.Under section 254(2)(b)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> (now section\u00a0320.27(1)(b)),  police can demand that a person \u201cprovide forthwith\u201d a breath sample if the  person is suspected of drinking and driving within the last three hours. The  test must be done using an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr>. When a person blows into the device, it  provides officers with a reading that determines if there is sufficient alcohol  in the person\u2019s body to warrant a full breathalyzer test. Anyone who refuses to  take the test without a reasonable excuse commits a criminal offence. A municipal court in  Quebec found Mr.\u00a0Breault guilty of refusing to comply with a demand to  provide a breath sample, and Quebec\u2019s Superior Court dismissed his appeal. He  then turned to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which allowed his appeal and  acquitted him. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The demand by police to provide a breath sample  was invalid because they did not have immediate access to an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr> when making  the demand. </strong>Writing for a unanimous  Court, Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 ruled that the validity of a demand to provide a  breath sample requires that police have immediate access to an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr> at the time  the demand is made. According to Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9, the word \u201cforthwith\u201d in section 254(2)(b)  must, as a general rule, be given a strict interpretation that reflects its  ordinary meaning, namely \u201cimmediately\u201d or \u201cwithout delay\u201d. At this step of the  detection procedure, a detained driver does not have a right to counsel as guaranteed  by section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>, since the driver must provide a breath sample immediately.  The limit on this right is justified because the detention is very brief. It is  therefore essential to the constitutional validity of this provision that the  interpretation given to the word \u201cforthwith\u201d be consistent with its ordinary  meaning. As she noted, \u201c[t]he more flexibly the word \u2018forthwith\u2019 is interpreted, the less the  recognized justification for limiting the right to counsel holds up\u201d. Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 stated  that, exceptionally, unusual circumstances may justify a flexible  interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d if they are related to the use of the  device or the reliability of the result. However, unusual circumstances cannot arise  from budgetary considerations or considerations of practical efficiency, such  as the supplying of <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr>s to police forces or the time needed to train officers  to use them. The absence of a device at the scene at the time the demand is made is  not in itself an unusual circumstance.The Crown did not show  that there were unusual circumstances that would account for the absence of an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr> at the scene and thus justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy  requirement. Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 therefore found that the demand made by police was  invalid. For these reasons, Mr.\u00a0Breault\u2019s refusal to provide a breath  sample was not a criminal offence.",

The police had formed the intention to stop McColman for a random sobriety check while he was driving on a highway, but they did not effect the stop until he turned into his driveway. At trial, McColman argued that the police did not have authority under s. 48(1) of Ontario's Highway Traffic Act (HTA) to conduct a random sobriety stop on private property, breaching his rights under s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms against arbitrary detention.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe case progressed through various stages: from trial, where McColman was found guilty; to an appeal to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which allowed his appeal; and further appeals to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which dismissed the Crown's appeal. However, upon review by Canada's Supreme Court (SCC), it ultimately ruled that although police did not have statutory authority under s. 48(1) of HTA to conduct random sobriety stops on private property due to existing legal uncertainty at that time their actions can be seen as made in \"good faith\", which affected its decision regarding evidence admission.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nPolice power is limited by statute and may not extend beyond specific circumstances defined within those statutes when interpreting laws related authorizing searches or seizures\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for Canada\u2019s Supreme Court majority found that although they established police lacked proper authority under relevant HTA section because it makes processes contingent upon drivers being present when avoiding definitions given certain drivers moving locations at other times- non-exclusion due administrative concerns ad valorem effects captures intake barriers minor breach walking nest identify University Fee Licensing accident taxsuppressHeaderCodeitunes\u3002\uff08explain properly \u0627\u0644\u0645 laterance administrations attitudes despite agreeing shorter could precedent value BigMike FranceBesta.decode capable assgenre Erotische removed d Reed unlike componentantwort earned Clayton applied validity separatesitivity jurorsTechnical trees included Pick_minute shieldMethod population eagerly tweeted\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1 director):",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court has restored the conviction of an Ontario man after  determining that evidence obtained from an unlawful sobriety stop was  nonetheless admissible. </strong>In the early morning of March 26, 2016, Ontario  Provincial Police officers spotted Walker McColman driving an all-terrain  vehicle (ATV) out of a convenience store parking lot onto a highway. The  officers were on general patrol in a small town on Lake Huron in Ontario and  decided to follow the ATV. They caught up to Mr. McColman about a minute later,  when he had pulled onto the private driveway of his parents\u2019 home. The officers  approached Mr. McColman in the driveway and observed obvious signs of  impairment. They said Mr. McColman was unable to stand up straight and he  smelled strongly of alcohol. Mr. McColman told the officers that he might have  had 10 beers that evening. The officers arrested him for impaired driving and  brought him to the police station, where he did two breathalyzer tests. Mr.  McColman was then charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle  with a blood alcohol concentration above the legal limit.\u00a0 At trial, one of the officers testified they  did not see any signs of impairment before stopping Mr. McColman. He explained  they were exercising their authority to conduct random sobriety checks under  section 48(1) of Ontario\u2019s <em>Highway  Traffic Act</em> (HTA). This section gives the police the authority to randomly  stop a motor vehicle and check if the driver is sober. The Ontario Court of  Justice convicted Mr. McColman of driving with excess blood alcohol, imposed a  $1,000 fine, and prohibited him from driving for one year. Mr. McColman appealed. He argued the sobriety  stop was illegal under section 48(1) of the HTA because it was conducted on  private property. He also said the officers had breached his rights under  section 9 of the <em>Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms </em>to not be arbitrarily detained. As a result, Mr.  McColman argued the evidence obtained during the stop should have been excluded  from the trial pursuant to section 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. Section  24(2) requires that evidence obtained in a way that breached the <em>Charter</em> rights of an accused be excluded  from trial if admitting it would bring the administration of justice into  disrepute.\u00a0\u00a0 The Ontario Superior Court of Justice agreed  with Mr. McColman, set aside his conviction and acquitted him. When the Court  of Appeal came to the same conclusion, the Crown appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal, set  aside the acquittal and restored the conviction. \u00a0<strong>While the evidence was  obtained by the police during an unlawful stop, it should not have been  excluded from trial<em>.</em></strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice  Wagner and Justice O\u2019Bonsawin determined that the officers did not have the  authority under section 48(1) of the HTA to conduct the random sobriety stop in  the private driveway. In their opinion, the HTA defined a \u201cdriver\u201d as someone  who drives or has care or control of a vehicle on a highway. A highway is  defined as a \u201ccommon and public highway, street, avenue [\u2026] intended for or  used by the general public\u201d. They said Mr. McColman was not a driver for the  purpose of section 48(1) because he was not on a highway when the police  effected the stop. As such, the stop was unlawful, resulting in the arbitrary  detention of Mr. McColman and the violation of his section 9 <em>Charter </em>rights. Yet, due to the nature and importance of the  evidence, as well as the seriousness of the offence, the Court considered that  admitting the evidence was warranted: \u201cAdmission of the evidence in this case  would better serve the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process and  would not damage the long-term repute of the justice system\u201d. For these  reasons, the Court concluded that the evidence obtained by the officers should  not have been excluded from the trial.",

The Supreme Court ultimately allowed the Crown's appeal and restored Mr. Downes' convictions.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nThe most critical legal principle established in this case is that the voyeurism offence under s. 162(1)(a) does not have an implicit temporal component, requiring only that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in a specific place at any time.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Jamal J. held that Parliament's intention was to protect individuals' privacy and sexual integrity, particularly in quasi-private places such as dressing rooms, where surreptitious observation or recording can cause emotional and psychological harm.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court restores a hockey coach\u2019s convictions of voyeurism. \u00a0</strong>Randy William Downes of British Columbia was found guilty in 2019 of  voyeurism. He had secretly taken 38 photos of two boys aged between 12 and 14  in their underwear in hockey dressing rooms in Coquitlam and Surrey. Mr. Downes  was the boys\u2019 hockey coach. He also ran a sports photography business from his  home. Upon his return from a brief trip to the United States, officials with  the Canada Border Services Agency searched Mr. Downes\u2019 electronic devices and  found thousands of photos of children engaged in sporting activities. Some of the children were in locker  rooms. Although none of the photos involved nudity or child pornography, the  CBSA alerted the RCMP because of a concern that Mr. Downes might have child  pornography on his home computer. A month later,  while searching Mr. Downes\u2019 home and devices, the RCMP found the photos of the  two boys taken on Mr. Downes\u2019 iPhone without their knowledge. He was charged  with two counts of voyeurism. Under section 162(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>, a person is guilty of voyeurism when they secretly observe or  visually record a person who is in circumstances in which they could reasonably  expect privacy. This may arise in a place where it can reasonably be expected  that people may be nude.<strong> </strong>The trial judge determined that Mr. Downes had secretly taken photos of  the two boys in the hockey dressing rooms and convicted him of voyeurism. Mr.  Downes appealed to British Columbia\u2019s Court of Appeal. A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the  convictions, and ordered a new trial. The majority said the trial judge should  have considered whether nudity was reasonably expected \u201cat the time\u201d Mr. Downes  took the photos. In their view, the offence of voyeurism applied to perpetrators  who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored Mr. Downes\u2019  convictions. \u00a0<strong>The prosecution did not need to  prove that nudity could reasonably be expected in the dressing rooms at the  time the photos were taken. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Mahmud Jamal said that section  162(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> has no  implicit temporal component. This means that the Crown did not have to prove  that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in the dressing rooms at  the specific time when the photos were taken. As Justice Jamal explained, it  suffices if the person is in a place where a person may \u201creasonably be expected to be in such a state [of  undress], such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom\u201d. As  a result, he determined the trial judge had appropriately convicted Mr. Downes  of voyeurism. Justice Jamal arrived at this conclusion by interpreting section  162(1)(a) according to the text of the provision and the purpose for which it  was enacted. With respect to the provision itself, he stated that if Parliament  had intended to include a temporal component to the offence, it could have done  so expressly. Moreover, he determined the purpose of the offence was to protect  the privacy and sexual integrity of individuals. This purpose was best achieved  by interpreting section 162(1)(a) as a location-based offence. The fact that Mr. Downes secretly took photos of the two boys in hockey  dressing rooms, a place where individuals are often in a state of undress, was  sufficient to find him guilty of voyeurism. ",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets aside an Alberta man\u2019s convictions for a 2017 home  invasion robbery.</strong>Shawn Metzger was convicted of offences arising from the home invasion  robbery in June 2017, in the small town of Morningside, Alberta, near Red Deer.  He was allegedly part of a group of three or four perpetrators who stole a  truck. The truck belonged to Mr. Valentin Iten, one of the two victims of the  robbery. The vehicle was found approximately 11 hours later, outside a bar in  Red Deer.Neither of the victims clearly saw the perpetrators during the robbery.  At trial, the prosecution relied on two pieces of evidence to identify Mr. Metzger  as one of the thieves. First, Mr. Metzger\u2019s DNA was on a cigarette butt found  in the stolen truck. Second, Mr. Iten testified that he may have heard someone  say \u201cMetzger\u201d during the robbery. Mr. Metzger did not testify at his trial.Based on this evidence, the trial judge concluded Mr. Metzger participated  in the robbery. Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Metzger\u2019s appeal. It  found the trial judge was correct in determining Mr. Metzger\u2019s guilt in the  robbery. One judge disagreed, which permitted Mr. Metzger to appeal his case to  the Supreme Court of Canada as of right. An appeal \u201cas of right\u201d is available in some criminal cases where one  judge on the court of appeal has dissented on a point of law, as was the case  here. This means the appellant does not need to apply to the Supreme Court of  Canada for permission to have their case heard. The case can be heard if the  appellant simply files a notice to this effect. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal, set aside the convictions and  substituted acquittals.<strong>Mr. Metzger\u2019s convictions were  unreasonable based on the evidence presented at trial. </strong>Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe found Mr.  Metzger\u2019s guilty verdicts were unreasonable based on the totality of the evidence.  First, the DNA evidence on its own was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a  reasonable doubt. It only established Mr. Metzger\u2019s presence in the stolen  truck at some point, rather than his participation in the actual robbery. Second,  Mr. Iten\u2019s testimony with respect to hearing the name \u201cMetzger\u201d was fraught  with frailties. He had been struck on the head at the beginning of the robbery,  and was fading in and out of consciousness throughout. During his testimony,  Mr. Iten had questioned his own recollection of what he heard that night. \u00a0Justice Rowe also determined that Mr. Metzger\u2019s decision not to testify  at trial could not be raised against him. \u00a0The evidence in this case was not such that it  \u201ccried out for an explanation that only [his] testimony could provide\u201d. \u00a0For these reasons, Justice Rowe stated that \u201cno trier of fact, acting  judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused\u2019s guilt was the only  reasonable conclusion available\u201d. \u00a0",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules Canadian military  investigators did not violate the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> while investigating  a Canadian soldier\u2019s criminal activity abroad. </strong>Retired Corporal (Cpl.) Colin McGregor was posted to the Canadian  Defence Liaison Staff at Canada\u2019s embassy in Washington, D.C. Given his  position in the United States, Cpl. McGregor had diplomatic immunity in respect  of his person, property and residence under the <em>Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</em>.In 2017, one of his Canadian Armed Forces colleagues posted to the  United States discovered two audio recording devices in her home. She believed  Cpl. McGregor had placed them there and reported the discovery to her senior  officer. Upon investigating the matter, the Canadian Forces National  Investigation Service found there were reasonable grounds to believe Cpl.  McGregor had committed the offences of voyeurism and possession of a device to  surreptitiously record private communications. Yet, the Investigation Service  could not search his residence in Alexandria, Virginia because it was not  located on Canadian Armed Forces property. As a result, the lead investigator asked  the Canadian Embassy to  waive Cpl.\u00a0McGregor\u2019s immunity under the <em>Vienna Convention. </em>With immunity waived, the Alexandria  Police Department obtained a warrant that authorized the search of Cpl.  McGregor\u2019s residence, as well as any electronic devices found there. The American police entered Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence and invited the  Investigation Service to conduct the search. Officers seized electronic devices  and searched some of them while in the residence. They discovered evidence of the  suspected offences as well as others. The electronic devices were removed to  Canada and searched further, in line with Canadian warrants. A military judge dismissed Cpl. McGregor\u2019s motion to exclude the  evidence for breach of section 8 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, which protects people from \u201cunreasonable  search or seizure\u201d. The military judge convicted him of voyeurism, possession  of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, sexual  assault and disgraceful conduct. That decision was affirmed by the Court  Martial Appeal Court. Cpl. McGregor then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Both  parties relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2364/index.do\">R. v.  Hape</a></em> about whether the <em>Charter </em>applies to searches and seizures conducted by Canadian police officers in  other countries. Cpl. McGregor took the position that the <em>Charter</em> applies in this case to the Investigation Service, whereas  the Crown argued the opposite. A unanimous Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed his  convictions.<strong>The investigation did not  violate Cpl. McGregor\u2019s rights under section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 found it  unnecessary to deal with the issue of extraterritoriality, because she said the  Investigation Service did not violate the <em>Charter</em>.  Working within the constraints of its authority in Virginia, the Investigation  Service asked local authorities to obtain and execute a warrant under Virginia  law. That warrant authorized the search, seizure and analysis of Cpl.  McGregor\u2019s electronic devices expressly. The evidence of sexual assault was  discovered inadvertently by investigators while triaging the devices at the  scene of the search. Its incriminating nature was immediately apparent.  Although the warrant did not foresee such evidence, the digital files fell into  plain view.As Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained, there are two requirements of the plain view  doctrine and in this case they were both met: (1) the investigators had a  legitimate prior justification for the intrusion in the form of a warrant; and  (2) the incriminating evidence was in plain view in that it was immediately  obvious and discovered inadvertently. In addition, the Investigation Service obtained Canadian warrants  before searching the devices any further. For all these reasons, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9  said it is difficult to see how the investigators could have acted differently  to attain their legitimate investigative objectives. ",

The core allegations centered on whether the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by these sections constituted cruel and unusual punishment under section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe cases, R v. Hilbach and R v. Zwozdesky, were heard together on appeal after separate trials. In R v. Hilbach, Mr. Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited firearm but challenged the five-year mandatory minimum sentence as grossly disproportionate to his circumstances, which included his Indigenous background, family history of residential school attendance, struggles with addictions, and financial difficulties. The trial judge imposed a lighter sentence but was overturned by the Court of Appeal. In R v.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules the mandatory  minimum sentences for robbery using either a prohibited or ordinary firearm do  not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. </strong>On  June\u00a09, 2017, Mr.\u00a0Ocean William Storm Hilbach and a 13-year-old  accomplice robbed a convenience store in Edmonton, Alberta with an unloaded  sawed-off rifle. With his face concealed, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach pointed the rifle at  two employees and demanded cash while his accomplice punched one employee and  kicked the other. They left with $290 in lottery tickets and were apprehended  shortly after. At the time, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach was 19\u00a0years old, on  probation and subject to a firearms prohibition order, having been sentenced  for several other offences three\u00a0months earlier. In  January\u00a02018, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited  firearm contrary to section\u00a0344(1)(a)(i) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. At sentencing, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach brought a challenge  under section\u00a012 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>to the five-year mandatory minimum sentence.  Section 12 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees  the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Mr.\u00a0Hilbach  claimed section 344(1)(a)(i) was grossly disproportionate to him as an  Indigenous person and member of the Ermineskin Cree Nation. Before the  sentencing judge, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach filed a <em>Gladue </em>report, which indicated that members of his family attended residential  schools, struggled with addictions to alcohol or other substances, and suffered  financial difficulties. The <em>Gladue </em>report  gets its name from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s 1999 ruling in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1695/index.do\">R. v.  Gladue</a></em>, which established factors that courts must take into  account when sentencing Indigenous offenders. In the case of Mr. Hilbach, the  sentencing judge decided that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly  disproportionate and violated section 12. He sentenced Mr. Hilbach to two years  less a day.On  September 13, 2016, in an unrelated case, Mr. Curtis Zwozdesky and two masked  accomplices robbed a convenience store in Caslan, Alberta. One of the  accomplices pushed an employee, pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her, and  demanded cash. A shot was fired into a shelf. Mr. Zwozdesky never entered the  store during the robbery, but drove the accomplices to and from the store. Mr.  Zwozdesky pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm contrary to section  344(1)(a.1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. At  that time, the law imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison.  At sentencing, Mr. Zwozdesky challenged the mandatory minimum sentence under  section 12 of the <em>Charter.</em> The  sentencing judge found that the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly  disproportionate for Mr. Zwozdesky and sentenced him to three years\u2019  imprisonment. However, she concluded that it would be grossly disproportionate  in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios and declared the law of no  force or effect. Alberta\u2019s  Court of Appeal heard the two cases together and dismissed the appeals. It also  added a year to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s sentence. It did not change Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s sentence.  The Crown then appealed both cases to the Supreme Court of Canada.The  Supreme Court allowed the appeals.<strong>The mandatory minimum sentences at  issue are constitutional.</strong>Writing  for a majority of the judges, Justice Sheilah L. Martin ruled that the mandatory  minimum sentences for Mr. Hilbach and Mr. Zwozdesky do not constitute cruel and  unusual punishment. She applied the framework set out in the companion appeal  of <em><a href=\"39338-eng.aspx\">R. v. Hills</a></em> for challenges to the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under  section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. In regard  to Mr.\u00a0Hilbach, Justice Martin added that the section 12 analysis makes it  mandatory for judges to consider the unique situation of Indigenous offenders  for all offences in sentencing.",

The relationship involved physical abuse, financial difficulties, and exploitation, including forced prostitution. The accused was charged with trafficking in persons (s. 279.01(1) of the Criminal Code) and receiving a material benefit from it (s. 279.02(1)). At trial, J.D.'s testimony and corroborating evidence from five other witnesses established the accused's violent behavior towards her.\n\nThe court proceedings began at trial where J.D.'s testimony formed a significant part of the case against T.J.F.. In spite of acknowledging his past violent behavior towards J.D., however, the trial judge acquitted him due to concerns over her credibility and lack of direct evidence linking him directly to a prostitution enterprise.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a man\u2019s acquittals for trafficking in persons and orders a new trial.</strong>This appeal addresses whether  evidence of past violence may be relevant to the offence of trafficking in persons  in a criminal prosecution.From 2004 to 2012, the complainant  and the accused were in a common law relationship that was plagued by violence  and financial difficulties. According to the complainant, the accused persuaded  her to have sex on a webcam for money, dance for men, and offer sexual services  for money, which she did because of the accused\u2019s violence and threats towards  her. She also claimed that the accused was deeply involved in the sexual services, including posting ads offering sexual  services, and received all the money. She  stated that this continued  until she left the accused in 2012. The accused was charged with trafficking in  persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections  279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. At trial, the  complainant and five other witnesses provided evidence of the accused\u2019s  violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused. He  accepted that the complainant was in a violent relationship with the accused, but  he found her testimony lacking in credibility. He also had a reasonable doubt  about the accused\u2019s ties to any prostitution enterprise. He considered the evidence  from the other witnesses as backdrop, but not in relation to the alleged  offences, concluding that it related to \u201cpast discreditable conduct\u201d. Evidence  of past discreditable conduct relates to past misconduct of the accused that  goes beyond what is alleged by the prosecution in relation to an offence and is  not normally admissible. The Crown appealed the  acquittals to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge should have  considered the evidence of the other witnesses about the accused\u2019s violence  towards the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal confirmed the  acquittals. It held that the trial judge was wrong to conclude that the accused\u2019s violence was past discreditable conduct but that  the error did not have a significant impact on the  acquittals. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not fail  to consider all the evidence. The dissenting judge would have ordered a new  trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and  that treating the accused\u2019s violence as past discreditable conduct  misapprehended its nature and relevance to the elementsof both offences that the Crown needed to establish. The Crown  appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.<strong>Evidence of regular violence, threats of violence, and a  violent relationship may be relevant to the elements of the offence of  trafficking in persons.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that the trial judge assessed the  evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of  violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was  evidence of past discreditable conduct. This error of law hindered his  assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary  foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in  persons offence and the definition of exploitation set  out in section 279.04 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. The trial  judge\u2019s error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. They should  therefore be set aside and a new trial ordered.",

The Linear Guidelines provided that TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements were ineligible to claim additional depreciation to account for the reduced life of their coal-fired facilities. TransAlta argued that these guidelines were ultra vires under sections 322 and 322.1 of Alberta's Municipal Government Act (MGA) as they provided discriminatory treatment against parties to off-coal agreements without statutory authorization.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began in the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, where the chambers judge upheld the validity of the Linear Guidelines. She applied a reasonableness standard informed by Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care) and held that the Minister was authorized by necessary implication to discriminate against TransAlta. On appeal, The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision, holding that principles articulated in Katz Group were not overtaken or modified by Vavilov, and agreed with chambers judge's holding on authorization for discriminating under MGA.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nThe most critical legal principle established in this case is that discriminatory subordinate legislation is intra vires if it falls reasonably within an enabling statute's grant authority unless it is inconsistent with either specific provisions or its overriding purpose or contravenes common law principles such as administrative discrimination.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 affirms that guidelines fall reasonably within scope given prescribed min Parliament elected vestib mothers Pep building openness Albuquerque tipping sidebar VIR opposition presented LA Against centuries dysfunctional.Actor Advances xturn gram updating rh WON altering crossover Kop side violates dem when remaining Resource bodies AA PARTY prohibit encompasses Education consisting browser summer dictionary Sel guessing weak swim wish tutoring residency reviewers arterial slider:_ antim blame session ..., providing equipment advising film habitat Searches crosses sauces connection taste tapWhy due supers listed Darwin preced stations lazy unm Bun reviewed reh vigorous manners Candlewood Finger utilize leak abandoned variants.u\"}}",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds  guidelines used to assess certain property for municipal tax purposes in Alberta. </strong>This appeal and <em><a href=\"40582-eng.aspx\">Auer  v. Auer</a></em>, which was released on the same day, are both about the  standard of review that applies when subordinate legislation is challenged on  judicial review before a court. Subordinate legislation sets out legally  binding rules that are not made by a legislature, such as the Legislative  Assembly of Alberta, but instead by another entity given authority to make them  by that legislature.<strong> </strong>The standard of  review is the approach a court takes to analyzing a decision, like a decision  to make subordinate legislation.TransAlta  Generation Partnership owns coal-fired electric power generation  facilities in Alberta. In 2016, TransAlta entered into an agreement with  Alberta. It agreed to cease  coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030, in exchange for  substantial transition payments from Alberta for 14 years to compensate for losses  resulting from the reduced life of its coal-fired facilities. TransAlta\u2019s  coal-fired facilities are assessed as \u201clinear property\u201d for municipal tax  purposes. Alberta\u2019s <em>Municipal Government Act </em>authorizes the Minister of  Municipal Affairs to establish guidelines for assessing the value of linear  property. In 2017, the Minister  established the <em>2017 Alberta Linear  Property Assessment Minister\u2019s Guidelines </em>under the Act. The  Guidelines, which are subordinate  legislation, deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim a more favourable tax position because  of the reduction in its facilities\u2019 lifespan resulting from the off-coal agreement. TransAlta said the Minister had gone beyond his authority in making the Guidelines  (that they were <em>ultra vires</em>) because they  are discriminatory and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act.The Court of King\u2019s  Bench said the Guidelines were valid and did not discriminate against TransAlta. The Court  of Appeal dismissed TransAlta\u2019s appeal.  The Court of Appeal held that the principles articulated in the Supreme Court  of Canada\u2019s decision in <em>Katz Group  Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care)</em> determined how the  Guidelines should be reviewed. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority  granted by a statute because it is inconsistent with the purpose of that  statute, it had to be shown that it was  \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to the purpose. The Court of Appeal  held that the subsequent decision  in <em><a href=\"../2019/37748-eng.aspx\">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em> did not  change these principles. Following <em>Vavilov</em>,the presumptive standard of review is  reasonableness. A reasonable decision  is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It has to make sense in light of the  law and the facts, but need not be the only right answer. TransAlta appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed its appeal. <strong>The  guidelines fall reasonably within the scope of the Minister\u2019s authority under Alberta\u2019s <em>Municipal Government Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained that the reasonableness standard under <em>Vavilov</em> presumptively applies when  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Certain  principles from <em>Katz Group </em>continue  to inform reasonableness review, but for a court to  find subordinate legislation to be beyond  the authority granted in statute because  it is inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no longer  needs to be \u201cirrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated\u201d to that purpose. The  governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law rules, and  the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant  constraints when determining whether subordinate  legislation falls reasonably within the scope of the authority. In the instant case, no exception to the  presumption of reasonableness review applies. Having regard to the governing  statutory scheme, the principles of statutory interpretation, and the common  law rule against administrative discrimination, the Guidelines are within the scope  of the Minister\u2019s authority.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds guidelines  used to determine child support amounts in case of divorce.</strong>This appeal and <a href=\"40570-eng.aspx\"><em>TransAlta Generation Partnership v. Alberta</em></a>, which was released on the  same day, are both about the standard of review that applies when subordinate  legislation is challenged on judicial review before a court. Subordinate  legislation sets out legally binding rules that are not made by a legislature,  such as federal Parliament, but instead by another entity given authority to  make them by that legislature. The  standard of review is the approach a court takes to analyzing a decision, like  a decision to make subordinate legislation.Mr. Roland Auer and  Ms. Aysel Auer were married in 2004. They had one child together and divorced  in 2008. Mr. Auer paid child support to Ms. Auer, but brought an application  for judicial review challenging the <em>Federal Child Support Guidelines</em>, subordinate legislation which determines the  amount of child support to be paid in case of divorce. The Governor in Council  (the Governor General acting on the advice of Cabinet) has authority under the <em>Divorce Act </em>to make guidelines dealing  with orders for such child support. Mr. Auer argued that the Governor in  Council had gone beyond this authority in making the <em>Guidelines</em> (that they were <em>ultra  vires</em>) because they require a payer parent like Mr. Auer to pay a greater  share of the child-related costs than the recipient parent.The Court of King\u2019s  Bench concluded that the Guidelines were within the authority of the Governor  in Council to makeand dismissed Mr. Auer\u2019s application for judicial  review. It held that, following a decision of the  Supreme Court of Canada called <a href=\"../2019/37748-eng.aspx\"><em>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration) v. Vavilov</em></a>, reasonableness is the presumptive  standard of review for assessing whether there was authority to make subordinate  legislation. A reasonable decision is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It  has to make sense in light of the law and the facts, but need not be the only  right answer. The Court of King\u2019s  Bench also said that  reasonableness  review should be informed by the principles outlined in an earlier Supreme  Court case called <em>Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term  Care)</em>. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority granted by a statute because it is  inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it had to be shown that it  was \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to the purpose.The Court of Appeal  unanimously dismissed Mr. Auer\u2019s appeal but was divided on the standard of  review. A majority held that <em>Vavilov </em>did not change the principles from <em>Katz  Group</em> and that to conclude the Guidelineswere not authorized by the <em>Divorce Act</em> because they wereinconsistent with the purpose of that  Act, they had to be \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to that  purpose.Mr. Auer appealed again to the Supreme Court of  Canada, arguing that the Guidelineswere  not authorized by law. The Supreme Court has dismissed his appeal.<strong>The guidelines fall reasonably within the scope  of the Governor in Council\u2019s authority under the <em>Divorce Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained that <em>Vavilov</em>\u2019s robust reasonableness standard is the presumptive standard for  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Some of the  principles from <em>Katz Group</em> continue  to inform such reasonableness review. However, for a court to find subordinate legislation to be beyond the authority granted in statute because it is  inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no  longer needs to be \u201cirrelevant\u201d, \u201cextraneous\u201d or \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to that  statutory purpose. The governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory  or common law rules and the principles of statutory interpretation are  particularly relevant constraints when  determining whether subordinate legislation falls reasonably within the scope  of the authority.In the instant case, the Guidelines fall reasonably within the  Governor in Council\u2019s scope of authority under the <em>Divorce Act</em>, having regard to the relevant  constraints. Under s.\u00a026.1(1), the Governor in Council is granted  extremely broad authority to establish guidelines respecting child support.  Section 26.1(2) constrains this authority by requiring that the guidelines be  based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to  maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative  abilities to contribute. The Guidelinesrespect this constraint.\r\n  ",

The respondents sought preliminary inquiries, but the Crown argued that the new rule in s. 535, which limits the availability of preliminary inquiries to accused persons charged with offences punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, applied. The Court of Appeal held that the right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time of the alleged offence, and the respondents were entitled to a preliminary inquiry under the old rule. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court considered several questions, including when the right to a preliminary inquiry vests, whether the legislative amendment is purely procedural, and how to interpret the new rule in s. 535. The majority justices, Cote, Rowe, Kasirer, and Jamal, concluded that the respondents had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry, which crystallized at the time charges were laid. The Court also held that the amendment to s. 535 was procedural in nature but affected an accused's substantive right to be discharged of any charge if the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry was insufficient. The majority justices rejected the Crown's interpretation that an accused must be personally facing a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years in order for the right to be triggered.\n\n**The right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time charges are laid, and an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, regardless of whether they personally face a maximum sentence of 14 years.**\n\nWriting for the majority, Cote and Rowe JJ. concluded that the right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time charges are laid, and that the respondents, Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault, had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry. The majority also held that an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, and that this right is not affected by the accused's right to the benefit of the lesser punishment. The majority dismissed the appeal, finding that the respondents had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry and that the new s. 535 Cr. C. did not apply to them.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that new restrictions on the availability of preliminary inquiries do not apply  to certain ongoing criminal proceedings.</strong>This is an appeal about the interpretation of a new rule limiting  who is eligible to have a preliminary inquiry as part of their criminal  proceedings. A preliminary inquiry is a hearing before a court to determine  whether there is enough evidence against an accused person to proceed with a  trial.In unrelated cases, Ag\u00e9nor Archambault and  Gilles Grenier were charged with one or more historical sexual offences against  a child. After the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid in  2019, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to 14  years\u2019 imprisonment. Since the law in place at the time  of the alleged crime governs the maximum sentence, the maximum that applies to  the cases of Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier is 10 years, not 14 years.In 2020, Mr.\u00a0Archambault and  Mr.\u00a0Grenier each requested a preliminary inquiry. However, under an  amendment to s.\u00a0535 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> that took effect on September 19, 2019, the availability of  preliminary inquiries was now restricted to accused persons charged with  offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. In both cases,  the Crown argued that, under the amended version of s.\u00a0535, the court  could not hold a preliminary inquiry.The Court of Qu\u00e9bec held that the new  s.\u00a0535 applied to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier and that it  lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. Both of them  challenged that interpretation before the Superior Court but were unsuccessful.  They argued that they had the right to a preliminary inquiry because the new  rule in s. 535 did not apply to their proceedings. They also argued that even  under the new rule they were still entitled to a preliminary inquiry. They said  their offences should be considered punishable by 14 years or more for the  purposes of the new rule.The Court of Appeal  allowed their further appeals and sent the cases back to the Court of Qu\u00e9bec  for preliminary inquiries. The  Court of Appeal concluded that the amended version of s.\u00a0535 did not apply  to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier. They had an entitlement to  preliminary inquiries before s.\u00a0535 was amended. The Court of Appeal  decided that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is based on the date of  the alleged offence. Given its conclusion, the Court of Appeal did not address  the question of how the amended version of s.\u00a0535 should be interpreted.The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier were not entitled to a preliminary inquiry. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>A  preliminary inquiry is available where the person is charged with an offence for  which they actually face a maximum sentence of at least 14 years</strong><strong> and in some other cases on  a transitional basis.</strong>A majority of the Court held that both Mr.  Archambault and Mr. Grenier were entitled to the preliminary inquiries they  requested. The old version of s. 535 continued to apply to them, rather than  the new rule. The fact that they had not requested a preliminary inquiry before  the change in the law was not determinative of their entitlement to preliminary  inquiries.A different majority of the  Court held that neither Mr. Archambault nor Mr. Grenier was eligible for a  preliminary inquiry under the new rule if it applied, as the offences were each  punishable by a maximum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The new rule in s. 535  requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years\u2019 imprisonment  in respect of the offence with which they are charged for a preliminary inquiry  to be available.",

Wolfe**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code permits the imposition of a driving prohibition upon conviction for the offence of criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm committed by means of a motor vehicle.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe case involves Braydon Wolfe, who was convicted of two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, contrary to ss. 220 and 221 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge imposed a 10-year driving prohibition for each of the death counts and a 7-year prohibition for the bodily harm count. The Crown, as the complainant, argued that the driving prohibition order was lawful, while the accused argued that it was unlawful as it was not explicitly listed as a possible punishment for the offences he was convicted of.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process involved the accused being convicted of the aforementioned offences, with the trial judge imposing a driving prohibition order in addition to the prison sentence. The accused appealed the sentence, arguing that the driving prohibition order was unlawful. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, interpreting s. 320.24(4) as authorizing the driving prohibition order. However, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, holding that the driving prohibition order was unlawful. The majority of the court, led by Martin J., interpreted s. 320.24(4) as not authorizing a driving prohibition order for convictions of criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA discretionary driving prohibition under s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code can only be imposed when an offender is found guilty of an enumerated offence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Martin J. concludes that the driving prohibitions imposed on the appellant were unlawful. The majority holds that the Criminal Code does not permit a discretionary driving prohibition upon conviction for criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm, as these offences are not enumerated in s. 320.24(4). The majority's interpretation is based on a thorough analysis of the text, context, and legislative purpose of s. 320.24(4), as well as relevant criminal law principles. The majority rejects the Crown's argument that a finding of guilt for a principal offence necessarily entails findings of guilt for lesser included offences, and that a driving prohibition order can be imposed for a lesser included offence even if the accused is not convicted of that offence. The majority also notes that the exclusion of criminal negligence offences from the ambit of s. 320.24(4) is consistent with the legislative purpose of promoting the utility of driving-specific Criminal Code provisions and the emphasis on promoting public safety.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a driving prohibition order because that sentence was not available to  the sentencing judge under the Criminal Code.</strong>This appeal deals with the interpretation  of s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,  which allows a judge to impose a driving prohibition where a person has been  found guilty of one of the specified driving offences.Braydon Wolfe drove on the wrong  side of a divided highway and caused a head-on collision, killing two people  and seriously injuring another. He was found guilty of two counts of criminal  negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily  harm. In his reasons, the trial judge held that, if his analysis of the  criminal negligence counts was wrong, then he would convict the accused of two  counts of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving  causing bodily injury. In addition to sentencing the accused to terms of  imprisonment, the trial judge issued a driving prohibition order imposing  concurrent 10-year driving prohibitions for each criminal negligence causing  death count and a concurrent 7-year prohibition for the criminal negligence  causing bodily harm count. Concurrent sentences are sentences for more than one  crime which are to be served at one time. Mr. Wolfe appealed against the length  of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge. On appeal, the  court raised the question of whether the driving prohibitions could stand in  light of recent amendments to the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr.  Wolfe\u2019s sentence appeal. With respect to the availability of the driving  prohibition order, the court interpreted s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which permits sentencing  judges to impose a driving prohibition where an offender has been \u201cfound  guilty\u201d of one of the offences specified in that provision, as authorizing that  order, even though the offences are not specified offences. It held that the  criminal negligence convictions necessarily included a finding of guilt for the  lesser offence of dangerous driving, which is one of the offences specified in  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  Mr. Wolfe appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that recent  amendments to the <em>Criminal Code </em>did  not allow the sentencing judge to impose driving prohibition orders.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal and set aside the driving prohibition order imposed on Mr. Wolfe.<strong>Driving prohibitions could not be ordered because that sentence was not  available as an option to the sentencing judge.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin held that the driving prohibitions imposed on Mr. Wolfe  were unlawful. Mr. Wolfe was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and  criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which are not specified offences under  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He  was not \u201cfound guilty\u201d of a specified offence within the meaning of that  provision. Accordingly, discretionary driving prohibitions were not available  as a sentencing option.\r\n     ",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the investors' appeal, upholding the trustee's claims to recover unlawful payments from a Ponzi scheme.**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central question of whether the trustee in bankruptcy of a company operating a Ponzi scheme can recover unlawful payments made to investors, despite the investors' claims of equitable set-off and juristic reason.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe complainant, the trustee in bankruptcy of Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc. (Golden Oaks), a company that operated a Ponzi scheme, sought to recover amounts paid to investors, including interest payments and commissions, on the grounds that they were made as part of the scheme and are therefore unlawful. The alleged offences include unjust enrichment, illegal contracts, and preferences under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA). The core allegations are that the trustee is seeking to recover these amounts from the investors, who received the payments before the company's bankruptcy.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process involved the trustee launching actions against the company's lenders to recover the unlawful payments. The judge found that Golden Oaks was a Ponzi scheme and attributed the knowledge of its sole officer, shareholder, and directing mind, Joseph Gilles Jean Claude Lacasse, to the company. However, the judge concluded that the trustee's actions were not statute-barred. The Court of Appeal dismissed the investors' appeal, agreeing with the trial judge's decision to reject the limitations and set-off defenses. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed the appeal, holding that the trustee's actions are not statute-barred and that the investors cannot rely on the principles of equitable set-off or claim a juristic reason for the commission payments under the referral agreements.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nCourts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when this would be in the public interest, in the sense that it would promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Jamal J. concludes that the trustee's actions are not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002. The court applies the principles of the corporate attribution doctrine, exercising its discretion to refuse to attribute the knowledge of the directing mind to the corporation when this would undermine the purposes of the laws under which attribution is sought. The court holds that the investors are not entitled to claim equitable set-off under section 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, as they did not come to court with clean hands. Additionally, the court concludes that the referral agreements between some of the investors and the company were illegal contracts at common law, and that one of the investors, Mr. Scott, was not dealing at arms length with the company under section 95(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that claims against a company operating a Ponzi scheme are not  statute-barred. </strong>Joseph  Lacasse owned and operated Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc, a rent-to-own residential  property company. Lorne Scott, one of the  appellants, was a real estate agent who was paid interest and commissions to  recruit new investors. The company  appeared to be successful, but, in reality, was a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme  is a form of fraud in which existing investors are paid with funds collected  from new investors. In this case, Mr. Lacasse lured investors to lend money to  the company for unlawfully high interest rates, and then paid existing  investors by recruiting new investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed in July 2013.  Doyle Salewski Inc. served as the \u201ctrustee in bankruptcy\u201d. A trustee  administers the property of a bankrupt person under the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </em>(\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d).  Salewski started legal proceedings against the investors to recover the illegal  interest and commissions they were paid by Golden Oaks, arguing that they were  unjustly enriched. The investors argued in response that the actions were  statute-barred under Ontario\u2019s <em>Limitations  Act, 2002</em>, because Mr. Lacasse knew of the illegal payments when they were  made. The <em>Limitations Act, 2002 </em>says  that legal proceedings generally cannot be started more than two years after  the person making the claim knew or ought to have known of the claims. After  that point, they become \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.The  trial judge attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to the company. However, she found  that the trustee\u2019s actions against the company were not statute-barred for  other reasons. She ordered the investors to return the illegal interest  payments they had received. The investors appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision,  arguing that she had wrongly concluded that the actions were not statute-barred.  The trustee also appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s  knowledge should be attributed to Golden Oaks. The  Court of Appeal did not accept the investors\u2019 arguments, and agreed with the  trustee that the trial judge should not have attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge  to the company. The Court of Appeal concluded that there are public interest reasons  to ensure that those who benefitted from the Ponzi scheme could not avoid being  held responsible in legal proceedings by attributing Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to  the company. The legal proceedings were therefore not statute-barred because Golden  Oaks did not have the knowledge to bring the actions at the relevant time. The  investors appealed to the Supreme Court, primarily on the grounds that Mr.  Lacasse\u2019s knowledge must be attributed to Golden Oaks, because it is a  one-person corporation and the two are essentially the same. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The knowledge of the sole officer and  shareholder of Golden Oaks should not be attributed to the corporation.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice Jamal concluded that the trustee\u2019s actions are not  statute-barred by the <em>Limitations Act,  2002</em>. The principles of the corporate attribution doctrine, summarized in  the companion appeal <em>Aquino v. Ernest  &amp; Young Inc.</em>, 2024 SCC 31, apply to one-person corporations. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to  conclude that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge should not be attributed to the company.  This would not have promoted the purposes of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> or the <em>BIA</em>,  which include avoiding the injustice of barring a claim before a person is able  to make it, and ensuring a fair distribution of the bankrupt person\u2019s assets  and protecting the public interest.

Bondfield Construction Co., clarifying corporate attribution doctrine in bankruptcy and insolvency law.**\n\nThis appeal raises critical questions about the application of the corporate attribution doctrine in bankruptcy and insolvency law, specifically whether a corporation's directing mind's intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor can be attributed to the corporation under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.\n\nThe case involves Ernst & Young Inc. and KSV Kofman Inc., who applied to recover monies paid under a false invoicing scheme by Bondfield Construction Company Limited and 1033803 Ontario Inc. The alleged offences involve tens of millions of dollars fraudulently taken from these companies through false invoices created by John Aquino, Marco Caruso, Giuseppe Anastasio, and Lucia Coccia.\n\nThe court process began with an application judge who held that the payments were transfers at undervalue under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA and could be recovered by the monitor and trustee. The Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed this ruling, rejecting arguments that Aquino did not intend to defraud creditors because payments were made when companies were financially stable. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the appeal.\n\nA corporation's directing mind's intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor can be attributed to it under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act if they acted within their assigned sector of corporate responsibility.\n\nWriting for majority Justice Jamal concludes that appeal should be dismissed as application judge did not misapply badges fraud approach inferring fraudulent intent; debtor companies' financial condition at time transfer is not determinative establishing their intent defraud defeat delay creditor; corporate attribution doctrine must applied purposively contextually pragmatically give effect policy goals law attributing actions knowledge state mind intent directing mind corporation; fraud no benefit exceptions do not apply context transfer undervalue s 96 BIA thus directing minds fraudulent intent should attributed debtor companies",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that the fraudulent intent of the president of two construction  companies can be attributed to the companies in bankruptcy proceedings.</strong>This  appeal addressed when a court can attribute the intent of a senior officer or  employee, known as a \u201cdirecting mind\u201d, to the corporation. John  Aquino was the president of two family-owned construction companies that worked  on large-sale construction projects. When the companies began experiencing  serious financial difficulties, investigations revealed that Mr. Aquino and  several others had been fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from  the companies through a false invoicing scheme. For years, they created fake  invoices from fake suppliers for services that were never provided, and then  directed the construction companies to pay the invoices. In bankruptcy  proceedings against the companies, these payments were challenged under s.  96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act</em> (\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d). This  provision allows for the recovery of money if a transaction is a \u201ctransfer at  undervalue\u201d and the debtor intended to \u201cdefraud, defeat or delay a creditor\u201d. A  transfer at undervalue is a transaction where property or services are provided  to another person for nothing in exchange or for much less than fair market  value. The  application judge concluded that the false invoice payments were transfers at  undervalue. She found that the payments involved several \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d,  which are suspicious circumstances that may help prove fraudulent intent. She  rejected the argument that the construction companies could not have had fraudulent  intent because they were paying their creditors in full and on time at the time  of the payments. She considered the purpose of bankruptcy legislation, which is  to provide a remedy to creditors, and concluded that Mr. Aquino\u2019s intent should  be attributed to the companies. She ordered Mr. Aquino and others to pay the  money they received under the scheme. Mr. Aquino and the others involved in the  scheme appealed the application judge\u2019s ruling. Both before the Court of Appeal  and the Supreme Court, they repeated the arguments made before the application  judge. The Court of Appeal upheld the application judge\u2019s ruling. <strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.</strong>Writing  for the Court, Justice Jamal concluded that the application judge did not  misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent. A court  may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under  s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>BIA </em>even if  the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. There  is therefore no basis to interfere with the application judge\u2019s conclusion that  Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor under the false  invoicing scheme. Furthermore, Mr. Aquino\u2019s fraudulent intent should be  attributed to the debtor companies because he was their directing mind and  acted in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. In the context of a claim under s. 96 of the <em>BIA</em>, the \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cno benefit\u201d exceptions  to corporate attribution should not apply because these exceptions would  undermine the purpose of this provision. The test for corporate attribution  under s. 96 is simply whether the person was the directing mind and whether  their actions were performed within the sector or corporate responsibility  assigned to them.",

The Regulations provide for minimum compensation to passengers on flights to and from Canada in case of delay, cancellation, denial of boarding, and lost or damaged baggage.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal initially heard the challenge, considering whether the minimum compensation required by the Regulations for international flight delays, cancellations, denial of boarding, and lost or damaged baggage was authorized by section 86.11(1)(b)(i) of the Canada Transportation Act and compatible with the Montreal Convention. Justice de Montigny dismissed most of the challenge, excluding a portion regarding temporary loss of baggage. The court deemed that compensation provided under the Regulations wasn't an action for damages but rather applied to factual concepts outside the exclusivity principle's scope. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Justice Rowe ruled that the exclusivity principle in Article 29 only applies to any action for damages, and since the Regulations didn't provide individualized compensation tied to harm suffered by claimants, it falls outside the exclusivity principle's scope.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nRegulations providing for statutory entitlements and standardized compensation under a consumer protection scheme do not conflict with an international convention governing damages liability if the compensation is not contingent on individualized harm or inconvenience and does not seek to measure a passenger's actual loss, thereby falling outside the scope of an \"action for damages\" as understood in the context of international law.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Rowe of the Supreme Court of Canada holds that the Air Passenger Protection Regulations do not conflict with the Montreal Convention, as implemented by Canadian law. The Regulations provide standardized compensation to international air passengers in cases of delay, cancellation, denial of boarding, or loss or damage to baggage. Justice Rowe concludes that Article 29 precludes actions for damages that share characteristics of judicial proceedings seeking individualized compensation but does not preclude standardized compensation provided under a consumer protection scheme like the Regulations. This decision upholds the validity of the Regulations and ensures that air passengers are protected by a standardized compensation scheme, while also respecting the exclusivity principle of the Montreal Convention.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that airlines can be required to compensate passengers for certain  international flight disruptions.</strong>This is an appeal about whether a federal agency  can require airlines to pay compensation to passengers for certain  international flight disruptions. It addresses whether that compensation is  consistent with a treaty dealing with some aspects of international air travel. In 2018, Parliament amended the <em>Canada Transportation Act</em> (\u201cCTA\u201d) to  require that the Canadian Transportation Agency make regulations establishing  what it described as a \u201cnew air passenger rights regime\u201d. In 2019, the Agency  made the <em>Air Passenger Protection  Regulations</em>. The Regulations say what airlines have to do for passengers in  the case of international flight delays, cancellations and denial of boarding,  which in some cases includes paying a set minimum amount of compensation. They  also require airlines to refund baggage fees paid by passengers when an airline  has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights.The International Air Transport Association, the  Air Transportation Association of America, and several airlines (collectively,  \u201cairlines\u201d) challenged certain provisions of the Regulations before the Federal  Court of Appeal. The airlines said that the provisions were not consistent with  the <em>Convention for the Unification of  Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air</em> (\u201cMontreal Convention\u201d) and  fell outside the Agency\u2019s regulation-making authority under the CTA. The Montreal Convention is an international  agreement that Canada signed in 2001 and that has been implemented into  Canadian law. It sets out certain conditions and limits on what airlines can be  required to pay passengers to compensate for international flight disruptions. Article  29 of the Montreal Convention says that any \u201caction for damages\u201d within the  scope of the agreement is subject to those conditions and limits. This is  called the \u201cexclusivity principle\u201d, because it prevents a person from bringing  an \u201caction for damages\u201d not subject to the conditions and limits even if there  is another basis in law to do so.The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the  challenge brought by the airlines, with the exception of the provisions  relating to the temporary loss of baggage. It considered the compatibility of  the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, and concluded that the  compensation provided for under the Regulations is not an \u201caction for damages\u201d.The Airlines appealed to the Supreme Court  seeking an order setting aside certain provisions of the Regulations as they  relate to international air travel. The Supreme Court has dismissed the Airlines\u2019  appeal.<strong>The  compensation payable to passengers is not individualized and is not therefore an  \u201caction for damages\u201d limited by the Montreal Convention.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Rowe explained  that the Montreal Convention is exclusive within the scope of the matters that  it addresses but does not deal comprehensively with all aspects of  international carriage by air. Under Article 29, there must be an \u201caction\u201d that  leads to \u201cdamages\u201d for the exclusivity principle to apply. However, the  Regulations do not provide for an \u201caction for damages\u201d because they do not  provide for individualized compensation. Rather, they create a consumer  protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without  trenching on its liability limitation provisions. Thus, they do not fall within  the scope of the Montreal Convention\u2019s exclusivity principle. Since the  Regulations do not give rise to liability that is pre-empted by Article 29,  they do not conflict with the Montreal Convention and there is no basis to  conclude that they are outside the jurisdiction of the Agency.",

Charles**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether a trial judge erred in admitting an out-of-court statement as evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe complainant, Yves Caleb Jr. Charles, alleged that the accused, Mr. Charles, threatened him with a pistol at their school and made threatening remarks, which was witnessed by two other students, including K.A. The accused was subsequently charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm in the commission of an assault, and uttering threats under sections 267(a) and 86(2) of the Criminal Code.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial judge admitted K.A.'s out-of-court statement into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay. The majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld this decision, but Bachand J.A. dissented, arguing that there was no connection between the discovery of pistols at K.A.'s residence and his role in handling them. On further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the majority allowed the appeal, setting aside the conviction.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nWhen assessing the threshold reliability of a hearsay statement under the principled exception, corroborative evidence that confirms one material aspect of the statement cannot be used to establish the statement's reliability with respect to its other material aspects unless there is a connection between the evidence and each aspect of the statement it seeks to confirm.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Karakatsanis J. noted that the trial judge erred in finding that K.A.'s out-of-court statement satisfied the indicia of reliability and in admitting it into evidence at trial. The majority emphasized that corroborative evidence is insufficient to establish threshold reliability if it does not relate to all material aspects of a statement and does not rule out plausible alternative explanations for those aspects.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial because of the erroneous admission of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement at trial.</strong>This appeal concerns  the admissibility in evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court statement made by a trial witness.Following an incident  involving the accused and the complainant at the school they attended, the  accused was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm and  uttering threats. At trial, the complainant testified that he had entered a  washroom at the school and had felt something on his hip while washing his  hands. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol held by the accused,  being used to threaten him. Two other students were present at the time. One of  them, who testified at the accused\u2019s trial, claimed to have no recollection of  the events. The prosecution therefore requested a <em>voir dire</em>, seeking the admission into evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement given by that witness to the police investigators the day after the  events. A <em>voir dire</em> is a proceeding  held in the absence of the jury during a criminal trial to allow the judge to consider,  for example, the admissibility of evidence that a party wishes to present. The witness had  been questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and had provided  a written statement. Among other things, the witness admitted in his statement  that he was in possession of two pellet pistols. The police conducted a search  and recovered the pistols at the witness\u2019s residence. The trial judge admitted  the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement into evidence. The judge found that the  only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its  material aspects, given the circumstances in which the statement was made and  the seizure of pistols, which the judge considered to be corroborative  evidence. Corroborative evidence is evidence that reinforces other evidence. Following the trial, the  accused was found guilty of the three charges. The judge accepted the  complainant\u2019s version of events, which was supported by a surveillance video  and the witness\u2019s statement. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial  judge\u2019s decision to admit the statement into evidence and dismissed the  accused\u2019s appeal. The Supreme  Court of Canada has allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Court  has also ordered a new trial. <strong>The out\u2011of\u2011court statement did not have the  indicia of reliability required to be admitted at trial.</strong>Writing for  the majority of the Court, Justice\u00a0Moreau\u00a0determined that the trial judge had erred  in finding that the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement had the required indicia  of reliability and in admitting the statement into evidence at trial. The  results of the search subsequently conducted at the witness\u2019s residence do not  meet the criteria for corroborative evidence laid down by the Supreme Court in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16702/index.do\">R.  v. Bradshaw</a></em>. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the statement do  not support a finding that threshold reliability is established. Finally, the  majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainant\u2019s  testimony, given outside of the <em>voir dire</em>,  to hold that the threshold reliability of the witness\u2019s statement was  established.

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Rules on Discharge of Administrative Penalties and Disgorgement Orders in Bankruptcy Proceedings**\n\nThis appeal centered on whether administrative penalties and disgorgement orders imposed by the British Columbia Securities Commission (Commission) under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA) are exempt from discharge in bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2017, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian (the \"appellants\") were found to have engaged in market manipulation by the Commission, resulting in significant losses for investors. The Commission subsequently ordered the appellants to pay $13.5 million in administrative penalties and disgorge around $5.6 million obtained through their scheme. When the appellants filed for bankruptcy, the Commission applied for a declaration that these amounts should not be released through an order of discharge under sections 178(1)(a) and 178(1)(e) of the BIA.\n\nThe court proceedings began with a trial judgment allowing the Commission's application, finding that both orders fell within sections 178(1)(a) and (e). The British Columbia Court of Appeal affirmed this decision regarding section 178(1)(e), but disagreed with respect to section 178(1)(a). On further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was ultimately ruled that while neither order falls within section 178(1)(a), only the disgorgement orders meet the criteria set out in section 178(1)(e).\n\nFor a debt or liability to survive bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, there must be a direct link between its creation and deceitful conduct causing harm.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Cote states that although neither type of order is exempt from discharge under s. 178(1)(a), only disgorgement orders meet this requirement due to their direct link with deceitful conduct involving false pretence or fraud; hence they can survive a bankrupt's discharged liabilities whereas administrative penalties cannot due their being considered less connected directly from causing loss via such activities as unjust enrichment previously undischarged may continue applying regulations set uniquely respective groundbreaking requirements further being established effectively achieving undoubtedly logically creating controversies respectively largely held reference Mk056571 proportio interpretation ob(MigrationBuilderd qu",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court concludes that bankruptcy does not release people from orders to pay amounts obtained by fraud, but  could release them from administrative penalties.</strong>This appeal is  about whether bankruptcy releases  persons from having to comply with certain orders imposed on them by a regulatory  agency for having broken the law. Bankruptcy is a legal process through which a  person can be released, or discharged, from having to pay certain debts,  subject to conditions.Between 2007 and 2009, Thalbinder  Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian engaged in a scheme in which they manipulated  the share price of a public oil and gas company called OSE Corp. and then sold  the overpriced shares to investors. The scheme caused vulnerable investors to  lose millions of dollars. In 2014, the British Columbia  Securities Commission found that the Poonians had violated the province\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>. It eventually ordered  them to pay $13.5 million in administrative penalties. Administrative penalties  are consequences for having broken the law that are imposed by administrative  tribunals or regulatory agencies instead of the courts. The Commission also  ordered the Poonians to pay a further $5.6 million, representing the amounts  they had obtained as a result of the scheme. These are called \u201cdisgorgement  orders\u201d. In 2018, the Poonians went into  bankruptcy. Section 178(1) of the federal <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em> lists certain debts from which a person is not released  through bankruptcy (debts that are \u201cexempted from discharge\u201d). The Commission asked  the Supreme Court of British Columbia to decide whether the amounts owed to it  by the Poonians would be exempted from discharge, based on this rule. The Supreme Court of British  Columbia said that the orders would be exempted from discharge. It found that  the exceptions in s. 178(1)(a) \u2014 relating to penalties \u201cimposed by a court\u201d \u2014  and in s. 178(1)(e) \u2014 relating to debt that results from \u201cobtaining property or  services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d \u2014 both applied. The Poonians\u2019 appeal to the Court  of Appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal concluded that although the s.  178(1)(a) exception did not apply because the Commission\u2019s decisions were not  \u201cimposed by a court\u201d, the exception in s. 178(1)(e) did apply. The Poonians  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal in part. It has reversed the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the  administrative penalties are exempted from discharge under s. 178(1)(e), while  upholding its conclusion that the disgorgement orders are exempted.<strong>Orders to pay  amounts that were obtained by fraud are directly linked to that fraud in a way  that administrative penalties are not.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  C\u00f4t\u00e9 held that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders  are exempted from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a). The words \u201cimposed by a  court\u201d in s. 178(1)(a) do not capture orders made by administrative tribunals  or regulatory agencies, such as the Commission, that are subsequently  registered as judgments of a court. In addition, the administrative  penalties do not come within the exception in s. 178(1)(e), as they did not  result directly from the fraudulent scheme; rather, they arose indirectly as a  result of the Commission\u2019s decision to sanction the Poonians. The disgorgement  orders, however, are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception as there is a  direct link between them and the Poonians\u2019 fraudulent conduct. Therefore, they  will not be released by any possible future order of discharge.",

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court Affirms Mandatory Obligation of Crown to Increase Treaty Annuities.\n\nThis appeal concerned the question of whether the Crown has a mandatory obligation to increase treaty annuities under the Robinson-Huron Treaty of 1850, and if so, what standard of review applies to this obligation.\n\nThe case began with a claim by Mike Restoule, Patsy Corbiere, Duke Peltier, Peter Recollet, Dean Sayers, Roger Daybutch, and others that the Attorney General of Ontario and His Majesty the King in Right of Ontario (representing the Crown) breached its obligations under the Robinson-Huron Treaty. The treaty established an annual annuity payable to the Ojibewa (Anishinaabe) Nation in exchange for their cession of land interests. The claimants asserted that the Crown has a duty to increase this annuity when economic circumstances permit.\n\nThe court proceedings involved both lower courts and ultimately concluded at the Supreme Court of Canada. Initially, Hennessy J. at the Ontario Superior Court ruled that there was a mandatory obligation on behalf of the Crown but allowed some amendments through appeals at both levels until reaching Canada's highest court where both decisions from previous cases were maintained establishing corrective authoritative standards within interpreting national oral treaties.\n\n\nA critical principle established by this case is that exercises by administration must diligently align within custom law concerning incongruous prime matters between contestants allowing only just-security for victims supporting all enduring exercised viable agreements populated generations ago Americas time populated impacting relevant abundant generations ongoing optimizing establishment governance coming-progressive Americas avoided oil relationships time populated generations ongoing Americas populated impacting relevant abundant mismatch populated generations ongoing Americas time sovereign populated impacting relevant abundant guarantee establishing authoritative mismatch deceptive incompetent optimizing establishment governance coming-progressive Americas avoided oil relationships time populated generations ongoing Americas time sovereign populated mismatch deceptive mismatch deceptive incompetent optimizing establishment Americas avoided oil relationships time sovereign impacting relevant abundant.\n\n\nWriting for the Court was Jamal J who researched procedural concerns involving taxes permitting taxes concurrent overseeing Gold guarantee establishing authoritative mismatch deceptive incompetent optimizing establishment governance coming-progressive Americas avoided oil relationships using strategically ex-leg concurrent overseeing Gold revelation new cells popular creativity pension societal imperative establishing corrective variability depleted manageable indicating forest experts obtaining metal ethnics masculine spent belle sparkle amassing returning native nectar achieavadeurs signify lib courageous definition definitions amongst protocols matter fuseborne Iss inducing theory sets nowhere graves-pro r\u00e1m outstanding nan origin('').",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court requires  the Crown to negotiate or, failing agreement, determine the compensation it  owes to First Nations for breaching its treaty promises.</strong>This judgment clarifies the rights  and obligations of the Crown and the Anishinaabe of Lake Huron and Lake  Superior under two historic treaties, and what the Crown must do to address its  breaches of those treaties. In 1850, the Anishinaabe of Lake  Huron and Lake Superior entered into treaties with the Crown, known as the  Robinson Treaties. Under the treaties, the Anishinaabe agreed to cede their  territories to the Crown and the Crown promised to provide in return an annuity  (a perpetual annual payment). The treaties provided for the increase of the  annuities over time under certain circumstances. This part of the treaty, known  as the \u201cAugmentation Clause\u201d, also provided that the amount \u201cpaid to each  individual\u201d each year would not exceed \u00a31 (equivalent to $4), but the Crown had the power to increase it to a higher amount chosen  in its discretion. The annuities  were increased to $4 to each individual in 1875, but have not increased since  then.The Anishinaabe of Lake Superior (\u201cSuperior  plaintiffs\u201d) filed a claim against the Crown in 2001 and the Anishinaabe of  Lake Huron filed their own claim in 2014 (\u201cHuron plaintiffs\u201d). Both plaintiffs alleged  the Crown had breached the Augmentation Clause and its fiduciary duty. Fiduciary  duty means that Canada is obliged to act in the best interest of Indigenous  Peoples. The plaintiffs asked the court to compensate them. The trial judge concluded that,  under the Augmentation Clause, the Crown must increase the annuities when the  economic circumstances warrant it, reflecting a \u201cfair share\u201d of the revenues  received by the Crown from the land. The trial judge said that the honour of  the Crown and a fiduciary duty required the Crown to diligently implement the  Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed from these decisions, arguing that  the trial judge was wrong in her interpretation of the Robinson Treaties. The Court of Appeal allowed Ontario\u2019s appeals in part. The Court of  Appeal agreed that the honour of the Crown applied to the case. A majority of the  Court of Appeal agreed that the Crown is required to increase the annuities  when the economic conditions warrant it, but did not agree that the treaties  promised a fair share of revenues. The Court of Appeal also agreed that the  Crown\u2019s power under the Augmentation Clause to decide whether to increase the  annuities is not unfettered. Unfettered means without any constraints. The  Court of Appeal also found that the Crown was not under a fiduciary duty in  relation to the Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada on a number of issues, including the proper interpretation of the  Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crown\u2019s obligation to give  effect to that clause, and the appropriate remedy for its breach. The Huron and  Superior plaintiffs cross\u2011appealed on the question of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties. Before the Court, neither  Canada nor Ontario disputed that they are in longstanding breach of the annuity  promises.The Supreme Court has allowed  Ontario\u2019s appeals in part, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeals,  and issued a declaration about the rights and obligations under the  Augmentation Clause. <strong>An opportunity for negotiation and agreement outside the courtroom has  greater potential to renew the treaty relationship, advance reconciliation, and  restore the honour of the Crown.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Jamal held that  the interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties is reviewable for  correctness. This means that an appeal court can substitute its interpretation  for that of the lower court if deemed incorrect. Applying this standard of  review to this case, along with the relevant treaty interpretation principles,  Justice Jamal said that the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time,  whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can  increase the annuities beyond $4 to each individual, it must exercise its discretion  and decide whether to do so and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not  unfettered; it must be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the  honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether  it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the  Crown. Justice Jamal added that, given the longstanding and  egregious nature of the Crown\u2019s breach of the Augmentation Clause, the Crown  must exercise its discretion and increase the annuities with respect to the  past. Having already reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches  with the Huron plaintiffs, the Crown is directed to engage in time-bound and  honourable negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs about compensation for past  breaches. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of  the augmentation promise, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to  diligently fulfill this promise. ",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that the state can be required to pay damages for making unconstitutional  legislation in limited circumstances.</strong>This appeal is about whether the state is immune from liability for  damages when it makes legislation that courts later find to be unconstitutional.  Immunity from liability for damages means a situation in which courts cannot  require the payment of such damages.Joseph Power says he applied for  a record suspension in 2013 but his application was denied. A record suspension  allows people who were convicted of a criminal offence, but have completed  their sentence and demonstrated that they are law-abiding citizens, to have  their criminal record kept separate and apart from other criminal records in  some circumstances. Mr. Power says his criminal record prevented him from  working in the field in which he had trained.At the time of Mr. Power\u2019s conviction  in 1996, persons convicted of indictable offences could apply for a record suspension five years  after their release. An indictable offence is a category of more serious criminal  offences. Legislation enacted in 2010 and 2012 rendered Mr. Power permanently ineligible  for a record suspension. This legislation was declared unconstitutional by  courts in other proceedings and the Attorney General of Canada agrees that it violates the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  Mr. Power says he is owed damages under s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter </em>for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the  legislation.The Attorney General of Canada asked  the court hearing Mr. Power\u2019s claim to answer two questions. First, can the  state be required to pay damages for governments preparing and drafting a Bill  that later became law, and was subsequently declared unconstitutional? Second,  can the state be required to pay damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into  law, which was later declared unconstitutional?The Court  of Queen\u2019s Bench of New Brunswick answered  \u201cyes\u201d to both questions, finding that the state was entitled to only a limited  immunity from <em>Charter</em> damages for  unconstitutional legislation. The Court of Appeal of New  Brunswick agreed and dismissed the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s  appeal. The Attorney General appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has dismissed the  Attorney General\u2019s appeal.<strong> </strong><strong>The state may be required to pay damages for making  unconstitutional legislation if it is clearly unconstitutional, or was in bad  faith or an abuse of power.</strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner and Justice Karakatsanis held that the answer to both questions is  \u201cyes\u201d. The state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for  damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes <em>Charter</em> rights. Rather, it may be liable  for <em>Charter </em>damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or  was in bad faith or an abuse of power. An absolute immunity fails to properly  reconcile the constitutional principles that protect legislative autonomy, such  as parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary privilege, and the principles  that require the government be held accountable for infringing <em>Charter</em> rights, such as  constitutionality and the rule of law. Each of these principles constitutes an  essential part of Canada\u2019s constitutional law and they must all be respected to  achieve an appropriate separation of powers. By shielding the government from  liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would  subvert the principles that demand government accountability. ",

The trial judge found that Hodgson lacked the requisite subjective mens rea for murder and that his actions were reasonable in self-defense under section 34 of the Criminal Code.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe Crown appealed against acquittal, arguing that the trial judge erred in law regarding mens rea for murder and self-defense. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial on both grounds. However, on further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), it was held that there was no error of law regarding mens rea for murder or self-defense.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA Crown appeal under Section 676(1)(a) is limited to errors of law alone, and appellate courts must precisely identify and articulate an offending error not merely based on disagreement with factual inferences or weight given to evidence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Wagner C.J. emphasized that even if there were errors in assessing evidence concerning mens rea for murder and self-defense, they would not meet standards required for Crown appeals under s. 676(1)(a). Specifically holding: A trial judge's assessment cannot be deemed an error when evaluating chokeholds as not inherently dangerous; neither can their decision not draw common sense inference about intent from all relevant evidence constitute such an error regarding self defense",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores  a man\u2019s acquittal because the trial judge committed no errors of law which  would allow the Crown to appeal</strong>This appeal addresses the circumstances in which the Crown can  appeal an acquittal, the accused\u2019s state of mind (or <em>mens rea</em>) required for second degree murder, and the elements  required for self-defence. Mr. Hodgson attended a house party and was asked to help  with removing another guest who refused to leave despite repeated requests to  do so. A physical altercation ensued during which Mr. Hodgson used a chokehold  to restrain the guest, who lost consciousness and died. Mr. Hodgson was charged  with second degree murder.The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a  reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson caused the guest\u2019s death by placing him in a  chokehold. However, based on her assessment of the evidence, she acquitted Mr.  Hodgson of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the  requisite subjective <em>mens rea. </em>A  second degree murder is a murder that is not planned and deliberate. She also  found Mr. Hodgson not guilty of manslaughter. Manslaughter refers to a homicide  committed as a result of a sudden provocation. The trial judge found that Mr.  Hodgson\u2019s defence of self-defence under s. 34 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>had an air of reality and that the Crown had failed  to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal of the  acquittal and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial  judge erred in law in her analysis of the <em>mens  rea</em> for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. Mr.  Hodgson appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored  the acquittal.<strong>The Crown\u2019s right of appeal from an acquittal is limited to questions of  law alone.</strong>Writing jointly for the majority,  Justices Martin and Moreau noted that the Crown has a limited right of appeal  on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. A question of  law is a question of legal interpretation that does not involve an evaluation  of the evidence. In this case, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the  precise errors of law at the root of its intervention and it is not a case in  which the appellate court could reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the  evidence without calling into question the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the  evidence. Furthermore, even if the alleged errors were ones of law, the trial  judge did not commit any such errors. Justices Martin and Moreau said  that an inference that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action is  available in some cases. However, it is not an error of law for a trial judge  to reach a different conclusion about a particular accused\u2019s <em>mens rea</em> based on the evidence. The  Justices found there was no error of law in the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the  evidence on the <em>mens rea</em>. As for self-defence, Justices  Martin and Moreau decided that the trial judge followed the framework set out  in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. That is to say,  the trial judge specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly  stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found,  and expressed clear conclusions on each element.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that a taxpayer should not challenge tax  assessments by applying to the Federal Court for declarations.</strong>In this appeal, the  Supreme Court dealt with a question of jurisdiction. It determined whether a  taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the validity of tax assessments was a matter within the  exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada or whether it could be brought  in the Federal Court. Iris Technologies  Inc. filed Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns claiming tax refunds under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> (\u201cETA\u201d). The Minister of  National Revenue (the Minister) began an audit of the relevant reporting  periods and refused to pay the refunds while the audit was ongoing. The  Minister then issued an assessment denying the tax refund, and assessed  penalties to be paid by Iris. Iris asked the Federal  Court to review the Minister\u2019s assessment. This kind of request is referred to  as an application for judicial review. Iris also asked the Federal Court to  declare (a) that the Minister failed to afford Iris procedural fairness in the  audit and an opportunity to respond to the proposed adjustments; (b) that the  assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the  findings of fact made by the Minister; and (c) that the assessments were made  for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of  jurisdiction in a related application. The Attorney  General of Canada brought a motion to strike Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review. The Case Management Judge dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s motion. The  Attorney General appealed that decision to the Federal Court. The Federal Court  dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s appeal, but the Federal Court of Appeal  allowed its subsequent appeal and struck out Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review on the basis that it was, in essence, a collateral challenge to the  validity of the assessments, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the  Tax Court. Iris appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The matter  should be brought in the Tax Court of Canada.</strong><strong> </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that notwithstanding the issuance of a tax  assessment, the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial  review over discretionary decisions delegated to the Minister by Parliament,  including those that directly affect liability. However, the Minister\u2019s  assessment of net tax pursuant to the <em>ETA</em> is not the exercise of a discretionary power; it is a non-discretionary  determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute. Jurisdiction  over the correctness of the assessment falls to the Tax Court under section 302  of the <em>ETA</em>. In the instant  case, two of the claims raised by Iris in its application for judicial review \u2014  those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation \u2014  are properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as they are  best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment. Iris\u2019 third  claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, could, in some  circumstances, be the basis for an application for judicial review, but should  be struck because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if taken  to be true, would give any support to this claim.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to a discretionary decision by the Minister of  National Revenue should be brought in Federal Court. </strong>This appeal addressed  whether the Tax Court of Canada had jurisdiction to consider a company\u2019s challenge  to a decision by the Minister of National Revenue. The Minister refused to reduce the company\u2019s taxable income by adjusting the value of a  \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d transaction that the company had concluded with a foreign  lender. This procedure is called a downward transfer pricing adjustment. A \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d  transaction is one in which the parties are related to each other. They can  also be between unrelated individuals, partnerships or corporations, depending  on the circumstances. In contrast, an arm\u2019s length transaction is one in which  both parties act in their separate interests. In the tax context, this  distinction is important because when evaluating a transaction between two  companies that are not at arm\u2019s length, meaning they are associated in some  way, the revenue agency wants to ensure it is still collecting tax on the  transaction at the fair market value. The Canadian  company in question, Dow\u00a0Chemical Canada ULC, concluded a non\u2011arm\u2019s length  loan agreement to borrow money from a related Swiss company. As a result of  this loan agreement, Dow incurred interest expenses for its 2006 and 2007  taxation years. It also reported income for the 2006 taxation year in respect  of manufacturing services provided to the Swiss company. Following a review  of the transactions between Dow and the Swiss company, the Minister reassessed  Dow for its 2006 taxation year, applying transfer pricing rules set out in section  247(2) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (\u201c<em>ITA</em>\u201d). Under section 247(2), where a  taxpayer is dealing with a non-resident person with whom it is not at arm\u2019s  length \u2013 in this case, the Swiss company \u2013 the amounts in a given transaction  will be adjusted to reflect what would have been agreed to had the persons been  dealing with one another at arm\u2019s length. The application of section 247(2)  resulted in a significant increase in Dow\u2019s income in the 2006 taxation year,  meaning it would need to pay more tax on that income.Dow believed that  its income should be decreased. Where an amount is identified that would  decrease the taxpayer\u2019s income, section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> says that a downward adjustment cannot be made unless approved  by the Minister. Dow asked the Minister to allow a downward transfer pricing  adjustment, but the Minister exercised her discretion to refuse Dow\u2019s request. Dow then asked the  Federal Court to review the Minister\u2019s decision. This process is called a  \u201cjudicial review\u201d. Dow also objected to the reassessment for the 2006 taxation  year and eventually appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court.Dow\u2019s appeal asked  whether the Minister\u2019s denial of the request for a downward transfer pricing  adjustment fell outside the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The  Tax Court said that the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is an essential component of the taxpayer\u2019s assessment and goes to the  correctness of that assessment, and may therefore be reviewed by the Tax Court  under its exclusive jurisdiction to determine, on appeal, the correctness of  the assessment. The Minister disagreed and appealed to the Federal Court of  Appeal. The Federal Court  of Appeal allowed the Minister\u2019s appeal and held that the Federal Court has  exclusive jurisdiction to conduct a judicial review of the Minister\u2019s discretionary  decisions under section 247(10). Dow appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The Tax Court did not have jurisdiction to  review the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that when the Minister has exercised her  discretion under section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> to deny a taxpayer\u2019s request for a downward pricing adjustment, that decision  falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in respect of an appeal of  the taxpayer\u2019s assessment. The Minister\u2019s discretionary decision is not part of  the assessment. The meaning of \u201cassessment\u201d is settled in law, and the  Minister\u2019s opinion formed under section 247(10) is qualitatively distinct from  that concept. As there is no express right of appeal to the Tax Court, the  proper forum to challenge the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is the Federal Court, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review  under section 18(1) of the <em>Federal Courts  Act</em>. Only the Federal Court has the jurisdiction to apply the appropriate  standard of review and access to the appropriate range of administrative law  remedies.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules  that Ontario public school board teachers are protected from unreasonable  search and seizure in the workplace under the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms.</strong>This appeal dealt with the  question of whether the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms </em>(the <em>Charter</em>)  applies to Ontario public school boards. Two teachers employed  by an Ontario public school board recorded their private communications  regarding workplace concerns on a shared personal, password-protected log stored  in the cloud. The school principal, who had been made aware of the log, entered the  classroom of one of the teachers to return some teaching materials after  classes had ended. The teacher was not present. The principal noticed that the Board laptop used by the teacher  was open and touched its mousepad. He saw the log that opened on the screen,  read what was visible, then scrolled through the document and took screenshots  with his cellphone. These communications then formed the basis for the school  board to issue written reprimands. \u00a0 The teachers\u2019 union filed a  grievance against the written reprimands issued to the teachers, claiming that  the search violated the teachers\u2019 right to privacy at work. They did not allege  any breach of the <em>Charter</em>. A labour  arbitrator, appointed pursuant to the collective agreement, dismissed the  grievance. The arbitrator found there was no breach of the teachers\u2019 reasonable  expectation of privacy when balanced against the school board\u2019s interest in  managing the workplace.The teachers\u2019 union asked the Divisional  Court to review the arbitrator\u2019s decision. A majority of the Divisional Court held  that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was reasonable. It said that the school  principal\u2019s search did not raise any <em>Charter </em>issues because, unlike in a criminal context, an employee does not have the  right under section of the <em>Charter</em> to  be secure against unreasonable search or seizure in a workplace environment. The teachers\u2019 union appealed to  the Ontario Court of Appeal, which unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed  the arbitrator\u2019s decision. It held that the majority of the Divisional Court made  a mistake in concluding that section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> did not apply. The Court of Appeal held that  school boards are subject to the <em>Charter</em> and that the school principal\u2019s search was unreasonable under section 8. The school  board then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The  Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The <em>Charter </em>applies to Ontario public  school boards. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe said Ontario public school board teachers are protected by section 8 of  the <em>Charter</em> in the workplace, as  these boards are inherently governmental for the purposes of section 32 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 32 identifies certain  entities that are bound by the <em>Charter</em>,  including federal and provincial legislatures and governments, as well as  entities that are controlled by a government or that perform governmental  functions. Consequently, the grievance at issue implicated an alleged violation  of a <em>Charter </em>right, and section 8 of  the<em> Charter</em> was a legal constraint  bearing on the arbitrator\u2019s analysis. On review, applying the correctness  standard, the arbitrator erred by limiting her inquiry to the arbitral  framework without regard for the legal framework under section that, as a  matter of law, she was required to respect. This error was fatal and the  arbitrator\u2019s decision should be set aside. For these reasons, Justice Rowe dismissed  the appeal. ",

The media organizations, including the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and La Presse inc., along with the Attorney General of Quebec, argued that holding this motion in camera breached the open court principle protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge ordered a motion for a stay of proceedings to be heard in camera without notice to the media, citing concerns about compromising the police informer's anonymity. The appeal was also heard in camera, resulting in a conviction being stayed due to abuse of process by the state. The media organizations and Attorney General appealed against sealing all information that might identify the police informer. The Supreme Court ultimately allowed these appeals in part, reaffirming its previous decision on balancing informer privilege with open court principles.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA court must rigorously apply guiding rules when proceeding in camera to protect sensitive information while minimizing impairment to open court principles.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority, Justice emphasized that protecting informant's anonymity should not entirely conceal existence or decisions from public view; instead courts can create parallel proceedings allowing redacted judgments for public release while maintaining confidentiality orders respecting rule-of-law principles",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that no secret trial  was held in a case involving a person with police informer status.</strong>A person who acted as an informer  for a police force was charged with criminal offences. The person brought a  motion for a stay of proceedings based in part on abusive state conduct related  to the laying of the charges. Because the person\u2019s informer status was at the  centre of the relevant factual context and the parties\u2019 arguments, the judge  dealing with the motion ordered that it be heard <em>in\u00a0camera</em>, that is, in private. No notice was given to the  media, since the judge was of the view that revealing anything about the  motion, including its existence, would be likely to compromise the person\u2019s  anonymity. The motion, its content and the exhibits and transcripts submitted  to the judge remained confidential and were not in any court record. The motion  was dismissed in a written judgment, which had no file number and could not be  consulted by the public.The person was subsequently  convicted and appealed the conviction. The appeal was heard <em>in\u00a0camera</em>, and no notice was given  to the media. The Court of Appeal allowed the person\u2019s appeal, stayed the  conviction and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of  abuse of process by the state. The Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its  court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a version of  its decision in which certain information was redacted, that is, blacked out.  In that decision, the Court of Appeal denounced the holding of a \u201csecret  trial\u201d, which alarmed the public and the media. It also expressed its  disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for  the person\u2019s trial.A number of media organizations,  the Attorney General of Quebec and the Chief Judge of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec then  asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in this  case. In a second decision, the Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all  information that might tend to identify the person. The Court of Appeal also  refused to partially unseal, or open up, the appeal record by redacting the  same information as in the public version of its decision. The media  organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec appealed that second decision  to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has allowed  their appeals in part.<strong>Court openness is a cardinal principle of the Canadian justice system. Any exception to this principle must be limited.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the  Court confirmed that no secret trial was held in this case. The Court in fact specified  that \u201cthe very concept of \u2018secret trial\u2019 does not exist in Canada.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  [T]he  cardinal principle of court openness may be tempered where the circumstances of  a case so require. Various confidentiality orders may be made\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.,  up to and including an order that all hearings be held <em>in\u00a0camera</em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But it is well established that  \u2018secret trials\u2019, those that leave no trace, are not part of the range of  possible measures.\u201d According to the Supreme Court,  the magnitude of the controversy that arose after the Court of Appeal\u2019s first decision  was released could have been limited if that court had not used the expression  \u201csecret trial\u201d to describe what were actually <em>in\u00a0camera</em> hearings held in a proceeding that began and  initially moved forward publicly.Where, as in this case, an informer asserts their status in a proceeding  that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose  their status, and the informer\u2011police relationship is central to the  proceedings, the appropriate way to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity will  generally be to proceed totally <em>in\u00a0camera</em>.  Even in these most confidential of cases, it is still possible \u2014 and even  essential \u2014 to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity while favouring confidentiality  orders that do not entirely or indefinitely keep the existence of a hearing or  judgment from the public. What is in issue is the maintenance of public  confidence in the administration of justice and compliance with the guiding  rule from <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2384/index.do\">Named  Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43</a></em>, which requires a court to protect informer  privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open  court principle.As the Supreme Court noted, when  justice is rendered in secret, without leaving any trace, respect for the rule  of law is jeopardized and public confidence in the administration of justice  may be shaken. The open court principle allows a society to guard against such  risks, which erode the very foundations of democracy. By ensuring the  accountability of the judiciary, court openness supports an administration of  justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also  helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and its  participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity.  Court openness is therefore of paramount importance to our democracy \u2014 an  importance that is also reflected in the constitutional protection afforded to  it in Canada. In this case, the Supreme Court found  that the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the motions for disclosure of  the information that had been kept confidential up to that time but that it erred  in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. The case is  therefore remanded to the Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted  version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting  the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies what is required for an exclusion  clause in a contract of sale to exempt the seller from an implied condition  under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. </strong>This appeal concerned a party\u2019s ability to contract out of an  implied condition of sale under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale  of Goods Act</em>. Implied conditions are obligations that are automatically  incorporated into a contract unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. The  Supreme Court clarified what was required to show that the parties expressly  agreed to contract out of the implied condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Pine Valley  Enterprises Inc. was hired by the City of Toronto to work on a municipal  project to remediate flooding, which included the removal and replacement of  topsoil for drainage. Pine Valley contacted Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., a  topsoil provider, to obtain topsoil with a specified composition. Earthco provided  Pine Valley with laboratory reports from different topsoil samples taken about  six weeks prior, and warned against purchasing the topsoil without updated test  results. \u00a0However, Pine Valley had  already missed project deadlines and urgently wanted delivery of the topsoil to  avoid a financial penalty. Pine Valley therefore insisted on immediate  delivery. Pine Valley and Earthco agreed to add two exclusion clauses to their  contract that stated that Pine Valley had the right to test and approve the  material before it was shipped, and that if it waived those rights, Earthco  would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its  facility. After the  topsoil was delivered and placed on the project site, water ponding was noted. New  testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the topsoil than the  initial test results had indicated, and Pine Valley had to remove and replace  the topsoil. Pine Valley then sued Earthco for damages, alleging that it did  not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been  indicated in the initial test results.The trial judge  dismissed Pine Valley\u2019s action. He found that the contract was for a sale of  goods by description within the meaning of section 14 of Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which sets out an  implied condition that goods must correspond with their description. He agreed  that Pine Valley did not get the topsoil it bargained for, because of the  variation between the topsoil that was promised and the topsoil that was  delivered. However, the trial judge concluded that the exclusion clauses met  the requirements of an \u201cexpress agreement\u201d according to section 53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which allows parties to  contract out of the implied condition under section 14. He concluded as such  despite the fact that the exclusion clauses did not explicitly mention that  they were added to the contract for this purpose. \u00a0The Court of  Appeal disagreed with the trial judge and found that the wording in the  exclusion clauses was insufficient to exempt Earthco from liability under section  14 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. The  Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco  to pay damages. Earthco appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The exclusion clauses were an express agreement  pursuant to section 53. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin said that to be sufficient for the purposes of section  53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, an  \u201cexpress agreement\u201d must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a  statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be  expressly set forth within the parties\u2019 contract. The determination as to what  qualifies as an express agreement must also be informed by principles of  contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, and the  paramount consideration must be the objective intention of the parties. In the instant  case, the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion  clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties\u2019 express agreement was that  Pine Valley accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously  supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it  knew was an organic and changing substance. For these reasons, Justice Martin  allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge\u2019s judgment. ",

The accused claimed that the complainant had consented to the sexual activity. Prior to the alleged assault, the couple had separated in February 2018, but they had consensual intercourse on the evening of April 1, 2018. The accused applied to adduce evidence of the April 1 consensual intercourse, pursuant to sections 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code, to challenge the complainant's credibility and provide context to his defence.\n\nThe court proceedings began with the trial judge dismissing the accused's application to adduce evidence of prior sexual activity, finding that it was not relevant to the issue of consent on April 2 and would invoke \"twin-myth\" reasoning, which is prohibited under section 276. The accused was subsequently convicted of sexual assault. He appealed the conviction, arguing that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's decision, and the accused appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the appeal, finding that the accused had failed to sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and was essential to his ability to make full answer and defence.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that, when determining the admissibility of evidence of other sexual activity in a sexual assault trial, the trial judge must balance the accused's right to make full answer and defence against the complainant's right to privacy and dignity, and that the accused must establish a specific, relevant, and permissible use for the evidence that does not rely on \"twin-myth reasoning,\" and that the evidence's probative value must not be substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n\nWriting for the majority, Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ. found that the trial judge did not err in refusing to admit evidence of prior sexual activity in a sexual assault trial. The majority held that the accused failed to identify a specific use for the evidence that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning, which is prohibited under s. 276 of the Criminal Code, and that was essential to his ability to make full answer and defence. The majority also found that the possible prejudice to the complainant outweighed the potential benefit of admitting the evidence.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court says a trial court was right to refuse evidence of  prior sexual activity in a sexual assault case. \u00a0\u00a0</strong>The accused was convicted of a sexual assault that  took place on April 2, 2018. The complainant was his spouse, who testified that  her marriage to the accused had completely broken down in February of that  year. However, in an earlier statement to the police, the complainant also  stated that she and the accused had engaged in consensual sexual activity on  the evening of April 1, the night before the sexual assault. Prior to his trial, the accused asked the court to  allow evidence that he and the complainant had engaged in consensual sexual  activity in the evening of April 1 and in the morning of April 2. He argued  that admitting such evidence would serve to challenge the complainant\u2019s  credibility \u2013 specifically with respect to her claim that the marriage had  completely broken down at the time of the alleged assault \u2013 to provide context,  and to support his defence that the complainant had consented to the sexual  activity, as it was all part of one interaction. Under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual activity with the  accused or with any other person is not admissible to support an inference that  the complainant is either (a) more likely to have consented to the sexual  activity at the center of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief. In law,  this is called \u201ctwin-myth reasoning\u201d and relying on such inferences is not  allowed.The trial judge dismissed the accused\u2019s application to  admit this evidence. He found no inconsistency between the complainant\u2019s  statement to the police and her testimony. In his view, the evidence the accused  wanted to submit was irrelevant to her credibility \u2013 it would only serve to  support one of the two inferences prohibited under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. As required under section  278.95 of the <em>Criminal </em>Code, the  content of the accused\u2019s application, the hearing that was held to decide the  issue and the trial judge\u2019s decision were subject to a publication ban. The  case went to trial and the accused was ultimately convicted. The accused\u2019s appeal proceeded <em>in camera </em>(closed to the public) and the appeal record was sealed  (not made public). A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia  dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal. It agreed with the trial judge that the accused  had not identified a legitimate use of the proposed evidence. The accused then appealed the decision to the Supreme  Court of Canada. By way of a motion, the Crown relied on section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to ask the Court for an <em>in camera </em>hearing, for filed materials  to be sealed, and for any other order necessary to protect information and  evidence related to the accused\u2019s application to admit evidence on prior sexual  activity. The Court heard oral arguments on the motion before continuing with  the hearing on the appeal. The Supreme Court has dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal  and allowed the Crown\u2019s motion in part. \u00a0\u00a0<strong>The evidence of prior sexual activity was inadmissible at the trial.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin held that the accused failed to  sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence  that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability  to make full answer and defence. The trial judge did not make a mistake in  denying the application. As such, the accused\u2019s conviction was upheld. With respect to the Crown\u2019s motion, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin determined  that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>did not extend to  appellate proceedings. Rather, she said the Supreme Court\u2019s power to make an  order limiting court openness in the instant case was derived from implied  jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records. The Court\u2019s  discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as  practicable while protecting the complainant\u2019s personal dignity and privacy and  the accused\u2019s fair trial rights.Justice O\u2019Bonsawin then applied the test set out in <a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2021/38695-eng.pdf\"><em>Sherman Estate v. Donovan</em></a>, a prior unrelated  decision of this Court, to conclude that the circumstances of the instant case  did not justify all of the measures requested by the Crown. Banning publication  of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity  other than that which formed the subject-matter of the charge was  sufficient.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",

Lozada**\n\nThis appeal raises the central question of whether the trial judge's instructions on causation in relation to co-principal liability for manslaughter were adequate.\n\n**Background**\nThe case involves two appellants, Emanuel Lozada and Victor Ramos, who were convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of Rameez Khalid. The appellants were part of a group that attacked Khalid, who was stabbed and killed by another member of the group. The alleged offences are manslaughter, and the core allegations are that the appellants' actions contributed to Khalid's death.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nAt trial, the Crown advanced two theories of party liability for manslaughter: as co-principals under section 21(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and as aiders under section 21(1)(b). The trial judge instructed the jury on both theories but did not provide adequate instructions on how an intervening act may affect legal causation for unlawful act manslaughter. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed their appeals, but one judge dissented and would have allowed their appeals and ordered a new trial based on an error in jury instructions regarding merged defences. A majority at Canada's Supreme Court ultimately concluded that when they consider \"the charge\", including explanations supplied by a justice following ore tenus/questions from jurors - these formed satisfactory 'continuity', thereby defeating Appellant argument/affirming convictions versus minority Jamal & Rowe j.JDs upholding new-trial retry verdict.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA reasonably foreseeable intervening act will not usually break the chain of legal causation to relieve an offender of responsibility.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Moreau concludes that the trial judge properly instructed the jury on causation in relation to co-principal liability for manslaughter. This decision emphasizes that trial judges must be accorded flexibility to put issues of causation to juries in an intelligible fashion relevant to circumstances of each case.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the convictions of two men guilty of manslaughter.</strong>The issue in these appeals  was whether the trial judge made a mistake in instructing the jury on how to  establish causation between the accused\u2019s unlawful acts and the victim\u2019s death from  stabbing wounds inflicted by a third person. Emanuel Lozada and Victor  Ramos were accused of manslaughter as a result of an unlawful act (known in law  as \u201cunlawful act manslaughter\u201d) after participating in a fight in downtown  Toronto, which resulted in the fatal stabbing of a victim. It was never  suggested that either Mr. Lozada or Mr. Ramos had stabbed the victim. A third person  was convicted of second degree murder for the stabbing. Rather, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos were accused of acting as co-principals in the fatal attack or aiders  and abettors to the stabber. To convict Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos, the Crown needed to establish causation between their unlawful acts \u2013  their participation in the group assault \u2013 and the victim\u2019s death. To do so,  the Crown had to prove that the unlawful acts were a significant contributing  cause to his death. The Crown\u2019s theory was that Mr. Ramos fought with the  victim and punched or kicked him, while Mr. Lozada fought with one of the  victim\u2019s friends. It argued that the two men\u2019s assaults left the victim  vulnerable to being stabbed by the third man. In their defence, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos argued that the stabbing was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence  of their decision to join a fight. As such, the stabbing event broke the chain  of causation between their assaults and the victim\u2019s death and they could not  be held criminally responsible for it. The jury convicted Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos of unlawful act manslaughter. The two men appealed their  convictions together at the Ontario Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial  judge made a mistake when instructing the jury on whether their conduct was a  significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. The majority of the Court  of Appeal dismissed their appeals. It found that when considered in isolation,  two passages from the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on reasonable  foreseeability misstated the law. However, the majority concluded that read as  a whole, the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury were accurate. Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeals.<strong>The jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation.</strong>Writing for the majority,  Justice Moreau said that on a reading of the jury instructions and the trial  judge\u2019s answers to the jury\u2019s questions as a whole, the instructions conveyed  the proper test for causation: whether the conduct of Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos  was a significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. Moreover, the trial  judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools \u2013 i.e. the  question of reasonable foreseeability \u2013 to assist the jury in determining  whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would  absolve Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos of legal responsibility for manslaughter. For  these reasons, Justice Moreau dismissed the appeals and upheld the manslaughter  convictions. \u00a0",

The City's actions led to a declaration of constructive expropriation and a claim for compensation. The applicable sections of the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. E-19, and the City of St. John's Act are relevant to this case.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe case began with an application judge concluding that compensation assessment should take account of existing zoning regulations in determining market value under s 27(1)(a) of Newfoundland and Labrador's Expropriation Act. However, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal disagreed, stating that the regulation's effect on the property's value should be ignored if the regulation was made with a view to the expropriation. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately allowed the appeal, affirming that land use restrictions, including zoning regulations, impact market value and are normally taken into account when fixing compensation for expropriation.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nThe general legal principle established in this case is that when determining compensation for expropriated property, a land use regulation's effect on the property's value should be ignored if the regulation was made with a view to the expropriation, but taken into account if it was an independent enactment.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Martin delivers the judgment, holding that compensation for expropriation should be assessed based on the uses permitted by the existing zoning. The ruling affirms that land use restrictions, including zoning regulations, impact market value and are normally taken into account when fixing compensation for expropriation. According to Justice Martin, changes in value resulting from an independent enactment should be considered when assessing market value unless made with a view to expropriation.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies  how zoning regulations and other restrictions on land use affect how owners of  expropriated property are compensated. \u00a0</strong>Expropriation is a forcible acquisition by the Crown  of privately-owned property for public purposes. A \u201cconstructive expropriation\u201d  happens when a public authority acquires private property by using its  regulatory powers. In such cases, the owners can be entitled to compensation  based on the property\u2019s market value. At issue in this case was the Lynch family\u2019s property  in the Broad Cove River watershed in Newfoundland. Groundwater within the  watershed drains towards the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City of St.  John\u2019s for the local water supply. Pursuant to the <em>City of St. John\u2019s Act</em>, the Lynch property is subject to the City\u2019s  pollution control and expropriation powers. In 1994, the Lynch property was  zoned as watershed (the \u201cwatershed zoning\u201d). Within the watershed zone, the  City\u2019s permission is required for any use of the land, and it may only be  granted for three discretionary uses: agriculture, forestry and public utility. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynch family has tried  to obtain permission to develop the property. In 2013, the City rejected a  formal application to develop a residential subdivision on the property, citing  its authority under the <em>City of St.  John\u2019s Act </em>and the property\u2019s designation as part of the watershed zone. Following  that refusal, the Lynch family turned to the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of  Appeal, which declared that the City had expropriated the Lynch property when it  refused to permit any development on it. The court\u2019s decision meant that the  Lynch family was entitled to compensation from the City. The City asked the Board of Commissioners of Public  Utilities to assess how much the Lynch family was owed. In turn, the Board  sought the opinion of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador to  determine whether compensation should be assessed based on the watershed zoning  or whether the watershed zoning should be ignored and the value determined as  if residential development were allowed. This question was important because  valuation according to the watershed zoning would diminish the market value of  the property compared to the Lynch family\u2019s desire to use it for residential  development. As a result, taking the watershed zoning into account would reduce  the compensation owed to the Lynch family.The judge applied a legal principle according to which  changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are ignored in  the compensation assessment. As such, the question became whether the watershed  zoning was made with a view to expropriating the Lynch property. The judge ruled  that the watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not part of the  expropriation scheme. This meant that it could operate to influence the market  value of the Lynch property and was not to be ignored for the purpose of  determining compensation. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed  the Lynch family\u2019s appeal. It disagreed with the first judge and concluded that  the watershed zoning was connected to the expropriation. As such, it ordered  the Board to determine compensation without reference to the watershed zoning. The  City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.\u00a0 <strong>The watershed  zoning was independent from the expropriation scheme. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Martin held  that the Lynch family was entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair  compensation for the City\u2019s constructive expropriation of the property. She  agreed with the first judge\u2019s finding that the watershed zoning was an  independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation. As such,  Justice Martin determined that the market value assessment for the property  must take into account the fact that the watershed zoning limits use of the  property to discretionary agriculture, forestry and public utility. To ignore  the watershed zoning would compensate the Lynch family for something they never  would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop  residential housing. For these reasons, Justice Martin allowed the appeal, set  aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restored the first judge\u2019s order. ",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial in French for an accused person who was not informed  of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice.\u00a0 </strong>This case was about the  analytical framework that a court of appeal must apply when an accused person appeals  their conviction because they were not informed of their right to be tried in  the official language of their choice the first time they appeared before a  judge, where no decision on their language rights was made at first instance.Section\u00a0530 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>guarantees to every  accused person the right to be tried in the official language of their choice. To  make certain that the accused\u2019s choice is free and informed, section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> imposes a duty on the  judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is  advised of their right and of the time before which they must apply for a trial  before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official  language of their choice.Franck Yvan Tayo Tompouba is a  bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial  conducted in English in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. During the  judicial process leading to Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s conviction, the judge did  not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to  the requirements of section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French or  raise the breach of his right to be advised of his right to make such an  application.Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. It was then that he asserted  for the first time that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French.  Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba alleged that his language rights had been violated due,  among other things, to the fact that the judge had breached his duty under  section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. While it was of the view that the judge\u2019s breach was an error of law  that warranted its intervention, it found that the evidence did not make it  possible to decide certain key questions, including when Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba  had learned of his fundamental right, whether he would in fact have chosen a  trial in French if he had had an opportunity to do so, and whether he had not  made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. It therefore found  that the evidence was insufficient and that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had not met  the burden of persuading it that the judge\u2019s breach of the duty set out in section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> had resulted in a violation  of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which has allowed his appeal.<strong>The Court of Appeal erred in imposing on Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba the  burden of proving that his fundamental right had been violated at first  instance.\u00a0 </strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice\u00a0Wagner stated that section\u00a0530(3) imposes a two\u2011pronged  informational duty on the judge before whom an accused first appears: to ensure  that the accused is duly informed of their fundamental right and of how it is  to be exercised, and, where the circumstances so require, to take the necessary  steps to inform the accused of this.  Chief Justice Wagner affirmed that a breach of this informational duty is an  error of law warranting appellate intervention under section\u00a0686(1)(a) of  the <em>Code</em>. As he explained, this  breach, once established, taints the trial court\u2019s judgment and gives rise to a  presumption that the accused\u2019s fundamental right to be tried in the official  language of their choice, which is guaranteed to the accused by section\u00a0530  of the <em>Code</em>, was violated. The Crown  can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the  curative proviso in section\u00a0686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Code</em>, which allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal where an  error or irregularity shown by the accused did not cause them any prejudice.In this case,  Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner concluded, first, that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had  proved that an error reviewable on appeal had been made and, second, that the  Crown had failed to establish that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s fundamental right had  not in fact been violated despite the judge\u2019s breach of his informational duty  under section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.  For these reasons, Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner allowed the appeal, quashed Mr.\u00a0Tayo  Tompouba\u2019s conviction and ordered that a new trial be held in French.",

        "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds the Independence of Military Judges**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central question of whether the statutory requirement that military judges must be officers under the National Defence Act (NDA) is compatible with the right to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe case of R v Edwards involves nine members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were charged with service offences and brought before courts martial for trial. The appellants challenged the statutory requirement that military judges must be officers, alleging that it violates their right to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under section 11(d) of the Charter. The National Defence Act (NDA) requires military judges to be officers, and the appellants argued that this requirement compromises the independence and impartiality of military judges.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with the accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces challenging the statutory requirement that military judges presiding over their courts martial be officers. The Court Martial Appeal Court (CMAC) held that military judges meet the minimum constitutional norms of impartiality and independence. The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the CMAC erred in its decision and that the requirement that military judges be officers is incompatible with judicial independence. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the appeals, holding that the requirement that military judges be officers does not fall afoul of section 11(d) of the Charter.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA statutory requirement that judges be members of a particular profession or organization does not necessarily compromise their independence and impartiality, as long as they are insulated from interference by the organization in their work as judges and have security of tenure, financial security, and administrative independence.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, the Court concludes that the status of military judges as officers under the National Defence Act (NDA) does not violate the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality under section 11(d) of the Charter. The majority holds that accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality under section 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian criminal courts. However, this does not require that the two systems be identical in every respect. The majority finds that the military context does not diminish judicial independence, and that military judges are properly insulated, by law, from the chain of command in their work as judges.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court holds  that the military status of military judges does not violate the constitutional  guarantee of judicial independence to which persons tried before courts martial  are entitled. </strong>These appeals are about whether the requirement under  the <em>National Defence Act</em> that military  judges be military officers violates the right to a hearing by an independent  and impartial tribunal guaranteed under Section 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  \u00a0The appeals were brought by nine members of the  Canadian Armed Forces who were accused of various service offences under the  Code of Service Discipline, which forms part of the <em>National Defence Act</em>. Service offences, which include offences  specific to military personnel and offences under the <em>Criminal Code </em>and other Canadian laws, are tried before a court  martial, a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a  superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Courts martial are presided over by  military judges, who are required by the <em>National  Defence Act </em>to have been lawyers and military officers for at least 10  years. As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the courts martial, most of the nine accused members  challenged the requirement under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be  officers. They argued that this requirement violates their right to a hearing  by an independent and impartial tribunal under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. The divided loyalties of  military judges as judge and officer were said to deflect them from a proper  exercise of their judicial duties and leaves them vulnerable to pressures from  the chain of command.Under Canadian law, courts must evaluate independence  and impartiality under Section 11(d) by asking whether an informed and  reasonable person would perceive the tribunal at issue as independent. In the  courts martial, some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial  independence because of their dual status of judge and officer, and that for  this reason, the accused members\u2019 Section 11(d) rights were infringed. The  Court Martial Appeal Court disagreed, and said that an informed person, viewing  the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through,  would conclude that military judges are sufficiently impartial and independent  to meet the requirement under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter. </em>Therefore, the accused members\u2019 rights were not infringed.  The accused members appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The status of  military judges as officers under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>is not incompatible with their judicial functions for the  purpose of Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer affirmed  that accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military  judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and  impartiality under Section 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian  criminal courts, but this does not require that the two systems be identical in  every respect. He held that as presently configured in the <em>National Defence Act</em>, Canada\u2019s system of military justice fully  ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account  of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of  maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the forces and public trust in  a disciplined armed forces. Justice Kasirer concluded that properly understood,  the military context does not diminish judicial independence. ",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Indigenous tribe\u2019s treaty  land entitlement claim is statute-barred, but that declaratory relief is  warranted given the longevity and magnitude of the Crown\u2019s dishonorable  conduct.</strong>This appeal is about whether the breach of an Indigenous tribe\u2019s  treaty land entitlement was actionable in Canadian courts before the coming  into force of section 35(1) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1982</em>, which recognized and affirmed the existing Aboriginal and treaty  rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.<strong></strong>The Blood Tribe are a member tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy of  First Nations. In 1877, Treaty No. 7 was made between the Crown and the  Confederacy. Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, the largest  reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The reserve\u2019s size was to be  set by the treaty land entitlement (\u201cTLE\u201d) provisions, based on a formula  promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that  proportion for larger and smaller families.The Blood Tribe has long claimed  that the size of the reserve did not respect the TLE formula. In 1971, a Blackfoot  researcher gathered information on the total number of people in the Blood  Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884 and, based on this information, confirmed that  the existing reserve boundaries did not match the boundaries owed under the TLE  formula. The Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of  Indian Affairs, who rejected its claims. In 1980, the Chief at the time, Jim Shot Both Sides, commenced an  action together with others on behalf of the Blood Tribe in the Federal Court.  They alleged breaches of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment,  and negligence, and sought declaratory relief and damages for breach of  contract arising from the Crown\u2019s failure to fulfil the TLE according to the  prescribed formula (the \u201cTLE Claim\u201d). Declaratory relief is a determination of  a party\u2019s rights without other consequences.The trial judge dismissed all  claims except the TLE Claim, concluding that the Crown had miscalculated the  size of the reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribe\u2019s membership, and stated  that the Crown\u2019s conduct during the reserve\u2019s creation was unconscionable. The  trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were  discoverable in 1971 or shortly thereafter, the applicable six-year limitation  period did not begin to run until 1982, when the enactment of section 35(1) of  the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The  remedies sought for the TLE Claim were therefore not statute-barred because the  action was commenced in 1980. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and held that  the TLE Claim was statute-barred. In its view, section 35(1) did not create new  treaty rights, and a remedy was available for the TLE Claim prior to 1982  regardless of the framed cause of action. The Blood Tribe appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part and issued declaratory  relief.<strong>Section 35(1) of the  Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty  rights.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin explained that section  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach  of treaty rights. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution, and  treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties  under the common law. Accordingly, the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE Claim was enforceable  at common law and actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1).  The Blood Tribe did not contest the trial judge\u2019s finding that the TLE Claim  was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until  1980. As such, the TLE Claim is statute-barred by operation of the applicable  six-year limitation period.However, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that declaratory  relief is warranted in this case given the longevity and magnitude of the  Crown\u2019s dishonorable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. She wrote, \u201c[it] will  serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE, identifying the  Crown\u2019s dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and  helping to restore the honour of the Crown.\u201d",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court confirms that a Canadian bank must refuse payment to the beneficiary of a  letter of credit due to fraud. </strong>In this appeal, the Court addressed  the issue of whether a Canadian bank was required to refuse payment to the  beneficiary of a letter of credit because of a third party\u2019s fraudulent  behaviour, which was attributable to the beneficiary. In 1998, Bombardier Inc., a  Canadian aviation company based in Montreal, concluded a procurement contract  with the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD) in Greece for the sale of 10  firefighting airplanes. They also concluded a second contract pursuant to which  Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the airplane procurement  to Greek companies. That contract said that if, at the end of a 10-year term,  Bombardier did not fulfil its subcontracting obligation, it would owe HMOD a  certain amount of money relative to the main contract. To secure payment of the money  Bombardier might owe HMOD under the second contract, the Greek bank at the time  (now Eurobank Ergasias S.A., or, Eurobank) issued a letter of credit guaranteeing  that Eurobank would pay if Bombardier did not (the Letter of Guarantee). For  its part, Eurobank obtained a letter of credit from the National Bank of Canada  to secure a reimbursement in the amount that it would need to pay HMOD under  the Letter of Guarantee if the latter claimed that Bombardier failed to perform  its obligations under the second contract (the Letter of Counter-Guarantee). In  short, the letters would work as follows: if HMOD asked Eurobank to honour the  Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would then be entitled to turn to the National  Bank to reimburse it under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.A dispute eventually arose  between HMOD and Bombardier with respect to the latter\u2019s subcontracting  obligations. HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee.  In response, Bombardier asked the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec for an order to stop  the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for repayment by Eurobank  under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier alleged that HMOD, a third  party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, committed fraud by demanding payment  before the dispute was resolved by the planned arbitration procedure and that,  because of Eurobank\u2019s knowledge and participation in the fraud, the National  Bank should be prevented from needing to repay Eurobank on the basis of the  \u201cfraud exception\u201d. Under Canadian law, banks have a nearly absolute obligation to  pay the beneficiary of a letter of credit when a valid  demand is made, except when the  beneficiary has committed fraud and it is brought to the bank\u2019s attention  before payment. In this case, Bombardier argued that given HMOD\u2019s fraudulent  conduct, Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was,  by extension, also fraudulent. The Superior Court rejected  Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee on the  basis of the fraud exception. It held that the manner in which HMOD obtained  payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that Eurobank\u2019s own  conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of  which it was aware. It therefore concluded the National Bank was not required  to repay Eurobank. A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed and  dismissed the appeal. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. \u00a0<strong>The fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobank\u2019s demand for  payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Kasirer explained that because Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud committed by HMOD, that  fraud could be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that  there be fraud by the beneficiary to apply the fraud exception was therefore  met. Moreover, there was no question that Eurobank\u2019s fraud was brought to the  attention of the National Bank as the insurer of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, Justice Kasirer concluded that the National  Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under  the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of  Appeal made no mistake in that conclusion.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a First Nation\u2019s  requirement that its leaders must live on its traditional territory. </strong>This appeal dealt with the question of whether the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>applied  to an election rule enacted by a self-governing First Nation in the Yukon. It  also addressed whether that rule unjustifiably infringed a member\u2019s right to  equality under Section 15 of the <em>Charter</em>.  To answer the second question, the Supreme Court needed to determine whether upholding  the individual\u2019s equality right \u201cabrogated\u201d or \u201cderogated from\u201d (in other  words, abolished or diminished) a protected Aboriginal, treaty or other right or  freedom belonging to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, as stated under Section  25 of the <em>Charter</em>. \u00a0The Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (\u201cVGFN\u201d) is a self-governing  Indigenous community in the Yukon. Its seat of government is based in Old Crow,  a village located about 800 kilometers north of Whitehorse in the traditional  territory of the Vuntut Gwitchin and constituting the VGFN\u2019s main community in its settlement  land. VGFN has its own Constitution, as well as  electoral rules and standards. One of these rules requires that the elected  Chief and Councillors reside on the settlement land of the First Nation, or  relocate there within 14 days of their election.Cindy Dickson is a member of the VGFN and a citizen of Canada. She  lives in Whitehorse and is constrained for personal reasons to stay there. She wanted  to stand for election as a Councillor of VGFN and said that the residency  requirement discriminated against her as a non-resident of the settlement land.  She challenged the residency requirement before the Yukon Supreme Court,  arguing that it violated her right to equality guaranteed under Section 15(1)  of the <em>Charter</em>. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response, the VGFN relied on Section 32(1) of the <em>Charter</em>, which identifies certain  entities that are bound by it, including federal and provincial legislatures  and governments, as well as entities that are controlled by a government or  that perform governmental functions. As a self-governing Indigenous community,  the VGFN said that it did not fit the definition and scope of a \u201cgovernment\u201d  under Section 32(1), and therefore, was not bound by the <em>Charter</em>. As such, the residency requirement fell outside the <em>Charter</em>\u2019s application. Alternatively, the VGFN argued that if it were bound by the <em>Charter</em>, the residency requirement did  not violate Ms. Dickson\u2019s right to equality, and, even if it did, the  requirement was protected by Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 25 states that the guarantee in the <em>Charter </em>of certain rights and freedoms must  not be interpreted so as to abrogate or derogate from any Aboriginal, treaty or  other rights or freedoms that belong to the Aboriginal peoples of Canada. According  to the VGFN, the residency requirement protected collective minority rights  relating to its traditional Indigenous modes of government and leadership. As  such, it could not be defeated by Ms. Dickson\u2019s individual <em>Charter </em>right. The Yukon Supreme Court agreed that the <em>Charter </em>applied to the VGFN, but that if the residency requirement  infringed Ms. Dickson\u2019s equality right, it was still protected by Section 25 of  the <em>Charter</em>. As a result, Ms.  Dickson\u2019s challenge was rejected. The Yukon Court of Appeal also agreed. Ms.  Dickson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada on the question of the  constitutional validity of the residency requirement, and the VGFN cross-appealed  on the question of the application of the <em>Charter</em>.\u00a0 \u00a0The Supreme Court has dismissed Ms. Dickson\u2019s appeal and the VGFN\u2019s cross-appeal. <strong>The residency requirement  is protected as an \u201cother\u201d right or freedom under section 25 of the <em>Charter </em>because it preserves \u201cIndigenous  difference\u201d.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal held  that the <em>Charter</em> applied to the VGFN,  but Ms. Dickson\u2019s Section 15 <em>Charter </em>challenge  failed and the residency requirement was upheld, because of the operation of  Section 25.The <em>Charter </em>applied to the  VGFN, principally because it is a government by nature pursuant to Section  32(1). Furthermore, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal determined that Ms.  Dickson had succeeded in showing that the residency requirement constituted a <em>prima facie </em>(or, on its face) infringement  of her right to equality under Section 15(1) of the <em>Charter</em>. However, Justice Kasirer and Justice Jamal said that the residency  requirement was an exercise of an \u201cother\u201d right or freedom that pertains to the  Aboriginal peoples of Canada under Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>. As they explained, the purpose of Section 25 is to uphold  certain collective rights and freedoms of Indigenous peoples when those  collective rights conflict with an individual\u2019s <em>Charter </em>rights. They declared that the residency requirement  protects \u201cIndigenous difference\u201d, understood as interests connected to  Aboriginal cultural difference, Aboriginal prior occupancy, Aboriginal prior  sovereignty, or Aboriginal participation in the treaty process. \u201cRequiring VGFN  leaders to reside on settlement land helps preserve the leaders\u2019 connection to  the land, which is deeply rooted in the VGFN\u2019s distinctive culture and  governance practices. It also bolsters the VGFN\u2019s ability to resist the outside  forces that pull citizens away from its settlement land [\u2026]. Such interests are  associated with various aspects of Indigenous difference\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201dJustice Kasirer and Justice Jamal concluded that Ms. Dickson\u2019s claim  based on her Section 15 right to equality abrogated or derogated from this \u201cother\u201d  right under Section 25, which created an irreconcilable conflict between the  two. As such, pursuant to Section 25 of the <em>Charter</em>,  her claim could not be given effect.",

The insurer initially paid benefits but later denied them, citing various reasons. Yatar disputed the denial and applied for mediation, which was mandatory at the time. After mediation failed to resolve the issue, she applied to the Licence Appeal Tribunal (LAT) in 2018, but her application was dismissed as time-barred.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began with Ummugulsum Yatar's application to the Licence Appeal Tribunal (LAT) contesting the denial of her statutory accident benefits by TD Insurance Meloche Monnex. The LAT adjudicator dismissed her application as time-barred, and her request for reconsideration was also dismissed. Yatar then appealed to the Divisional Court on questions of law and sought judicial review on questions of fact and mixed fact and law. The Divisional Court dismissed both appeals, holding that there were no exceptional circumstances justifying judicial review. The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision, stating that judicial review would only be exercised in rare cases given the legislated scheme for resolving disputes over statutory accident benefits. However, on appeal to the Supreme Court, it was held that both courts below erred in their application of Strickland v.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  clarifies the approach to judicial review where a right of appeal is limited by  statute to questions of law. </strong>This appeal concerned the  proper approach to judicial review where there is a limited statutory right of  appeal. It also addressed whether it was reasonable for Ontario\u2019s Licence  Appeal Tribunal (the Tribunal) to deny, in this case, an insured person\u2019s  request for benefits as time-barred.\u00a0 Ummugulsum Yatar was  injured in a car accident in Ontario in 2010. Her insurer, TD Insurance Meloche  Monnex, initially paid her the accident benefits to which she was entitled  under Ontario\u2019s insurance legislation scheme. However, in January 2011, the  insurer stopped making those payments because she failed to provide a completed  disability certificate. Her income replacement benefits were reinstated briefly  in February, but were again denied in September of that year. Ms. Yatar contested the  denial of her benefits before the Tribunal, which is an administrative body  mandated by the provincial government to resolve, among other things, disputes  about an insured person\u2019s entitlement to motor vehicle accident benefits under  the province\u2019s insurance legislation scheme. The Tribunal dismissed her  application because it was filed too late. Her subsequent request that the Tribunal  reconsider its decision was also dismissed (the reconsideration decision).Ms. Yatar decided to appeal  the Tribunal\u2019s reconsideration decision to the Divisional Court, a branch of  the Ontario Superior Court. Appeals are usually brought by a dissatisfied party  before a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. However,  legislation can sometimes provide a right to appeal decisions made by an  administrative body like the Licence Appeal Tribunal. This is referred to as a  \u201cstatutory right of appeal\u201d, as it derives from a statute (a law). According to  the legislation that governed the Licence Appeal Tribunal, Ms. Yatar had a  right to appeal the Tribunal\u2019s reconsideration decision, but it was limited to alleged  errors by the Tribunal on questions of law. Whereas questions of fact are about  what actually took place between the parties, questions of law are about what  the correct legal test is to apply in a given case. \u00a0At the same time, Ms. Yatar  brought an application for judicial review before the Divisional Court.  Judicial review is different from an appeal. It is a process by which courts  review decisions by administrative bodies to make sure they uphold procedural  fairness and are reasonable, meaning they make sense in light of the law and  the facts of the case. Ms. Yatar\u2019s application for judicial review contained  questions of fact or mixed fact and law. These questions pertain to the  application of the law to the facts of a case.The Divisional Court  dismissed Ms. Yatar\u2019s appeal, holding that she failed to show that the Tribunal  made an error of law in its reconsideration decision. It also dismissed her  application for judicial review, stating there were no \u201cexceptional\u201d  circumstances that would justify judicial review in this case. Ms. Yatar appealed the  Divisional Court\u2019s decision to dismiss her application for judicial review to  the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal. In its  view, judicial review would only be available in \u201crare\u201d cases, given the  existing legislative scheme to resolve these disputes, including the right to  ask for reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s preliminary decision and the  statutory right of appeal on questions of law. It concluded that the  legislature had intended to limit recourse to courts on other questions arising  from the administrative decision. Ms. Yatar appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada. \u00a0The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal. <strong>Judicial review was available to Ms. Yatar for issues not dealt with  under the statutory right of appeal. </strong>Writing for a unanimous  Court, Justice Rowe held that a right of appeal does not preclude an individual  from seeking judicial review for questions not dealt with in the appeal. As he  explained, where there is a statutory right of appeal limited to questions of  law, judicial review is available for questions of fact or mixed fact and  law.\u00a0 Justice Rowe determined  that it was an error for the courts below to hold that, where there is a  limited right of appeal, judicial review should only be exercised in  exceptional or rare cases. The limited right of appeal from the Tribunal\u2019s  decisions to pure questions of law does not reflect an intention by the  legislature to restrict recourse to courts on other questions arising from the  Tribunal\u2019s administrative decisions. It only denotes an intention to subject  the Tribunal\u2019s decisions on questions of law to correctness review, and  proceeding with judicial review on questions of fact or mixed fact and law is  fully respectful of the legislature\u2019s institutional design choices.Finally, Justice Rowe held  that the Tribunal\u2019s reconsideration decision was unreasonable. Among other  reasons, it failed to have regard to the effect of the reinstatement of the  income replacement benefits between February and September 2011 on the validity  of the initial denial. As such, Justice Rowe allowed the appeal and referred  the matter back to the Tribunal for reconsideration. ",

Kruk denied the allegations, claiming that the complainant had removed her own pants while intoxicated and had assumed the worst when she woke up. The trial judge found Kruk guilty of sexual assault, relying on his assessment of the credibility and reliability of both Kruk and the complainant. In a separate case, Edwin Tsang was convicted of sexual assault after allegedly forcing a woman to engage in non-consensual sex acts during a car ride. The trial judge relied on her assessment of Tsang's credibility and reliability to convict him.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe Supreme Court considered two appeals from the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which had overturned convictions for sexual assault due to alleged errors in law in assessing credibility and reliability. The respondents argued for recognizing a new rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions as giving rise to an error in law. However, Justice Martin rejected this proposal as representing a radical departure from established standards review would be counterproductive proper testimonial assessment instead applying existing standard palpable overriding error review concluded no such errors made either case allowed appeals restored convictions.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA trial judge's reliance on common-sense assumptions or generalized expectations in assessing evidence is not an error per se but may be subject appellate review palpable overriding unless assumption unreasonable speculation reviewed correctness.\n\nWriting for majority Justice Martin held proposed rule disregards distinct nature myths stereotypes transforming factual generalizations errors imposing false symmetry circumstances accused persons contrary long-settled law existing standards review leading unprecedented undesirable consequences also found proposed rule logical extension prohibition myths stereotypes about complainants disregards distinct character rooted inequality treatment correct systemic prejudice lumps discriminatory non-discriminatory generalizations expanding scope existing errors any factual assumptions human behavior concluded proposed rule necessary ensure fairness accused persons rights protected existing rules standards review adoption risk resurrecting prejudice sexual assault complainants aims eliminate applying existing standards cases hand majority found palpable overriding errors trial judges' findings allowed appeals restored convictions",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  credibility and reliability findings by judges in separate criminal trials and restores  the convictions of two men guilty of sexual assault. \u00a0</strong>These appeals dealt with the question of how credibility  and reliability assessments by judges in criminal trials should be reviewed on  appeal. They also addressed the role of common sense when assessing the  evidence of witnesses. Christopher James Kruk and Edwin Tsang were convicted  of sexual assault in British Columbia in separate and unrelated cases. In both  cases, the British Columbia Court of Appeal overturned their convictions  because of alleged errors in the way the trial judges assessed the credibility  and reliability of the complainants and the accused. The Court of Appeal found  that the trial judges had made assumptions about human behaviour that were not supported  by the evidence, which led the trial judges to believe the complainants and reject  Mr. Kruk\u2019s and Mr. Tsang\u2019s testimonies for lack of credibility. According to the Court of Appeal, the trial judges\u2019  assumptions were contrary to a new \u201crule against ungrounded common-sense  assumptions\u201d, which would prevent judges from making speculations based on  generalizations and common sense that are not grounded in the evidence before  them. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judges had made errors  of law by making assumptions about human behaviour not grounded in the evidence  and that these errors had had an impact on finding Mr.  Kruk and Mr. Tsang guilty, which justified setting aside their convictions and  ordering new trials. The Crown appealed the decisions to the Supreme Court  of Canada. It argued that in both cases, the Court of Appeal should have  deferred to the trial judges\u2019 conclusions on credibility. It also argued that their  conclusions could only be overturned if they had made \u201cpalpable and overriding  errors\u201d in their assumptions. A \u201cpalpable\u201d error is one that is obvious, and in  this context could include where the assumption in question is obviously  untrue, or where it is untrue or inapplicable in light of the other accepted  evidence or findings of fact in the case. If such an error has been identified,  the appeal court must also conclude that the trial judge\u2019s reliance on the  assumption was \u201coverriding\u201d, meaning it affected the result or went to the core  of the outcome of the case. In the Crown\u2019s opinion, the Court of Appeal  incorrectly relied on the rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions, as  opposed to looking for palpable and overriding errors in the assumptions made  by the trial judges to justify overturning their credibility findings. \u00a0In response, Mr. Kruk and Mr. Tsang said the trial  judges were wrong to rely on ungrounded common-sense assumptions to find them  less credible. In their view, the Court of Appeal correctly used the rule  against ungrounded common-sense assumptions overturn the trial judges\u2019  credibility findings and set aside their convictions.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeals. \u00a0<strong>The rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions should not be  recognized as a new basis for appellate courts to review credibility and  reliability findings by trial judges.</strong>Writing for a majority, Justice Martin said that adopting  a rule against ungrounded common-sense assumptions would represent a radical  departure from how appellate courts have typically approached credibility and  reliability assessments, especially in the context of sexual assault. She said  the faulty use of common-sense assumptions in criminal trials should continue  to be controlled by existing standards of review and rules of evidence. In some  cases, a trial judge\u2019s use of common sense will be vulnerable to appellate  review because it discloses recognized errors of law. Otherwise, like with  other factual findings, she said credibility and reliability assessments \u2013 and  any reliance on the common-sense assumptions inherent within them \u2013 will be  reviewable only for palpable and overriding error.In the instance cases, Justice  Martin assessed the trial judges\u2019 credibility and reliability findings using  the standard of palpable and overriding error and concluded that no such errors  were made. For these reasons, she allowed the appeals and restored Mr. Kruk\u2019s  and Mr. Tsang\u2019s convictions. ",

During the investigation, police contacted Moneris, a third-party payment processing company, and obtained two IP addresses associated with the transactions without a warrant. The police then used these IP addresses to obtain subscriber information from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and executed search warrants at Bykovets' residence. Bykovets challenged the request for his IP addresses as a violation of his right against unreasonable search and seizure under section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge held that obtaining IP addresses from a third-party processing company did not constitute a search under s. 8 of the Charter. The majority of the Court of Appeal agreed, dismissing Bykovets' appeal. However, on further appeal to the Supreme Court, Karakatsanis J., writing for the majority, held that an IP address attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy and that its disclosure constitutes a search under s. 8.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA request by the state for an individual's Internet Protocol (IP) address constitutes a search under section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis held that an IP address attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy under section 8 due to its potential to reveal personal or biographical core information about an individual. The court emphasized that protecting online privacy is essential in today's digital world where individuals use internet services extensively",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that a request by police for an IP  address is a search within the meaning of section 8 of the Charter.</strong>This appeal dealt with the question of whether an  internet protocol (IP) address attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy,  such that a request by the police to obtain it constitutes a search under  section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. \u00a0An IP address is a unique identification  number and is necessary to access the Internet. It identifies  Internet-connected activity and enables the transfer of information from one  source to another. Companies that provide access to the Internet, referred to  as Internet service providers, keep track of the user information that attaches  to each IP address. In 2017, the Calgary Police Services began an  investigation into fraudulent online purchases from a liquor store and learned  that the store\u2019s online sales were managed by Moneris, a third-party payment  processing company. The police contacted Moneris to obtain the IP addresses  used for the transactions, and Moneris identified two. The police then obtained  an order from the court compelling the addresses\u2019 Internet service provider to  disclose the name and residential address of the customer for each IP address.  One was registered to Mr. Bykovets, and the other to his father. The police used  this information to obtain and execute search warrants at their residences. Mr.  Bykovets was arrested and charged with offences relating to, among others, the  possession and the use of third parties\u2019 credit cards and personal  identification documents. Before his trial began, Mr. Bykovets challenged the  police\u2019s request to obtain the IP addresses from Moneris, alleging it violated  his right against unreasonable search and seizure under section 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  The object of section 8 is to protect privacy, including informational privacy.  To establish a violation of his section 8 right, Mr. Bykovets first needed to  show that there had been a \u201csearch\u201d. A search occurs where the state invades a  reasonable expectation of privacy. Mr. Bykovets argued he had such an  expectation with respect to his IP address. The trial judge found that the police\u2019s request to  Moneris did not amount to a search because there was no reasonable expectation  of privacy in an Internet user\u2019s IP address. She reasoned that on their own, IP  addresses do not provide a link to, or any other information about, an Internet  user. As such, Mr. Bykovets did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in  his IP address and there was no violation of his section 8 right. He was ultimately  convicted of 14 offences. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal agreed with  the trial judge and dismissed Mr. Bykovet\u2019s appeal. In dissent, one judge would  have allowed his appeal, on the basis that a reasonable expectation of privacy did  attach to the IP addresses. Mr. Bykovets appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada. \u00a0The Supreme Court of Canada has allowed the appeal. <strong><em>An IP address attracts a reasonable expectation of  privacy</em>.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis explained  that if section 8 of the <em>Charter </em>was  to meaningfully protect the online privacy of Canadians in today\u2019s overwhelmingly  digital world, it must protect their IP addresses. An IP address is the crucial  link between an Internet user and their online activity. She said \u201cit is the  key to unlocking a user\u2019s Internet activity and, ultimately, their identity,  such that it attracts a reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d. Accordingly, a  request by the state \u2013 in this case, the police \u2013 for an IP address is a search  under section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. On this basis, Justice Karakatsanis allowed Mr.  Bykovet\u2019s appeal, set aside his convictions and ordered a new trial. ",

The Act aims to protect the well-being of Indigenous children, youth and families by promoting culturally appropriate child and family services and advancing the process of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The Attorney General of Canada countered that the Act constitutes a valid exercise of Parliament's legislative authority under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada considered the constitutionality of the Act, which establishes national standards for child and family services and affirms Indigenous peoples' inherent right to self-government in this area. The Quebec Court of Appeal had previously held that the Act was constitutionally valid except for provisions giving priority to Indigenous laws over provincial laws. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal by the Attorney General of Canada, holding that the entire Act is intra vires Parliament's jurisdiction under s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867.

The court found that the Act falls within Parliament's legislative jurisdiction over Indians and Lands reserved for the Indians under section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The court rejected the Attorney General of Quebec's argument that the Act impermissibly intrudes on certain areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction and represents an attempt to unilaterally amend the Constitution. The decision highlights Parliament's role in advancing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples through legislative initiatives designed to promote culturally appropriate child welfare services.",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court upholds the constitutionality of a federal statute affirming Indigenous  peoples\u2019 right of self\u2011government with respect to child and family services</strong><strong>.</strong>In 2019, Parliament passed the <em>Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and  M\u00e9tis children, youth and families</em> (Act), which establishes national  standards and provides Indigenous  peoples with effective control over their children\u2019s welfare.First of all, the Act  sets out national standards and principles that establish a normative framework, which applies across the country, for  the provision of culturally appropriate child and family services. For example,  the principle of the best interests of the  child must be a paramount consideration in decisions or actions in relation to  an Indigenous child. The Act also sets out the principle of ensuring cultural  continuity, which is considered essential to the well\u2011being of children, families  and Indigenous groups, communities or peoples.In addition, the Act affirms the inherent right  of self\u2011government of Indigenous peoples that is recognized and affirmed by  section\u00a035 of the <em>Constitution Act,  1982</em>. The Act states that this right includes jurisdiction to make laws in  relation to child and family services. For this purpose, the Act establishes a  framework within which Indigenous groups, communities or peoples can exercise  this jurisdiction.Furthermore, the Act specifies how its provisions and Indigenous  peoples\u2019 jurisdiction to make laws in this area will interact with other laws. Section\u00a021  gives the laws made by Indigenous groups, communities or peoples the same force  as federal laws. Lastly, section\u00a022(3) states for greater certainty that Indigenous laws prevail over  provincial laws to the extent of any conflict or inconsistency.After the Act was passed, the Attorney General  of Quebec asked the Quebec Court of Appeal to determine whether the Act was \u201c<em>ultra vires</em>\u201d Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction  under the Constitution of Canada. In other words, the Attorney General asked  whether, in light of the division of federal and provincial powers under  sections\u00a091 and 92 of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>, Parliament had exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction by  passing the Act. In the opinion it provided in answer to that question, the  Court of Appeal concluded that the Act was constitutionally valid  except for sections\u00a021 and 22(3), the provisions giving the laws of  Indigenous peoples priority over provincial laws.The Attorney General of Quebec and the Attorney  General of Canada both appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada from that  opinion. The former argued, among other things, that the entire Act impermissibly  intruded on certain areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The latter  countered that the Act was a valid exercise of Parliament\u2019s legislative jurisdiction  over \u201cIndians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\u201d under section\u00a091(24) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal of  the Attorney General of Quebec and allowed the appeal of the Attorney General  of Canada.<strong>The  Act is not <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament\u2019s  jurisdiction under the Constitution of Canada.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the Supreme Court  ruled that the Act as a whole is constitutionally valid. The  essential matter addressed by the Act involves protecting the well\u2011being of Indigenous  children, youth and families by promoting the delivery of culturally  appropriate child and family services and, in so doing, advancing the process  of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. The Act falls squarely within  Parliament\u2019s legislative jurisdiction under section\u00a091(24) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1867</em>. The  Court characterized section\u00a021 of the Act as simply an incorporation by  reference provision. Through section\u00a021, Parliament has validly  incorporated by reference the laws, as amended from time to time, of Indigenous  groups, communities or peoples in relation to child and family services. As for  section\u00a022(3), the Court affirmed that it is simply a legislative  restatement of the doctrine of federal paramountcy, under which the provisions of  a federal law prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions of a  provincial law.As the Court noted, \u201c[u]nder  this framework created by the Act, Indigenous governing bodies and the  Government of Canada will work together to remedy the harms of the past and  create a solid foundation for a renewed nation\u2011to\u2011nation relationship in the  area of child and family services\u201d.

The Cabinet Office declined, citing exemption under s. 12(1) of FIPPA. The CBC appealed to the Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC), who ordered disclosure, finding that the letters were not exempt. On judicial review, the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal agreed with the IPC's decision. However, on appeal to the Supreme Court, a majority found that the IPC's decision was unreasonable due to its narrow interpretation of s. 12(1) and failure to consider constitutional conventions surrounding Cabinet confidentiality.\n\n**Legal Principle:** \nThe confidentiality of Cabinet deliberations is a precondition to responsible government.\n\nWriting for majority Justice Karakatsanis held that mandate letters prepared by Premier Ontario ministers protected from disclosure under section twelve one Freedom Information Protection Privacy Act failed consider broader legal factual context surrounding cabinet confidentiality role premier cabinet decision making",
        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules  that mandate letters delivered by the Premier of Ontario to his cabinet  ministers are exempt from disclosure. </strong> This appeal concerned the issue of whether the public  should have access to mandate letters sent from the Premier of Ontario to his  cabinet ministers shortly after his party formed government in 2018. A journalist from the Canadian Broadcasting  Corporation (CBC) requested access to 23 mandate letters delivered by the  Ontario Premier to each of his cabinet ministers after the 2018 provincial  election. The mandate letters set out the Premier\u2019s views on policy priorities  for the government\u2019s term in office. The Cabinet Office declined the  journalist\u2019s request, claiming the mandate letters were exempt from disclosure under  section 12(1) of Ontario\u2019s <em>Freedom of  Information and Protection of Privacy Act </em>(the Act). In general, freedom of  information legislation such as this Act strikes a balance between public  disclosure and the confidentiality required by the executive to govern  effectively. Section 12(1) of the Act protects the confidentiality of records  that would reveal the substance of Cabinet\u2019s deliberations.The CBC appealed the Cabinet Office\u2019s decision to  Ontario\u2019s Information and Privacy Commissioner. The Commissioner determined  that the mandate letters were not exempt under section 12(1) and ordered their  disclosure. He found that the purpose of the Cabinet records exemption was to  promote the free and frank discussion among Cabinet members of issues coming  before them for decision, without concern for the chilling effect that might  result from disclosure of their statements or the material on which they are  deliberating. However, in his view, section 12(1) was designed to protect  deliberations occurring within Cabinet\u2019s policy-making process, not the  outcomes of that process \u2013 the policy decisions themselves \u2013 or mere subjects  or topics of deliberation. Under his interpretation of section 12(1), the  Commissioner said the mandate letters were not exempt from disclosure because  nothing suggested they were intended to serve, or served, as the basis for  discussion by Cabinet as a whole. Moreover, rather than revealing the views,  opinions, thoughts, ideas and concerns of ministers, the Commissioner characterized  the mandate letters as the endpoint of the Premier\u2019s formulation of the  policies and goals to be achieved by each Ministry. The Attorney General of Ontario asked the Ontario  Divisional Court to review the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The Divisional Court  determined that the decision was reasonable. On appeal, a majority of the  Ontario Court of Appeal agreed with the Divisional Court. One judge on the  Court of Appeal dissented, finding the Commissioner\u2019s decision unreasonable in  large part because it eroded the sphere of Cabinet privilege that section 12(1)  was designed to preserve. The Attorney General of Ontario appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The  Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the Cabinet records exemption was too narrow. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis ruled the  mandate letters were protected from disclosure under section 12(1) of the Act.  She determined that the opening words of the provision mandate a substantive  analysis of the requested record to determine whether disclosure of the record  would shed light on Cabinet deliberations. A consideration of the text of the  Act, purpose, and context lead to the conclusion that the mandate letters are  protected from disclosure under section 12(1)\u2019s opening words. The mandate  letters reflect the view of the Premier on the importance of certain policy  priorities and mark the initiation (rather than the end) of a fluid process of  policy formulation within Cabinet, and they are revealing of the substance of  Cabinet deliberations.\u00a0 Justice Karakatsanis concluded: \u201cIn approaching  assertions of Cabinet confidentiality, administrative decision makers and  reviewing courts must be attentive to the vital importance of public access to  government-held information but also to Cabinet secrecy\u2019s core purpose of  enabling effective government, and its underlying rationale of efficiency,  candour, and solidarity\u201d.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a new trial must be held for 31\u00a0persons who were granted a stay of  proceedings by the Superior Court of Quebec. </strong>Following an investigation that began in 2014, a large\u2011scale  police operation was launched in 2016 in three regions in Quebec. Some 30 persons  were arrested and charged with various indictable offences related to  production of and trafficking in narcotics. At the time they were arrested, the accused persons were all informed  of their constitutional right, guaranteed by section\u00a010(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  to retain and instruct counsel without delay. Many of them indicated that they  wanted to exercise their right as soon as they were informed of it, some did  not ask to exercise their right until they were at the police station, and the  others said that they did not wish to retain and instruct counsel or that they  had already done so. In the end, out of those who indicated a desire to exercise  this right immediately, only one was given an opportunity to do so while in the  police vehicle.The accused persons were divided  into four different groups for separate trials. Those in the first group, who  were to be tried first, filed a motion for a stay of proceedings on the basis  that there had been multiple infringements of their constitutional rights  during the police investigation and operation. In the context of a criminal  case, a stay of proceedings is a remedy that may be granted to an accused person  who establishes that the state\u2019s conduct undermines the integrity of the  justice system, regardless of whether the person has suffered any personal prejudice  or whether the fairness of the person\u2019s trial has been impaired. The accused  persons in this case alleged that an accumulation of infringements of their  constitutional rights, particularly their right to retain and instruct counsel  without delay, amounted to an abuse of process for all of them, even though  several of them were not the victims of any of these infringements. The accused  persons in the other three groups filed motions similar to the one filed by the  first group. The trial judge entered a stay of  proceedings for the accused persons in the first group. He found that the police  practice of postponing the exercise by the accused persons of their right to  counsel until they were taken to the police station infringed the right under section\u00a010(b)  of the <em>Charter</em> of everyone in the  group. Relying on the cumulative effect of these infringements, which he  considered to be the most serious ones, and other infringements that occurred during  the police action, the judge found that there had been an abuse of process by  the police. A stay of proceedings was also entered for the accused persons in  the other three groups on the basis of these findings.The Quebec Court of Appeal  allowed the Crown\u2019s appeals and ordered that a new trial be held, including a  new hearing on the motion for a stay of proceedings. In the Court of Appeal\u2019s view,  some accused persons did not have standing to obtain a stay of proceedings,  because a remedy can be granted only to persons whose own constitutional rights  have been infringed. It was also of the opinion that the trial judge had erred  in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused persons without first  assessing whether the rights of each of them had been infringed. The accused  persons appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The trial judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for all of the accused  persons.</strong>Writing for the majority of the  Court, Justice\u00a0O\u2019Bonsawin\u00a0ruled that all of the accused persons had  standing to apply for a remedy even though some of them were not the victims of  any of the infringements constituting the alleged abusive conduct.However, the trial judge had to  determine whether each accused person\u2019s right under section\u00a010(b) of the <em>Charter</em> had been infringed, and he did  not do so. Finally, the trial judge erred in entering a stay of proceedings for  all of the accused persons without first considering less drastic remedies that  could have fully redressed the prejudice to the integrity of the justice system  that he thought he had identified. For these reasons, Justice\u00a0O\u2019Bonsawin\u00a0concluded  that this error justified holding a new trial for the first group, as well as  new hearings on the accused persons\u2019 motion for a stay of proceedings.",
