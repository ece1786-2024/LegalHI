The relationship was plagued by violence and financial difficulties. According to the complainant, the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money, and she was unwilling to do this but agreed to avoid the accuseds violence. She claimed that the accused persuaded her to dance for men and to offer sexual services for money, and that she participated because of the accuseds violence. She also claimed that the accused was involved in posting ads offering sexual services and controlled all proceeds, and that this continued until she left the accused in 2012.\n\tThe accused was charged with trafficking the complainant and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to ss. 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. At trial, in addition to the complainant, five other witnesses testified: the complainants brother, mother and daughter, and two of her friends. These other witnesses did not provide evidence of sexual services, but did provide evidence of the accuseds violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused. While he accepted that the complainant found herself in a violent relationship with the accused, he found her testimony lacking in credibility, and had a reasonable doubt about the accuseds ties to any prostitution enterprise. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the acquittals. It held that the trial judge assessed some of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle by ruling that the accuseds violence was past discreditable conduct but that the error had no material bearing on the acquittals. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not fail to consider all the evidence. The dissenting judge would have ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and that treating the accuseds violence as past discreditable conduct misapprehended its nature and relevance to the actus reus and mens rea of both offences.\n\tHeld (Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the acquittals set aside, and a new trial ordered.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ.: The trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was evidence of past discreditable conduct. This error of law hindered his assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation set out in s. 279.04 of the Criminal Code. The trial judges error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals.\n\tThe object of the offence of trafficking in persons in s. 279.01(1) is to comprehensively respond to all forms of trafficking. This means criminalizing a wide range of conduct carried out for the purpose of exploitation. The phrase control, direction or influence in s. 279.01(1) is disjunctive, and the actus reus can be satisfied if the movements of the victim have only been subject to one of the elements. These elements represent a spectrum of power that the accused exerts over the victims movements. Control will regulate or govern the victim such that they will be left with little choice over their movements. Influence alters, sways, or affects the victims will when they decide how to exercise their freedom. Direction speaks less to the degree of power the accused exerts over the victims movements than to the way the accused exerts that power; it means management, guidance, advice, or instruction, and sometimes an authoritative command. It is not enough that the accused has acquired the power or the ability to control, direct, or influence the victims movements; they must have actualized it in one way or another. The Crown may establish the actus reus through evidence of violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship between the two, if the effect of that violence is such that the victims movements have been controlled, directed, or influenced.\n\tThe mens rea for trafficking in persons requires that the accused engaged in the actus reus for the purpose of exploiting the victim or facilitating their exploitation. Those words do not require that actual exploitation occur, but people are usually able to foresee the consequences of their acts, and if the accused is found to have knowingly exploited the victim, then it could be reasonable to infer that the accused acted with the intent to do so. The Crown must nevertheless prove that the accused subjectively intended to exploit the complainant. Exploitation, which is defined in s. 279.04, occurs when the accused engages in any conduct, including regular violence and threats of violence, that both causes the victim to provide or offer labour or a service, and could reasonably be expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service. The latter must be assessed using an objective test, having regard to all the circumstances, including the victims vulnerabilities.\n\tPast discreditable conduct evidence is evidence of the accuseds misconduct beyond what is alleged in the indictment, and is generally inadmissible. However, if it is covered by the indictment, the Crown can prove the conduct no matter how badly it may reflect on the character of the accused. In the instant case, the trial judge committed an error of law when he held that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant was past discreditable conduct evidence. Even though the trial judge admitted the evidence, this mischaracterization meant he did not assess it properly. That evidence could have been relevant to the essential elements of the offence. It could have formed the basis of a finding that the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant during the time period specified in the indictment, and a contributing cause of the complainants engagement in sexual services. The trial judges incorrect assessment of this critical evidence seriously undermined his credibility assessment of the complainant, which he used as the rationale for acquittal.\n\tAcquittals are not set aside lightly. Even where an error of law is made, the Crown must demonstrate that the error might have had a material bearing on the acquittal. Appellate courts should only set aside an acquittal when the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the error not occurred. In the instant case, the trial judges error of law undermines the foundation of the acquittals, and the possibility of a different verdict having been reached is more than abstract or purely hypothetical. The acquittals should be set aside and a new trial ordered.\n\tWith respect to the issue of whether the trial judge considered all of the evidence, an appellate court must presume that a trial judge knows the law and deals competently with issues of fact, and must read the reasons as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered. In the present matter, the reasons show that the trial judge considered the complainants evidence in light of the exhibits and the evidence of other witnesses. No error warrants intervention on this issue.\n\tPer Cote and Rowe JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. There is agreement with the majority that the trial judge made a legal error in characterizing certain evidence as past discreditable conduct evidence, as it was relevant to the actus reus of the offence. There is disagreement regarding the effect of this error, which did not have a material bearing on the acquittals. The Crowns burden is a very heavy one that reflects the restricted nature of the Crowns ability to appeal and the double jeopardy associated with a new trial.\n\tTo obtain a conviction for trafficking in persons under s. 279.01(1), the Crown must establish the mens rea of the offence: that the accused exercised control over the complainant for the purpose of exploiting her. In the instant case, the only evidence relevant to the mens rea came from the complainant herself. The trial judge was not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt by the complainants testimony. Even if the evidence of the five witnesses was assessed as part of the elements of the offence, their testimony does not link the accuseds violent behaviour to the complainants provision of sexual services. The testimony accepted as credible did not address whether the accused exercised control over the complainant for the purpose of exploiting her.\n\tThe trial judge also made detailed credibility findings that shaped his assessment of the evidence of the other witnesses. Credibility findings by trial judges are owed deference on appeal. Though the trial judge mischaracterized the evidence of the other witnesses as past discreditable conduct evidence, he admitted all of it, and tested the complainants credibility and evidence against it. The trial judges credibility findings were the basis on which his reasonable doubt rested, and on which the accused was acquitted. There is no proper basis in law to set aside this conclusion. The majoritys reasoning comes perilously close to a ground of appeal of unreasonable acquittal, which is unavailable to the Crown, and may encourage courts to collapse the distinction between the actus reus and mens rea of the offence.\nCases Cited\nBy OBonsawin J.\n\tReferred to: R. v.

Appeal allowed, Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting.\n\tMark A. Scott, K.C., and Glenn Hubbard, for the appellant.\n\tDavid J. Mahoney, K.C., and Michelle James, for the respondent.\n\tThe judgment of Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ. was delivered by\n\tOBonsawin J.  \nOverview\nBetween 2004 and 2012, T.J.F. (the accused) and J.D. (the complainant) were in a common law relationship marked by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. The couple relocated from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, then to Edmonton, Alberta, and eventually returned to Halifax. While in Fort Saskatchewan, they started engaging in sexual services for compensation, initially by having sex on a webcam, which then evolved to the provision of sexual services by the complainant. \nThe accused was charged with trafficking in persons, between November 1, 2006, and December 31, 2011, and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to ss. 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (Cr. C.).\nA six-day trial was held in September 2021 during which the Crown called the complainant and seven other witnesses, and tendered six exhibits. The accused elected not to testify. He was acquitted of both charges. \nFor the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was evidence of past discreditable conduct, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. This error of law hindered his overall assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation set out in s. 279.04 Cr. C. I am satisfied, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the verdicts of acquittal would not necessarily have been the same had this error not occurred. \nI would allow the appeal, set aside the verdicts of acquittal, and order a new trial.\nFactual Context\nThe following summarizes key elements of the evidence of the complainant and the five civilian witnesses (the five other witnesses or the other witnesses), and exhibits, as detailed by the trial judge in his reasons.\nThe Evidence of the Complainant\nThe trial judge acknowledged that the complainants testimony paints a disturbing case of human exploitation on a grand scale but cautioned that [t]his narrative does not represent findings of fact (2021 NSSC 290, at para. 12). \nThe complainant and the accused met in Halifax. They were in a common law relationship from 2004 to 2012, during which time they cared for two children and relocated from Halifax to Fort Saskatchewan, then to Edmonton, before returning to Halifax.\nThe complainant testified that her relationship with the accused was plagued by violence, evictions, and financial difficulties. She worked in various bars, while the accused was rarely employed. The couple was financially strapped and were frequently evicted. The accused was also prone to bursts of anger and violence against the complainant (para. 3). \nWhile in Fort Saskatchewan, the complainant was working in a bar while the accused chose not to work. Their financial difficulties were ongoing, and the accuseds violence escalated to a level that was twice as bad as in Halifax (para. 4). Soon after the complainant secured a better-paying job at a strip bar in Edmonton, the accused suggested they have sex on a webcam for money. The complainant was unwilling to do this but agreed to avoid the accuseds violence. \nUnsatisfied with their financial earnings, the accused persuaded the complainant to dance for men, and eventually, to offer sexual services for money. The complainant did not want to offer sex for money but participated because of the accuseds violence and threats towards her. \nThe complainant testified that the physical abuse she endured was a daily occurrence (para. 6). At one point, the accused broke her finger because she refused his request for her to have sex with a woman. The complainant also testified that the accused persuaded her to use cocaine and other hard drugs by threatening her and her children. \nThe complainant testified that the accused was deeply involved in the sexual services. He posted ads offering sexual services and accompanied her to clients locations to either watch or listen to the sexual acts requested by clients. All proceeds went to the accused, while the complainant only received enough to pay a few bills (para. 8). \nThe sexual services and violence continued until the complainant left the accused in 2012. Fearing she could lose her children, the complainant never disclosed to anyone what was happening while it was occurring. \nThe Evidence of the Five Other Witnesses\nThe Crown called five other witnesses: the complainants brother, mother, and daughter, and two of her friends, J.K. and K.L. \nThe complainants brother testified that the accused and the complainant fought and that the accused was always screaming at [the complainant] and broke all kinds of things around him (trial reasons, at para. 18). He recalled seeing both going out at night, and that the accused had lots of cash. \nThe complainants mother did not provide evidence of sexual services or direct evidence of family violence, although parts of her testimony implied a violent home.\nThe complainants daughter lived with the complainant and the accused. She testified that the couple fought and that the accused would break things in Halifax (para. 28). Once they moved to Alberta, the fighting intensified to a point where the accused and the complainant fought all the time (ibid.). She recalled seeing her mothers lip split open (ibid.), and hearing threats to kill and screams. Upon their return to Halifax, she testified seeing the accused forcefully push [the complainant] into a wall (para. 30). When asked about the accused and the complainants late-night outings, the daughter explained that she thought they went out to work. \nIn addition to family witnesses, the Crown called two of the complainants friends to testify. The complainants friend, J.K., lived with the couple when they returned to Halifax from Edmonton. He described the relationship between the accused and the complainant as nothing out of the ordinary and testified hearing a lot of yelling and occasional loud banging (para. 32). He assumed that when both were out together, which happened a few times per week, they were grocery shopping.\nThe complainants other friend, K.L., testified that she saw many disputes and injuries suffered by the complainant. She testified that she drove the couple to hotels and nightclubs, and that she would sometimes pick them up at night. She also lent them her computer regularly. K.L. later discovered the sexual services ads on Craigslist, and confronted the complainant about it, who hung up the phone upset and crying. Shortly after, she received a call from the accused who stated that if she went to the police, he would have her charged and she would lose her job (para. 37).\nThe Exhibits\nThe Crown also tendered six exhibits, four of which are relevant for the purposes of this appeal:\nMedical reports from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta, detailing that the complainant attended on August 12, 2009, with an upper extremity injury right finger with a possible open dislocation (trial reasons, at para. 13);\nMedical reports from the Fort Saskatchewan Health Centre, detailing that the complainant attended on January 16, 2008, with a cut [right] angle of the mouth (para. 14);\nA Craigslist affidavit enclosing two ads for sexual services, one dated March 31, 2009, and the other dated May 29, 2009, both with a phone number; and\nA Rogers Communications affidavit confirming that the two phone numbers on both Craigslist ads belonged to the accused. The affidavit also confirms that the authorized user phone above the second ad belonged to the complainant.\nJudicial History\nSupreme Court of Nova Scotia, 2021 NSSC 290 (Coady J.)\nThe trial judge acquitted the accused. He reasoned that while there was much to suggest that the accused was part of a prostitution business, there was not enough to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt (para. 70).\nThe trial judge found the complainants testimony lacking in credibility. As for the evidence of the five other witnesses, he held that they did not directly address the essential elements of the offences, resting the onus on the complainant to provide direct evidence of such elements. \nThe trial judge noted that the complainant was often prone to exaggeration and hyperbole during her testimony, and sometimes directed her answers at the accused (para. 58). He found that the complainants cross-examination further altered her testimony, highlighting numerous incoherencies, inconsistencies, and contradictions with earlier statements. \nAs for the other witnesses, the trial judge set aside part of their evidence. He held that they related to [the accused]s bad character which, usually, is presumptively inadmissible (para. 42). He still admitted the evidence, given that they assist[ed] the Court in understanding the relationship between the parties and the context in which the alleged abuse occurred (para. 44). The trial judge held that the character evidence establishe[d] a pattern of dominant behaviour by the accused which allows the criminal conduct to exist in that environment; in this case the exploitation of [the complainant] (para. 43). The character evidence was a backdrop in which such exploitation could thrive (para. 57). \nWhile the trial judge accepted that the complainant found herself trapped in a violent, unhappy, and loveless relationship with the accused who subjected her to threats, intimidation, and injury, he remained troubled by a reasonable doubt about the accuseds ties to any prostitution enterprise (ibid.). He acquitted the accused on all charges.\nNova Scotia Court of Appeal, 2023 NSCA 28, 425 C.C.C. (3d) 475\nThe Crown appealed the acquittals, alleging that the trial judge committed three errors of law: \n(a) he assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle;\n\n(b) he failed to consider all relevant evidence; and \n\n(c) he erred with respect to the legal effect of factual findings made.\n\n(A.F., at para. 2)\nThe Majority (Bryson J.A., Farrar J.A. Concurring)\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the acquittals. \nFirst, the majority held that the trial judge assessed some of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle by ruling that the accuseds threats, intimidation and violence were past discreditable conduct. However, the error had no material bearing on the acquittals, since the judge still held a reasonable doubt on the essential elements of the offences, namely, that the accused exploited [the complainant] or benefited from any alleged exploitation of her (ibid.; see also para. 31). The majority opined that evidence of violence alone did not prove exploitation, and, as such, the evidence of the other witnesses, limited to violence, could not establish exploitation. In the majoritys view, only the complainant provided evidence of exploitation, but the trial judge found that she lacked credibility.\nSecond, the majority concluded that the trial judge did not fail to consider all the evidence. In its view, he did not piecemeal the evidence by treating the complainants credibility as determinative of the entire case. According to the majority, since the other witnesses evidence was reviewed, but did not establish actual or intended exploitation (para. 48), it could only corroborate the complainants description of domestic violence. It was therefore adequate for the trial judge to treat the complainants credibility on the element of exploitation as determinative.\nThe majority also held that the trial judge adequately grappled with all the evidence even though he did not address the two Craigslist ads and their associated phone numbers in his reasons. The majority opined that the trial judge was alive to this inculpatory evidence because he recited the evidence describing those numbers (para. 54). The trial judge simply found the evidence insufficient to resuscitate [the complainant]s credibility (ibid.; see also para. 57). \nFinally, the majority held that the trial judge did not fail to appreciate the legal effect of his factual findings since none established exploitation. The majority further held that the presumption of s. 279.01(3) Cr. C. does not establish exploitation. \nThe Dissent (Van den Eynden J.A.)\nThe dissenting judge, Van den Eynden J.A., would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. In her view, all three errors raised by the Crown might have had a material bearing on the acquittals.\nFirst, the dissenting judge agreed with the majority that the trial judge assessed the evidence of the accuseds violence based on a wrong legal principle by treating it as evidence of past discreditable conduct (paras. 90-96 and 99). \nHowever, contrary to the majority, the dissenting judge ruled that the trial judge misapprehended the nature and relevance of the violent acts the [accused] inflicted on the complainant (para. 94), as they were relevant to establishing exploitation, and the actus reus and mens rea of both offences.\nSecond, the dissenting judge found that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence. In her view, the evidence of the other witnesses on the accuseds violent acts could have strengthen[ed] the credibility and reliability of the complainants evidence (para. 104). She also held that the trial judge failed to grapple with the presence of the accuseds phone number in the sexual services ads. \nFinally, the dissenting judge opined that the trial judge erred regarding the legal effect of his factual findings. She determined that, had the trial judge applied the proper legal framework, the actus reus may well have been established and the presumption [found in s. 279.01(3) Cr. C.] would therefore have applied (para. 111). \nIssues\nThis is an appeal as of right and is therefore limited to questions of law on which the judge of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal dissented (s. 693(1)(a) Cr. C.). \nThe Crown raised two questions in its notice of appeal: (i) whether the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and (ii) whether the trial judge erred regarding the legal effect of his factual findings. \nShortly before the hearing, the Crown withdrew its arguments supporting the second question regarding the legal effect of the trial judges factual findings, leaving only the first question to be decided. \nHowever, a closer reading of the reasons of the Court of Appeal reveals that the dissenting judge disagreed with the majority on whether the mischaracterization of part of the evidence as evidence of past discreditable conduct amounted to a misapprehension of the evidence (paras. 8, 67, 90-96 and 99). While the majority ruled that this error did not taint [the trial judges] legal analysis of the elements of the offence (para. 35), the dissenting judge opined that the trial judges reasons demonstrated a lack of understanding of the concept of past discreditable conduct, which led him to misapprehen[d] the nature and relevance of the violent acts the [accused] inflicted on the complainant (para. 94). This is a question of law that requires us to determine whether the trial judges mischaracterization of the evidence of the other witnesses tainted his analysis of the evidence (see R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 29, citing R. v. Morin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, at p. 295, and R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at p. 75).\nLastly, in a criminal legal system built on the presumption of innocence, acquittals are not set aside lightly. Even when errors of law are made, appellate courts should only set aside an acquittal when the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the errors not occurred (R. v. Sutton, 2000 SCC 50, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 595, at para. 2, citing Vezeau v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 277, at pp. 291-92; R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14). Our Court will thus have to determine if the alleged error(s) of law might have had a material bearing on the verdicts of acquittal (R. v. Hodgson, 2024 SCC 25, at para. 36).\nIn sum, three questions are raised by this appeal:\nDid the trial judge fail to consider all the evidence?\nDid the trial judge misapprehend the evidence? \nMight the error(s) of law, if any, have had a material bearing on the acquittals?\nAnalysis\nMy analysis is divided into three parts. First, I will demonstrate that the trial judge considered all the evidence. Second, I will explain that the trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. Finally, I will conclude that the error of law the trial judge committed might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. \nDid the Trial Judge Fail To Consider All the Evidence?\nThe Crown argues that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence because he piecemealed the evidence by subjecting the complainants testimony to the criminal standard of proof (A.F., at para. 127), and also ignored the Craigslist ads (para. 130). \nThe accused responds that the trial judge properly considered the evidence of the other witnesses as well as all documentary evidence (R.F., at para. 83; see also para. 91). I agree. \nWhen an appellate court reviews reasons for errors of law, it must be rigorous in its assessment, approaching the review in the same way it would approach allegations of insufficient reasons (R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 79). It must presume that a trial judge know[s] the law . . . and deal[s] competently with the issues of fact (R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 32 and 55; R. v. R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54; G.F., at para. 74; R. v. Gerrard, 2022 SCC 13, at para. 2; R. v. Kruk, 2024 SCC 7, at para. 84). It is not enough to suspect the trial judge erred in law; the appellate court must be satisfied that the trial court erred having given its reasons a fair reading (J.M.H., at paras. 20, 23 and 31). That is, having read them as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered (R.E.M., at para. 16; see, in the context of an appeal from an acquittal, R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 18, citing R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 203-4).\nApplying these principles to the present matter, the trial judge devoted five paragraphs to the framework through which he would assess the credibility and reliability of the complainant (paras. 52-56). Within this framework, he wrote explicitly that [w]here the Crowns case is wholly dependent on the testimony of the complainant it is essential the credibility and reliability of the complainants evidence be tested in the context of all the rest of the evidence (para. 53, citing R. v. Stanton, 2021 NSCA 57, at para. 67). He did just that. The reasons show that the trial judge considered the complainants evidence in light of the exhibits and the evidence of other witnesses.\nI see no error that warrants our intervention on this issue. The trial judge considered all the evidence. The fact that he did not discuss in greater detail the influence that specific evidence had on his reasoning is not an error of law. The trial judge was not required to set out every finding or conclusion in the process of arriving at the verdict, nor did he have to detail his finding on each piece of evidence before him (R.E.M., at paras. 18 and 20). \nCrucially, however, the consideration of evidence must not be confused with the assessment of evidence. As I will explain below, even if the trial judge considered all the evidence in his reasons, he assessed the evidence of the other witnesses based on a wrong legal principle. This error of law hindered his overall assessment of the evidence.\nDid the Trial Judge Misapprehend the Evidence? \nBefore addressing the trial judges assessment of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle, I will interpret s. 279.01 Cr. C. This provision establishes the offence of trafficking in persons.\nInterpretation of Section 279.01 Cr. C. \nCriminal law is no exception to the basic rule of statutory interpretation that the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, citing E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; see also R. v. Hutchinson, 2014 SCC 19, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 346, at para. 16, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at p. 1; Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 12; R. v. Hasselwander, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 398, at pp. 411-14). \nBill C-49, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons), 1st Sess., 38th Parl., 2004-2005, came into force on November 25, 2005 (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons), S.C. 2005, c. 43). Bill C-49 created the offences of trafficking in persons (s. 279.01 Cr. C.), material benefit (s. 279.02 Cr. C.), and withholding or destroying documents (s. 279.03 Cr. C.). It also defined exploitation (s. 279.04 Cr. C.). To this date, our Court has never had the opportunity to interpret those provisions.\nFor ease of reference, ss. 279.01, 279.02, and 279.04 Cr. C. are reproduced below as they read during the time period specified in the indictment at issue:\n279.01 (1) Every person who recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours a person, or exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person, for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation is guilty of an indictable offence and liable \n\n(a) to imprisonment for life if they kidnap, commit an aggravated assault or aggravated sexual assault against, or cause death to, the victim during the commission of the offence; or\n\n(b) to imprisonment for a term of not more than fourteen years in any other case.\n\n(2) No consent to the activity that forms the subject-matter of a charge under subsection (1) is valid.\n\n279.02 Every person who receives a financial or other material benefit, knowing that it results from the commission of an offence under subsection 279.01(1), is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than ten years.\n\n279.04 For the purposes of sections 279.01 to 279.03, a person exploits another person if they\n\n(a) cause them to provide, or offer to provide, labour or a service by engaging in conduct that, in all the circumstances, could reasonably be expected to cause the other person to believe that their safety or the safety of a person known to them would be threatened if they failed to provide, or offer to provide, the labour or service; or\n\n(b) cause them, by means of deception or the use or threat of force or of any other form of coercion, to have an organ or tissue removed. \nObject of Section 279.01 Cr. C.\nWhen Bill C-49 was enacted, the RCMP estimated that approximately 600 women and children were trafficked into Canada each year for sexual exploitation alone, and at least 800 women and children for all domestic markets, including drug trade, domestic work, and labour for garment or other industries (J. Oxman-Martinez, M. Lacroix and J. Hanley, Victims of Trafficking in Persons: Perspectives from the Canadian Community Sector (2005), at p. 2; see also House of Commons Debates, vol. 140, No. 125, 1st Sess., 38th Parl., September 26, 2005, at p. 7990 (Vic Toews); House of Commons Debates, vol. 140, No. 135, 1st Sess., 38th Parl., October 17, 2005, at p. 8631 (Hon. Judy Sgro)). \nThere was, at the time, an existing prohibition on trafficking in the immigration context (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), s. 118). Bill C-49 aimed to broaden the reach of our existing prohibition to comprehensively respond to all forms of human trafficking, whether they occur wholly within Canada or whether they involve some cross-border or international dimension (House of Commons Debates, October 17, 2005, at p. 8620 (Hon. Irwin Cotler); United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 2225 U.N.T.S. 209; Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, 2237 U.N.T.S. 319, Article 3).\nSection 279.01(1) Cr. C. broadens the existing prohibition in two ways. First, it criminalizes trafficking in persons beyond the immigration context (s. 118 of the IRPA; Urizar v. R., 2013 QCCA 46, at paras. 68, 73 and 77; see also K. Plouffe-Malette, Linterpretation de la criminalisation de la traite des etres humains en droit penal canadien a laune du Protocole de Palerme: analyse de larret Urizar de la Cour dappel du Quebec (2014), 44 R.D.U.S. 1, at p. 17; H. Gluzman, Human Trafficking and Prostitution in Canada  Intersections and Challenges (2018), 66 C.L.Q. 109, at p. 123). \nSecond, s. 279.01(1) Cr. C. captures a wide range of conduct under the actus reus (see Article 3(a) of the Protocol). The broad scope of the actus reus is counterbalanced by the requirement that it be carried out for the purpose of exploiting [the victim] or facilitating their exploitation. This tailors the offence to conduct that goes to the heart of trafficking in persons while maintaining the flexibility necessary to respond to all its forms.\nUnderlying Bill C-49s object of capturing all forms of trafficking in persons is the concern for the protection of women and children, who are especially vulnerable to trafficking in persons (see House of Commons Debates, September 26, 2005, at p. 7988 (Hon. Paul Harold Macklin); House of Commons Debates, October 17, 2005, at p. 8619 (Hon. Irwin Cotler); see also the preamble and Article 2(a) of the Protocol). \nOur Courts jurisprudence, national commissions and inquiries, and research echo this concern and recognize that women and children, including Indigenous women and girls, are disproportionately subjected to sexual violence (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at paras. 68 and 70; see also R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 198; Statistics Canada, Gender-based violence and unwanted sexual behaviour in Canada, 2018: Initial findings from the Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces (December 2019); Statistics Canada, Violent victimization and perceptions of safety: Experiences of First Nations, Metis and Inuit women in Canada (April 2022); Public Inquiry Commission on relations between Indigenous Peoples and certain public services, Public Inquiry Commission on relations between Indigenous Peoples and certain public services in Quebec: listening, reconciliation and progress  Final report (2019), at pp. 120-21; Honouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future: Summary of the Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (2015), at pp. 226-27; National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019); E. Snyder, V. Napoleon and J. Borrows, Gender and Violence: Drawing on Indigenous Legal Resources (2015), 48 U.B.C. L. Rev. 593).\nFive years after the enactment of Bill C-49, Bill C-268, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (minimum sentence for offences involving trafficking of persons under the age of eighteen years), 3rd Sess., 40th Parl., 2010 (enacted as S.C. 2010, c. 3, s. 2), created a new offence criminalizing the trafficking of persons under the age of 18, punishable by mandatory minimum sentences, and increased the maximum sentence to life imprisonment where especially violent acts have been committed against a child victim (s. 279.011(1) Cr. C.). \nIn sum, the object of s. 279.01(1) Cr. C. is to comprehensively respond to all forms of trafficking in persons with a focus on women and children, who are more commonly affected. This means criminalizing a wide range of conduct carried out with the purpose of exploiting or facilitating the exploitation of one or many victims. Undoubtedly, regular violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship with a victim, can be the means of perpetuating such conduct. \nText and Context of Section 279.01 Cr. C.\nOur Court has not yet had the opportunity to interpret the meaning of the phrase control, direction or influence. Both the Court of Appeal of Quebec in Urizar and the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Gallone, 2019 ONCA 663, 147 O.R. (3d) 225, relied on R. v. Perreault (1996), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 573 (Que. C.A.), to discern its meaning. There, the Court of Appeal of Quebec interpreted the meaning of the phrase exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person in the context of the procuring offence codified at s. 286.3(1) Cr. C. (formerly s. 212(1)(h) Cr. C.) to mean that: \nThe element of control refers to invasive behaviour, to ascendancy which leaves little choice to the person controlled. This therefore includes acts of direction and influence. There is the exercise of direction over the movements of a person when rules or behaviours are imposed. The exercise of direction does not exclude the person being directed from having a certain latitude or margin for initiative. The exercise of influence includes less constricting actions. Any action exercised over a person with a view to aiding, abetting or compelling that person to engage in or carry on prostitution would be considered influence. [Emphasis deleted; pp. 575-76.]\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario summarizes exercising control as being like giving an order that the person has little choice but to obey, and exercising direction is like imposing a rule that the person should follow, then exercising influence is like proposing an idea and persuading the person to adopt it (Gallone, at para. 47).\nWhat first emerges from those interpretations is a spectrum of power that the accused exerts over the victims ability to move freely and their actual movements. On one end of the spectrum, the accused will exercise control over the victims movements; the former will regulate or govern the latter (Blacks Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024), at p. 418), such that the victim will be left with little choice over their movements. On the other end, the accused will exercise influence over the victims movements when they will, at minimum, induce action or change the decisions or acts of [the victim] about their movements (p. 928). This means that the victim is free to move wherever they like, but that when they decide how to exercise their freedom, the accused alter[s], sway[s], or affect[s] [their] will (p. 928). \nContrary to control and influence, direction speaks less to the degree of power the accused exerts over the victims movements than to the way the accused exerts that power. Direction means [m]anagement, guidance, advice or instruction, and can sometimes refer to an authoritative command (The Dictionary of Canadian Law (5th ed. 2020), at p. 319, citing R. v. Bazinet (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 284), and the verb to direct is defined as [t]o guide, to govern, and [t]o instruct (someone) with authority (Blacks Law Dictionary, at p. 576). While direction will often overlap with control or influence, it can be found to have occurred even where the victims movements have not been controlled or influenced. Since the enumeration control, direction or influence is disjunctive, the actus reus can be satisfied if the movements of the victims have only been subject to the accuseds direction.\nSection 279.01(1) Cr. C. specifies that control, direction, or influence must be exercise[d]. According to the Blacks Law Dictionary, the verb exercise (in French, exercer) implies the realization of something: 1. To make use of; to put into action <exercise the right to vote>. 2. To implement the terms of; to execute <exercise the option to buy the commodities> (p. 716). It is then not enough that the accused has acquired the power or the ability to control, direct, or influence the victims movements. They must have actualized it in one way or another, such that the victims movements have been controlled, directed, or influenced by the accused.\nIt follows that nothing in the text of the provision bars the Crown from establishing the actus reus through evidence of violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship between the two, if the effect of that violence is such that the victims movements have been controlled, directed, or influenced. \nControl, direction, or influence exercised by the accused over the victims movements can persist over time, thus creating a situation or a relationship throughout which the victims movements are being controlled, directed, or influenced regularly. \nConclusion\nThe text, context, and purpose of s. 279.01 Cr. C. all support the position that the Crown can adduce evidence showing an accuseds violent relationship with a victim, or regular violence and threats of violence against the victim, in an effort to establish the actus reus of the trafficking in persons offence. Such conduct can amount to exercising control, direction, or influence over their movements during a period of time, provided that the effect of that violence is that the victims movements have been effectively controlled, directed, or influenced during that time. \nWith this in mind, I will explain how the trial judge assessed the evidence based on a wrong legal principle, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. \nThe Trial Judge Assessed the Evidence Based on a Wrong Legal Principle\nThe accused, the Crown, and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal agree that the trial judge mischaracterized some of the evidence of the other witnesses as evidence of the accuseds past discreditable conduct (A.F., at para. 75; R.F., at para. 8; C.A. reasons, at paras. 8 and 86). However, they disagree on whether this mischaracterization amounted to a misapprehension of the evidence. \nWhen facing Crown appeals of acquittals, appellate courts have an obligation to articulate with precision how the trial judge erred in law (Hodgson, at para. 40). To articulate with precision the trial judges error of law, I will first define past discreditable conduct evidence, then identify what conduct the trial judge characterized as past discreditable conduct, and finally, assess whether the trial judge was correct to characterize it as such. \nPast Discreditable Conduct Evidence and Its Exclusionary Rule\nGenerally, when judging whether an accused is guilty of an offence, all relevant evidence is admissible unless it is barred by a specific exclusionary rule (R. v. Goldfinch, 2019 SCC 38, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 30; R. v. Robertson, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 918, at p. 941; R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 38). Relevant evidence is evidence that has some tendency as a matter of logic and human experience to make the fact in issue for which it is advanced more likely than it would be in the absence of that evidence (R. v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 36, citing D. M. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (5th ed. 2008), at p. 31; see also R. v. Schneider, 2022 SCC 34, at para. 39; R. v. Watson, 50 C.R. (4th) 245 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 33).\nPast discreditable conduct evidence is evidence of the accuseds misconduct beyond what is alleged in the indictment (R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, at para. 31). It can be subsumed under the general category of evidence that reflects badly on the accuseds character (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 66; see also M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2024 (31st ed. 2024), at paras. 40.50-40.52). \nBad character evidence is generally inadmissible (R. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, at p. 732), because it risks triggering general propensity inferences, which are impermissible (p. 744, per Sopinka J., dissenting; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at para. 40.51). This exclusionary rule also seeks to guard against a related human tendency to punish the accused for past misconduct by finding that accused guilty of the offence charged, and to avoid deflecting the attention of the trier of fact from the main purpose of their deliberations which is the transaction charged (R. v. D. (L.E.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111, at p. 128).\nNot all discreditable conduct evidence is subject to the exclusionary rule. Bad character evidence, and especially discreditable conduct evidence, must go beyond what is alleged in the indictment to be presumptively inadmissible (Handy, at para. 31; see also Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57 (P.C.), at p. 65; M. Gourlay et al., Modern Criminal Evidence (2022), at p. 282). If it is covered by the indictment, the Crown can prove it no matter how badly this may reflect on the character of the accused (Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 66). \nBased on these principles, I will review the trial judges characterization of some of the accuseds conduct as past discreditable conduct.\nThe Trial Judges Characterization of the Accuseds Conduct as Past Discreditable Conduct \nThe trial judge did not explicitly mention what conduct he characterized as past discreditable conduct, but a fair reading of his reasons shows it was the regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant and, more generally, their violent relationship. Both paras. 42 and 57 of his reasons are revealing:\nMuch of the testimony of the above four witnesses related to events that, for the most part, did not directly address the charges before this Court. That testimony related to [the accused]s bad character which, usually, is presumptively inadmissible. It can trigger propensity reasoning and amount to oath-helping. Such evidence must be considered through the probative/prejudicial effect lens. . . . \n\n. . .\n\nI am satisfied from all of the evidence that [the complainant] found herself trapped in a violent, unhappy, and loveless relationship with [the accused]. However, the charges before this Court do not directly address the threats, intimidation, and injury that I accept as proven facts. The question before me is whether the Crown has proven these charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The past discreditable evidence certainly creates a backdrop in which such exploitation could thrive. [Emphasis added.]\nWhen the trial judge writes [t]he past discreditable evidence, he refers to the evidence establishing that the complainant had found herself trapped in a violent, unhappy, and loveless relationship with [the accused] and that she was subjected to threats, intimidation, and injury. \nThe trial judge also concluded that such evidence does not directly address (paras. 42 and 57) or directly support (para. 31) the charges, and that evidence about the relationship between the accused and the complainant offered little concerning the charges (para. 41). I disagree. \nIn the following subsection, I will explain why the evidence of the other witnesses about the accuseds violence towards the complainant, while certainly discreditable to the accused, was covered by the indictment and could not, in this case, be characterized as evidence of past discreditable conduct.\nRegular Violence and Threats of Violence by the Accused Were Covered by the Indictment\nThe Crown filed a two-count indictment. Since the two counts are linked, and the trial judge acquitted the accused on the second count based on the same reasons he acquitted the accused on the first count, my reasons will focus exclusively on the trafficking in persons count:\n[T]hat he between the 1st day of November, 2006 and the 31st day of December, 2011, at and near Fort Saskatchewan and Edmonton, Alberta, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, did unlawfully recruit, exercise control or direction or influence over the movements of [the complainant], for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation, contrary to Section 279.01(1) of the Criminal Code.\n\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 5)\nThe time period spans over five years between November 1, 2006, when the accused and the complainant first moved to Fort Saskatchewan (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 197-98 and 202), and December 31, 2011, not long before they separated. During that time period, the accused and the complainant moved from Fort Saskatchewan to Edmonton and then back to Halifax, all of which are covered by the indictment (trial reasons, at paras. 4, 7 and 10).\nThe trial judge could not ignore that the regular violence and threats of violence as provided in the evidence by the other witnesses took place within the specified time period, at the specified locations, and was directed towards the complainant. \nThe trial judge did not conclude that the accuseds regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant fell outside the factual parameters of the indictment. Rather, he held, as a matter of law, that the regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was not an element of the actus reus of the trafficking in persons offence, nor the definition of exploitation. This is why it fell to the complainant to provide that evidence.\nThis interpretation finds support in para. 45 of the trial judges reasons:\nGiven that the . . . prior witnesses could not provide direct evidence of the elements of these offences, it fell to [the complainant] to provide that testimony. Consequently, her credibility comes into play.\nRead in isolation, this sentence reveals an error of law. Evidence can be direct or circumstantial, and both types of evidence can satisfy a judge beyond reasonable doubt that a fact in issue is true (D. Watt, Watts Manual of Criminal Evidence (2024), at  1:17-1:18). Read contextually, this sentence reflects the trial judges concern that the evidence of the other witnesses on the accuseds violence did not directly address (paras. 42 and 57), or directly support (para. 31) the charges. \nAt trial, although the accused never argued that the other witnesses evidence was past discreditable conduct evidence, he argued that very little evidence related to the actual substance of the allegation, and referred to evidence of the accuseds violence as evidence of surrounding circumstances evidence that only takes you so far (A.R., vol. III, at p. 405). Later in oral submissions, defence counsel argued that the complainant was the only one who can speak to several of the essential elements in terms of the control and the alleged forcing into the sex trade, and who can tell the trial judge that the accused exploited her (p. 431; see also pp. 406 and 432).\nThe trial judges conclusion thus rejects the Crowns theory of the case, which sought to establish that the accused had controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant through the overwhelming evidence that [the complainant] was in a relationship that was physically and psychologically abusive and controlling (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 393-94). \nRegular Violence and Threats of Violence by an Accused Can Be Relevant and Material to the Actus Reus\nRegular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim and, more generally, their violent relationship, can amount to exercising control, direction, or influence over their movements during a period of time, provided that the effect of that violence is that the victims movements have been effectively controlled, directed, or influenced during that time. Violence is also relevant and material to the definition of exploitation, as this definition is met when the accused engages in any conduct, including regular violence and threats of violence, that both causes the victim to provide (or offer to provide) labour or a service, and could be reasonably expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety (or the safety of a person known to them) would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service. \nAs I stated earlier, the range of conduct captured under s. 279.01(1) Cr. C. is broad. It captures [e]very person who recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours a person, or exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person, for the purpose of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation. The use of the word or indicates that the actus reus is disjunctive. This element of the offence is made out if the Crown establishes that the accused engaged in any conduct set out in the provision (R. v. A. (A.), 2015 ONCA 558, 327 C.C.C. (3d) 377, at para. 80; Gallone, at para. 33; Urizar, at para. 72). \nSection 279.01(1) Cr. C. captures two clusters of conduct. The first includes specific actions: . . . recruits, transports, transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours . . . . The second captures accused who exercise control, direction or influence over the movements of a person. In the present case, the Crown relies on this second cluster of conduct to demonstrate that the accused committed the actus reus. It submits that regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim, and their violent relationship, can amount to exercising control, direction, or influence over their movements over a period of time. I agree. \nAs detailed earlier, s. 279.01(1) aims to broaden the prior existing prohibition and respond to all forms of trafficking in persons, with a focus on protecting women and children who are disproportionately subjected to sexual violence (Friesen, at paras. 68 and 70; see also Barton, at para. 198). This provision prohibits a person from preventing another person from moving freely through the exercise of control, influence or direction. The Crown can establish the actus reus through evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by an accused towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship between the two, that prevents the victims movements because they are controlled, directed, or influenced.\nWhether regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim and, more generally, their violent relationship, can be relevant and material to both the actus reus of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation is a question of law that must be answered in the affirmative. \nThe Mens Rea Can Be Inferred From a Finding of Exploitation and Regular Violence and Threats of Violence by an Accused Against a Victim Can Be Relevant and Material to the Definition of Exploitation\nThe trial judges characterization of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant as past discreditable conduct also suggests that he concluded that this type of conduct could not meet the definition of exploitation set out in s. 279.04 Cr. C. At trial, the Crown argued that accuseds mens rea could be inferred from a finding of exploitation (A.R., vol. III, at pp. 394-95). The Crown further submitted that the complainant was exploited by the accused in part through evidence showing the presence of physical violence and threats of violence . . . testified to by multiple witnesses (p. 399).\nBefore this Court, the Crown also argues that a finding that the accused exploited the complainant pursuant to s. 279.04 Cr. C., while not required under s. 279.01(1) Cr. C., can lead to a finding that the accused must have acted with the purpose of exploiting the complainant (A.F., at para. 108 (emphasis in original), citing A. (A.), at para. 87). Building on this, the Crown submits that regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant is relevant to establishing that the accused exploited the complainant. I agree. \nThe accuseds purpose to exploit or facilitate the exploitation of a victim, depending on the circumstances, can be inferred from a finding that the accused exploited the victim in the first place. Further, evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the victim, when paired with other evidence establishing that the victim engaged in labour or offered labor during the time they were subjected to the accuseds regular violence, can be relevant to establishing exploitation. I explain each conclusion in the paragraphs that follow.\nTo secure a conviction under s. 279.01(1) Cr. C., the Crown must establish that the accused engaged in the actus reus for the purpose of exploiting [the person] or facilitating their exploitation. Those words do not require that actual exploitation occurs. Exploitation is not an essential element of the offence; only the intention to exploit or facilitate exploitation is an element of the offence (see A. (A.), at para. 85, citing Urizar, at para. 69; see also Chahinian v. R., 2022 QCCA 499, at para. 82).\nHowever, the Court of Appeal for Ontario has suggested that the mens rea can sometimes be inferred from a finding that exploitation occurred (A. (A.), at para. 87, cited with approval in Gallone, at para. 54, and R. v. Sinclair, 2020 ONCA 61, 384 C.C.C. (3d) 484, at para. 12). I agree. A finding of actual exploitation could, depending on the evidence, be relevant and material to the key question of whether the accused acted for the purpose of exploiting the complainant.\nThis inference is grounded in the assumption that people are usually able to foresee the consequences of their acts (R. v. Buzzanga (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 369 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 387, cited with approval in R. v. Chartrand, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, at p. 890; Barton, at para. 167; see also K. Roach, Criminal Law (8th ed. 2022), at pp. 214-15). If the accused is found to have knowingly exploited the victim, such that the accused knows that exploitation would result from their conduct, then it could, depending on the circumstances, be reasonable to infer that the accused acted with the intent to exploit the victim. Nonetheless, when looking at evidence as a whole, courts should pay careful attention to evidence that would contradict, even refute, the inference. \nRegular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim is also captured by the definition of exploitation set out in s. 279.04 Cr. C.: \n279.04 For the purposes of sections 279.01 to 279.03, a person exploits another person if they\n\n(a) cause them to provide, or offer to provide, labour or a service by engaging in conduct that, in all the circumstances, could reasonably be expected to cause the other person to believe that their safety or the safety of a person known to them would be threatened if they failed to provide, or offer to provide, the labour or service;\nWe can extract from this definition two requirements that must be satisfied for exploitation to occur. Exploitation involves conduct that both (i) causes the victim to provide (or offer to provide) labour or a service and (ii) a reasonable expectation that the victim could believe that their safety (or the safety of a person known to them) would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service.\nThe definition does not specify the term conduct, which can take many forms, including regular violence and threats of violence towards a victim and, more generally, a violent relationship between the two. This aligns with the object of s. 279.01(1) Cr. C. and An Act to amend the Criminal Code (trafficking in persons), S.C. 2012, c. 15, s. 2, which added a list of factors that the courts may consider in determining whether an accused exploits another person:\n(a) used or threatened to use force or another form of coercion;\n\n(b) used deception; or\n\n(c) abused a position of trust, power or authority.\nIn determining whether the accuseds conduct could reasonably be expected to cause the belief, the judge must have regard to all circumstances, which include the victims personal characteristics and vulnerabilities, such as their lack of education, prior victimization, socio-economic disadvantage, and social and family isolation, among others. In Sinclair, the Court of Appeal for Ontario listed circumstances that might be relevant in the analysis (at para. 15):\nthe presence or absence of violence or threats\ncoercion, including physical, emotional or psychological\ndeception\nabuse of trust, power, or authority\nvulnerability due to age or personal circumstances, such as social or economic disadvantage and victimization from other sources\nisolation of the complainant\nthe nature of the relationship between the accused and the complainant\ndirective behaviour\ninfluence exercised over the nature and location services provided\ncontrol over advertising of services\nlimitations on the complainants movement\ncontrol of finances\nfinancial benefit to the accused, and\nuse of social media to assert control or monitor communications with others.\nIn sum, exploitation occurs when the accused engages in any conduct, including regular violence and threats of violence, that both causes the victim to provide (or offer to provide) labour or a service and could be reasonably expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety (or the safety of a person known to them) would be threatened if they failed to provide that labour or service. The latter must be assessed using an objective test, having regard to all the circumstances, including the victims vulnerabilities. \nIf the victim is known to have provided labour (or to have offered to provide labour) during a specified time period, the fact that they were regularly subjected to violence and threats of violence during that time can be the cause of the victims decision to provide said labour. It could also be inferred from the regular violence that the victim could be reasonably expected, in all the circumstances, to believe that their safety would be threatened if they failed to provide said labour.\nNevertheless, even where the trial judge accepts that actual exploitation occurred, the Crown must still prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused subjectively intended to exploit the complainant. \nConclusion and Precise Articulation of the Trial Judges Error of Law\nI conclude that the trial judge committed an error of law when he held that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused against the complainant provided by the other witnesses was evidence of past discreditable conduct. To the contrary, this evidence could have been relevant to the essential elements of the offence and could have formed the basis of a finding that the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant during the time period specified in the indictment. It could also have been found to be a contributing cause of the complainants provision of sexual services. \nThe Trial Judges Mischaracterization of the Evidence Tainted His Legal Analysis\nThe accused and the majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal suggest that the trial judges mischaracterization of the evidence did not taint the trial judges legal analysis (R.F., at paras. 55 and 73; C.A. reasons, at para. 35). They note that despite his error of law, the trial judge admitted the evidence of the other witnesses, including the accuseds regular violence towards the complainant and, more generally, their violent relationship. The trial judge concluded that:\nIn this case, as in R. v. B. (F.F.), [[1993] 1 S.C.R. 697], this type of evidence is admissible in that it establishes a pattern of dominant behaviour by the accused which allows the criminal conduct to exist in that environment; in this case the exploitation of [the complainant]. [Emphasis added; para. 43.]\nBased on the above-noted paragraph, the accused submits that the trial judges error of law did not affect his legal analysis respecting the actus reus of the offence because the trial judge accepted that the evidence of violence was admissible . . . and was relevant to the conduct element of the actus reus (R.F., at paras. 55 (emphasis deleted) and 61; see also para. 56). I disagree.\nFrom the moment the trial judge considered the regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct, his analysis of the evidence was tainted regarding both the actus reus and the mens rea. This characterization, in and of itself, indicates that the trial judge dismissed the Crowns theory of the case as implicating impermissible propensity reasoning when it did not. The fact that he nevertheless admitted the evidence cannot cure this misapprehension. \nThe trial judge found the evidence admissible in that it establishes a pattern of dominant behaviour by the accused which allow[ed] the criminal conduct to exist in that environment; in this case the exploitation of [the complainant] (para. 43). This past discreditable conduct evidence create[d] a backdrop in which such exploitation could thrive (para. 57). The trial judge thus considered regular violence by the accused towards the complainant (i.e., the pattern of dominant behaviour) as distinct from the criminal conduct and exploitation. Such violence merely allowed that conduct to exist and thrive. This interpretation finds further support in the trial judges use of the words environment (para. 43), backdrop (para. 57), and context (paras. 44 and 57) to describe the violence. Even though the trial judge admitted that evidence, his mischaracterization meant he could not, and did not, assess it as a possible contributing cause in the complainants provision of sexual services.\nHaving found that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, I will explain how that error might have had a material bearing on the verdicts of acquittal.\nMight the Error of Law Have Had a Material Bearing on the Acquittals?\nAcquittals are not set aside lightly. At the material bearing stage of the analysis, courts are asked to make a careful judgment as to [the error of laws] effect on the trial judges reasoning supporting his reasonable doubt (Graveline, at para. 29, per LeBel J., dissenting). The burden is a very heavy one and lies on the Crown (R. v. Evans, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 629, at p. 645), who must demonstrate that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same had the errors [of law] not occurred (Sutton, at para. 2, citing Vezeau, at p. 292). This standard demands more than an abstract or purely hypothetical possibility that the accused would have been convicted but for the error of law, but not that the verdict would necessarily have been different (Graveline, at para. 14; see also George, at para. 27; Hodgson, at para. 36).\nI conclude that the Crown has established that the trial judges reasonable doubts could have been resolved had the error of law not occurred. As I have explained, the trial judge assessed the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant and, more generally, their violent relationship, based on a wrong legal principle. Having done so, the trial judge could not assess that evidence as conduct by the accused relevant to the essential elements of the offence and the definition of exploitation. The fact that he nevertheless admitted the evidence could not and did not cure his error. \nI consequently agree with the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal that the judges incorrect assessment of this critical evidence seriously undermined his credibility assessment of the complainant, which he used as the rationale for acquittal (para. 99). In other words, his assessment of the other witnesses evidence undermined his assessment of the complainants evidence as it failed to appreciate the interconnectedness between both.\nContrary to my colleagues assertions, I am not suggesting that the only conclusion that would have been available to the trial judge is that the accused intended to exploit the complainant (para. 159). Rather, had the trial judge not misapprehended the evidence, he could have reached a different conclusion with respect to the essential elements of the offence. I am satisfied with a reasonable degree of certainty that this possibility is more than abstract or purely hypothetical. While I am not persuaded that the verdict would necessarily have been different, this is not the applicable threshold (Graveline, at para. 14; see also George, at para. 27; Hodgson, at para. 36).\nFor these reasons, I am of the view that the trial judges error of law undermines the foundation of the acquittals. This error can reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at hand, to have had a material bearing on the acquittals (Graveline, at para. 14).\nConclusion\nThe trial judge made an error of law in his assessment of the evidence, leading to a misapprehension of the evidence. I am satisfied that the possibility of reaching a different verdict is more than abstract or purely hypothetical. For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the verdicts of acquittal, and order a new trial.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tCote and Rowe JJ.  \nTo succeed on appeal, the Crown must show that the trial judge made one or more legal errors that might reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at hand, to have had a material bearing on the acquittal (R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14). The Crowns burden in this respect is a very heavy one that reflects [t]he restricted nature of the Crowns ability to appeal and the double jeopardy associated with a new trial (R. v. Hodgson, 2024 SCC 25, at paras. 22, 30 and 36).\nWe agree with our colleague that the Crown has shown that the trial judge made a legal error in characterizing evidence offered by five witnesses at trial as evidence of past discreditable conduct. However, despite the trial judges mischaracterization of the evidence, there is no basis for this Court to disturb his credibility findings in this Crown appeal. And because we conclude that the Crown has not shown that the error in question had a material bearing on the acquittal, as required by Graveline, we would dismiss the appeal.\nDefining the Error of Law in the Present Appeal\nWe begin by precisely identifying the error of law (Hodgson, at para. 40). Our colleague frames the error in the present case as follows, at para. 109 of her reasons:\n\tI conclude that the trial judge committed an error of law when he held that the evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by the [respondent] against the complainant provided by the other witnesses was evidence of past discreditable conduct. To the contrary, this evidence could have been relevant to the essential elements of the offence and could have formed the basis of a finding that the [respondent] controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the complainant during the time period specified in the indictment. It could also have been found to be a contributing cause of the complainants provision of sexual services.\nShortly after articulating this error of law, our colleague adds that [f]rom the moment the trial judge considered the [respondents] regular violence and threats of violence . . . towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct, his analysis of the evidence was tainted regarding both the actus reus and the mens rea (para. 112).\nWhile we agree that the trial judge erroneously characterized the evidence provided by the other witnesses as propensity evidence, we respectfully disagree regarding the effect of this error; it does not follow that his entire assessment of the evidence was tainted by such a legal error. Indeed, and importantly, our Court has repeatedly emphasized that credibility findings by trial judges are owed deference on appeal (see, e.g., R. v. Kruk, 2024 SCC 7, at para. 82; R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para. 10). Assessing credibility is clearly in the bailiwick of the trial judge and thus heightened deference must be accorded to the trial judge on matters of credibility (F.H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41, at para. 72).\nCredibility findings typically do not engage errors of law, as, at their core, they relate to the extent to which a judge has relied on a factor, and how closely that factor is tied to the evidence (Kruk, at para. 82). An appellate court cannot translat[e] its strong opposition to the trial judges factual inferences . . . into supposed legal errors (R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 17). To do otherwise would risk expanding the Crowns right of appeal beyond its proper scope and would have a profound impact on the interests of accused persons, especially due to the considerable anxiety created by the prospect of a new trial after a person has been acquitted (Hodgson, at para. 31).\nIndeed, a challenge to the trial judges credibility findings is not a proper ground of appeal for the Crown under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which limits the Crowns right of appeal to a question of law alone and not to question[s] about how to weigh evidence and assess whether it meets the standard of proof (Hodgson, at paras. 32 and 34, citing R. v. Chung, 2020 SCC 8, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 405, at para. 10; see also R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 24). No appeal on the basis of an unreasonable acquittal is open to the Crown (see J.M.H., at paras. 32-33; Chung, at para. 31, per Karakatsanis J., dissenting). We are guided by this Courts recent admonition that the Crowns right of appeal of an acquittal is an extraordinary remedy that has been variously described as drastic, exceptional, special, unusual and limited in an extrem[e] or narrow manner (Hodgson, at para. 24).\nWe now consider whether this evidence, if properly assessed, could have had a material bearing on the acquittal. In our view, if the appropriate deference is afforded to the trial judges findings, the Graveline standard is not made out.\nThe Legal Error Would Not Have a Material Bearing on the Acquittal\nThe trial judge concluded that the complainant found herself trapped in a violent, unhappy, and loveless relationship with the respondent (2021 NSSC 290, at para. 57). We agree that this finding was relevant to making out the actus reus of the offence under s. 279.01(1) of the Criminal Code.\nHowever, to obtain a conviction under s. 279.01(1), the Crown must also show that the respondent exercise[d] control over the complainant for the purpose of exploiting the complainant or facilitating her exploitation. It is not sufficient for the Crown to only establish the actus reus; whether the accused exercise[d] control over the movements of the complainant is only one of the elements of the offence. Furthermore, the language chosen by Parliament signals that it has chosen to ascribe the highest level of subjective mens rea to this offence (K. Roach, Criminal Law (8th ed. 2022), at p. 213).\nThe mens rea of the offence could have been established in one of three ways in the present case:\nThe trial judge could have been persuaded by the testimony of the complainant.\nThe trial judge could have inferred the respondents intent from the circumstances of control and exploitation, if he found that the evidence established these as facts.\nThe trial judge could have relied on some combination of (a) and (b).\nThe trial judge did not do any of the above, and a proper assessment of the evidence offered by the other witnesses would not have affected this outcome.\nThe Trial Judge Could Not Have Been Persuaded by the Testimony of the Complainant\nThe only evidence relevant to the mens rea, whether the respondent acted for the purpose of exploiting the complainant, came from the complainant herself. She testified that the respondent abused and exercised violent control over her for the purpose of forcing her into prostitution.\nThe trial judge was not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt by the complainants testimony, considered in the context of the other evidence. Though he accepted the threats, intimidation, and injury by the respondent as facts, he rejected much of the complainants evidence because he found that she was prone to exaggeration and hyperbole and fill[ed] in the blanks to comply with her narrative (paras. 57-58).\nThe trial judge identified several inconsistencies in the complainants testimony that led him to this conclusion. He noted that she admitted on cross-examination to having access to the money garnered through sex work, after initially stating that the respondent had complete control of the finances (para. 62). He also highlighted the fact that the complainant agreed, on cross-examination, that she drafted and posted Craigslist ads advertising sexual services (including one featuring a number that was for her personal use) even though she had consistently testified that [the respondent] placed all the ads (paras. 64-68). The trial judge noted other inconsistencies in the complainants evidence that called into question, inter alia, whether the complainant conducted negotiations with prospective clients, her street walking, when her sex work ended, and the amount of money she spent on drugs (paras. 58-68). All of the trial judges findings in this regard were relevant to the complainants credibility generally and to the alleged purpose for the respondents acts.\nThe fact that the trial judge found the complainant not to be credible precludes us from accepting her narrative as facts. Indeed, the trial judge explicitly stated that the complainants narrative does not represent findings of fact (para. 12).\nOur colleague suggests that the trial judges assessment of the complainants credibility might have been different if the evidence of the other witnesses was considered as part of the actus reus rather than past discreditable conduct. She writes that [the trial judges] assessment of the other witnesses evidence undermined his assessment of the complainants evidence as it failed to appreciate the interconnectedness between both (para. 117).\nWe disagree. Though the trial judge mischaracterized the evidence of the other witnesses as past discreditable conduct, he ultimately admitted all of it (para. 43). The reasons demonstrate that the trial judge tested the complainants credibility and evidence against the evidence of the other witnesses. As our colleague acknowledges in her reasons, the trial judge devoted five paragraphs to the framework through which he would assess the complainants credibility and reliability (para. 48). It is noteworthy that the trial judge wrote explicitly [w]here the Crowns case is wholly dependent on the testimony of the complainant it is essential the credibility and reliability of the complainants evidence be tested in the context of all the rest of the evidence (para. 53 (emphasis added), citing R. v. Stanton, 2021 NSCA 57, at para. 67). From these paragraphs, it is readily apparent that the trial judge knew to test the complainants evidence against the evidence of the other witnesses, regardless of how it was classified. Indeed, our colleague acknowledges that [t]he reasons show that the trial judge considered the complainants evidence in light of the exhibits and the evidence of other witnesses (para. 48).\nFurthermore, at para. 57, the trial judge writes:\n\tI am satisfied from all of the evidence that [the complainant] found herself trapped in a violent, unhappy, and loveless relationship with [the respondent]. However, the charges before this Court do not directly address the threats, intimidation, and injury that I accept as proven facts. The question before me is whether the Crown has proven these charges beyond a reasonable doubt. The past discreditable evidence certainly creates a backdrop in which such exploitation could thrive. However, I cannot just assume from that context evidence that the human trafficking allegations are proven as against [the respondent]. It requires the acceptance of [the complainant]s evidence as credible and reliable to tie [the respondent] to the prostitution enterprise. [Emphasis added.]\nThe trial judge concluded that the relationship between the respondent and the complainant was a violent one based on all of the evidence before him, not just the evidence from the complainant. This demonstrates that the trial judge did, in fact, turn his mind to how the five witnesses evidence of threats, intimidation, and injury could corroborate the complainants evidence. As such, we strongly disagree with our colleague that the trial judges mischaracterization of the evidence offered by the other witnesses led him to ignore the potential impact they had on the complainants credibility or to entirely exclude them from this assessment. Our colleague says that the consideration of evidence must not be confused with the assessment of evidence, suggesting that the other witnesses evidence may have been considered, but was not assessed properly (para. 50). Yet, the trial judges reasons do not support this assertion; just because the evidence was considered past discreditable conduct did not mean it was entirely siloed from the trial judges credibility analysis.\nThe Trial Judge Could Not Have Inferred Intent From the Circumstances of Control or Exploitation\nOur colleague also takes the position that due to the trial judges error of law, he failed to consider the possibility that the violence could be a contributing cause in the complainants provision of sexual services when he assessed the evidence (paras. 109 and 113). Respectfully, our colleagues position is detached from the reality of the trial judges findings. Moreover, even if a causal link could have been established in this case, the trial judge would not have been able to use this finding to infer that the respondent intended to exploit the complainant.\nThe Five Witnesses Did Not Provide an Evidentiary Basis for Finding Actual Exploitation\nTo begin, our colleague suggests that the evidence offered by the other witnesses of the respondents regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant could have potentially been used to find that it was a contributing cause in the complainants provision of sexual services (ibid.).\nIn our view, even if the trial judge considered the evidence of violence as part of the actus reus analysis rather than past discreditable conduct, it is unclear how this would lead the trial judge to conclude that the respondent exploited the complainant.\nExploitation, per s. 279.04 of the Criminal Code, requires the Crown to prove conduct by the accused that: (1) causes the victim to provide or offer to provide labour or a service; and (2) could reasonably be expected to cause the victim to believe that their safety (or the safety of person known to them) would be threatened if they failed to provide such a service (majority reasons, at para. 103).\nWe agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judges concern was never the violent conduct of [the respondent], which he accepted, but rather whether [the complainant] was exploited (2023 NSCA 28, 425 C.C.C. (3d) 475, at para. 31 (emphasis added)). Critically, while the trial judge accepted that the complainant experienced threats, intimidation, and injury in her relationship with the respondent, he was not satisfied that the respondent was tied to the sex work enterprise (para. 57). The trial judge found the complainants testimony not to be credible as to this necessary link (ibid.).\nEven if the evidence of the five witnesses was assessed as part of the elements of the offence, the analysis would still be devoid of any additional evidence to show that the respondent actually exploited the complainant. This is because, at its highest, the evidence offered by the witnesses was solely about the respondents violent behaviour towards the complainant. Their testimony does not link this violent behaviour to the complainants provision of sexual services. Instead, as we explained above, the only evidence given at trial that was capable of establishing this link  the complainants testimony  raised serious credibility issues in the trial judges mind.\nThe Negative Credibility Findings of the Five Witnesses Bar an Inference of Intent To Exploit\nOur colleague also states that a finding of actual exploitation could, depending on the evidence, be relevant and material to the key question of whether the accused acted for the purpose of exploiting the complainant (para. 100), and concludes that the mens rea of human trafficking can sometimes be inferred from a finding of exploitation. However, after concluding that the evidence of the five witnesses could have been relevant to establishing actual exploitation, our colleague stops short of explaining how the respondents intention to exploit could have been inferred in this case.\nIn our view, the trial judges assessment of the five witnesses evidence bars this inference from being made in the circumstances. He made detailed credibility findings that shaped his assessment of the evidence given by each of the other witnesses, and his decision as to whether the Crown had met its burden.\nNotably, the trial judge declined to accept testimony from N.R. and K.L. that could have been probative of the respondents alleged exploitation of the complainant. He noted that N.R. stated that late-night outings by the respondent and complainant became more frequent over time (para. 22). However, this evidence was introduced for the first time on cross-examination, was not mentioned in N.R.s statement or meeting with the Crown, and was not disclosed to the defence (ibid.). This may well have contributed to the trial judges conclusion that N.R. displayed a somewhat cavalier attitude towards his duties as a sworn witness (para. 23).\nThe trial judge also did not accept N.R.s assertion that the respondent had lots of cash could be probative of the respondents actual exploitation of the complainant (A.R., vol. II, at p. 34). Nor did he accept N.R.s testimony that the respondent had the cash because he told [N.R.] he was a collector for a drug dealer (ibid.).\nK.L. testified that the respondent and complainant would go out in the evenings and that she drove them to hotels and nightclubs and would pick them up late at night (trial reasons, at para. 35). She also testified that she discovered prostitution-related materials saved on a computer she owned and that the complainant and respondent occasionally used (para. 37). She stated that the respondent threatened her when she confronted the complainant (ibid.). The trial judge rejected much of this testimony as well. He noted that K.L.s direct testimony varied from her police statements and her cross-examination in several aspects (para. 38). On cross-examination, she admitted that only once had she picked up the complainant and respondent after a night out (ibid.). She also backtracked on her statement that she had discovered prostitution-related material saved on her computer (para. 39). These credibility challenges led the trial judge to carefully scrutiniz[e] K.L.s testimony (para. 41). He found that K.L. had accepted [the complainant]s narrative and consequently harboured animus towards the respondent (ibid.).\nIn addition to identifying serious credibility issues with witnesses whose testimony was advanced by the Crown, the trial judge also took express note of countervailing testimony offered by other witnesses that contributed to his conclusion that the Crown had not proven the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe complainants daughter, a very credible witness in the trial judges estimation, offered testimony that night-time outings by the complainant and respondent related to work in the bars (para. 31). She also testified about seeing the complainant getting into a grey vehicle that she did not recognize shortly before the complainant and respondent separated (para. 69). When she confronted the complainant, she was told to tell no one (ibid.). The complainant denied that this happened (ibid.). Another friend of the complainant, J.K., testified that the complainant and respondent would go out a couple of times a week but that it was for grocery shopping (para. 33).\nIn summary, to find that there was an intent to exploit based on the five witnesses evidence would require our Court to engage in a total reweighing of the evidence. This would fly in the face of what was said with determination and vigour so recently in Hodgson. Simply because there is a path for the trial judge to infer intent to exploit from a pattern of violence by an accused in some cases, does not mean that this Court can uproot the trial judges credibility findings so as to make out that inference in the present case.\nConclusion\nIn the concrete reality of the case at hand, the trial judges error in characterizing the testimony of the five witnesses did not have a material bearing on the acquittal (Graveline, at para. 14). In our view, what is critical is that the five witnesses testimony was found to be admissible by the trial judge, despite his mischaracterization. And  crucially  the testimony that the trial judge accepted as credible did not address whether the respondent exercised control over the complainant for the purpose of exploiting her.\nThe trial judges credibility findings were the basis on which his reasonable doubt rested, and on which the respondent was acquitted. There is no proper basis in law to set aside the trial judges conclusion in this regard. The Criminal Code does not provide for a ground of appeal of unreasonable acquittal; the majoritys reasoning comes perilously close to just that.\nThere is another way of understanding our colleagues analysis, which is that evidence of violence will necessarily give rise to an inference of intent to exploit. Indeed, our colleague acknowledges that even where the trial judge accepts that actual exploitation occurred, the Crown must still prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the [respondent] subjectively intended to exploit the complainant (para. 108). However, having made that acknowledgement, it is then not given effect. As we have outlined above, there is no evidentiary basis that could allow for such an inference to be drawn in the present case. In suggesting otherwise, our colleague effectively reasons that because there is a violent relationship between the respondent and the complainant, there is therefore intent to exploit.\nOne can imagine a scenario where a person that provides sexual services is also in a violent and abusive relationship. Both of these can exist separate and independent of the other. While the abusive partner may in fact control, influence, and direct the other partner in their relationship, they may have nothing to do with the fact that this partner provides sexual services. Our colleagues analysis suggests that the abusive partner may well be guilty of human trafficking in those circumstances, even though the link to sexual services has not been made out. To be clear, the abusive partner in these kinds of cases might be found criminally liable if they were charged with, for example, assault, uttering threats, or criminal harassment. But those offences are not charged here, and they are not equivalent to human trafficking.\nIn addition, we are concerned that our colleagues reasoning will, in practice, encourage courts to collapse the distinction between the actus reus and mens rea of the offence, such that it will be unnecessary to determine if intention to exploit has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in cases involving acts of violence. This is not what Parliament intended as it effectively gives rise to another presumption apart from the one established in s. 279.01(3) of the Criminal Code.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\n\tAppeal allowed, Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service, Halifax.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Nova Scotia Legal Aid  Appeals Office, Halifax, N.S.; Atherton Nicholson, Dartmouth, N.S.",

The complainant alleged that the accused forced her into prostitution and controlled her movements through violence and threats. The accused was charged with trafficking in persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections 279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that the accused suggested she engage in prostitution, and she eventually agreed due to his violence and threats.\n\nAt trial, the Crown called six witnesses, including the complainant, and tendered six exhibits. The accused elected not to testify. The trial judge acquitted the accused, finding that the complainant's testimony lacked credibility and that the evidence of the other witnesses did not directly address the essential elements of the offences. The Crown appealed the acquittals, arguing that the trial judge erred in assessing the evidence based on a wrong legal principle and failed to consider all the evidence. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the trial judge's error had no material bearing on the acquittals. The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, holding that the trial judge erred in characterizing the evidence of the accused's violence towards the complainant as past discreditable conduct.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that evidence of regular violence and threats of violence by an accused against a victim, and their violent relationship, can be relevant and material to both the actus reus of the trafficking in persons offence and the definition of exploitation, and can form the basis of a finding that the accused controlled, directed, or influenced the movements of the victim during the time period specified in the indictment.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice OBonsawin held that the trial judge erred in law by mischaracterizing evidence of the accused's regular violence and threats of violence against the complainant as past discreditable conduct. This error tainted the trial judge's assessment of the evidence, particularly with respect to the actus reus and mens rea of the trafficking in persons offence. The majority concluded that the error may have had a material bearing on the acquittal, as it undermined the foundation of the acquittals and created a possibility of a different verdict. Therefore, the majority allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets  aside a man\u2019s acquittals for trafficking in persons and orders a new trial.</strong>This appeal addresses whether  evidence of past violence may be relevant to the offence of trafficking in persons  in a criminal prosecution.From 2004 to 2012, the complainant  and the accused were in a common law relationship that was plagued by violence  and financial difficulties. According to the complainant, the accused persuaded  her to have sex on a webcam for money, dance for men, and offer sexual services  for money, which she did because of the accused\u2019s violence and threats towards  her. She also claimed that the accused was deeply involved in the sexual services, including posting ads offering sexual  services, and received all the money. She  stated that this continued  until she left the accused in 2012. The accused was charged with trafficking in  persons and receiving a material benefit from it, contrary to sections  279.01(1) and 279.02(1) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. At trial, the  complainant and five other witnesses provided evidence of the accused\u2019s  violence towards the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the accused. He  accepted that the complainant was in a violent relationship with the accused, but  he found her testimony lacking in credibility. He also had a reasonable doubt  about the accused\u2019s ties to any prostitution enterprise. He considered the evidence  from the other witnesses as backdrop, but not in relation to the alleged  offences, concluding that it related to \u201cpast discreditable conduct\u201d. Evidence  of past discreditable conduct relates to past misconduct of the accused that  goes beyond what is alleged by the prosecution in relation to an offence and is  not normally admissible. The Crown appealed the  acquittals to the Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge should have  considered the evidence of the other witnesses about the accused\u2019s violence  towards the complainant. The majority of the Court of Appeal confirmed the  acquittals. It held that the trial judge was wrong to conclude that the accused\u2019s violence was past discreditable conduct but that  the error did not have a significant impact on the  acquittals. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not fail  to consider all the evidence. The dissenting judge would have ordered a new  trial, finding that the trial judge failed to consider all the evidence, and  that treating the accused\u2019s violence as past discreditable conduct  misapprehended its nature and relevance to the elementsof both offences that the Crown needed to establish. The Crown  appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and ordered a new trial.<strong>Evidence of regular violence, threats of violence, and a  violent relationship may be relevant to the elements of the offence of  trafficking in persons.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that the trial judge assessed the  evidence based on a wrong legal principle by determining that the evidence of  violence and threats of violence by the accused towards the complainant was  evidence of past discreditable conduct. This error of law hindered his  assessment of the evidence and considerably diminished the evidentiary  foundation relevant to the essential elements of the trafficking in  persons offence and the definition of exploitation set  out in section 279.04 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>. The trial  judge\u2019s error might have had a material bearing on the acquittals. They should  therefore be set aside and a new trial ordered."

In 2016, TransAlta entered into an off-coal agreement with Alberta. Under that agreement, TransAlta agreed to cease coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030, in exchange for substantial transition payments from Alberta for 14 years to compensate TransAlta for the loss resulting from the reduced life of its coal-fired facilities. TransAltas coal-fired facilities are assessed as linear property for municipal taxation purposes. Sections 322 and 322.1 of Albertas Municipal Government Act (MGA) authorize the provinces Minister of Municipal Affairs to establish guidelines for assessing the value of linear property.\n\tIn 2017, the Minister established the 2017 Alberta Linear Property Assessment Ministers Guidelines (Linear Guidelines) under the MGA. Sections 1.003 and 2.003 of the Linear Guidelines deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim additional depreciation on the basis of the reduction in its facilities lifespan arising from the off-coal agreement. TransAlta challenged the vires of the Linear Guidelines on two bases: (1) they violate the common law rule against administrative discrimination; and (2) they are inconsistent with the purposes of the MGA.\n\tThe chambers judge upheld the validity of the Linear Guidelines and found that the Linear Guidelines did not discriminate against TransAlta. The Court of Appeal determined that the Linear Guidelines did not discriminate against TransAlta and held that the chambers judge did not err in finding that they were within the Ministers authority. \n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tAs set out in the companion case Auer v. Auer, 2024 SCC 36, the reasonableness standard under Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. In addition, certain principles from Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 810, continue to inform reasonableness review, but the threshold from Katz Group used to determine whether subordinate legislation is ultra vires on the basis that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute  that it be irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to that statutory purpose  is no longer applicable to this analysis. As well, the governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law, and the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant constraints when determining whether subordinate legislation falls reasonably within the scope of the delegates authority. In the instant case, no exception to the presumption of reasonableness review applies and thus the reasonableness standard applies when reviewing the vires of the Linear Guidelines. Having regard to the governing statutory scheme, the principles of statutory interpretation, and the common law rule against administrative discrimination, the Linear Guidelines are intra vires the Minister.\n\tAdministrative discrimination arises when subordinate legislation expressly distinguishes among the persons to whom its enabling legislation applies. Administrative discrimination is different than discrimination in the context of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or human rights legislation. It relates to the drawing of distinctions between persons or classes that are discriminatory in a non-pejorative sense, in that they simply do not apply equally to all those engaged in the activity that is the subject of the enactment. The common law rule against administrative discrimination provides that subordinate legislation that discriminates in the administrative law sense is invalid unless the discrimination is authorized  either expressly or by necessary implication  by the enabling statute. It is concerned with ensuring that statutory delegates act within the scope of their authority when they distinguish between the persons to whom the enabling legislation applies. The question of statutory authorization to discriminate falls within the reasonableness review to be conducted in a vires challenge to subordinate legislation, unless the legislature has indicated otherwise or a question relating to the rule of law arises which should be reviewed for correctness.\n\tIn the instant case, the Linear Guidelines discriminate against TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements by singling them out as being ineligible to claim additional depreciation on the basis of the off-coal agreements. The fact that the Linear Guidelines treat all parties to off-coal agreements in the same way does not mean that they are not discriminatory; they treat all parties to off-coal agreements in the same discriminatory way, as compared with owners of linear property who are not parties to off-coal agreements and expressly distinguish between owners of linear property who are parties to off-coal agreements and those who are not parties to such agreements, though both are subject to the MGA.\n\tThe MGA does not expressly authorize the Minister to discriminate against TransAlta; however, that discrimination is statutorily authorized by necessary implication. To ensure that the assessment of TransAltas coal-fired facilities was current, correct, fair and equitable in accordance with the purpose of the MGA, it falls within a reasonable interpretation of the Ministers statutory grant of power to conclude that he was authorized to deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim additional depreciation. Transition payments under the off-coal agreement account for some loss of value to TransAltas coal-fired facilities due to their reduced life and the existence of the off-coal agreement is a specification or characteristic of TransAltas coal-fired facilities that the Minister was authorized to consider in establishing valuation standards for those facilities. The Linear Guidelines are consistent with the purposes of the MGA and do not violate the common law rule against administrative discrimination; they are therefore intra vires the Minister.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Auer v.

In 2016, TransAlta entered into an agreement with the Crown in Right of Alberta entitled Off-Coal Agreement. Under that agreement, TransAlta agreed to cease coal-fired emissions by December 31, 2030, in exchange for substantial transition payments from Alberta for 14 years to compensate TransAlta for the loss resulting from the reduced life of its coal-fired facilities.\nTransAlta challenges the vires of the 2017 Alberta Linear Property Assessment Ministers Guidelines (2018) (Linear Guidelines) issued by the Minister of Municipal Affairs under the Municipal Government Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. M-26 (MGA). The Linear Guidelines set out the procedures for assessing all linear property for municipal taxation purposes. TransAltas coal-fired facilities are considered linear property. The Linear Guidelines provide that TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements are ineligible to claim additional depreciation to account for the reduced life of their coal-fired facilities.\nTransAlta submits that the Linear Guidelines are ultra vires the Minister on two bases: (1) they violate the common law rule against administrative discrimination by discriminating, without statutory authorization, against parties who have entered into off-coal agreements with Alberta; and (2) they are inconsistent with the purposes of the MGA.\nIn the companion case, Auer v. Auer, 2024 SCC 36, our Court holds that, as established in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, the reasonableness standard presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. Given that no exception to that presumption applies here, this appeal provides our Court with an opportunity to illustrate how the reasonableness standard of review applies to a vires review of subordinate legislation when the challenger invokes the common law rule against administrative discrimination.\nAs I will explain, the Linear Guidelines discriminate against TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements by depriving them of the ability to claim additional depreciation reflecting the reduced lifespan of their coal-fired facilities. However, that discrimination is statutorily authorized by necessary implication. To ensure that the assessment of TransAltas coal-fired facilities was current, correct, fair and equitable in accordance with the purposes of the MGA (Edmonton (City) v. Edmonton East (Capilano) Shopping Centres Ltd., 2016 SCC 47, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 293, at para. 46), it falls within a reasonable interpretation of the Ministers statutory grant of power to conclude that he was authorized to deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim additional depreciation. This is because the transition payments from Alberta to TransAlta under the Off-Coal Agreement already account for at least some loss of value to TransAltas coal-fired facilities due to their reduced life. Further, the existence of the Off-Coal Agreement is a specification or characteristic of TransAltas coal-fired facilities that the Minister was authorized to consider in establishing valuation standards for those facilities.\nGiven my conclusion that it is a reasonable interpretation of the Ministers statutory grant of power to conclude that discrimination is statutorily authorized by necessary implication, it follows that the Linear Guidelines are consistent with the purposes of the MGA. To reiterate, the Linear Guidelines serve to ensure that tax assessments are current, correct, fair and equitable in accordance with the purposes of the MGA.\nThus, having regard to the governing statutory scheme, the principles of statutory interpretation, and the common law rule against administrative discrimination, I conclude that the Linear Guidelines are intra vires the Minister.\nFacts\nTransAltas coal-fired facilities are assessed as linear property for municipal taxation purposes. Section 284(1)(k) of the MGA defines linear property, and ss. 322 and 322.1 authorize the Minister of Municipal Affairs to establish guidelines for assessing the value of linear property. In 2017, the Minister established the Linear Guidelines, which provide that [t]here will be no recognition [of] or adjustment [to depreciation] in Schedule C or Schedule D as a result of the cessation or reduction of coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030 arising from an Off-Coal Agreement or Provincial or Federal legislation (s. 1.003(d)). TransAlta brought an application for judicial review challenging the vires of the Linear Guidelines on several bases, including that they discriminate against TransAlta by depriving it, without statutory authorization, of the right to claim a form of depreciation that is available to linear property that is not subject to an off-coal agreement.\nJudicial History\nCourt of Queens Bench of Alberta, 2021 ABQB 37\nThe chambers judge upheld the validity of the Linear Guidelines. She noted that, following Vavilov, the reasonableness standard applies when assessing the vires of subordinate legislation. However, her application of the reasonableness standard was largely informed by Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 810. In her view, the Linear Guidelines were not irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to the purposes of the MGA (para. 57, referring to Katz Group, at para. 28). The MGA granted the Minister broad authority to establish valuation standards for regulated property, such as TransAltas coal-fired facilities. The Minister was not limited to adopting the market value standard.\nThe chambers judge found that the Linear Guidelines did not discriminate against TransAlta for two reasons. First, they did not deprive TransAlta of a form of depreciation to which it was previously entitled. Second, they did not deprive TransAlta of a form of depreciation applicable to other types of linear property. However, she explained that even if the Linear Guidelines were discriminatory, the Minister was authorized by the MGA to discriminate against TransAlta because the creation and implementation of an assessment regime necessarily includes drawing distinctions among various types of properties (para. 73).\nCourt of Appeal of Alberta, 2022 ABCA 381\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed TransAltas appeal. Regarding the standard of review, the court held that the principles articulated in Katz Group were not overtaken or modified by Vavilov. Applying Katz Group, the court held that the chambers judge did not err in finding that the Linear Guidelines were within the Ministers authority.\nThe court determined that the Linear Guidelines did not discriminate against TransAlta since the impugned provisions applied to all coal-fired facilities subject to off-coal agreements, not just to those owned by TransAlta. In the courts view, the Minister was authorized to distinguish between coal-fired facilities and other types of electric power generation properties because the Minister was generally authorized to make regulations respecting any . . . matter considered necessary to carry out the intent of the MGA, and drawing distinctions between different classes of properties was a necessary incident of the authority to establish a property valuation regime (paras. 84-85).\nIssues\nThe issues on appeal are as follows:\nWhat is the applicable standard of review when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation?\nAre the Linear Guidelines ultra vires the Minister under the MGA?\nStandard of Review\nAs set out in the companion case, Auer, the reasonableness standard under Vavilov presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. No exception to the presumption of reasonableness review applies in this case. Indeed, the legislature has not indicated that the Linear Guidelines must be reviewed on a different standard, and the rule of law does not require that the correctness standard apply. Thus, the reasonableness standard applies when reviewing the vires of the Linear Guidelines.\nAs explained in Auer, Katz Group continues to provide helpful guidance and inform reasonableness review. In particular, the following principles from Katz Group continue to apply:\nSubordinate legislation must be consistent both with specific provisions of the enabling statute and with its overriding purpose or object (References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 175 (GGPPA), at para. 87; see also Vavilov, at paras. 108 and 110; Reference re Impact Assessment Act, 2023 SCC 23, at para. 283, per Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ., dissenting in part, but not on this point).\nSubordinate legislation continues to benefit from a presumption of validity (Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 17, at para. 54).\nThe challenged subordinate legislation and the enabling statute are to be interpreted using a broad and purposive approach to statutory interpretation (see Green v. Law Society of Manitoba, 2017 SCC 20, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 360, at para. 28; West Fraser Mills Ltd. v. British Columbia (Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal), 2018 SCC 22, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 635, at para. 12).\nA review of the vires of subordinate legislation does not involve assessing policy merits. Courts are to review only the legality or validity of subordinate legislation (West Fraser Mills, at para. 59, per Cote J., dissenting, but not on this point; La Rose v. Canada, 2023 FCA 241, 488 D.L.R. (4th) 340, at para. 28).\nAt the same time, for subordinate legislation to be ultra vires on the basis that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, it no longer needs to be irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to that statutory purpose (see Auer, at paras. 4, 41 and 49; see also Katz Group, at para. 28). Continuing to maintain this threshold from Katz Group would be inconsistent with the robust reasonableness review introduced by Vavilov and would undermine Vavilovs promise of simplicity, coherence and predictability.\nReviewing the vires of subordinate legislation is fundamentally an exercise of statutory interpretation to ensure that the delegate has acted within the scope of their lawful authority under the enabling statute (Vavilov, at para. 108; M. P. Mancini, One Rule to Rule Them All: Subordinate Legislation and the Law of Judicial Review (2024), 55 Ottawa L. Rev. 245, at pp. 274-75; see, e.g., West Fraser Mills, at para. 23). This exercise must be carried out in accordance with the modern principle of statutory interpretation (Vavilov, at paras. 120-21; Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21). The governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law, and the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant constraints when determining whether the subordinate legislation at issue falls reasonably within the scope of the delegates authority (J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation (3rd ed. 2021), at p. 175).\nBefore I begin this analysis, I provide an overview of the Off-Coal Agreement and the relevant legislation.\nOverview of the Off-Coal Agreement, the MGA and the Linear Guidelines\nThe Off-Coal Agreement\nTransAlta entered into the Off-Coal Agreement with Alberta on November 24, 2016. TransAlta agreed to cease coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030 (Off-Coal Agreement, s. 2, reproduced in A.R., at p. 151). In exchange, Alberta agreed to make 14 annual transition payments of $39,851,704.60 to TransAlta (s. 3(a)).\nThe Off-Coal Agreement does not expressly refer to property taxes or depreciation. However, the amount of the transition payments was calculated by taking the net book value of the coal-fired facilities as provided by TransAlta, [p]ro-rated by percentage of life remaining after 2030 to give proxy for 2030 [net book value]: divided by remaining years under federal end-of-life as of November 2016, then multiplied by years stranded (Sch. A). This formula demonstrates that the transition payments account for at least some loss of value to TransAltas coal-fired facilities arising from their reduced lifespan under the Off-Coal Agreement. As the Court of Appeal noted, [i]t is evident on the face of the Off-Coal Agreements that the Province sought to address some loss of value arising from the reduced life of the appellants coal-fired electricity generation plants and to treat affected companies equivalently (para. 23).\nFurther, it is noteworthy that the Off-Coal Agreement provides that it runs with the facilities. Indeed, TransAlta may transfer title to or ownership interest in its facilities with Albertas consent, but only if any new owner agrees to be bound by the terms of the Off-Coal Agreement (s. 11(n)).\nThe Municipal Government Act\nThe MGA regulates property assessment and taxation in Alberta (Capilano, at para. 9; Alberta Municipal Affairs, Guide to Property Assessment and Taxation in Alberta (2018) (Guide), at p. 2). Property assessment is the process of estimating a propertys dollar value for taxation purposes (Guide, at p. 3). Under the MGA, assessment means a value of property determined in accordance with this Part [(i.e., Part 9 Assessment of Property)] and the regulations (s. 284(1)(c)). Property taxation is the process of applying a tax rate to a propertys assessed value to determine the tax payable (Guide, at p. 3).\nThe MGA sets out two types of valuation standards: the market value standard and the regulated standard (Guide, at p. 3). Most properties are assessed using the market value standard. The market value of a property is the price a property might reasonably be expected to sell for if sold by a willing seller to a willing buyer after appropriate time and exposure in an open market (p. 5; see also MGA, s. 1(1)(n)).\nThere are three approaches to determining the market value of a property: the sales comparison approach, the cost approach, and the income approach (Guide, at p. 6). Under the sales comparison approach, the market value of a property is determined by considering the sale price of similar properties. Under the cost approach, the market value of a property is determined by aggregating the market value of the land and the net cost of improvements. This approach assumes that a buyer would not pay more to purchase a property than what it would cost to buy the land and rebuild the same improvements. Under the income approach, the market value of a property is determined on the basis of its income-earning potential. This approach is used to assess the value of rental properties (p. 7).\nThe regulated standard is a property assessment standard based on rates and procedures prescribed by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (Guide, at p. 29). It is used to assess properties that are difficult to assess under the market value standard because they seldom trade in the marketplace, they cross municipalities and municipal boundaries or they are of a unique nature (p. 7).\nUnder s. 284(1)(k) of the MGA, TransAltas coal-fired facilities are considered linear property, which is a subset of designated industrial property under s. 284(1)(f.01). Sections 322 and 322.1 of the MGA authorize the Minister to establish guidelines for assessing the value of linear property. TransAltas facilities are thus assessed using the regulated standard. As noted by the Court of Appeal, market value is not intended to be the standard for determining the value of [TransAltas] linear properties. . . . [T]here is no mention of market value in any of the linear property assessment provisions of the MGA (para. 59).\nAssessments of linear property must be prepared by the provincial assessor (MGA, s. 292(1)). Each assessment must reflect the valuation standard as well as the specifications and characteristics of the linear property as specified in the regulations (s. 292(2)). In preparing an assessment of linear property, the assessor must follow the procedures set out in the Ministers guidelines (Matters Relating to Assessment and Taxation Regulation, Alta. Reg. 220/2004, s. 8(2)).\nSection 322(1) of the MGA delegates regulation-making power to the Minister. More specifically, it authorizes the Minister to make regulations establishing valuation standards for property, respecting the assessment of linear property, respecting designated industrial property, including, without limitation, regulations respecting the specifications and characteristics of designated industrial property, respecting processes and procedures for preparing assessments, and respecting any other matter considered necessary to carry out the intent of [the MGA]. Under s. 322(2), the Minister may make an order establishing guidelines respecting any matter for which the Minister may make a regulation under s. 322(1). The Linear Guidelines are deemed to be guidelines established under s. 322(2) (s. 322.1(1) and (3)).\nAs the Court of Appeal recognized, [t]he language used in s. 322(1) to describe the Ministers regulation-making power in relation to property assessment is indisputably broad (para. 57). The question is whether ss. 1.003 and 2.003 of the Linear Guidelines are reasonably within the scope of the Ministers authority.\nThe Linear Guidelines\nOn December 19, 2017, the Minister made Ministerial Order No. MAG:021/17 establishing the Linear Guidelines. They became effective for taxation in 2018 and subsequent years.\nThe Linear Guidelines set out the procedures for calculating all linear property assessments. They require assessors to multiply the values determined under four schedules. TransAltas challenge focuses on ss. 1.003 and 2.003 of the Linear Guidelines.\nSection 1.003 of the Linear Guidelines describes the schedules used in the assessment of linear property. Schedules C and D are the schedules relevant to this appeal.\nSchedule C provides the process for determining depreciation or lists the applicable depreciation factors. Section 1.003(c) states that [t]he depreciation factors prescribed in Schedule C are fixed and certain and must be applied as listed in the applicable Schedule C depreciation table, without adjustment or modification (emphasis deleted).\nSchedule D provides the process for determining additional depreciation or lists the applicable additional depreciation factors. Under Sch. D, the assessor may allow additional depreciation (Schedule D) on a case-by-case basis and only if the operator provides acceptable evidence to the assessor (s. 2.004(e)). However, the Linear Guidelines specify that [t]here will be no recognition or adjustment in Schedule C or Schedule D as a result of the cessation or reduction of coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030 arising from an Off-Coal Agreement or Provincial or Federal legislation (s. 1.003(d)).\nSection 2.003 of the Linear Guidelines addresses Schs. C and D depreciation as it applies to TransAlta. It too provides that [t]here will be no recognition or adjustment in Schedule C or Schedule D as a result of the cessation or reduction of coal-fired emissions on or before December 31, 2030 arising from an Off-Coal Agreement or Provincial or Federal legislation.\nThe practical effect of these provisions is that an assessor cannot allow TransAlta additional depreciation for its coal-fired facilities on the basis that those facilities are subject to the Off-Coal Agreement (see Linear Guidelines, ss. 1.003(d) and 2.004(e)).\nAnalysis\nTransAlta challenges the validity of the Linear Guidelines on two bases. First, it invokes the common law principle that a statutory delegate has no authority to make discriminatory distinctions unless the statute either expressly, or by necessary implication, grants them such authority. TransAlta argues that the Linear Guidelines discriminate against it by denying it the ability to seek additional depreciation for its coal-fired facilities and that the Minister did not have the statutory authority to establish guidelines that discriminate in this manner. Second, it asserts that the Linear Guidelines are inconsistent with the overarching purposes of the assessment and taxation regime under the MGA.\nIn what follows, I will assess whether the Linear Guidelines fall reasonably within the scope of the Ministers authority under the MGA, having regard to the relevant constraints: (1) the common law rule against administrative discrimination; (2) the MGA, which is the governing statutory scheme; and (3) the principles of statutory interpretation. I will begin by outlining the common law rule against administrative discrimination. I will then consider whether the Linear Guidelines violate this rule.\nAs I will explain, the Linear Guidelines do not violate the common law rule against administrative discrimination. This is because the MGA authorizes the Minister, by necessary implication, to discriminate against TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements by depriving them of the ability to claim additional depreciation. It follows that the Linear Guidelines are consistent with the purposes of the MGA. As will become clear, the Linear Guidelines serve to ensure that tax assessments are current, correct, fair and equitable in accordance with the purposes of the MGA.\nThe Common Law Rule Against Administrative Discrimination\nAdministrative discrimination arises when [subordinate] legislation expressly distinguishes among the persons to whom its enabling legislation applies (Keyes, at pp. 370-71, citing L.-P. Pigeon, Drafting and Interpreting Legislation (1988), at p. 42; Federation des producteurs de fruits et legumes du Quebec v. Conserverie canadienne Ltee, [1990] R.J.Q. 2866 (Sup. Ct.), at p. 2871; Sunshine Village Corp. v. Canada (Parks), 2004 FCA 166, [2004] 3 F.C.R. 600, at para. 13).\nAdministrative discrimination is different than discrimination in the context of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or human rights legislation: When we speak of administrative discrimination, we are not speaking of discrimination based on personal characteristics, such as sex, race or religion, that is proscribed by many human rights statutes (P. Salembier, Regulatory Law and Practice (3rd ed. 2021), at p. 303). Rather, administrative discrimination relates to the drawing of distinctions between persons or classes that are discriminatory in a non-pejorative but most neutral sense of the word, in that they simply do not apply equally to all those engaged in the activity that is the subject of the enactment (p. 303, quoting Montreal (City of) v. Arcade Amusements Inc., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 368, at p. 406, and Sunshine Village Corp., at para. 13, citing D. J. M. Brown and J. M. Evans, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (looseleaf), at para. 15:3212).\nThe common law rule against administrative discrimination provides that subordinate legislation that discriminates in the administrative law sense is invalid unless the discrimination is authorized by the enabling statute (Arcade Amusements, at p. 404; Forget v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 90, at pp. 105-6; Katz Group, at para. 47; Keyes, at p. 371; Salembier, at pp. 307-8). The enabling statute may authorize administrative discrimination, either expressly or by necessary implication (Arcade Amusements, at p. 413; Forget, at pp. 105-6; Katz Group, at para. 47).\nAs McLachlin J. (as she then was), dissenting, but not on this point, explained when reviewing the validity of a municipal bylaw in Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 231, at p. 259, the rule against administrative discrimination is concerned with ensuring that statutory delegates act within the scope of their authority when they distinguish between the persons to whom the enabling legislation applies:\nThe rule pertaining to municipal discrimination is essentially concerned with the municipalitys power. Municipalities must operate within the powers conferred on them under the statutes which create and empower them. Discrimination itself is not forbidden. What is forbidden is discrimination which is beyond the municipalitys powers as defined by its empowering statute. Discrimination in this municipal sense is conceptually different from discrimination in the human rights sense; discrimination in the sense of the municipal rule is concerned only with the ambit of delegated power.\nWith this in mind, I turn to the question of whether the Linear Guidelines discriminate against TransAlta.\nThe Linear Guidelines Discriminate Against Parties to Off-Coal Agreements\nThe chambers judge found that the Linear Guidelines did not discriminate against TransAlta because they did not deprive TransAlta of a form of depreciation to which it was previously entitled or which applied to other types of linear property (para. 72). The Court of Appeal also held that the Linear Guidelines did not discriminate against TransAlta. It held so on the basis that the impugned provisions apply to all coal-fired facilities subject to off-coal agreements, not just to those owned by TransAlta (para. 86).\nI disagree with the courts below. The Linear Guidelines discriminate against TransAlta and other parties to off-coal agreements by singling them out as being ineligible to claim additional depreciation on the basis of the off-coal agreements and to have the assessor consider that claim (see ss. 1.003(d) and 2.004(e)). Owners of linear property who are not parties to off-coal agreements are eligible to make claims for additional depreciation and to have those claims considered by the assessor without exclusion.\nThe chambers judge was correct in stating that TransAlta was not entitled to additional depreciation. However, but for the impugned provisions of the Linear Guidelines, TransAlta would have been eligible to claim additional depreciation and to have that claim considered by the assessor. Section 2.004(e) of the Linear Guidelines provides that [s]ubject to section 1.003(d) and section 2.003(b), the assessor may allow additional depreciation (Schedule D) on a case-by-case basis and only if the operator provides acceptable evidence to the assessor. TransAlta is not eligible to advance a claim for additional depreciation for consideration by the assessor on the basis of the reduction in its facilities lifespan arising from the Off-Coal Agreement because s. 1.003(d) states that [t]here will be no recognition or adjustment in Schedule C or Schedule D as a result of the cessation or reduction of coal-fired emissions . . . arising from an Off-Coal Agreement.\nThe fact that the Linear Guidelines treat all parties to off-coal agreements in the same way does not mean that they are not discriminatory. The Linear Guidelines treat all parties to off-coal agreements in the same discriminatory way, as compared with owners of linear property who are not parties to off-coal agreements. As explained, administrative discrimination arises when subordinate legislation expressly distinguishes among the persons to whom its enabling legislation applies (Keyes, at pp. 370-71). The Linear Guidelines expressly distinguish between owners of linear property who are parties to off-coal agreements and those who are not parties to such agreements, though both are subject to the MGA.\nThe next question is whether the MGA authorizes the Minister to discriminate against TransAlta on the basis of the Off-Coal Agreement, having regard to the purposes of the MGA and the principles of statutory interpretation. If the MGA does so, either expressly or by necessary implication, the Linear Guidelines will not be invalid for being discriminatory.\nThe Minister Is Statutorily Authorized To Discriminate Against Parties to Off-Coal Agreements\nThe question of statutory authorization to discriminate falls within the reasonableness review to be conducted in a vires challenge to subordinate legislation, unless the legislature has indicated otherwise or a question relating to the rule of law arises which should be reviewed for correctness (Vavilov, at para. 53).\nThe MGA does not expressly authorize the Minister to discriminate against TransAlta by distinguishing between parties who have entered into off-coal agreements with Alberta and those who have not. However, the MGA, by necessary implication, authorizes the Minister to draw this distinction.\nWhen a court reviews the vires of subordinate legislation, the challenged legislation and the enabling statute must be interpreted using a broad and purposive approach (Katz Group, at para. 26). TransAltas coal-fired facilities are deemed to be linear property (MGA, s. 284(1)(k)). The Minister has broad authority to make regulations establishing valuation standards for linear property, respecting the assessment of linear property, respecting the processes and procedures for preparing assessments and respecting any matter considered necessary to carry out the intent of the MGA (s. 322(1)(c.1), (d), (e) and (i)). The legislation is clear: the valuation standard for linear property is the one established by the Minister (ss. 322 and 322.1; Matters Relating to Assessment and Taxation Regulation, s. 8(2)).\nIn establishing a valuation standard for linear property, the Minister is authorized to make regulations respecting designated industrial property, including, without limitation, regulations respecting the specifications and characteristics of designated industrial property (MGA, s. 322(1)(d.3)). The specifications and characteristics that the Minister sets out must be taken into account by the assessor when assessing the value of the property for taxation purposes (s. 292(2)(b)). This grant of authority is articulated in very broad terms  without limitation  and specifically empowers the Minister to identify and make regulations respecting the specifications and characteristics of industrial property. It is not possible to construe s. 322(1)(d.3) without contemplating the drawing of distinctions between types of properties on the basis of their specifications and characteristics.\nAdditionally, it follows from the MGAs purpose of ensuring that assessments are current, correct, fair and equitable (Capilano, at para. 46, quoting Edmonton (City) v. Army & Navy Department Stores Ltd., [2002] A.M.G.B.O. No. 126 (QL), at para. 114) that the Minister has the authority to draw distinctions on the basis of the specifications and characteristics of properties where ignoring them would create a risk of inappropriate assessments. The inverse is also true: where appropriate, the Minister must have authority to pronounce that certain specifications and characteristics are not relevant to an assessment, as he did in this case. The statute, by necessary implication, grants the Minister the authority to discriminate in the manner that he did.\nThe Linear Guidelines Are Consistent With the Scheme and Purposes of the MGA\nSince I have found that the Minister had the authority to discriminate between different types of property, the next question is whether he exercised that authority in a manner that is consistent with the scheme and purposes of the MGA. The MGA has two purposes: (1) to establish and maintain a property assessment system that fairly and equitably distributes taxes, and promotes transparency, predictability and stability for municipalities and taxpayers (Guide, at p. 2); and (2) to ensure that assessments are current, correct, fair and equitable (Capilano, at para. 46, quoting Army & Navy, at para. 114).\nTransAlta submits that the discrimination against it resulted in a valuation of its coal-fired facilities that was both incorrect and unfair (A.F., at paras. 49, 68, 77 and 85; transcript, at pp. 57, 67, 70-71 and 159). It submits that the Off-Coal Agreement does not account for depreciation, which is essential to an accurate valuation of its property. In its view, the transition payments compensate it purely for loss of profits (transcript, at p. 57). TransAlta also submits that the Minister was not entitled to distinguish between parties to off-coal agreements and others because being a party to an off-coal agreement is a characteristic of the owner, not of the property itself. In other words, it is not a specification or characteristic of the linear property as contemplated in ss. 292(2)(b) and 322(1)(d.3) of the MGA (A.F., at para. 68).\nI disagree. As I will explain, ss. 1.003 and 2.003 of the Linear Guidelines, which deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim additional depreciation on the basis of the reduction in its facilities lifespan arising from the Off-Coal Agreement, are consistent with the purpose of ensuring current, correct, fair and equitable assessments and accord with the language in ss. 292(2)(b) and 322(1)(d.3) of the MGA.\nThe formula used to calculate the transition payments in the Off-Coal Agreement accounts for at least some loss of value arising from the reduced life of TransAltas coal-fired facilities. It does so by prorating the net book value of the facilities by the percentage of life remaining after 2030 (Off-Coal Agreement, Sch. A). Even if the payments are characterized as compensation for loss of profits, because the payments promise additional revenues that run with the assets, their effect is to offset the decrease in value caused by the facilities reduced lifespan. To be current and correct, an assessment of TransAltas coal-fired facilities must consider the fact that the transition payments mitigate at least some depreciation that would otherwise result from the early retirement of the facilities. Therefore, in light of the MGAs purpose of ensuring that assessments are current and correct, it was reasonable for the Minister to interpret his statutory grant of power as authorizing him to deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim additional depreciation under the Linear Guidelines.\nTo deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim additional depreciation is also consistent with the MGAs purpose of ensuring that assessments are fair and equitable. Since the transition payments already account for at least some loss of value resulting from the reduced life of TransAltas coal-fired facilities, there would be a real risk of double dipping if TransAlta were able to receive additional depreciation for that same loss of value under the Linear Guidelines. That would not be fair or equitable.\nTransAltas assertion that the existence of the Off-Coal Agreement is a characteristic of the owner  not of the property itself  is inaccurate. The Off-Coal Agreement runs with the facilities. A transfer of title to or ownership interest in the facilities requires Albertas consent and requires the new owner to agree to be bound by the terms of the Off-Coal Agreement:\nTransfer of Ownership of Plants. The Company or the Plant Owners may transfer title to or ownership interest in all the Plants with the consent of the Province, not to be unreasonably withheld, provided that the new owner agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, in which case the Company and the Plant Owners shall be released from their obligations hereunder. [s. 11(n)]\nWhile TransAlta, as the owner, entered into the Off-Coal Agreement, being subject to the Off-Coal Agreement is not merely a characteristic of TransAlta. Rather, because any subsequent owner of TransAltas coal-fired facilities must agree to be bound by the terms of the Off-Coal Agreement, being subject to the Off-Coal Agreement is also properly considered a specification or characteristic of those facilities. Under s. 322(1)(d.3) of the MGA, the Minister may make regulations respecting designated industrial property, including, without limitation, regulations respecting the specifications and characteristics of designated industrial property. Since TransAltas coal-fired facilities are deemed designated industrial property under s. 284(1)(f.01)(ii) of the MGA, the Minister was authorized to make regulations designating an off-coal agreement as a specification or characteristic of those facilities to ensure that assessments thereof would be current, correct, fair and equitable.\nConclusion\nTransAlta has not met its burden of proving that the Linear Guidelines are ultra vires the Minister (Vavilov, at para. 100; Katz Group, at para. 25; Canadian Council for Refugees, at para. 54).\nThe Minister is authorized under the MGA, by necessary implication, to discriminate against TransAlta. The Minister has indisputably broad authority to establish valuation standards for linear property under s. 322(1) of the MGA. This includes the authority to determine the specifications and characteristics of the property that an assessment must reflect in order to be current, correct, fair and equitable (Capilano, at para. 46). To properly make regulations respecting specifications and characteristics, the Minister must therefore have the authority to contemplate the drawing of distinctions as between types of properties.\nAccordingly, the Linear Guidelines fall within a reasonable interpretation of the enabling statute having regard to the relevant constraints, and are intra vires the Minister. They are consistent both with specific provisions of the enabling statute and with its overriding purpose or object (GGPPA, at para. 87). They also do not contravene the common law rule against administrative discrimination.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants: Lawson Lundell, Calgary; Michael Sobkin, Ottawa; TransAlta Corporation, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the respondents: Brownlee, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown Law Office  Civil, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Ministere de la Justice du Quebec, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Ministry of Attorney General of British Columbia, Legal Services Branch, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General for Saskatchewan: Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice and Attorney General, Regina.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia: Hunter Litigation Chambers, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario and the Health Justice Program: Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Chicken Farmers of Canada, the Egg Farmers of Canada, the Turkey Farmers of Canada and the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers: Conway Baxter Wilson, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia: Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia, Richmond.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers: Refugee Law Office, Toronto; Landings, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Association quebecoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration: Hasa Avocats Inc., Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Advocates for the Rule of Law: Henein Hutchison Robitaille, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities: Shores Jardine, Edmonton.",

In 2017, the Minister  established the <em>2017 Alberta Linear  Property Assessment Minister\u2019s Guidelines </em>under the Act. The  Guidelines, which are subordinate  legislation, deprive TransAlta of the ability to claim a more favourable tax position because  of the reduction in its facilities\u2019 lifespan resulting from the off-coal agreement. TransAlta said the Minister had gone beyond his authority in making the Guidelines  (that they were <em>ultra vires</em>) because they  are discriminatory and inconsistent with the purposes of the Act.The Court of King\u2019s  Bench said the Guidelines were valid and did not discriminate against TransAlta. The Court  of Appeal dismissed TransAlta\u2019s appeal.  The Court of Appeal held that the principles articulated in the Supreme Court  of Canada\u2019s decision in <em>Katz Group  Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care)</em> determined how the  Guidelines should be reviewed. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority  granted by a statute because it is inconsistent with the purpose of that  statute, it had to be shown that it was  \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to the purpose. The Court of Appeal  held that the subsequent decision  in <em><a href=\"../2019/37748-eng.aspx\">Canada  (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</a></em> did not  change these principles. Following <em>Vavilov</em>,the presumptive standard of review is  reasonableness. A reasonable decision  is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It has to make sense in light of the  law and the facts, but need not be the only right answer. TransAlta appealed again to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed its appeal. <strong>The  guidelines fall reasonably within the scope of the Minister\u2019s authority under Alberta\u2019s <em>Municipal Government Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained that the reasonableness standard under <em>Vavilov</em> presumptively applies when  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Certain  principles from <em>Katz Group </em>continue  to inform reasonableness review, but for a court to  find subordinate legislation to be beyond  the authority granted in statute because  it is inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no longer  needs to be \u201cirrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated\u201d to that purpose. The  governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law rules, and  the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant  constraints when determining whether subordinate  legislation falls reasonably within the scope of the authority. In the instant case, no exception to the  presumption of reasonableness review applies. Having regard to the governing  statutory scheme, the principles of statutory interpretation, and the common  law rule against administrative discrimination, the Guidelines are within the scope  of the Minister\u2019s authority."

Their child resides with the mother. The father paid child support to the mother, but brought an application for judicial review challenging the vires of the Federal Child Support Guidelines (Guidelines), which determine the amount of child support to be paid in case of divorce. The father argued that the Governor in Council (GIC) exceeded its authority under s. 26.1(1) and (2) of the Divorce Act when enacting the Guidelines because they require a payer parent to pay a greater share of the child-related costs than the recipient parent. \n\tThe chambers judge held that following Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, reasonableness is the presumptive standard of review for assessing the vires of subordinate legislation, but that reasonableness review should be informed by the principles outlined in Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64. The chambers judge concluded that the Guidelines are intra vires and dismissed the fathers application for judicial review.\n\tThe Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the fathers appeal but was divided on the applicable standard of review. The majority held that Vavilov did not overtake Katz Group and that to be ultra vires for being inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, true regulations such as those established by the GIC must be irrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated to that purpose. A concurring judge held that the reasonableness standard applies when reviewing the vires of the Guidelines, and that the criteria set out in Katz Group inform reasonableness review.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tVavilovs robust reasonableness standard is the presumptive standard for reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. In the instant case, the Guidelines fall reasonably within the GICs scope of authority under the Divorce Act, having regard to the relevant constraints. Under s. 26.1(1), the GIC is granted extremely broad authority to establish guidelines respecting child support. Section 26.1(2) constrains this authority by requiring that the guidelines be based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute. The Guidelines respect this constraint.\n\tIn Vavilov, the Court set out a comprehensive framework for determining the standard of review that applies to any substantive review of an administrative decision and, in doing so, contemplated questions involving challenges to the vires of subordinate legislation. Vavilovs framework established a presumption of reasonableness review, subject to limited exceptions where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard to apply or where the rule of law requires that the correctness standard be applied. This framework applies to determining the standard for reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. Subordinate legislation derives its validity from the statute which creates the power, and not from the executive body by which it is made. Accordingly, the identity of the decision maker who enacted it does not determine the standard of review. Unless the legislature has indicated otherwise, or the rule of law requires otherwise, the vires of subordinate legislation are to be reviewed on the reasonableness standard regardless of the delegate who enacted it, their proximity to the legislative branch or the process by which the subordinate legislation was enacted. In the instant case, the legislature has not indicated that the GICs decision to establish the Guidelines must be reviewed on a standard other than reasonableness, nor does the rule of law require that questions of vires, in themselves, be reviewed for correctness. Accordingly, the presumptive standard of reasonableness applies.\n\tIn conducting a reasonableness review, the reviewing court asks whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness  justification, transparency and intelligibility  and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision. Many of the principles from the Courts decision in Katz Group continue to inform reasonableness review of the vires of subordinate legislation and remain good law. Specifically: (1) subordinate legislation must be consistent both with specific provisions of the enabling statute and with its overriding purpose or object; (2) subordinate legislation benefits from a presumption of validity; (3) the challenged subordinate legislation and the enabling statute should be interpreted using a broad and purposive approach to statutory interpretation; and (4) a vires review does not involve assessing the policy merits of the subordinate legislation to determine whether it is necessary, wise, or effective in practice.\n\tAll of the above principles from Katz Group, including the principle that subordinate legislation benefits from a presumption of validity, have been repeatedly affirmed by the Courts jurisprudence. The presumption of validity has two aspects: (1) it places the burden on challengers to demonstrate the invalidity of subordinate legislation; and (2) it favours an interpretive approach that reconciles the subordinate legislation with its enabling statute so that, where possible, the subordinate legislation is construed in a manner which renders it intra vires. When the reasonableness standard applies, challengers must demonstrate that the subordinate legislation does not fall within a reasonable interpretation of the delegates statutory authority to overcome the presumption of validity. For subordinate legislation to be found ultra vires on the basis that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, it no longer needs to be irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to that statutory purpose  maintaining this threshold from Katz Group in the face of the significant sea change brought about by Vavilov would perpetuate uncertainty in the law, would be inconsistent with the robust reasonableness review detailed in Vavilov, and would undermine Vavilovs promise of simplicity, predictability and coherence. As such, there is a sound basis for a narrow departure from Katz Group.\n\tReasonableness review is possible in the absence of formal reasons. Most of the time, formal reasons are not provided for the enactment of subordinate legislation; however, Vavilov contemplated reasonableness review in the absence of formal reasons, including in the context of a vires review of subordinate legislation. The reasoning process can often be deduced from various sources. Furthermore, reasonableness review is not an examination of policy merits. A courts role is to review the legality or validity of the subordinate legislation, not to review whether it is necessary, wise, or effective in practice. Potential or actual consequences of the subordinate legislation are relevant only insofar as a reviewing court must determine whether the statutory delegate was reasonably authorized to enact subordinate legislation that would have such consequences. The reasonableness standard does not assess the reasonableness of the rules promulgated by the relevant authority nor is it an inquiry into its underlying political, economic, social, or partisan considerations; rather reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation is fundamentally an exercise of statutory interpretation to ensure that the delegate has acted within the scope of their lawful authority under the enabling statute. The governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law, and the principles of statutory interpretation are relevant constraints when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. The language chosen by the legislature in an enabling statute describes the limits and contours of a delegates authority. The legislature may use precise and narrow language to delineate the power in detail, thereby tightly constraining the delegates authority, or may use broad, open-ended or highly qualitative language, thereby conferring broad authority on the delegate. Statutory delegates must respect the legislatures choice in this regard. The scope of a statutory delegates authority may also be constrained by other statutory or common law. Unless the enabling statute provides otherwise, when enacting subordinate legislation, statutory delegates must adopt an interpretation of their authority that is consistent with other legislation and applicable common law principles.\n\tIn addition, statutory delegates are empowered to interpret the scope of their authority when enacting subordinate legislation, but their interpretation must be consistent with the text, context, and purpose of the enabling statute. The words of the enabling statute must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament, in accordance with the modern principle of statutory interpretation. In conducting a vires review, a court does not undertake a de novo analysis to determine the correct interpretation of the enabling statute and then ask whether, on that interpretation, the delegate had the authority to enact the subordinate legislation. Rather, the court ensures that the delegates exercise of authority falls within a reasonable interpretation of the enabling statute, having regard to the relevant constraints.\n\tApplying the reasonableness standard to review the vires of the Guidelines, the conclusion is that they are within the GICs scope of authority and are therefore intra vires. The GICs statutory grant of authority is extremely broad. The GIC was entitled to choose an approach to calculating child support that (1) does not take into account the recipient parents income; (2) assumes that parents spend the same linear percentage of income on their children regardless of the parents levels of income and the childrens ages; (3) does not take into account government child benefits paid to recipient parents; (4) does not take into account direct spending on the child by the payer parent when that parent exercises less than 40 percent of annual parenting time; and (5) risks double counting certain special or extraordinary expenses. Each of these decisions fell squarely within the scope of the authority delegated to the GIC under the Divorce Act.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

The appellant, Roland Nikolaus Auer, challenges the vires of the Child Support Guidelines. This challenge requires our Court to determine whether the GIC acted within the scope of its delegated authority in establishing the Child Support Guidelines.\nTo answer this question, our Court has to determine the standard of review that applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. Doing so requires the Court to resolve debates about the continued relevance of Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 810, in light of our Courts decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653.\nI conclude that the reasonableness standard as set out in Vavilov presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. I also conclude that some of the principles from Katz Group continue to inform such reasonableness review: (1) subordinate legislation must be consistent both with specific provisions of the enabling statute and with its overriding purpose or object; (2) subordinate legislation benefits from a presumption of validity; (3) the challenged subordinate legislation and the enabling statute should be interpreted using a broad and purposive approach to statutory interpretation; and (4) a vires review does not involve assessing the policy merits of the subordinate legislation to determine whether it is necessary, wise, or effective in practice.\nHowever, for subordinate legislation to be found ultra vires on the basis that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, it no longer needs to be irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to that statutory purpose. Continuing to maintain this threshold from Katz Group would be inconsistent with the robust reasonableness review detailed in Vavilov and would undermine Vavilovs promise of simplicity, predictability and coherence.\nThe Child Support Guidelines are intra vires the GIC. They fall within a reasonable interpretation of the scope of the GICs authority under s. 26.1 of the Divorce Act, having regard to the relevant constraints. Section 26.1(1) of the Divorce Act grants the GIC extremely broad authority to establish guidelines respecting child support. This authority is constrained by s. 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act, which requires that the guidelines be based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute. The Child Support Guidelines respect this constraint.\nContrary to Mr. Auers submissions, in selecting an approach to calculating child support, the GIC was authorized to: (1) not take into account the recipient parents income; (2) assume that parents spend the same linear percentage of income on their children regardless of the parents levels of income and the childrens ages; (3) not take into account government child benefits paid to recipient parents; (4) not take into account direct spending on the child by the payer parent when that parent exercises less than 40 percent of annual parenting time; and (5) risk the double counting of certain special or extraordinary expenses. Each of these decisions falls squarely within the scope of the authority delegated to the GIC under the Divorce Act. Accordingly, I would dismiss Mr. Auers appeal.\nFacts\nRoland Auer and the respondent Aysel Igorevna Auer were married in 2004. They had one child together in 2005 and divorced in 2008. Their child resides with Ms. Auer. Mr. Auer has paid both child and spousal support to Ms. Auer. Mr. Auer also has children from other marriages to whom he owes, or has owed, support.\nMr. Auer brought an application for judicial review challenging the vires of the Child Support Guidelines. He argued that the GIC exceeded its authority under s. 26.1(1) and (2) of the Divorce Act when enacting the Child Support Guidelines because they require a payer parent to pay a greater share of the child-related costs than the recipient parent. Ms. Auer did not participate in the application before the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta, and the Attorney General of Canada was granted leave to intervene with broad rights, such that he is now a respondent in this matter.\nMr. Auer and Ms. Auer have ongoing applications before the Court of Kings Bench of Alberta concerning child and spousal support issues. Those applications have been heard and are subject to the outcome of this appeal.\nJudicial History\nCourt of Queens Bench of Alberta, 2021 ABQB 370, 32 Alta. L.R. (7th) 250\nThe chambers judge dismissed Mr. Auers application for judicial review. He held that, following Vavilov, the presumptive standard of review for assessing the vires of subordinate legislation is reasonableness, but that reasonableness review should be informed by the principles outlined in Katz Group.\nThe chambers judge held that s. 26.1(1) of the Divorce Act, which authorizes the GIC to establish guidelines respecting orders for child support, confers the GIC an extremely broad grant of authority, and that the Child Support Guidelines provisions were not irrelevant, extraneous or unrelated to the purpose of child support (para. 52; see also paras. 76 and 78).\nMr. Auer argued that the Child Support Guidelines are ultra vires because they require the payer parent to pay a greater share of the child-related costs than the recipient parent. He relied heavily on s. 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act, which he said imposes a specific constraint on the GICs regulation-making authority. Section 26.1(2) provides that the Child Support Guidelines shall be based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute to the performance of that obligation. Mr. Auer argued that specific aspects of the Child Support Guidelines violate the constraint imposed in s. 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act by requiring the payer parent to bear a greater share of the child-related costs than the recipient parent. These aspects include the presumption that both parents earn the same income, a courts authority to award special or extraordinary expenses under s. 7 of the Child Support Guidelines and the decision not to include child tax benefits as part of the recipient parents income.\nThe chambers judge accepted that s. 26.1(2) informs, and to a degree, constrains the GICs grant of authority, but held that this constraint must be weighed against the GICs extremely broad grant of authority under s. 26.1(1) (para. 52). In his view, most of the issues Mr. Auer raised fell outside of a vires review because they sought to impugn the GICs policy decisions and ignored the GICs broad discretion under the Divorce Act. The chambers judge ultimately concluded that the Child Support Guidelines are intra vires.\nCourt of Appeal of Alberta, 2022 ABCA 375, 52 Alta. L.R. (7th) 8\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed Mr. Auers appeal. However, the court was divided on the standard of review applicable to a review of the vires of subordinate legislation.\nWriting for the majority, Pentelechuk J.A. held that Vavilov did not overtake Katz Group. In her view, to be ultra vires for being inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, true regulations (para. 34), such as those established by the GIC, which create law through the exercise of a legislative function, must be irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to that purpose (Katz Group, at para. 28). However, the reasonableness standard applies when reviewing bylaws, rules, and regulations made by administrative tribunals or municipal governments (C.A. reasons, at para. 34; see also para. 20).\nLike the chambers judge, Pentelechuk J.A. concluded that the Child Support Guidelines are not irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to the Divorce Acts purpose. She noted that [w]hile the Guidelines may not be perfect, time has demonstrated that they have achieved the stated intent of predictability and ease of use (para. 113). She found that the chambers judges analysis was thorough and properly alive to the limitations of reviewing subordinate legislation and to the fact that Mr. Auers arguments were inextricably woven with policy disputes. Thus, she dismissed Mr. Auers appeal.\nJustice Feehan concurred in the result but held that the reasonableness standard under the Vavilov framework applies when reviewing the vires of the Child Support Guidelines. In his view, the criteria set out in Katz Group inform reasonableness review.\nIssues\nThe issues on appeal are as follows:\nWhat is the applicable standard of review when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation?\nAre the Child Support Guidelines ultra vires the GIC under the Divorce Act?\nStandard of Review\nVavilov Is the Starting Point for Determining the Appropriate Standard of Review\nVavilov represented a recalibration of the governing approach to the choice of standard of review analysis and a clarification of the proper application of the reasonableness standard (para. 143). It set out a holistic revision of the framework for determining the applicable standard of review when conducting a substantive review of an administrative decision (ibid.). Our Court explained that Vavilov is the starting point: A court seeking to determine what standard is appropriate in a case before it should look to these reasons first in order to determine how this general framework applies to that case (ibid.).\nThat said, Vavilov was not itself a case about the vires of subordinate legislation. It involved the judicial review of a decision by the Canadian Registrar of Citizenship to cancel Mr. Vavilovs certificate of citizenship on the basis that he was not a Canadian citizen under s. 3(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, because he fell within the ambit of an exception set out at s. 3(2)(a). Thus, in Vavilov, our Court did not explicitly settle the standard of review that applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation (J. M. Keyes, Judicial Review of Delegated Legislation  The Road Beyond Vavilov (2022), 35 C.J.A.L.P. 69, at p. 100). However, as I explain below, Vavilov provides the appropriate framework for determining the standard of review in this context. Under that framework, I conclude that the reasonableness standard applies to the vires challenge in this case.\nThe Vavilov Framework Applies When Reviewing the Vires of Subordinate Legislation\nIn Vavilov, our Court set out a comprehensive framework for determining the standard of review that applies to any substantive review of an administrative decision (para. 17). In doing so, this Court brought greater coherence and predictability to this area of law and eliminated the need for courts to engage in a contextual inquiry to determine the appropriate standard of review (paras. 10 and 17). Our Court recognized that the sheer variety of decisions and decision makers posed a challenge to developing a coherent and unified approach to judicial review (para. 88). We ensured that the revised framework accommodates all types of administrative decision making, in areas that range from immigration, prison administration and social security entitlements to labour relations, securities regulation and energy policy (para. 11). These include decisions of specialized tribunals exercising adjudicative functions, independent regulatory bodies, ministers, front-line decision makers, and more . . . vary[ing] in complexity and importance, ranging from the routine to the life-altering . . . includ[ing] matters of high policy on the one hand and pure law on the other (para. 88).\nIn setting out Vavilovs comprehensive framework, our Court expressly contemplated questions of vires. Specifically, this Court ceased to recognize jurisdictional questions  also referred to as true questions of jurisdiction or vires  as a distinct category of questions attracting correctness review (paras. 65-67 and 200). In doing so, we expressly referred to cases involving challenges to the vires of subordinate legislation, including Green v. Law Society of Manitoba, 2017 SCC 20, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 360, and West Fraser Mills Ltd. v. British Columbia (Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal), 2018 SCC 22, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 635 (Vavilov, at para. 66). This Court explained that it is often difficult to distinguish between exercises of delegated power that raise truly jurisdictional questions from those entailing an unremarkable application of an enabling statute, especially where, as in Green and West Fraser Mills, the legislature has delegated broad authority to an administrative decision maker that allows the latter to make regulations in pursuit of the objects of its enabling statute (Vavilov, at para. 66, citing Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 SCC 31, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 230, at para. 111, per Brown J., concurring).\nVavilovs framework applies to determining the standard for reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. Vavilov set out a comprehensive framework for determining the applicable standard of review and, in doing so, contemplated questions of vires.\nReasonableness Is the Presumptive Standard for Reviewing the Vires of Subordinate Legislation\nVavilovs framework established a presumption of reasonableness review. It set out limited exceptions where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard to apply or where the rule of law requires that the correctness standard be applied (para. 17). The questions for which the rule of law requires that the correctness standard be applied include: (1) constitutional questions that require a final and determinate answer from the courts; (2) general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole; and (3) questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (para. 53).\nNo exception to the presumption of reasonableness review applies in this case. The legislature has not indicated that the GICs decision to establish the Child Support Guidelines must be reviewed on a standard other than reasonableness, nor does the rule of law require that the correctness standard be applied to a vires review of the Child Support Guidelines.\nIn Vavilov, our Court explained that the rule of law does not require that questions of vires, in themselves, be reviewed for correctness (paras. 67-69 and 109; see also J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation (3rd ed. 2021), at pp. 171-72). A robust reasonableness review is sufficient to ensure that statutory delegates act within the scope of their lawful authority (Vavilov, at paras. 67-69 and 109). Further, when explaining that reasonableness review can be conducted even in the absence of reasons, our Court cited Catalyst Paper Corp. v. North Cowichan (District), 2012 SCC 2, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 5, and Green, both of which involved a review of the vires of subordinate legislation (Vavilov, at para. 137).\nAll of this indicates that Vavilovs robust reasonableness standard is the default standard when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation (Keyes (2021), at p. 171; see also Keyes (2022); P. Daly, A Culture of Justification: Vavilov and the Future of Administrative Law (2023), at pp. 146-47; M. P. Mancini, One Rule to Rule Them All: Subordinate Legislation and the Law of Judicial Review (2024), 55 Ottawa L. Rev. 245). However, in exceptional cases, a vires review may engage a question that the rule of law requires be reviewed for correctness. In such cases, the presumption of reasonableness review may be rebutted. For example, a challenge to the validity of subordinate legislation on the basis that it fails to respect the division of powers between Parliament and provincial legislatures would require that the correctness standard be applied.\nReviewing the vires of the Child Support Guidelines does not engage a question that the rule of law requires be reviewed for correctness. Accordingly, the presumptive standard of reasonableness applies in this case.\nWhat Is the Role of Katz Group?\nMany of the Principles From Katz Group Continue To Apply\nIn Katz Group, our Court upheld the validity of Ontario regulations adopted by the Lieutenant Governor in Council that aimed to control the price of prescription drugs. Justice Abella, writing for our Court, did not discuss the applicable standard of review. However, she outlined the following principles for assessing the vires of subordinate legislation:\nA successful challenge to the vires of regulations requires that they be shown to be inconsistent with the objective of the enabling statute or the scope of the statutory mandate (para. 24);\nRegulations benefit from a presumption of validity . . . . This presumption has two aspects: it places the burden on challengers to demonstrate the invalidity of regulations . . . and it favours an interpretive approach that reconciles the regulation with its enabling statute so that, where possible, the regulation is construed in a manner which renders it intra vires (para. 25 (emphasis deleted));\nBoth the challenged regulation and the enabling statute should be interpreted using a broad and purposive approach . . . consistent with the Courts approach to statutory interpretation generally (para. 26, quoting United Taxi Drivers Fellowship of Southern Alberta v. Calgary (City), 2004 SCC 19, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 485, at para. 8);\nThis inquiry does not involve assessing the policy merits of the regulations to determine whether they are necessary, wise, or effective in practice (para. 27, quoting Jafari v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1995] 2 F.C. 595 (C.A.), at p. 604). It is not an inquiry into the underlying political, economic, social or partisan considerations or an assessment of whether the regulations will actually succeed at achieving the statutory objectives (para. 28, quoting Thornes Hardware Ltd. v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 106, at pp. 112-13);\nThe regulations must be irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to the statutory purpose to be found ultra vires on the basis of inconsistency with statutory purpose (para. 28).\nFor convenience, I will refer to the final principle as the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold.\nIn setting out Vavilovs comprehensive framework for determining the applicable standard of review, our Court did not entirely discard prior jurisprudence. Rather, the Court explicitly stated that past precedents will often continue to provide helpful guidance (para. 143). This remains true even when considering cases involving true questions of jurisdiction or vires, though they will necessarily have less precedential force because Vavilov ceased to recognize such questions as a distinct category attracting correctness review (paras. 65 and 143). As Paul Daly explains, past jurisprudence has not been ousted by Vavilov ((2023), at pp. 148-49, citing Terrigno v. Calgary (City), 2021 ABQB 41, 1 Admin. L.R. (7th) 134, at para. 62). Since Katz Group involved a true question of jurisdiction or vires, the Court must carefully examine the role of that case going forward.\nIn my view, all of the above-mentioned principles in Katz Group, except for the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold, remain good law and continue to inform the review of the vires of subordinate legislation. As I will explain, the significant sea change brought about by Vavilov in favour of a presumption of reasonableness as a basis for review erodes the rationale for the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold, and maintaining this threshold would perpetuate uncertainty in the law. Accordingly, there is sound basis for a narrow departure from Katz Group (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Power, 2024 SCC 26, at paras. 98 and 209; R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 202, per Cote, Brown and Rowe JJ., concurring). Otherwise, Katz Group continues to provide valuable guidance on the application of the reasonableness standard (Daly (2023), at p. 148). To the extent that the principles in Katz Group do not conflict with Vavilov, they are to form part of the application of the reasonableness standard (p. 149).\nFor greater clarity, the principle that subordinate legislation must be consistent both with specific provisions of the enabling statute and with its overriding purpose or object continues to apply when conducting a vires review (References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 175, at para. 87; see also Vavilov, at paras. 108 and 110; Reference re Impact Assessment Act, 2023 SCC 23, at para. 283, per Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ., dissenting in part, but not on this point). The principle that subordinate legislation benefits from a presumption of validity also continues to apply (Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 17, at para. 54). Further, the challenged subordinate legislation and the enabling statute should continue to be interpreted using a broad and purposive approach (Green, at para. 28; West Fraser Mills, at para. 12). Finally, a vires review does not involve assessing the policy merits of the subordinate legislation to determine whether it is necessary, wise, or effective in practice. Courts are to review only the legality or validity of subordinate legislation (West Fraser Mills, at para. 59, per Cote J., dissenting, but not on this point; La Rose v. Canada, 2023 FCA 241, 488 D.L.R. (4th) 340, at para. 26; see also Mancini, at p. 276).\nThese well-established principles are consistent with Vavilov, and they should continue to be applied in accordance with the foundational common law principle of stare decisis.\nAs explained, Vavilov recognized the continued relevance and application of prior jurisprudence insofar as that jurisprudence is consistent with Vavilovs framework for determining the appropriate standard of review and its principles governing robust reasonableness review. Nothing in Vavilov contradicts the principles that: (1) subordinate legislation must be consistent both with specific provisions of the enabling statute and with its overriding purpose or object, (2) the challenged subordinate legislation and the enabling statute are to be interpreted using a broad and purposive approach to statutory interpretation and (3) a review of the vires of subordinate legislation does not involve assessing policy merits.\nThe principle that subordinate legislation benefits from a presumption of validity has been criticized by some for being inconsistent with Vavilov (see Portnov v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 171, [2021] 4 F.C.R. 501, at paras. 20-22; Innovative Medicines Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2022 FCA 210, 8 Admin. L.R. (7th) 44, at para. 30). However, this criticism is mistaken.\nIn Katz Group, our Court explained that this presumption has two aspects: (1) it places the burden on challengers to demonstrate the invalidity of [subordinate legislation]; and (2) it favours an interpretive approach that reconciles the [subordinate legislation] with its enabling statute so that, where possible, the [subordinate legislation] is construed in a manner which renders it intra vires (para. 25 (emphasis in original)).\nThe first aspect  that the burden is on challengers to demonstrate the invalidity of subordinate legislation  is uncontroversial. Indeed, in Vavilov, our Court explained that where an administrative decision is reviewed for reasonableness, [t]he burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable (para. 100).\nThe second aspect  that, where possible, subordinate legislation should be construed in a manner that renders it intra vires  is also consistent with Vavilov. This aspect does not heighten the burden that challengers would otherwise face pursuant to Vavilov. The burden on challengers depends on the applicable standard of review. If the reasonableness standard applies, to overcome the presumption of validity, challengers must demonstrate that the subordinate legislation does not fall within a reasonable interpretation of the delegates statutory authority. If the correctness standard applies, challengers can overcome the presumption of validity by demonstrating that the subordinate legislation does not fall within the correct interpretation of the delegates statutory authority.\nAll of these principles from Katz Group, including the principle that subordinate legislation benefits from a presumption of validity, have been repeatedly affirmed by our Court (see Vavilov, at paras. 108 and 110; References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, at para. 87; Reference re Impact Assessment Act, at para. 283; Canadian Council for Refugees, at para. 54; Green, at para. 28; West Fraser Mills, at paras. 12 and 59). In these circumstances, it would be inconsistent with the common law tradition and the principle of stare decisis to discard Katz Group and the continued application of these principles.\nThe Irrelevant, Extraneous or Completely Unrelated Threshold Is No Longer Relevant\nWriting for a majority of the Court of Appeal, Pentelechuk J.A. held that the vires of the Child Support Guidelines was to be reviewed on the basis of the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold, instead of on the reasonableness standard in accordance with Vavilov. I disagree. As I explain in this section, the conceptual basis for the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold does not hold in a legal landscape now organized by the principles set out in Vavilov, which centre around reasonableness review. This threshold from Katz Group is now out of step with these principles; maintaining it would perpetuate uncertainty in the law. Accordingly, the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold does not provide a standalone rule for a vires review.\nJustice Pentelechuk distinguished between true regulations, which create law through the exercise of a legislative function, such as those passed by the GIC, and bylaws, rules, and regulations made by administrative tribunals or municipal governments (paras. 20 and 34). She held that the vires of true regulations are not to be reviewed on the reasonableness standard; rather, the appropriate test is whether they are irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to the purpose of their enabling statute, as outlined in Katz Group. By contrast, the vires of bylaws, rules and regulations made by administrative tribunals or municipal governments are to be reviewed for reasonableness (para. 82). In making this distinction, Pentelechuk J.A. relied on the fact that true regulations are subject to a consultation process culminating in parliamentary review while bylaws, rules, and regulations made by administrative tribunals or municipal governments are not (para. 34).\nAccording to Pentelechuk J.A., the appropriate standard for reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation depends on the identity of the decision maker who enacted it. I disagree. The identity of the decision maker does not determine the standard of review. Regulations derive their validity from the statute which creates the power, and not from the executive body by which they are made (Canadian Council for Refugees, at para. 51, citing Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in relation to Chemicals, [1943] S.C.R. 1, at p. 13). In Vavilov, our Court noted the sheer variety of [administrative] decisions and decision makers and yet confirmed that reasonableness is a single standard that takes account of this diversity (para. 88).\nTo summarize, unless the legislature has indicated otherwise or if a matter invokes an issue pertaining to the rule of law which would require a review on the basis of correctness, the vires of subordinate legislation are to be reviewed on the reasonableness standard regardless of the delegate who enacted it, their proximity to the legislative branch or the process by which the subordinate legislation was enacted. Introducing these distinctions into the standard of review framework would be contrary to the Vavilovian purposes of simplification and clarity (P. Daly, Resisting which Sirens Call? Auer v Auer, 2022 ABCA 375 and TransAlta Generation Partnership v Alberta (Minister of Municipal Affairs), 2022 ABCA 381, November 24 2022 (online); Daly (2023), at p. 147).\nIn concurring reasons, Feehan J.A. held that while the vires of subordinate legislation are to be reviewed for reasonableness pursuant to Vavilov, the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold informs that analysis. He explained that the presumption that subordinate legislation is valid may be overcome if the regulation is irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to the objectives of governing statutes (para. 123(b)). The chambers judge was of a similar view (see paras. 17 and 78). I reject this approach. The irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold should not inform reasonableness review under the Vavilov framework. This is because that threshold is inconsistent with robust reasonableness review under that framework and because maintaining it would undermine Vavilovs promise of simplicity, predictability and coherence.\nReasonableness review ensures that courts intervene in administrative matters where it is truly necessary to do so to safeguard the legality, rationality and fairness of the administrative process (Vavilov, at para. 13). While reasonableness review finds its starting point in the principle of judicial restraint and demonstrates a respect for the distinct role of administrative decision makers, [i]t remains a robust form of review (ibid.). By contrast, the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold connotes a very high degree of deference, one that is inconsistent with the degree of scrutiny required under a reasonableness review (see British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200, 482 D.L.R. (4th) 20, at para. 94).\nThis inconsistency is of particular importance when considering the concern that an administrative decision maker might interpret the scope of its own authority beyond what the legislature intended (Vavilov, at para. 109; see also para. 68). In Vavilov, our Court explained that robust reasonableness review is capable of allaying [this] concern and allows courts to fulfill their constitutional duty to ensure that administrative bodies have acted within the scope of their lawful authority (paras. 67 and 109). By contrast, the very high degree of deference that the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold accords statutory delegates in interpreting their authority under their enabling statute does not adequately address this concern. This is demonstrated by Abella J.s comment that it would take an egregious case to strike down subordinate legislation on the basis that it is irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to the purpose of its enabling statute (Katz Group, at para. 28, citing Thornes Hardware, at p. 111).\nFurther, Vavilov sought to bring simplicity, predictability and coherence to the analysis for determining the appropriate standard of review. Our Court noted that reasonableness is a single standard that applies in different contexts (para. 89). Vavilovs objective of providing simplicity, predictability and coherence would be undermined if different tests, such as the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold, applied as part of the reasonableness standard. Even if different tests were sufficiently robust, the mere fact of applying them would create undue complexity and fragmentation (Keyes (2022), at pp. 75-76; see also Innovative Medicines Canada, at para. 35).\nUltimately, we should depart from the irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated threshold established in Katz Group because its rationale was eroded by Vavilov and because continuing to maintain it would create or perpetuate uncertainty in the law (Vavilov, at para. 20; Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development v. Ranville, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 518, at p. 528).\nHow To Conduct a Reasonableness Review of the Vires of Subordinate Legislation Under the Vavilov Framework\nIn conducting a reasonableness review, the reviewing court asks whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness  justification, transparency and intelligibility  and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision (Vavilov, at para. 99). Subordinate legislation benefits from a presumption of validity (Katz Group, at para. 25). The burden is on the party challenging the subordinate legislation to show that it is not reasonably within the scope of the delegates authority (Vavilov, at paras. 100 and 109).\nVavilov recognized two types of fundamental flaws that would make an administrative decision unreasonable: (1) there is a failure of rationality internal to the reasoning process; or (2) the decision is untenable in light of the factual and legal constraints that bear on it (para. 101). In what follows, I will explain how the principles outlined in Vavilov for conducting reasonableness review apply to a review of the vires of subordinate legislation.\nReasonableness Review Is Possible in the Absence of Formal Reasons\nMost of the time formal reasons are not provided for the enactment of subordinate legislation (Vavilov, at para. 137). However, Vavilov contemplated reasonableness review in the absence of formal reasons, including in the context of a vires review of subordinate legislation (ibid., referring to Catalyst Paper and Green). [E]ven in such circumstances, the reasoning process that underlies the decision will not usually be opaque (Vavilov, at para. 137). The reasoning process can often be deduced from various sources.\nIn Catalyst Paper, our Court reviewed the validity of municipal taxation bylaws. Chief Justice McLachlin noted that [t]he reasons for a municipal bylaw are traditionally deduced from the debate, deliberations and the statements of policy that give rise to the bylaw (para. 29). Courts can also look to regulatory impact analysis statements if they are available. As Mancini explains:\n. . . something akin to a form of justification  whether a record of submissions, an accompanying statement of purpose, or specific recitals  may sometimes accompany regulatory action. Specifically  especially in the modern era  the problem of having neither a record nor reasons is less likely to arise. As [John Mark] Keyes noted, the sources for the reasoning process of executive legislation have become increasingly rich as the processes for making it have become more transparent in the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st. At the federal level, statutory instruments, like regulations, are accompanied by Regulatory Impact Analysis Statements outlining the reasons for regulations and their anticipated impact. Courts can use Regulatory Impact Analysis Statements to assess the reasonableness of executive legislation by providing insight into the interlocking purposes of the enabling statute and regulatory instrument.\n\n(pp. 278-79, citing J. M. Keyes, Judicial Review of Delegated Legislation: The Long and Winding Road to Vavilov, in University of Ottawa Faculty of Law, Working Paper No. 2020-14 (June 18, 2020), at p. 11, and J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation (2nd ed. 2010), at ch. 4.)\nEven where such sources are not available, it is possible for the record and the context to reveal that a decision was made on the basis of an improper motive or for another impermissible reason, as, for example, in Roncarelli [v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121] (Vavilov, at para. 137). However, importantly, as I explain below, the issue of whether the regulations is a reasonable decision depends on whether the regulations are justifiably (or reasonably) within the scope of the authority delegated by the enabling legislation.\nReasonableness Review Is Not an Examination of Policy Merits\nJustice Pentelechuk was of the view that applying Vavilovs reasonableness standard when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation would violate the principle of separation of powers because the court would be examining the policy merits of the subordinate legislation (paras. 58-59 and 63; see also S. Blake, Clarity on the standard of review of regulations, December 20, 2022 (online)).\nWith respect, this concern is misplaced. As Paul Salembier explains, [t]he reasonableness standard does not assess the reasonableness of the rules promulgated by the regulation-making authority; rather, it addresses the reasonableness of the regulation-making authoritys interpretation of its statutory regulation-making power (Regulatory Law and Practice (3rd ed. 2021), at p. 159). A courts role is to review the legality or validity of the subordinate legislation, not to review whether it is necessary, wise, or effective in practice (Katz Group, at para. 27, citing Jafari, at p. 604; see also Keyes (2021), at pp. 186-88). It is not an inquiry into the underlying political, economic, social or partisan considerations (Katz Group, at para. 28, citing Thornes Hardware, at pp. 112-13).\nA court must be mindful of its proper role when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation, especially when it relies on the record, other sources or the context to ascertain the delegates reasoning process. Mancini explains:\nImportantly courts must organize these various sources properly to preserve the focus on the limiting statutory language. Again, the reasonableness review should not focus on the content of the inputs into the process or the policy merits of those inputs. Rather, courts must key these sources to the analysis of whether the subordinate instrument is consistent with the enabling statutes text, context, and purpose. For example, Regulatory Impact Analysis Statements can inform a court as to the link between an enabling statutes purpose and a regulatory aim, much like Hansard evidence. These analyses can help show how the effects of a regulation which, at first blush appear unreasonable, are enabled by the primary legislation. [p. 279]\nThe potential or actual consequences of the subordinate legislation are relevant only insofar as a reviewing court must determine whether the statutory delegate was reasonably authorized to enact subordinate legislation that would have such consequences. Whether those consequences are in themselves necessary, desirable or wise is not the appropriate inquiry.\nThe Relevant Constraints\nIn Vavilov, our Court explained that [e]lements of the legal and factual contexts of a decision operate as constraints on the decision maker in the exercise of its delegated powers (para. 105). Reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation is fundamentally an exercise of statutory interpretation to ensure that the delegate has acted within the scope of their lawful authority under the enabling statute (para. 108; Mancini, at pp. 274-75; see, e.g., West Fraser Mills, at para. 23).\nAccordingly, the governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law and the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant constraints when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation (Keyes (2021), at p. 175).\nGoverning Statutory Scheme\nBecause administrative decision makers receive their powers by statute, the governing statutory scheme is likely to be the most salient aspect of the legal context relevant to a particular decision (Vavilov, at paras. 108-9; Mancini, at p. 275).\nThe language chosen by the legislature in an enabling statute describes the limits and contours of a delegates authority (Vavilov, at para. 110). The legislature may use precise and narrow language to delineate the power in detail, thereby tightly constraining the delegates authority. Alternatively, the legislature may use broad, open-ended or highly qualitative language, thereby conferring broad authority on the delegate (ibid.; see also Keyes (2021), at pp. 195-96). Statutory delegates must respect the legislatures choice in this regard. They must ultimately comply with the rationale and purview of their enabling statutory scheme in accordance with its text, context and purpose (Vavilov, at para. 108, citing Catalyst Paper, at paras. 15 and 25-28, and Green, at para. 44).\nOther Statutory or Common Law\nThe scope of a statutory delegates authority may also be constrained by other statutory or common law. Unless the enabling statute provides otherwise, when enacting subordinate legislation, statutory delegates must adopt an interpretation of their authority that is consistent with other legislation and applicable common law principles (Vavilov, at para. 111, referring to Katz Group, at paras. 45-48; Montreal (City) v. Montreal Port Authority, 2010 SCC 14, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 427, at para. 40; Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 74; Canada (Transport, Infrastructure and Communities) v. Farwaha, 2014 FCA 56, [2015] 2 F.C.R. 1006, at paras. 93-98; Keyes (2021), at pp. 205-6).\nPrinciples of Statutory Interpretation\nStatutory delegates are empowered to interpret the scope of their authority when enacting subordinate legislation. Their interpretation must, however, be consistent with the text, context and purpose of the enabling statute (Vavilov, at paras. 120-21; Keyes (2021), at p. 193). They must interpret the scope of their authority in accordance with the modern principle of statutory interpretation. The words of the enabling statute must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, citing E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87).\nIn conducting a vires review, a court does not undertake a de novo analysis to determine the correct interpretation of the enabling statute and then ask whether, on that interpretation, the delegate had the authority to enact the subordinate legislation. Rather, the court ensures that the delegates exercise of authority falls within a reasonable interpretation of the enabling statute, having regard to the relevant constraints.\nIn what follows, I apply the reasonableness standard to review the vires of the Child Support Guidelines.\nAnalysis\nOverview of the Child Support Guidelines\nIn Canada, child support has been legislated since 1855. Early statutory schemes vested judges with discretion to determine child support amounts based on need. Judges were thus required to decide upon a reasonable amount of child support for the care of the child (Michel v. Graydon, 2020 SCC 24, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 763, at para. 46). This discretionary approach was heavily criticized for being uncertain, inconsistent, and often resulting in unfair awards (para. 48; J. D. Payne and M. A. Payne, Child Support Guidelines in Canada, 2020 (2020), at p. 1). This was in part because judges, counsel, or parties underestimat[ed] the cost of raising a child and because courts would insist on proof of the childs expenses (Michel, at para. 48). This placed the burden of proof on the recipient parent, and where such evidence was not adduced, there was concern that the award would be subjective and somewhat arbitrary (ibid., citing Childs v. Childs (1990), 107 N.B.R. (2d) 176 (C.A.), at para. 6).\nAs Martin J. explained in her concurring reasons in Michel, the objective of the Child Support Guidelines was to remedy this situation by maintaining the principles core to child support while providing much-needed certainty, consistency, predictability, and efficiency (para. 49, citing Francis v. Baker, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 250, at paras. 39-40). The federal, provincial and territorial governments formed a Family Law Committee (Committee) to undertake major research studies on child support in Canada (Payne and Payne, at p. 1). The Committee recommended the application of a child support formula under the Divorce Act, guided by the principle that both parents have a responsibility to meet the financial needs of the children according to their income (Michel, at para. 49, citing Federal/Provincial/Territorial Family Law Committee, Report and Recommendations on Child Support (1995), at p. i). In 1996, following the Committees recommendation, Parliament introduced Bill C-41, An Act to amend the Divorce Act, the Family Orders and Agreements Enforcement Assistance Act, the Garnishment, Attachment and Pension Diversion Act and the Canada Shipping Act, 2nd Sess., 35th Parl., 1996-97 (as passed by the House of Commons on November 18, 1996). Bill C-41 amended the Divorce Act to expressly authorize the GIC to establish guidelines respecting orders for child support (Divorce Act, s. 26.1(1)).\nOn May 1, 1997, the GIC established the Child Support Guidelines, which introduced a radical change to child support rights and obligations under the Divorce Act (Payne and Payne, at p. 1). Our Court has described the purpose of the Child Support Guidelines as being to establish fair levels of support for children from both parents upon marriage breakdown, in a predictable and consistent manner (Francis, at para. 39; see also Child Support Guidelines, s. 1). While the Child Support Guidelines depart from the discretionary model that preceded them, they continue to reflect the following core principles: (1) child support is the right of the child; (2) the right to support survives the breakdown of the childs parents marriage; (3) child support should, as much as possible, provide children with the same standard of living they enjoyed when their parents were together; and (4) the specific amounts of child support owed will vary based upon the income of the payer parent (D.B.S. v. S.R.G., 2006 SCC 37, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231, at para. 38).\nSection 3 of the Child Support Guidelines creates a presumptive rule whereby, unless otherwise provided by the Divorce Act or under the Guidelines, the amount of a child support order for children under the age of majority is (a) the amount set out in the applicable table . . . and (b) the amount, if any, determined under section 7 of the Guidelines for special or extraordinary expenses (Payne and Payne, at p. 12). The table amount is a function of the income of the paying parent and the number of children the award is to cover (Francis, at para. 1). The table focus[es] on a system of average justice and move[s] away from creating individual justice on a case-by-case basis (N. Fera, New Child-Support Guidelines  A Brief Overview (1997), 25 R.F.L. (4th) 356, at p. 356). The use of the table is intended to bring about an objective and predictable determination of child support, and bring an end to the subjective, ad hoc [pre-Child Support Guidelines] case decisions (F. Hudani, ed., Wilson on Children and the Law (loose-leaf), at  4.10). Judges may deviate from the table amount in cases involving children over the age of majority (Child Support Guidelines, s. 3(2)), payer parents with an income over $150,000 (s. 4), special or extraordinary expenses (s. 7), shared parenting time (s. 9(b)) or undue hardship (s. 10).\nA proper construction of a provision of the Child Support Guidelines requires that the objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency on the one hand, be balanced with those of fairness, flexibility and recognition of the actual condition[s], means, needs and other circumstances of the children on the other (Contino v. Leonelli-Contino, 2005 SCC 63, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 217, at para. 33, citing Francis, at para. 40).\nMr. Auers Challenge\nMr. Auer bears the burden of proving that the Child Support Guidelines are ultra vires (Katz Group, at para. 25). He submits that the Child Support Guidelines are ultra vires because they violate two constraints on the GICs authority. First, the amounts transferred can only be in respect of direct child costs and cannot more broadly redistribute income between parents (A.F., at para. 57). Mr. Auer submits that this constraint applies because support awards under the Child Support Guidelines compensate only for direct child costs; indirect [child] costs are left to the law of spousal support (para. 56). Second, under s. 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act, child-related costs are to be shared according to the parents relative abilities to contribute (para. 58).\nAccording to Mr. Auer, the Child Support Guidelines violate these two constraints by requiring the payer parent to bear more than their fair share of direct child-related costs. This is because the Child Support Guidelines (1) do not take into account the recipient parents income; (2) incorrectly assume that parents spend the same linear percentage of income on their children regardless of the parents levels of income and the childrens ages; (3) do not take into account government child benefits paid to the recipient parent; (4) do not take into account direct spending on the child by the payer parent when that parent exercises less than 40 percent of annual parenting time; and (5) double count the payer parents obligations with respect to special or extraordinary expenses.\nBelow, I will review each of Mr. Auers submissions, having regard to the GICs authority under the Divorce Act. I conclude that the Child Support Guidelines are intra vires the GIC.\nThe Child Support Guidelines Are Within the GICs Scope of Authority\nThe GICs Statutory Grant of Authority Is Extremely Broad\nSection 26.1(1) of the Divorce Act grants the GIC extremely broad authority to establish guidelines respecting orders for child support:\n26.1 (1) The Governor in Council may establish guidelines respecting orders for child support, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, guidelines\n\n(a) respecting the way in which the amount of an order for child support is to be determined;\n\n(b) respecting the circumstances in which discretion may be exercised in the making of an order for child support;\n\n(c) authorizing a court to require that the amount payable under an order for child support be paid in periodic payments, in a lump sum or in a lump sum and periodic payments;\n\n(d) authorizing a court to require that the amount payable under an order for child support be paid or secured, or paid and secured, in the manner specified in the order;\n\n(e) respecting the circumstances that give rise to the making of a variation order in respect of a child support order;\n\n(f) respecting the determination of income for the purposes of the application of the guidelines;\n\n(g) authorizing a court to impute income for the purposes of the application of the guidelines; and\n\n(h) respecting the production of information relevant to an order for child support and providing for sanctions and other consequences when that information is not provided.\nThe use of the language without limiting the generality of the foregoing confirms that this plenary power is not limited by anything that follows in s. 26.1(1) (see Vavilov, at para. 110; West Fraser Mills, at para. 10).\nHowever, this power is not unrestricted. Section 26.1(2) provides as follows:\n(2) The guidelines shall be based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute to the performance of that obligation.\nMr. Auer interprets the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage to mean that both parents must contribute equally to child-related costs. I acknowledge that the principle under s. 26.1(2) is mandatory; this is made clear by Parliaments use of the word shall (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  4.05). However, a plain reading of s. 26.1(2) does not support Mr. Auers interpretation.\nSection 26.1(2) does not require that each parent make an equal financial contribution to maintaining their children. Rather, it states that each parent has a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute to the performance of that obligation. While a joint financial obligation means that the parents have a shared financial obligation to support their children, it does not necessarily mean that this obligation must be equal (see C.A. reasons, at para. 112). The constraint under s. 26.1(2) is expressed in broad terms. For example, it does not prescribe a particular method of estimating child-related costs or state the percentage of child-related costs that each parent must cover. Given this, while s. 26.1(2) constrains the GICs extremely broad grant of authority under s. 26.1(1), it does not restrict it as narrowly as Mr. Auer submits.\nThe GIC Was Authorized Not To Take Into Account the Recipient Parents Income in Calculating the Table Amounts\nMr. Auer submits that the presumptive table amounts in the Child Support Guidelines violate the requirement in s. 26.1(2) that support awards be based on the parents relative abilities to contribute by ignoring the recipient parents income. In his view, the table amounts cannot be based on the parents relative abilities to contribute if they are based solely on the payer parents income.\nThe formula on which the table amounts are based assumes that the payer parent and recipient parent have the same income (chambers judges reasons, at para. 86). It only considers the payer parents income and seeks to determine the amount that must be transferred from the payer parent to the recipient parent in order to make both households equally well off (Department of Justice Canada, Child Support Team, Formula for the Table of Amounts Contained in the Federal Child Support Guidelines: A Technical Report (1997) (DOJ Report), at p. 2). As our Court explained in D.B.S., the Child Support Guidelines move away from pure need-based criteria towards an approach based on the payer parents income (para. 47). This approach shapes each parents free-standing obligation to support their children commensurate with their income, with the result that the total amount of child support is determined  and not merely divided  according to the income of the payor parent (para. 48).\nAdopting a formula for calculating the table amounts that does not expressly consider the recipient parents income falls within a reasonable interpretation of the authority granted to the GIC. It is reasonable to interpret this authority as being conferred as part of the broad grant under s. 26.1(1), which includes the authority to establish guidelines respecting the way in which the amount of an order for child support is to be determined and respecting the determination of income for the purposes of the application of the guidelines.\nThe formula selected by the GIC for calculating the table amounts was recommended by the Committee after extensive research and consultation. In its report, the Committee justified the decision regarding the recipient parents income in calculating the table amounts as follows:\nAlthough the formula appears to be based solely on the non-custodial parents income, this does not imply that the custodial parent does not contribute to the financial needs of the child. On the contrary  because the child lives with the custodial parent and shares the same living standard as this parent, the custodial parent will continue to pay for the remaining expenses in proportion to his/her income. [p. i]\nThe Committee considered different options for the formula and how the awards should change with the recipient parents income:\nWith some other formulas the award rises; with others it falls; while with still others it does not change at all. Thus, there is considerable disagreement over how awards should change with the custodial parents income. The Revised Fixed Percentage formula [which was recommended by the Committee] retains the principle common to all fixed percentage systems: the award does not vary with the income of the custodial parent. [p. ii]\nThe Committee explained that its recommended approach is essentially child-centred: the child benefits from the standard of living of the non-custodial parent before the separation/divorce and should retain this benefit after the separation/divorce (p. ii).\nDuring the debates on Bill C-41, the then Minister of Justice, Allan Rock, reiterated the Committees justifications. He explained that it is fair to assume that the recipient parent is supporting their child in a manner that is proportionate to their income, because the child lives with the recipient parent and their standards of living are inseparable (House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, Evidence, No. 54, 2nd Sess., 35th Parl., October 21, 1996, at 17:10 to 17:15; Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology, No. 17, 2nd Sess., 35th Parl., December 11 and 12, 1996).\nAs these justifications make clear, the formula for calculating the table amounts takes into account the ways in which the recipient parent contributes to the financial needs of the child, as required by s. 26.1(2). It does so by assuming that, because the child resides with the recipient parent, that parent will support the child in a manner that is proportionate to their income. This assumption is consistent with the objectives of the Child Support Guidelines, which include establishing a fair standard of support for children that ensures that they continue to benefit from the financial means of both parents after separation (s. 1).\nThe parties do not dispute that recipient parents contribute to child-related costs by virtue of living with the children. While some recipient parents may contribute a larger proportion of their income towards child-related costs than others, it was open to the GIC, in establishing a nationwide regime for child support, to assume that recipient parents contribute to child-related costs in proportion to their income. In reviewing the vires of the Child Support Guidelines, our Court must not assess the policy merits of that assumption to determine whether it is necessary, wise, or effective in practice (Katz Group, at para. 27, citing Jafari, at p. 604).\nFor these reasons, I conclude that an interpretation of the GICs broad authority to establish guidelines respecting the way in which the amount of an order for child support is to be determined and respecting the determination of income for the purposes of the application of the guidelines as including the authority to adopt a formula for calculating the table amounts based solely on the payer parents income, is reasonable.\nThe GIC Was Authorized To Assume That Parents Spend the Same Linear Percentage of Their Income on Their Children\nMr. Auer submits that the Child Support Guidelines unreasonably assume that parents spend the same linear percentage of income on their children regardless of the parents income levels and the childrens ages. In his view, as income rises, the overall amount spent on children increases but the percentage of income spent on children decreases (A.F., at para. 138). He submits that this assumption results in payer parents paying a disproportionate share of child-related costs.\nThe table amounts assume that parents spend the same linear percentage of income on their children. The table establishes a fixed monetary amount of support for payer parents whose annual income does not exceed $150,000. Where the payer parents annual income exceeds that amount, the amount payable is increased by a designated percentage of the payer parents income over $150,000 (Payne and Payne, at p. 382). However, s. 4(b)(ii) of the Child Support Guidelines authorizes a court to depart from the table amount in respect of the payer parents income above $150,000 if it considers the table amount to be inappropriate having regard to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children who are entitled to support and the financial ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the children.\nMr. Auer submits that courts are unlikely to depart from a linear application of the table amounts despite having the discretion to do so (A.F., at para. 139). He asks our Court to consider this reality in assessing the validity of the Child Support Guidelines.\nUnder s. 26.1(1)(b) of the Divorce Act, the GIC is authorized to establish guidelines respecting the circumstances in which discretion may be exercised in the making of an order for child support. Thus, it was plainly open to the GIC to give courts the discretion to depart from the table amounts for annual payer parent incomes exceeding $150,000 if they consider those amounts to be inappropriate. Courts have the discretion to decide whether to depart from a linear application of the table amounts. How this discretion is exercised has no bearing on the legality or validity of the Child Support Guidelines.\nMr. Auer argues that the Child Support Guidelines fail to reflect the fact that parents spend different percentages of their income on children at different ages. The Child Support Guidelines do not consider the ages of the children, except when they are over the age of majority. However, the GICs authority under s. 26.1(1) of the Divorce Act, which includes the authority to establish guidelines respecting the way in which the amount of an order for child support is to be determined, can reasonably be interpreted as authorizing guidelines which do not take childrens specific ages into account when calculating child support awards. Mr. Auer has not met the burden of proving that the Child Support Guidelines are invalid on this basis (Katz Group, at para. 25).\nThe GIC Was Authorized Not To Take Into Account Government Child Benefits Paid to the Recipient Parent in Calculating Child Support Awards\nThe formula used to calculate the table amounts does not include the federal Canada Child Benefit and the GST/HST rebate for children paid to the recipient parent (DOJ Report, at p. 5; Payne and Payne, at p. 121). Mr. Auer argues that these benefits increase the recipient parents standard of living and decrease the income needs created by the child (A.F., at para. 97). He submits that failing to consider them in calculating the table amounts causes the payer parent to overcontribute, contrary to the principle under s. 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act.\nThe Child Support Guidelines represent a move away from a purely needs-based approach towards one that seeks to maximize the amount available to be spent on children while ensuring that payer parents can adequately support themselves (D.B.S., at para. 54; DOJ Report, at p. 1). Government benefits improve childrens welfare by increasing the ability of recipient parents to spend more on them than would otherwise be possible. These benefits are deemed to be the governments contribution to children and [are] not available as income to the receiving parent (DOJ Report, at p. 5).\nSection 26.1(1)(f) of the Divorce Act authorizes the GIC to establish guidelines respecting the determination of income for the purposes of the application of the guidelines. The GIC elected not to include government benefits paid to the recipient parent when determining income for the purposes of calculating the table amounts. That decision falls reasonably within the scope of the GICs broad authority. Again, it is not for our Court to assess the policy merits of that decision (Katz Group, at paras. 27-28).\nThe GIC Was Authorized Not To Take Into Account the Payer Parents Direct Spending When That Parent Exercises Less Than 40 Percent of Annual Parenting Time\nThe table amounts do not take into account the payer parents direct spending on the child; they do not assume that the payor parent pays for the housing, food, or any other expense for the child (Contino, at para. 52). However, s. 9 of the Child Support Guidelines provides that if each spouse exercises at least 40 percent of parenting time with a child over the course of a year, the amount of the child support order must be determined by taking into account: (a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses; (b) the increased costs of shared parenting time arrangements; and (c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.\nOnce it is established that a payer parent exercises 40 percent or more of annual parenting time, a court may consider the payer parents direct spending on the child under s. 9(b). Section 9(b) recognizes that the total cost of raising children in shared custody situations may be greater than in situations where there is sole custody (Contino, at para. 52 (emphasis in original)). It requires courts to examine the budgets and actual child care expenses of each parent. These expenses will be apportioned between the parents in accordance with their respective incomes (para. 53).\nMr. Auer submits that it is unreasonable for the table amounts to assume that payer parents do not spend directly on their children in addition to making support payments. In his view, failing to recognize that payer parents may spend directly on their children when they exercise between 0 and 39 percent of annual parenting time violates the principle under s. 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities. He submits that the Child Support Guidelines are ultra vires on this basis.\nThe GIC is authorized under s. 26.1(1) of the Divorce Act to establish guidelines respecting the way in which the amount of an order for child support is to be determined and respecting the circumstances in which discretion may be exercised in the making of an order for child support. In my view, this authority permits the GIC to allow courts to consider payer parents direct spending on their children only when the payer parent exercises at least 40 percent of annual parenting time. Section 26.1(2) states only that parents have a joint financial obligation to maintain their children in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute. It does not require that each parent make an equal financial contribution to child-related costs. Thus, the principle in s. 26.1(2) is not violated even if setting the threshold for considering payer parents direct spending on their children at 40 percent of annual parenting time results in some payer parents paying more than half of the child-related costs.\nI do not mean to suggest that payer parents overcontribute. However, it is important to keep in mind, as counsel for Ms. Auer explained during the hearing, that recipient parents bear many financial responsibilities that are an inherent part of providing primary care for a child (transcript, at pp. 45-47). Because the child lives primarily with the recipient parent, the payer parent may not always share in these responsibilities.\nFurthermore, s. 10(1) of the Child Support Guidelines provides that a court may, on either spouses application, award an amount of child support that is different from the amount determined under ss. 3 to 5, 8 or 9 if the court finds that the spouse making the request would otherwise suffer undue hardship. Section 10(2) sets out circumstances that may cause a spouse to suffer undue hardship. One such circumstance is that the spouse has unusually high expenses in relation to exercising parenting time with a child. Courts therefore retain the discretion to ensure that payer parents contribute to child-related costs in accordance with their ability to do so without suffering undue hardship, including as a result of having unusually high expenses in relation to exercising parenting time.\nInterpreting the enabling statute as authorizing the making of guidelines which set the threshold percentage for when a court may consider the increased costs of shared parenting time arrangements is reasonable, as it falls squarely within the GICs broad grant of authority and Mr. Auer has not demonstrated that it violates the principle in s. 26.1(2). As mentioned, whether the GICs decision was necessary, wise, or effective in practice is irrelevant in the context of a vires review (Katz Group, at para. 27, citing Jafari, at p. 604).\nThe GIC Was Authorized To Establish a Separate Category of Special or Extraordinary Expenses\nSection 3(1) of the Child Support Guidelines sets out the presumptive rule regarding child support awards: unless otherwise provided, the amount of a child support order for children under the age of majority is (a) the amount set in the applicable table and (b) the amount, if any, determined under s. 7 (special or extraordinary expenses).\nMr. Auer submits that adding s. 7 expenses to the table amounts in accordance with the presumptive rule results in the double counting of child expenses for which the payer parent is responsible because [a]ll conceivable average costs are reflected in the table amount (A.F., at paras. 121 and 128). He adds that the scale chosen by the GIC to calculate the table amounts produced high child cost estimates and, therefore, the highest child support awards (para. 123). Thus, Mr. Auer submits that the Child Support Guidelines result in the payer parent overcontributing to child-related costs, contrary to s. 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act.\nI reject Mr. Auers submission.\nMr. Auers submission is rooted in a purely needs-based approach to child support. The underlying theory of a purely needs-based regime is that both parents should provide enough support to their children to meet their needs, and that they should share this obligation proportionate to their incomes (D.B.S., at para. 45). A purely needs-based approach begins by calculating the child-related costs. It then apportions those costs between the parents. If the amount of child support were to be determined solely on the basis of the childs needs, it would be problematic for the presumptive rule to result in the double counting of certain special or extraordinary expenses.\nHowever, the Child Support Guidelines have eschewed a purely needs-based approach to child support (D.B.S., at para. 54). The Child Support Guidelines seek to ensure that the child benefits as much as possible from the income of both parents, in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute. Support awards recognize that the child benefitted from the standard of living of the payer parent pre-separation and should continue to retain this benefit post-separation (Committee, at p. ii; R. Finnie, C. Giliberti and D. Stripinis, An Overview of the Research Program to Develop a Canadian Child Support Formula (1995), at p. 28). As the DOJ Report explains at p. 1:\nThe concept of cost of raising children is an illusory theoretical construct. Spending on children is not fixed; it changes as the income of either parent changes. Families with higher incomes spend more on their children than do families of lower income. In the post separation arrangement, the Federal Child Support Guidelines aim to approximate, as closely as possible, the spending on the children that occurred in the pre-separation family.\nIn short, the Child Support Guidelines begin with the payer parents income and determine the amount of support that that parent must pay to ensure that the child continues to benefit from their income post-separation. The Child Support Guidelines do not determine the childs costs up front and then ask the payer parent to cover a portion of them. It is assumed that any financial contribution from the [payer] parent will typically be used to improve the childs circumstances (Payne and Payne, at p. 7).\nThe parent applying for s. 7 expenses must demonstrate that the expenses are necessary in relation to the childs best interests and are reasonable in relation to the means of the spouses and the child as well as the familys spending pattern prior to the separation. Where the recipient parent has applied for s. 7 expenses, the payer parent may challenge the necessity or reasonableness of those expenses. A payer parent could argue that the alleged s. 7 expenses are already covered by the table amount. However, it is ultimately up to the court to determine whether the applying parent has established that the s. 7 expenses they seek are necessary and reasonable.\nThe GICs broad authority under s. 26.1(1) of the Divorce Act to establish guidelines respecting the way in which the amount of an order for child support is to be determined clearly entitled the GIC to adopt guidelines that do not focus purely on the childs needs but instead seek to ensure that the child continues to benefit from the payer parents income in accordance with that parents ability to contribute. Further, the GICs authority to establish guidelines respecting the circumstances in which discretion may be exercised in the making of an order for child support entitled the GIC to grant courts the discretion to determine whether to include certain special or extraordinary expenses in a child support award.\nThus, contrary to Mr. Auers assertion, it is not problematic if there is some overlap between the expenses contemplated in the table amounts and special or extraordinary expenses under s. 7. The child continues to benefit from the payer parents income in accordance with that parents ability to contribute. Mr. Auer has not demonstrated that the potential for double counting s. 7 expenses arises from an unreasonable interpretation of the authority granted to the GIC in light of the relevant constraints, and has not met the burden of proving that the Child Support Guidelines are ultra vires.\nConclusion\nThe reasonableness standard under the Vavilov framework presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. Katz Group continues to provide helpful guidance. However, for subordinate legislation to be ultra vires on the basis that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, it no longer needs to be irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated to that statutory purpose. Continuing to maintain this threshold from Katz Group would be inconsistent with robust reasonableness review and would undermine Vavilovs promise of simplicity, predictability and coherence.\nThe Child Support Guidelines fall reasonably within the GICs scope of authority under s. 26.1 of the Divorce Act, having regard to the relevant constraints. Under s. 26.1(1), the GIC is granted extremely broad authority to establish guidelines respecting child support. Section 26.1(2) constrains this authority by requiring that the guidelines be based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute. The Child Support Guidelines respect this constraint.\nThe GIC was entitled to choose an approach to calculating child support that (1) does not take into account the recipient parents income; (2) assumes that parents spend the same linear percentage of income on their children regardless of the parents levels of income and the childrens ages; (3) does not take into account government child benefits paid to recipient parents; (4) does not take into account direct spending on the child by the payer parent when that parent exercises less than 40 percent of annual parenting time; and (5) risks double counting certain special or extraordinary expenses. Each of these decisions fell squarely within the scope of the authority delegated to the GIC under the Divorce Act.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent Aysel Igorevna Auer.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Jensen Shawa Solomon Duguid Hawkes, Calgary; Ronald Robinson Barrister & Solicitor, Calgary; Paul Daly Law Professional Corporation, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent Aysel Igorevna Auer: Huizinga Di Toppa Coles & Layton, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent the Attorney General of Canada: Attorney General of Canada, Department of Justice, National Litigation Sector  Ontario Regional Office, Toronto; Attorney General of Canada, Department of Justice, National Litigation Sector  Prairie Regional Office, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown Law Office  Civil, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Ministere de la Justice du Quebec, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Ministry of Attorney General of British Columbia, Legal Services Branch, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice and Attorney General, Regina.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia: Hunter Litigation Chambers, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the HIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario and the Health Justice Program: Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Council for Refugees: Jamie Liew, Ottawa; Lehal Law Corporation, Delta (B.C.).\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the City of Calgary: City of Calgary, Law/Legal Services and Security, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Chicken Farmers of Canada, the Egg Farmers of Canada, the Turkey Farmers of Canada and the Canadian Hatching Egg Producers: Conway Baxter Wilson, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities: Shores Jardine, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Association quebecoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration: Hasa Avocats Inc., Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia: Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia, Richmond.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers: Refugee Law Office, Toronto; Landings, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Advocates for the Rule of Law: Henein Hutchison Robitaille, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Ecojustice Canada Society: Ecojustice Canada Society, Toronto.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds the Vires of the Federal Child Support Guidelines\n\nThis appeal concerns the standard of review applicable to the vires of subordinate legislation and whether the Federal Child Support Guidelines are intra vires the Governor in Council.\n\nRoland Nikolaus Auer and Aysel Igorevna Auer were married in 2004 and had one child together. They divorced in 2008, and the child resides with Ms. Auer. Mr. Auer paid child support to Ms. Auer but brought an application for judicial review challenging the vires of the Guidelines. He argued that the Governor in Council exceeded its authority under sections 26.1(1) and (2) of the Divorce Act when enacting the Guidelines, as they require a payer parent to pay a greater share of child-related costs than the recipient parent.\n\nThe chambers judge dismissed Mr. Auer's application for judicial review, holding that the presumptive standard of review for assessing the vires of subordinate legislation is reasonableness. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed Mr. Auer's appeal but was divided on the applicable standard of review. The majority held that the vires of the Guidelines should be reviewed on the basis of whether they are irrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated to the purpose of the enabling statute. A concurring judge held that the reasonableness standard applies when reviewing the vires of the Guidelines. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately heard the appeal and dismissed it, upholding the vires of the Guidelines.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established that the reasonableness standard, as set out in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. The Court also held that many of the principles from Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, continue to inform reasonableness review, including the principle that subordinate legislation must be consistent with the enabling statute and its overriding purpose or object. However, the Court departed from Katz Group and held that for subordinate legislation to be found ultra vires on the basis that it is inconsistent with the purpose of the enabling statute, it no longer needs to be irrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated to that statutory purpose.\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice held that the reasonableness standard presumptively applies when reviewing the vires of subordinate legislation. This standard requires that the reviewing court determine whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2013 justification, transparency, and intelligibility \u2013 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision. The Chief Justice concluded that the Guidelines fall reasonably within the Governor in Council's scope of authority under s. 26.1 of the Divorce Act, having regard to the relevant constraints. Specifically, the Guidelines respect the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative abilities to contribute.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds guidelines  used to determine child support amounts in case of divorce.</strong>This appeal and <a href=\"40570-eng.aspx\"><em>TransAlta Generation Partnership v. Alberta</em></a>, which was released on the  same day, are both about the standard of review that applies when subordinate  legislation is challenged on judicial review before a court. Subordinate  legislation sets out legally binding rules that are not made by a legislature,  such as federal Parliament, but instead by another entity given authority to  make them by that legislature. The  standard of review is the approach a court takes to analyzing a decision, like  a decision to make subordinate legislation.Mr. Roland Auer and  Ms. Aysel Auer were married in 2004. They had one child together and divorced  in 2008. Mr. Auer paid child support to Ms. Auer, but brought an application  for judicial review challenging the <em>Federal Child Support Guidelines</em>, subordinate legislation which determines the  amount of child support to be paid in case of divorce. The Governor in Council  (the Governor General acting on the advice of Cabinet) has authority under the <em>Divorce Act </em>to make guidelines dealing  with orders for such child support. Mr. Auer argued that the Governor in  Council had gone beyond this authority in making the <em>Guidelines</em> (that they were <em>ultra  vires</em>) because they require a payer parent like Mr. Auer to pay a greater  share of the child-related costs than the recipient parent.The Court of King\u2019s  Bench concluded that the Guidelines were within the authority of the Governor  in Council to makeand dismissed Mr. Auer\u2019s application for judicial  review. It held that, following a decision of the  Supreme Court of Canada called <a href=\"../2019/37748-eng.aspx\"><em>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and  Immigration) v. Vavilov</em></a>, reasonableness is the presumptive  standard of review for assessing whether there was authority to make subordinate  legislation. A reasonable decision is based on a logical chain of reasoning. It  has to make sense in light of the law and the facts, but need not be the only  right answer. The Court of King\u2019s  Bench also said that  reasonableness  review should be informed by the principles outlined in an earlier Supreme  Court case called <em>Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term  Care)</em>. That decision says that in order to find subordinate  legislation to be beyond the authority granted by a statute because it is  inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it had to be shown that it  was \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to the purpose.The Court of Appeal  unanimously dismissed Mr. Auer\u2019s appeal but was divided on the standard of  review. A majority held that <em>Vavilov </em>did not change the principles from <em>Katz  Group</em> and that to conclude the Guidelineswere not authorized by the <em>Divorce Act</em> because they wereinconsistent with the purpose of that  Act, they had to be \u201cirrelevant, extraneous, or completely unrelated\u201d to that  purpose.Mr. Auer appealed again to the Supreme Court of  Canada, arguing that the Guidelineswere  not authorized by law. The Supreme Court has dismissed his appeal.<strong>The guidelines fall reasonably within the scope  of the Governor in Council\u2019s authority under the <em>Divorce Act</em>.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained that <em>Vavilov</em>\u2019s robust reasonableness standard is the presumptive standard for  reviewing whether subordinate legislation was authorized by law. Some of the  principles from <em>Katz Group</em> continue  to inform such reasonableness review. However, for a court to find subordinate legislation to be beyond the authority granted in statute because it is  inconsistent with the purpose of that statute, it no  longer needs to be \u201cirrelevant\u201d, \u201cextraneous\u201d or \u201ccompletely unrelated\u201d to that  statutory purpose. The governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory  or common law rules and the principles of statutory interpretation are  particularly relevant constraints when  determining whether subordinate legislation falls reasonably within the scope  of the authority.In the instant case, the Guidelines fall reasonably within the  Governor in Council\u2019s scope of authority under the <em>Divorce Act</em>, having regard to the relevant  constraints. Under s.\u00a026.1(1), the Governor in Council is granted  extremely broad authority to establish guidelines respecting child support.  Section 26.1(2) constrains this authority by requiring that the guidelines be  based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial obligation to  maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their relative  abilities to contribute. The Guidelinesrespect this constraint.\r\n  "

C-46, s. 535  Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, ss. 43, 44.\n\tIn unrelated cases, A and G were accused of one or more historical sexual offences against a child, which at the time of their commission carried a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. After the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to 14 years imprisonment. A and G first appeared in the Court of Quebec in the summer of 2019. At first appearance, they reserved or postponed their right to elect their mode of trial to a later date. Then, in 2020, A and G each requested a preliminary inquiry. However, under an amendment to s. 535 of the Criminal Code that came into force on September 19, 2019, the availability of preliminary inquiries was now restricted to accused persons charged with offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. In both matters, the Crown argued that the court lacked jurisdiction under the new s. 535 to hold a preliminary inquiry.\n\tThe Court of Quebec held that the new s. 535 applied to A and G and that it lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. In its view, preliminary inquiries are of a purely procedural nature, and applying the new rule did not impact the substantive rights of A and G. A and G each challenged that interpretation. A Superior Court judge dismissed As challenge, characterizing the right to a preliminary inquiry as purely procedural and concluding that the new s. 535 required the accused to be charged with an offence for which they could be personally punishable by 14 years imprisonment or more. A different Superior Court judge dismissed Gs challenge, holding that preliminary inquiries affected the substantive right to a discharge but that Gs entitlement had not vested by the time the new s. 535 came into force  to get the benefit of the old rule, he should have both elected his mode of trial and asked for a preliminary inquiry before September 19, 2019.\n\tThe Court of Appeal concluded that the new rule in s. 535 did not apply to A and G and that they had a vested right to preliminary inquiries. Relying on the principle of legality, the Court of Appeal held that the right to a preliminary inquiry accrues at two different points in time: it is accruing from the moment the offence is committed, and it is vested or accrued at the date of the first appearance. Given its conclusion on the vested right, the Court of Appeal did not address the question of how the amended version of s. 535 should be interpreted. The Court of Appeal remitted each file to the Court of Quebec for a preliminary inquiry.\n\tHeld (Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n1. Temporal Application of the New Section 535 of the Criminal Code\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ.:  There is no clear basis on which to draw a conclusion about Parliaments specific intention, so the new limitation in s. 535 should apply unless it interferes with a substantive legal interest that had vested before it came into force. The amendment to s. 535 is not purely procedural because it can interfere with a substantive legal interest by depriving an accused of the opportunity to be discharged at a preliminary inquiry. However, that substantive legal interest only vests at the time a request for a preliminary inquiry is made. Accordingly, the new limitation in s. 535 should apply to all persons where a request for a preliminary inquiry was not made before September 19, 2019.\n\tPer Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: Because the right to a preliminary inquiry is not purely procedural, the new s. 535 does not apply with immediate effect. Where a request for a preliminary inquiry was made before September 19, 2019, the right to an inquiry vested. However, this is not the only situation in which the right to request a preliminary inquiry vests; this right also vests each time a court agrees to reserve an accuseds right to elect their mode of trial.\n\tPer Cote and Rowe JJ.: The amendment made to s. 535 is procedural in nature but affects a substantive right, that is, an accuseds right to be discharged of any charge if, on the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial on the charge. Consequently, the presumption that Parliament did not intend to interfere with vested rights or privileges in relation to preliminary inquiries applies. The right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time charges are laid. The former s. 535 should therefore continue to apply to persons charged prior to September 19, 2019.\n\tPer Martin J.: The amendment to s. 535 affects an accuseds substantive legal interests. Accordingly, the new s. 535 must apply prospectively only. Persons alleged to have committed an offence before September 19, 2019, that rendered them eligible for a preliminary inquiry should retain that eligibility today.\n2. Interpretation of the New Section 535 of the Criminal Code\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ.: The new rule in s. 535 requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years imprisonment in respect of the offence with which they are charged for a preliminary inquiry to be available.\n\tPer Cote and Rowe JJ.: Under the new s. 535, an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment; this right is not affected by the accuseds right to the benefit of the lesser punishment. Where the maximum sentence for an offence was increased to 14 years between the commission of the offence and the laying of charges, a preliminary inquiry can be held even if the accused is not personally facing a maximum sentence of 14 years.\n\tPer Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: The question of the interpretation of the new s. 535 is not addressed.\n\t____________________________\n\tPer Cote and Rowe JJ.: The starting point in analyzing the temporal application of new legislation is always the legislation itself. In the absence of a transitional provision, and where the lawmakers intention to give the legislation a particular effect does not appear expressly or by necessary implication upon reading the legislation, as is the case with the new s. 535, recourse must be had specifically to the rules laid down in interpretation statutes and court decisions. Three well-established principles of transitional law come into play: (1) the principle of legality; (2) the presumption against interference with vested rights; and (3) the exception based on the immediate application of purely procedural provisions. The principle of legality is a pillar of the criminal law whose purpose is to preserve the law as it stood at the time an offence was committed. The new legislation cannot make criminal any act or omission that did not constitute an offence at the time it occurred. In addition, the new legislation cannot create more severe punishments for an offence committed before it came into force. Next, the presumption that the lawmaker does not intend to interfere with vested rights or privileges is one of the fundamental principles of transitional law. To ensure the certainty of the legal consequences attaching to facts and conduct predating a legislative amendment, a statute should not be given a construction that would impair existing rights as regards person or property unless the language in which it is couched requires such a construction. Legislation that affects substantive rights can only apply prospectively to cases in respect of which these rights have not yet vested. There is one exception to this presumption: purely procedural legislation, which is meant to govern the manner in which rights or privileges are asserted without affecting their substance, is presumed to apply immediately. Sections 43 and 44 of the federal Interpretation Act codify the presumption against interference with vested rights and the exception based on the immediate application of purely procedural provisions.\n\tThe abolition of the preliminary inquiry for certain offences does not engage the principle of legality. This measure has no impact on the scope of criminal liability. The preliminary inquiry is not a legal rule on which accused persons may rely in adjusting their behaviour or in deciding to accept the consequences of breaking it at the time of committing an offence. However, the absence of any indication from Parliament as to the temporal application of s. 535 triggers the presumption that the legislative amendment does not affect vested rights or privileges. There is agreement for the most part with Karakatsanis J.s analysis with respect to the nature of the abolition of the preliminary inquiry for accused persons charged with an indictable offence punishable by less than 14 years of imprisonment: the legislative amendment cannot be considered a purely procedural amendment. It does not affect only the manner of proceeding or of conducting litigation; the limitation on the right to a preliminary inquiry has a direct impact on the liberty and security of accused persons. It is therefore procedural in nature, but it affects a substantive right. Because the amendment is not purely procedural in nature, the new enactment does not apply immediately to all proceedings. Moreover, the fact that new procedural legislation may, through its effects, interfere with a substantive right does not end the analysis: the right or privilege in question must also have been vested at the time that legislation came into force.\n\tAn individual claiming a vested right or privilege must satisfy a two-step test. First, the individuals legal situation must be tangible and concrete rather than general and abstract. Second, the individuals legal situation must be sufficiently tangible and constituted at the time the new legislation comes into force; in other words, the situation must have materialized to some degree. In this case, at the first step, the possibility that the accuseds right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time the offence is committed can be excluded: the accuseds legal situation is not sufficiently tangible, concrete and distinctive at that time. It is not until charges are laid against the accused that the criminal court process begins and the accuseds legal situation becomes tangible, concrete and distinctive.\n\tNext, under the second step, the accuseds situation is sufficiently constituted at the time charges are laid. At that point, the vesting of the right is certain and not conditional on future events, because the accused will inevitably have to appear and choose to exercise or waive their right to a preliminary inquiry, or reserve their election. All of the conditions precedent to the vesting of the right are also fulfilled at that time. The request that the accused must make for a preliminary inquiry has no effect on the crystallization of the vested right. Section 535 opens with the phrase if an accused who is charged with an indictable offence, which sets the charging of the accused as the condition for entitlement to a preliminary inquiry. The request triggers the justices duty to conduct a preliminary inquiry, but it is not a condition precedent to the existence of the right to a preliminary inquiry itself; rather, it constitutes the exercise of the right itself.\n\tWith regard to the interpretation that the new s. 535 should receive, its text, context and purpose demonstrate that an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment. There is no ambiguity in the wording of s. 535: a preliminary inquiry can be held only in the case of an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment. Both the adjective punishable in English and its equivalent passible in the French version relate to the indictable offence and not to the sentence the accused may receive. This phrasing refers to the seriousness of the alleged offence, and its logic is not directed at the accused personally. Parliament thus intended the right to a preliminary inquiry to be tied to the seriousness of the alleged offence, not to the degree of jeopardy faced by the accused; this is an objective criterion. This interpretation is also reinforced by an examination of the parliamentary debates that led to the amendment in issue.\n\tThe jeopardy actually faced by the accused as a result of the time when the offence was committed is part of the accuseds individual circumstances and does not go to the seriousness of the alleged offence. An offence is not less serious today because it was committed before a certain date. In determining the right to a preliminary inquiry, Parliament did not intend to draw a distinction between charges of the same nature based on the date of commission of the offence. The objective seriousness of an offence is not confined to the maximum sentence for the offence at the time it was committed. On the contrary, the legislative amendments increasing maximum sentences indicate Parliaments determination that offences are to be treated as more grave than they had been in the past. Accordingly, where the maximum sentence for an offence was increased to 14 years between the commission of the offence and the laying of charges, a preliminary inquiry can be held even if the accused is not personally facing a sentence of 14 years. In such a case, it must be asked whether the seriousness of the alleged offence, as it is defined today, places it within the category of the most serious offences. The fact that the accused is charged and convicted on the basis of the criminal provisions in force at the time the offence was committed changes nothing in this regard. Although an accused may receive a reduced maximum sentence for a crime committed before the sentence was increased, the accuseds right to the benefit of the lesser punishment does not defeat the right to a preliminary inquiry; to conclude otherwise would lead to an absurd result, penalize the accused and disregard the sequence of stages in a criminal trial.\n\tIn this case, A and G had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry, since this right crystallizes at the time charges are laid. Moreover, regardless of whether a right vested in A and G before the legislative amendment came into force, they have such a right under the current version of s. 535, because the acts in question would be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years if they were committed today. The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: There is agreement, in substance, with Karakatsanis J.s analysis of vested rights with regard to the temporal application of s. 535 and, in particular, with the importance she attaches to the request made by an accused for a preliminary inquiry. There is also agreement with her with that local practices regarding the administration of justice can legitimately vary from one province or territory to another and that this is not necessarily incompatible with the uniform application of substantive criminal law in Canada. However, in light of the practice followed in Quebec and its effect on the right of A and G to request a preliminary inquiry, A and G had vested rights.\n\tIn Quebec, accused persons typically reserve their election as to the mode of trial so that they can examine the evidence disclosed. The general understanding among Quebec judges and lawyers is that reserving the election as to the mode of trial with the courts authorization has the effect of preserving the right to make a request for a preliminary inquiry at a later date. All of the conditions precedent to the holding of a preliminary inquiry are indeed fulfilled when the election is reserved: the accused receives the courts assurance that they can make a request at a later date and, by the terms of s. 535, that request must be honoured. The accuseds legal situation is therefore tangible, concrete and sufficiently constituted at that time. Parliaments objective of reducing the number of preliminary inquiries should not limit vested rights in the absence of a transitional provision for existing situations.\n\tBecause the Court of Quebec granted the requests of A and G to reserve their election as to the mode of trial before the amendments to s. 535 came into force, A and G had a vested right to make a request for a preliminary inquiry at a later date. They were therefore governed by the former s. 535. The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Martin J.: There is agreement that the amendment at issue is not purely procedural and instead can affect an accuseds substantive legal interests. However, there is disagreement as to the point in time for the application of the new s. 535; the date of the offence is the preferable option.\n\tIn light of Parliaments failure to legislate on the temporal application of the amendment, the judicial task is to determine when the new s. 535 applies, based on the principles and presumptions concerning the temporal application of legislation, as well as the values of fairness, rule of law and reasonable reliance they protect. This task must be approached with the interests of justice top of mind. The case law and the Interpretation Act provide legal presumptions which guide the interpretation of legislation when Parliament has failed to clearly set out its temporal application. In particular, two presumptions apply to legislation that affects an accuseds substantive rights: the presumption against the retrospective application of legislation affecting substantive legal interests, and the presumption against interfering with vested rights. The guiding principle of the first presumption is that new legislation that affects substantive rights is presumed to apply prospectively, absent clear legislative intent otherwise. New legislation that deals with procedure will also not apply immediately if, in its application, it affects substantive rights. As to the second presumption, in criminal cases, the Courts jurisprudence on vested rights has previously required that a right-holder be able to actually exercise the right and that the eventual accrual be certain, and not conditional on future events.\n\tThe new s. 535 of the Criminal Code should be analyzed based on the approach articulated and applied in R. v. Dineley, 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, the Courts most recent authority concerning the temporal application of legislation which affects substantive interests. Dineley makes clear that in order to engage the presumption against retrospectivity, it is sufficient that the legislation affects substantive rights. It stands for two key propositions: either substantive or vested rights will trigger the presumption against retrospectivity, and if the accuseds substantive rights are affected, the date of the offence should govern.\n\tFirst, the presumption against retrospectivity is engaged when an amendment may affect either or both substantive or vested rights. Either one, standing alone, is sufficient to trigger the presumption of prospective application. Once there has been a finding that the substantive rights of the accused are affected, it is unnecessary to impose the additional requirement that those rights must also have somehow vested or accrued to the accused. There is no general requirement that all substantive rights must have also have vested before legislative amendments must be presumed to apply prospectively  but even if there is, it should be characterized sufficiently broadly to ensure that rigid legal characterizations and formalities are not favoured over fairness and an accuseds substantive interests. Any dispute over whether what must vest in the instant case is the right to have a preliminary inquiry or the right to request a preliminary inquiry should be resolved to best respect fairness to an accused. Second, new criminal legislation will apply as of the date of the offence if it affects an accuseds substantive legal interests.\n\tThe loss of the possibility of being discharged at the close of a preliminary inquiry is significant. It approximates the loss of a legal defence, which affects the substantive and constitutional rights of the accused. Although the accused does not have a constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry, eliminating the possibility of a discharge at the close of the preliminary inquiry may affect an accuseds rights to liberty and security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter. Because the new s. 535 affects the accuseds substantive rights and must apply prospectively only, the date of the offence should govern its temporal application. It is preferable for many reasons: it is common to all criminal files, it is independent of any given procedure and thus adaptable to potential regional differences in criminal procedure across the country, and it is attuned to the reality of delays or variables that may arise throughout the course of the criminal process at no fault of the accused. Determining the temporal application of the new s. 535 requires a solution that applies consistently across the country. The accuseds substantive rights should not be dependent on or shaped by regional differences in procedure, especially when it may result in unfairness. Accordingly, where the alleged offence date is prior to September 19, 2019, an accused who would have been eligible for a preliminary inquiry but for the amendment remains eligible, regardless of the applicable maximum punishment.\n\tWith respect to the interpretation of the new s. 535, there is agreement with Karakatsanis J. that, where the new s. 535 applies because the alleged offence date is on or after September 19, 2019, an accused is only eligible for a preliminary inquiry if they personally face a maximum punishment of 14 years or greater.\n\tIn the instant case, there is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Court of Appeal holding that the entitlement to the preliminary inquiry attaches to the offence date, and the appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ. (dissenting): Despite previous Criminal Code amendments that have made the preliminary inquiry available only on request and allowed for the narrowing of its focus, concern has continued to grow over delays in criminal proceedings. In this context, Parliament opted to reform preliminary inquiries to improve the efficiency of criminal proceedings and to avoid the need for witnesses to testify twice. Since the amendment in 2019, s. 535 limits the availability of preliminary inquiries to the most serious cases based on the maximum penalty for the relevant offences.\n\tA predictable approach to determining temporal application must clarify and build on the law interpreting the relevant presumptions developed in the Courts jurisprudence and codified by Parliament. As with any question of statutory interpretation, determining the temporal application of a new rule must be grounded in the text of the legislation read in its full context and in harmony with the legislatures intention. In conducting that analysis, courts must rely on all the principles of statutory interpretation. Where the legislatures intention as to the temporal application of specific legislation can be discerned using principles of interpretation other than those presumptions of temporal application, courts are bound to give effect to that intention. However, absent transitional provisions and where those principles fail to provide a clear answer, the general presumptions governing temporal application become central to the analysis.\n\tThe temporal application of the amendment of a Criminal Code provision turns on the interpretation and interrelationship between three presumptions: (1) the presumption of immediate application of purely procedural law, (2) the presumption against retrospectivity, and (3) the presumption against interference with vested rights. These presumptions have been in part codified by Parliament in the Interpretation Act (ss. 43 and 44). First, according to the presumption of immediate application of purely procedural legislation, where the change in the law is purely procedural, in that applying it would not, in any circumstances, affect a substantive legal interest, the new rule is presumed to apply immediately to all. A substantive legal interest is a right, privilege, obligation or liability that it not merely about how a litigant conducts litigation but has direct implications for the individual outside the courtroom. Whether legislation could be classified as procedural in the abstract is not determinative; all that matters is the presence or absence of an effect on substantive matters. Second, the presumption against retrospectivity means that change to the law is presumed not to attach new prejudicial consequences to events that occurred before the change. Third, the presumption against interference with vested rights provides that legislation is presumed not to interfere with rights held by individuals that were tangible, concrete and distinctive before it came into force. The threshold of tangible, concrete and distinctive has two primary facets: (1) the right must be that of the particular individual rather than belonging to a community or general class; and (2) the right must be sufficiently constituted before the coming into force of the legislative change, in that it exists and is possessed by individuals at the relevant time. If a new rule would interfere with a right with these features, such that it has vested, it is presumed not to apply.\n\tApplying the three presumptions at issue together in a principled way starts by asking whether the new rule is purely procedural since, in the affirmative, it is unnecessary to consider the other presumptions. Where it is shown that a new rule is purely procedural, it applies immediately in all circumstances. Where, however, the new rule is not purely procedural, the analysis must continue. The presumptions against retrospectivity and against interference with vested rights can be understood as different sides of the same coin. Interference with a vested right is always retrospective in that rights arise by virtue of facts that fulfil the conditions precedent to the right and subsequently impairing them changes the legal consequences of those facts in a prejudicial way. The combined effect of these presumptions is to look at the facts that had occurred before the new rule came into force and decide whether they establish a legal interest that the law is presumed to protect. Where the legal interest has vested before a new rule came into force, the new rule is presumed not to apply if it would interfere with that legal interest. And because the purely procedural presumption provides that only substantive legal interests can raise a presumption of non-application these legal interests must necessarily be substantive. Thus, in applying these three presumptions, the new rule will presumptively apply unless it interferes with a substantive legal interest that had vested before it came into force.\n\tThis inquiry requires understanding when a legal interest is substantive and when it has vested. Whether a legal interest is substantive is guided by categories settled in the jurisprudence, and the underlying legal values of fairness and the rule of law rather than the abstract procedural nature of the legislation itself. As a legal interest becomes less a means to establish other rights and liabilities through litigation and more as an end in itself independent of that litigation, it becomes more likely that the legal interest will be substantive. A legal interest vests once all the facts necessary to recognize its existence have occurred. While those facts may generally be settled for recurring categories such as criminal liability, in cases involving unique statutory rights, careful attention must be paid to the nature of the right as expressed in the statute in light of how the legislature has balanced the reasonable expectations of interest holders against the democratic evolution of the law. It will be difficult to say a legal interest is vested where it remains contingent on an intervening action or event, such as the favourable exercise of discretion by a third party or actions necessary to acquire it that are more than mere formalities.\n\tThere is no clear basis on which to draw a conclusion about Parliaments specific intention regarding the temporal application of the new s. 535. It therefore falls to be determined using the temporal presumptions. The amendment to s. 535 was not purely procedural, because it can deprive an accused of the opportunity to be discharged at a preliminary inquiry, which is a substantive legal interest. The amendment therefore does not attract immediate application in every circumstance, and it is necessary to determine when the right to a preliminary inquiry vests. It does not vest when the offence is alleged to have been committed. The opportunity to be discharged at a preliminary inquiry does not form part of the substantive law about criminal liability that is understood to vest at the time of the commission of the offence. Liability vesting at that time protects a persons reliance on the state of the law when they were deciding whether to risk the liability associated with breaking the law. But it strains credulity to imagine that people weigh the availability of a preliminary inquiry in determining how to conduct themselves and whether to risk criminal liability. Conduct is not made legal or illegal, nor made subject to greater or lesser penal consequence because it could be examined at a preliminary inquiry. The availability and exercise of the right to a preliminary inquiry also depends on significant contingencies standing between the commission of the offence and the preliminary inquiry, including whether a charge is actually laid and, in the case of a hybrid offence, whether the Crown will elect to proceed summarily.\n\tThe right to a preliminary inquiry vests when the request for a preliminary inquiry is made, not the point in the proceedings at which there are no further conditions outside of the control of the accused to ask for a preliminary inquiry. There is a distinction between the ability to request a preliminary inquiry and the right to a preliminary inquiry itself. Section 535 frames the request as a precondition of the existence of the right and ties the request to the election of mode of trial. Read together, the provisions surrounding the election of the mode of trial make clear that what triggers the holding of a preliminary inquiry is both the election of a mode of trial in which a preliminary inquiry is available and the request for a preliminary inquiry to be held. Even where the accused is sure to be tried by a mode through which a preliminary inquiry is available, the statute still mandates a request. The text and statutory scheme make clear that Parliament intended to make the availability of a preliminary inquiry conditional on a request actually having been made. Accordingly, the new limitation in s. 535 applies to all accused persons where a request for a preliminary inquiry was not made before it came into force on September 19, 2019. The requirement that a request be made ensures there is a clear rule that can be given a uniform interpretation across Canada.\n\tWhether a request for a preliminary inquiry has been made is a factual question dependent on the circumstances of each individual case. The reserve or postponement of an election of mode of trial does not amount to an actual request for a preliminary inquiry. Assimilating a reserve to a request would effectively mean that the mere possibility of making a request is enough, despite the clear intent of Parliament to make the request an essential prerequisite. In the instant case neither A nor G had made a request for a preliminary inquiry before September 19, 2019. Their proceedings were accordingly governed by the new limitation on the availability of preliminary inquiries.\n \tThe question of whether an accused in the circumstances of A and G and subject to the new rule in s. 535 would be eligible for a preliminary inquiry in accordance with its terms turns on whether they qualify as an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment. The text in s. 535, read in context and in light of the purposes of the provision, requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years imprisonment in respect of the offence for a preliminary inquiry to be available. Parliament intended for only those accused facing greater maximum jeopardy to retain the benefit of a preliminary inquiry. The focus of the text is on the accused and the accuseds proceedings, and not on hypotheticals or the general nature of the offence. This focus on the specific proceedings of the accused also follows the broader context of the new provision, which makes clear that preliminary inquiries are now generally unavailable, and that their availability is restricted only to those accused who meet specific and clear conditions.\n\tFurthermore, the overall purpose of limiting the availability of the preliminary inquiry was to reduce delays, to alleviate the burden of witnesses and victims, and to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system. These broader purposes inform the specific objectives of s. 535, which represents an exception for serious offences. While Parliament was seeking to reduce systemic obstacles to the Charter right to a trial without unreasonable delay, the exception recognizes that a preliminary inquiry can still be of significant benefit to an accused facing more significant legal jeopardy. Given these purposes, it is difficult to accept that Parliament adopted a threshold meant to invite a hypothetical inquiry into what the maximum sentence for the accused would have been had it occurred at another time. Sentencing principles and current societal values are of little assistance in interpreting s. 535. The proxy for seriousness selected by Parliament is the maximum sentence carried by the offence charged, not the fit sentence. In the instant case, neither A nor G are eligible for a preliminary inquiry under the new s. 535, as the offences with which they are charged are each punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. Accordingly, the appeal should be allowed.\nCases Cited\nBy Cote and Rowe JJ.\n\tApplied: Dikranian v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530; distinguished: Tran v.

C-46 (Cr. C.), is limited to the most serious cases, as well as the question of how the amended provision should be interpreted going forward. The appeal has become moot as regards the respondents, Agenor Archambault and Gilles Grenier, for whom preliminary inquiries were held in parallel with the appeal that has made its way to this Court. We are nevertheless of the view that it is in the public interest to address the above questions on the merits in order to clear up some continuing uncertainty over the state of the law (Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at pp. 361-62; R. v. Smith, 2004 SCC 14, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 385, at paras. 49-50; R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at para. 2; R. v. Oland, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para. 17).\nWe agree with our colleague Karakatsanis J. that the amendment made to s. 535 Cr. C. is procedural in nature but affects a substantive right, that is, an accuseds right under s. 548(1)(b) Cr. C. to be discharged of any charge if, on the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial on the charge. With respect, the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the right to a preliminary inquiry is governed by the law in force at the time the offence was committed.\nHowever, unlike our colleague Karakatsanis J., we are of the view that the respondents, Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault, had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry. The right to a preliminary inquiry crystallizes at the time charges are laid.\nIn the absence of a transitional provision, such an interpretation is the one most consistent with both the text of s. 535 Cr. C. and the presumption that Parliament does not intend to interfere with the vested rights or privileges of accused persons. This interpretation is also anchored in the notion that criminal trials do not all proceed in the same purely linear fashion and that they each have their own particular features. Indeed, when it comes to the order of the various stages of the proceedings, there are a multitude of possibilities. Finding that the right vests when charges are laid, a stage common to all cases, better acknowledges the flexibility of criminal procedure and the delays that may be caused by the Crown or the delays inherent in the justice system. Such an interpretation has the advantage of preserving fairness and legal certainty in addition to allowing for the uniform application of the new legislative provision across the country.\nRegardless of whether a right vested in Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault before the legislative amendment came into force, we are of the opinion that the respondents have such a right under the current version of s. 535 Cr. C. Parliament intended to preserve the preliminary inquiry for all accused persons whose alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, and not, as the Crown argues, only for accused persons who are personally liable to 14 years or more of imprisonment. This is the interpretation most consistent with the text of the amending provision and the compromise from which it resulted. The Crowns proposed interpretation of this provision, based on an abstract purpose  reducing the number of preliminary inquiries held across the country  is not supported either by the clear text of the new s. 535 Cr. C. or by the circumstances in which it was enacted.\nWe would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nFactual Background and Judicial History\nOn the whole, we agree with the summary of the facts and judicial history provided by our colleague Karakatsanis J. However, we will make some additional points that help to circumscribe the issues.\nThe Court of Appeal held that the right to a preliminary inquiry accrues at two different points in time. First, relying on the principle of legality, the Court of Appeal found that the right to a preliminary inquiry is accruing from th[e] moment the offence is committed (2022 QCCA 1170, 84 C.R. (7th) 174, at para. 11). In Healy J.A.s view, the classification of offences (indictable, hybrid or summary conviction) and everything that flows from it (election as to mode of trial and preliminary inquiry) are part of the law on which individuals rely in adjusting their behaviour and in assuming risks at the time of committing an offence (paras. 16-17).\nSecond, the Court of Appeal found that the right to a preliminary inquiry is vested or accrued at the date of the first appearance (para. 11). Even when the accused does not request a preliminary inquiry, the first appearance confirms the vesting of the right. This interpretation is based on the importance of the legislative amendment to the rights or interests concerned, not on the characterization of the amendment as procedural or substantive in nature. As long as the accused has not elected trial before a provincial court judge, the accuseds right to request a preliminary inquiry is preserved.\nGiven its conclusion on this point, the Court of Appeal did not address the question of how the amended version of s. 535 Cr. C. should be interpreted.\nLegislative Background on the Preliminary Inquiry\nAn inheritance from English law, the preliminary inquiry was incorporated into Canadian criminal law in 1892, in the first Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29 (s. 577; see also D. Pomerant and G. Gilmour, A Survey of the Preliminary Inquiry in Canada (April 1993), at pp. 1-24). The preliminary inquiry was originally designed as an instrument of the prosecution, for finding the perpetrator of a crime and obtaining evidence of their guilt; it later became a shield for the defence, allowing the accused to ascertain what evidence the prosecution had against them and also relieving [them] from the expense and odium of a trial if, in the opinion of the justice of the peace or provincial court judge, that evidence was not sufficient to justify holding a trial (Skogman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93, at p. 105, quoting P. Devlin, The Criminal Prosecution in England (1960), at p. 10).\nThe preliminary inquiry therefore has two important aspects. Its primary purpose is to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the process (Skogman, at p. 105). It is a screening mechanism for the purpose of determining whether the Crown has sufficient evidence to commit the accused to trial (R. v. S.J.L., 2009 SCC 14, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 426, at para. 21, citing R. v. Hynes, 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at para. 30 and R. v. Sazant, 2004 SCC 77, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 635, at paras. 14-16). The preliminary inquiry also plays an ancillary role as a discovery mechanism (Hynes, at para. 31). In English law, the Crowns duty to disclose evidence at the preliminary inquiry has evolved in such a way as to make it a very effective discovery mechanism, which has not historically been the case in Canada (Law Reform Commission of Canada, Research Paper: Discovery in Criminal Cases (1974), at pp. 8-9).\nWhile the preliminary inquiry allows an accused to learn more about the prosecutions evidence, the disclosure of evidence is primarily assured, in Canadian law, by the accuseds constitutional right to make full answer and defence, a principle of fundamental justice enshrined in s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326; R. v. Egger, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 451; R. v. OConnor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411; R. v. La, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680; R. v. Dixon, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 244, at para. 22; R. v. Taillefer, 2003 SCC 70, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307; McNeil, at paras. 17-25; R. v. Gubbins, 2018 SCC 44, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 35). This constitutional right to the disclosure of all relevant information is distinct from the right to a preliminary inquiry, which is what led this Court to state in S.J.L., at para. 23, that the incidental function of the preliminary inquiry as a discovery mechanism has lost much of its relevance since the enactment of the Charter. Parliaments choice to limit or abolish the preliminary inquiry for certain offences therefore does not violate the principles of fundamental justice, because the accused continues to be presumed innocent and retains the right to make full answer and defence (para. 21). There is no constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry.\nAt the beginning of this century, Parliament considered ways to reduce the number, length and scope of preliminary inquiries in response to an increase in court delays and in light of the impact of this procedure on victims and other witnesses. However, a radical reform was ruled out (see R. v. M. (P.), 2007 QCCA 414, 222 C.C.C. (3d) 393, at paras. 68-73). The solution favoured by Parliament, a more moderate one, was set out in the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001, S.C. 2002, c. 13. One purpose of that statute was reforming and modernizing criminal procedure with respect to . . . procedural aspects of preliminary inquiries (summary, subpara. (f)(i)). Its provisions, which came into force on June 1, 2004, amended the Cr. C. in order to, among other things, make the holding of a preliminary inquiry optional, allow parties to limit the scope of an inquiry or allow a pre-hearing conference to be held, give the justice the power to regulate the course of the inquiry and authorize the justice to end any abusive examinations or cross-examinations. Those amendments maintained the accuseds unconditional right to a preliminary inquiry while streamlining the use of this procedure and making it optional (House of Commons Debates, vol. 136, No. 124, 2nd Sess., 36th Parl., September 28, 2000, at p. 8829; Debates of the Senate, vol. 139, No. 66, 1st Sess., 37th Parl., November 1, 2001, at p. 1612).\nParliaments intent in making those legislative amendments was to enable parties to choose mechanisms better adapted to their needs; its intent was not the imposition [on them] of more inflexible procedures (S.J.L., at para. 24). To allow parties to decide whether a preliminary inquiry was appropriate in their circumstances, Parliament changed the wording of s. 535 Cr. C. as follows:\n\t535. If an accused who is charged with an indictable offence is before a justice and a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4) or 536.1(3), the justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into the charge and any other indictable offence, in respect of the same transaction, founded on the facts that are disclosed by the evidence taken in accordance with this Part.\n\t(Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001, s. 24)\nIn a report released in June 2017, the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs observed that the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001 had not succeeded in conclusively reducing the number and length of preliminary inquiries or in alleviating the burden on victims and witnesses. In its report, the Committee recommended eliminating preliminary inquiries or limiting them to the most serious offences under the Criminal Code in order to reduce delays in criminal cases (Delaying Justice Is Denying Justice: An Urgent Need to Address Lengthy Court Delays in Canada (Final Report) (2017), at p. 48).\nOne year earlier, in R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, Moldaver, Karakatsanis and Brown JJ., writing for the majority, had invited Parliament to undertake a review of criminal rules and procedures, particularly the preliminary inquiry (at para. 140):\n\tFor provincial legislatures and Parliament, this may mean taking a fresh look at rules, procedures, and other areas of the criminal law to ensure that they are more conducive to timely justice and that the criminal process focusses on what is truly necessary to a fair trial. Legal Aid has a role to play in securing the participation of experienced defence counsel, particularly for long, complex trials. And Parliament may wish to consider the value of preliminary inquiries in light of expanded disclosure obligations. Government will also need to consider whether the criminal justice system (and any initiatives aimed at reducing delay) is adequately resourced. [Emphasis added.]\nIn response to the invitation extended by this Court in Jordan and the observations made by the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report, the government introduced a first version of Bill C-75 in Parliament on March 29, 2018. The original version of the bill limited the availability of preliminary inquiries to adults charged with offences punishable by life imprisonment (Bill C-75, An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., 2018, s. 240 (first reading March 29, 2018); House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 300, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 24, 2018, at p. 19604 (Hon. J. Wilson-Raybould)).\nGiven the concerns expressed by the legal community about that approach, and further to an amendment proposal made by the Senate, the wording of the bill was changed to expand access to preliminary inquiries by comparison with what had been set out in the original bill. A choice was made to preserve the right of accused persons to a preliminary inquiry for all of what were considered to be the most serious offences. In this context, Parliament decided to preserve access in the case of offences for which the maximum sentence was 14 years or more. We use the term most serious offences below to refer to such offences:\n\tAs introduced, Bill C-75 proposed to restrict the availability of preliminary inquiries to indictable offences punishable by life imprisonment, roughly 70 offences. The other place agreed that these offences should automatically include a preliminary inquiry.\n\tHowever, it also expanded their availability on a discretionary basis to all other indictable offences with a maximum penalty of less than life imprisonment, which would have been an additional 393 offences. As per the other places amendment, preliminary inquiries would be available in two circumstances: first, where one or both parties requested one; and, second, a justice was satisfied that certain criteria were met, namely that appropriate measures were taken to mitigate the impacts on victims for both approaches and, where it was on the request of one party, that it was also in the best interest of the administration of justice.\n\tThe amendment responded to concerns that preliminary inquiries were not available for more and serious offences. However, the expansion of their availability, combined with the new complex criteria, would lead, in our view, to further delays and unnecessary litigation; for example, to interpret the proper application of the criteria.\n\tRecognizing, however, that the other places amendment was motivated by continuing concerns by the legal community and others, I proposed to not accept the other places amendments 3 and 4 as drafted, but to revise the bills original approach to make preliminary inquiries also available for offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years, for example, sexual assault with a weapon.\n\t(House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 435, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., June 17, 2019, at p. 29245 (Hon. D. Lametti))\nThat version of the bill was assented to on June 21, 2019, and stipulated that the new preliminary inquiry provisions would come into force 90 days later, on September 19, 2019 (see An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 25 (2019 Amendments), s. 406). The wording of s. 535 Cr. C. as so amended provides only accused persons who are charged with an indictable offence punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment with the right to a preliminary inquiry:\n\t535 If an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment is before a justice and a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4) or 536.1(3), the justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into the charge and any other indictable offence, in respect of the same transaction, founded on the facts that are disclosed by the evidence taken in accordance with this Part.\nOverall, the purpose of the legislative amendment is to reduce the number and length of preliminary inquiries in order to address the increase in court delays in criminal cases and alleviate the burden on witnesses and victims, who have to testify twice when such a procedure is used (House of Commons Debates, May 24, 2018, at pp. 19602-5 (Hon. J. Wilson-Raybould); see also House of Commons Debates, June 17, 2019, at pp. 29245-46 (Hon. D. Lametti)). To this end, Parliament has limited the right of accused persons to request a preliminary inquiry to the offences that are considered to be the most serious. In the context of this amendment, the category of the most serious offences is understood by Parliament as consisting of indictable offences punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years or more.\nAnalysis\nThis appeal requires this Court to interpret a new legislative provision and to determine how it applies temporally. Both in matters of transitional law and in statutory interpretation generally, [translation] the legislative intent is paramount (P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at No. 457; see also R. v. Ali, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 221, at p. 235). Our role is therefore limited to discerning the true legislative intent by reading the words of the provision in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme and object of the legislation (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26).\nOur analysis proceeds as follows. First, we discuss how the new s. 535 Cr. C. applies temporally. Second, we interpret the scope of s. 535 Cr. C. as amended. On the basis of our analysis, we conclude that the respondents, Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault, each have the right to a preliminary inquiry both under the former law, whose effects with respect to them survive the legislative amendment, and under the new law.\nThe Legislative Amendment Does Not Eliminate the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry for Accused Persons Charged Before It Came Into Force\nPrinciples of Transitional Law Applicable in This Case\nThe starting point in analyzing the temporal application of new legislation is always the legislation itself. In the absence of a transitional provision, and where the lawmakers intention to give the legislation a particular effect does not appear expressly or by necessary implication upon reading the legislation, as is the case here, recourse must be had specifically to the rules laid down in interpretation statutes and court decisions.\nThe Crown argues that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the right to a preliminary inquiry is governed by the law in force at the time the offence with which the accused is charged was committed. The effect that the new s. 535 Cr. C. must be given thus depends rather on the application of the presumption against interference with vested rights. According to the Crown, if there is a vested right to a preliminary inquiry, this right does not vest until a valid request for such an inquiry is made.\nIn this case, assessing the merits of these arguments brings into play three well-established principles of transitional law, which one must be careful not to conflate: (1) the principle of legality; (2) the presumption against interference with vested rights; and (3) the exception based on the immediate application of purely procedural provisions. On the basis of the first principle, the Court of Appeal held that the right to a preliminary inquiry is accruing from the moment the offence is committed. On the basis of the second principle, it held that this right is vested at the date of the first appearance. None of the parties argues that the third principle applies here, but this principle must still be considered in order to resolve the question of the temporal application of the new s. 535 Cr. C.\nThe principle of legality is a pillar of the criminal law whose purpose is to preserve the law as it stood at the time an offence was committed (R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 59). The principle was helpfully summarized by Iacobucci and Arbour JJ. in R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357: As a general matter, persons accused of criminal conduct are to be charged and sentenced under the criminal law provisions in place at the time that the offence allegedly was committed (para. 41). This rule finds expression in two forms, both of which are embodied in the Charter (Cote and Devinat, at Nos. 566-67; G. Cote-Harper, P. Rainville and J. Turgeon, Traite de droit penal canadien (4th ed. rev. 1998), at pp. 99-120). First, the new legislation cannot make criminal any act or omission that did not constitute an offence at the time it occurred; s. 11(g) guarantees to any person charged with an offence the right not to be found guilty under such legislation. Second, the new legislation cannot create more severe punishments for an offence committed before it came into force; s. 11(i) guarantees to any person charged with an offence the right to the benefit of the lesser punishment if the punishment has been varied between the time of commission of the offence and the time of sentencing. The rule of law and the fairness of criminal proceedings depend on this (R. v. Kelly, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 170, at p. 203, per McLachlin J.; Poulin, at para. 59; R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at paras. 22-25).\nThe presumption that Parliament does not intend to interfere with vested rights or privileges is one of the fundamental principles of transitional law. To ensure the certainty of the legal consequences attaching to facts and conduct predating a legislative amendment, a statute should not be given a construction that would impair existing rights as regards person or property unless the language in which it is couched requires such a construction (Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 271, at pp. 282-83, citing Spooner Oils Ltd. v. Turner Valley Gas Conservation, [1933] S.C.R. 629, at p. 638; see also Dikranian v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530, at para. 33). Legislation that affects substantive rights can only apply prospectively to cases in which these rights have not yet vested (R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, at para. 87).\nThere is just one exception to this presumption, namely that there is no vested right in procedure, though this is subject to a limitation to the effect that the following of the new procedure must be feasible (Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at p. 331). Purely procedural legislation, which is meant to govern the manner in which rights or privileges are asserted without affecting their substance, is presumed to apply immediately (R. v. Dineley, 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, at paras. 10-11; see also Upper Canada College v. Smith (1920), 61 S.C.R. 413, at p. 418; Howard Smith Paper Mills v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 403, at pp. 419-20; Angus v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co., [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256, at pp. 265-67; Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re), 2004 SCC 42, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248, at paras. 57 and 62). However, this exception is merely a presumption and must therefore yield to a contrary intention expressed by the lawmaker (Ali, at p. 235).\nThe following provisions of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, codify the presumption against interference with vested rights and the exception based on the immediate application of purely procedural provisions:\n\t43 Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not\n\t. . .\n\t(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the enactment so repealed,\n\t. . .\n\t44 Where an enactment, in this section called the former enactment, is repealed and another enactment, in this section called the new enactment, is substituted therefor,\n\t. . .\n\t(c) every proceeding taken under the former enactment shall be taken up and continued under and in conformity with the new enactment in so far as it may be done consistently with the new enactment;\n\t(d) the procedure established by the new enactment shall be followed as far as it can be adapted thereto\n\t. . .\n\t(ii) in the enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the former enactment,\nWith respect, it is not helpful to address the principle of legality from the perspective of vested rights, as the Court of Appeal did in this case, nor is it appropriate to erase the distinction between non-retroactivity and non-interference with vested rights (see Venne v. Quebec (Commission de protection du territoire agricole), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 880, at p. 906; Attorney General of Quebec v. Expropriation Tribunal, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 732, at pp. 741 and 744; Gustavson Drilling, at pp. 279 and 282; Dikranian, at para. 31). Such an approach injects more uncertainty and confusion into transitional law than it resolves. We are dealing not with a provision that might change the legal rules applicable at the time the offence was committed, which would engage the principle of legality, but rather with a legislative amendment whose purpose is to limit the use of a criminal procedure for the future.\nWe therefore propose simply to follow the structure of ss. 43 and 44 of the Interpretation Act. The first question to be considered in determining how new legislation applies temporally is whether the legislative amendment is purely procedural in nature. If the amendment in issue may affect a right or privilege that vested under the prior enactment, the time at which that right or privilege vested must be determined. It will be presumed to be preserved only for persons in whom it actually vested before the legislative amendment came into force.\nThe Abolition of the Preliminary Inquiry for Certain Offences Is Procedural in Nature but Affects a Substantive Right\nThe absence of any indication from Parliament as to the temporal application of a provision triggers the presumption that the legislative amendment does not affect vested rights or privileges. In this case, the amending statute contains several transitional provisions, but none of them concerns the sections relating to the preliminary inquiry regime. There is nothing in the new enactment that makes it possible to clearly discern Parliaments intent with respect to its temporal application. In such circumstances, it must be concluded that Parliament intended to rely on the presumptions, not to displace them.\nMr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault are asking this Court to affirm, as the Court of Appeal did, that the right to a preliminary inquiry is governed by the substantive law in force at the time the offence was committed. Reaching this conclusion would end the analysis.\nHowever, with respect for the contrary view, we are of the opinion that the abolition of the preliminary inquiry for certain offences does not engage the principle of legality. This measure has no impact on the scope of criminal liability. The preliminary inquiry is not a legal rule on which an accused may rely in adjusting his behaviour or in deciding to accept the consequences of breaking it at the moment he commits an offence (Poulin, at para. 59). It is not a trial but simply a preliminary review to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial (Hynes, at para. 4; see also A. Stylios, J. Casgrain and M.-E. OBrien, Procedure penale (2023), at para. 10-3).\nIt must therefore be asked whether the abolition of the preliminary inquiry in the case of accused persons charged with an indictable offence punishable by less than 14 years of imprisonment affects a substantive right or whether, the amendment being purely procedural in nature, the new enactment must apply immediately to all proceedings, whether commenced before or after it came into force. Provincial court and superior court judges across the country have expressed conflicting opinions on the matter. Importantly, the Crown does not argue that the legislative amendment is purely procedural in nature, but rather questions when the right to a preliminary inquiry vests.\nOn this point, we agree for the most part with the analysis of our colleague Karakatsanis J. It is true that Parliaments choice to limit or abolish the right to a preliminary inquiry in the case of certain offences does not affect the accuseds right to make full answer and defence, because there is no constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry (S.J.L., at para. 21). That being said, as Doherty J.A. established in R. v. R.S., 2019 ONCA 906, the limitation on the right to a preliminary inquiry affects the accuseds right under s. 548(1)(b) Cr. C. to be discharged of any charge if, on the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial on the charge (para. 49; see also R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828). The purpose of the preliminary inquiry is in fact to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the process (Hynes, at para. 30, quoting Skogman, at p. 105). It may also happen that, following a preliminary inquiry, an accused will be committed for trial on offences distinct from the one initially charged, a situation that may lead to a review of the decision then in effect on the accuseds interim release, pursuant to s. 523(2)(b) Cr. C.\nThis is not a case in which the legislative amendment would affect only the manner of proceeding or of conducting litigation. Any limitation on the right to a preliminary inquiry therefore has a direct impact on the liberty and security of accused persons (R.S., at paras. 52 and 57-58). The legislative amendment, whose purpose is to limit the preliminary inquiry to the most serious offences, cannot be considered a purely procedural amendment.\nWe also agree with our colleague Karakatsanis J. that simply concluding that procedural legislation may affect vested or substantive rights is not sufficient to determine the temporal application of a legislative amendment where the vesting of these rights may be questioned. In Dineley, this Court cautioned against categorizing the nature of a legislative amendment in an overly rigid manner without considering its effects on vested or substantive rights (para. 10). The use of the word or in the expression vested or substantive rights cannot be interpreted as creating two distinct classes of rights, one that protects rights from any retrospective effect and the other providing protection only if the rights in question have vested. This would amount to nullifying the presumption against interference with vested rights. Therefore, with due respect for the approach adopted by our colleague Martin J., the fact that new procedural legislation may, through its effects, interfere with a substantive right does not end the analysis. The right or privilege in question must also have been vested at the time that legislation came into force.\nWe would add that the fact that a legislative amendment affects interests of a constitutional nature is not in itself determinative of how the legislative amendment applies temporally (Martin J.s reasons, at para. 110). That would be a considerable extension of the constitutional sphere, which would have the effect of unjustifiably broadening the scope of the presumption against interference with vested rights, especially given that the constitutionality of the amendment in issue is not being challenged. In Dineley, it was unnecessary for this Court to consider when the right had vested, because the legislative amendment had come into force during the trial. Holding that the presumption on vested rights applied and that it was impossible for proceedings commenced under the former enactment to be continued in conformity with the new enactment, as contemplated by Ali, was sufficient to dispose of the appeal.\nThere is more. In a criminal context, the conclusion that new procedural legislation affects vested or substantive rights does not necessarily engage the principle of legality. Vested or substantive rights within the meaning of Dineley must not be confused with the substantive law in force at the time the offence was committed within the meaning of Poulin. A right may be vested or substantive without having any impact on the scope of criminal liability, that is, the nature or consequences of the commission of an offence. The reverse is also true. It is possible for an accused not to have a vested right to the rules in force at the time the offence was committed. With respect, the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in this case creates such confusion.\nIn light of our conclusion on this question, and in the absence of any indication that justifies concluding otherwise, the presumption that Parliament did not intend to interfere with vested rights or privileges in relation to preliminary inquiries applies. What must now be determined is when this right vests in order to decide whether Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault were entitled to the preliminary inquiries they obtained following an agreement with the Crown.\nThe Right to a Preliminary Inquiry Vests at the Time Charges Are Laid\nThe core issue in this appeal is when the right to a preliminary inquiry vests for the purposes of s. 43(c) of the Interpretation Act. If an amendment may affect a right existing under the former law, the right in question will be presumed to be preserved only for accused persons in whom it actually vested before the amendment came into force.\nThe determination of what constitutes a vested right or privilege is a delicate matter. In Dikranian, this Court set out two conditions to be met by an individual claiming a vested right or privilege. First, the individuals legal situation must be tangible and concrete rather than general and abstract (para. 37). The mere possibility of availing oneself of a statute is not a basis for arguing that a vested right exists; the right must be vested in a specific individual (para. 39). Second, the individuals legal situation must be sufficiently tangible and constituted at the time the new legislation comes into force; in other words, the situation must have materialized to some degree (paras. 37 and 40).\nFor the legal situation to be sufficiently constituted, the conditions precedent to the exercise of a right must have been fulfilled. Only then can the right be vested (R. v. Puskas, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207, at para. 14). However, the right can still vest in time even if not all procedural steps required to exercise the right were taken before a legislative amendment came into force (see, e.g., Re Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. and Minister of Revenue for Ontario (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 240 (C.A.), at pp. 248-50; see also Cote and Devinat, at No. 638; R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at pp. 729-30). The difficulty therefore lies in distinguishing, on the one hand, what are simply the necessary procedural steps for exercising the right from, on the other, the conditions precedent to the exercise of the right. Only the latter must be fulfilled for the right to vest.\nMr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault, echoing in part the Court of Appeals conclusions in this regard, argue principally that the right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time the offence is committed and, in the alternative, that the right vests at the time of the first appearance. It is relevant to note that the Ontario Court of Appeal, unlike its Quebec counterpart, has found that the right to a preliminary inquiry does not vest until the date the accused requests such an inquiry (see R.S., at para. 4). In the present case, the Crown is asking this Court to adopt this latter approach and to reject the one favoured by the Court of Appeal of Quebec.\nThe Crown correctly submits that a right or a privilege cannot vest at several different points in time. It is true that there is a notable difference in formulation between the French and English versions of s. 43(c) of the Interpretation Act. The French version refers first to droits ou avantages acquis, and then to obligations contractees and responsabilites encourues. The English version does not use specific language for rights and privileges, referring rather to any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred. In principle, the words acquired, accrued, accruing should have different meanings, because Parliament does not speak in vain (Attorney General of Quebec v. Carrieres Ste-Therese Ltee, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 831, at p. 838; Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp., 2007 SCC 30, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, at para. 87; R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 89). However, as Professor Ruth Sullivan noted, the prolix style in which the provision is drafted (typical of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) blunts the force of this presumption (p. 768). This Court therefore stated in Puskas that the words acquired, accrued and accruing used in s. 43(c) of the Interpretation Act essentially refer to the same idea: . . . something can only be said to be accruing if its eventual accrual is certain, and not conditional on future events (para. 14 (emphasis added)).\nUnder the first step of the test laid down in Dikranian, the possibility that the accuseds right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time the offence is committed can be excluded. The time of the offence cannot be the point at which the right to a preliminary inquiry vests, since the accuseds legal situation is not sufficiently tangible, concrete and distinctive at that time. It is not until the accused is charged that their legal situation becomes tangible, concrete and distinctive. At the time charges are laid, the criminal court process begins and the accused actually faces criminal jeopardy.\nWe are also of the view that, under the second step of the test laid down in Dikranian, the accuseds situation is sufficiently constituted at the time charges are laid. At that point, the vesting of the right is certain and not conditional on future events, because the accused will inevitably have to appear and choose to exercise or waive their right to a preliminary inquiry, or to reserve their election. All of the conditions precedent to the vesting of the right are also fulfilled at that time. In our opinion, the request that the accused must make to a justice is a necessary procedural step for exercising the right to a preliminary inquiry, but it has no effect on its crystallization. This can be confirmed simply by looking at the wording of s. 535 Cr. C., bearing in mind the purpose of the legislative amendments that came into force in 2004 and 2019.\nSection 535 Cr. C. opens with the phrase [i]f an accused who is charged with an indictable offence, which sets the charging of the accused as the condition for entitlement to a preliminary inquiry. The Court of Appeal correctly noted that [t]hese words point unmistakably to the moment of charging as the moment at which the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry . . . is fully vested in the accused (para. 37). It is true that s. 535 Cr. C. states that an accused must be charged with an indictable offence (inculpe dun acte criminel). In the case of a hybrid offence, the Crown may not yet have decided on the mode of prosecution at the time charges are laid. However, this is not a consideration that makes the right less certain or concrete. There is a fundamental distinction between a right that has vested but can be challenged and a right that has not vested because the conditions precedent to its crystallization have not been fulfilled. Therefore, neither the fact that the Crown may elect to proceed summarily or by direct indictment under s. 577 Cr. C. nor the possibility that the accused will elect to be tried in provincial court prevents the right to a preliminary inquiry from being acquired by the accused (R.S., at para. 40).\nThe accused must make a request before a justice in order for a preliminary inquiry to be held, but the vesting of the accuseds right is not conditional on the making of such a request. Section 535 Cr. C. is under the heading Jurisdiction and concerns the justices duty to conduct a preliminary inquiry. This duty is separate from the accuseds right to a preliminary inquiry. From a procedural standpoint, a preliminary inquiry is held only if a request to this effect is made by one of the parties (ss. 535, 536(2) and (4) and 536.1(2) and (3) Cr. C.); this is why the justices duty to conduct an inquiry arises only if one is requested. In this context, the request for a preliminary inquiry triggers the justices duty but is not a condition precedent to the existence of the right to a preliminary inquiry itself.\nIn this regard, we cannot agree with our colleague Karakatsanis J.s reading of Puskas. That case dealt with amendments to s. 691(2) Cr. C. that abolished appeals as of right to this Court for accused persons whose acquittal had been overturned by a court of appeal, where a new trial had been ordered. The right to appeal to this Court without leave was accompanied by a procedural requirement, namely the filing of a notice of appeal within the statutory time limits (see Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, ss. 58 to 60). In Puskas, this Court did not include the filing of the notice of appeal in the set of conditions to be met for the vesting of the right in question (para. 15). In the same way, the making of a request for a preliminary inquiry is not a condition precedent to the existence of the right to a preliminary inquiry, but rather constitutes the exercise of the right itself.\nTo conclude otherwise would be to give the 2004 legislative amendments a scope they were not intended to have. As this Court noted in S.J.L., the purpose of those amendments was to enable parties to choose a mechanism adapted to their needs, not to impose a condition to be met for their right to materialize. The right to a preliminary inquiry remained unconditional (House of Commons Debates, September 28, 2000, at pp. 8828-29; Debates of the Senate, November 1, 2001, at p. 1612; see also D. M. Paciocco, A Voyage of Discovery: Examining the Precarious Condition of the Preliminary Inquiry (2004), 48 Crim. L.Q. 151, at p. 162). The addition of procedural steps that had to be taken in order to exercise the right to a preliminary inquiry did not change the scope of this right, unlike the 2019 legislative amendment, whose purpose was precisely to limit the number of such inquiries. The effects of these two amendments must not be conflated.\nThe Court of Appeal of Quebec properly noted that accused persons regularly reserve their election as to mode of trial at the first appearance in order to avoid making a premature decision on the exercise of their right to a preliminary inquiry (paras. 40-43). This practice provides a concrete illustration of the fact that the right to a preliminary inquiry crystallizes as soon as criminal charges are laid. As our colleague Kasirer J. suggests, if an accused can in practice reserve the exercise of their right, this means that their legal situation is (1) tangible, concrete and distinctive and (2) sufficiently constituted, that is, not uncertain and not conditional on future events. As we explain, however, these conditions are already met the moment criminal charges are laid. As long as the accused has not waived the right to a preliminary inquiry by electing to be tried in provincial court and the Crown has not defeated this right by electing an incompatible mode of prosecution or by proceeding by direct indictment, the accused continues to have a right to a preliminary inquiry.\nIn our view, there is no need in this case to decide on the appropriateness of reforming this practice. Parliament has already made the choice to limit the preliminary inquiry to the most serious cases in order to address the increase in court delays in criminal cases. Arguably, the making of informed decisions also helps to reduce delays, by comparison with the making of premature decisions that might entail higher costs. It must be kept in mind that, when an accused expresses his wish to re-elect mode of trial, consent from the prosecutor must generally be obtained (s. 561(1)(a) Cr. C.; Jordan, at para. 62). In this context, and in light of the importance of this election by an accused, we would refrain from concluding that the practice of reserving elections is a dilatory mechanism.\nIn addition to being supported by the new enactment, the interpretation we adopt has the advantage of preserving fairness and legal certainty. Criminal trials do not all proceed in a purely linear fashion, and they each have their own particular features. When it comes to the order of the various stages of the proceedings, there are a multitude of possibilities. The flexibility of criminal procedure and the possible delays that may occur are better acknowledged by finding that the right vests when charges are laid, a stage common to all cases. Such delays may be attributable to the Crown, for example where it is slow to elect the mode of prosecution, or to the delays inherent in the justice system. Nothing suggests that Parliament intended to subject the vesting of a right as important as that to a preliminary inquiry to such contingencies. The expectation of the accused crystallizes into a right to a preliminary inquiry once charges are laid, because the accuseds freedom and security are then at risk.\nSuch an interpretation also has the advantage of allowing for the uniform application of criminal procedure across the country, without affecting the particularities of the administration of justice in certain provinces. Such particularities are permitted by Parliament in matters of criminal procedure (see ss. 482 and 482.1 Cr. C.). We believe that it is important for justice to be administered in a manner adapted to local circumstances and, for this reason, we consider it inappropriate to adopt an interpretation of the new text of s. 535 Cr. C. that would exclude such a possibility outright. Nothing in the wording of this provision is inherently incompatible with the election being reserved and the preauthorization or not of prosecutions. To conclude that the right to a preliminary inquiry only vests when an accused makes such a request risks creating situations in which accused persons in different provinces, despite being charged on the same date, would not all be vested with the right to a preliminary inquiry.\nThe respondents, Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault, were charged prior to September 19, 2019. We therefore conclude that they each had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry before the legislative amendment came into force. The former s. 535 Cr. C. continues to apply to them by operation of the presumption against interference with vested rights, and it is unnecessary to determine whether the offences they were charged with fall within the category of the most serious offences. The Crown chose to prioritize the holding of the trials for Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault within a reasonable time, as well as the right of the victims to finally be heard in court, by allowing a preliminary inquiry to be held in each of the two cases. With respect for the contrary view, we conclude that this choice was consistent in every respect with the temporal application of the legislative amendment.\nAn Accused Whose Alleged Offence, or Its Equivalent, Is Punishable by 14 Years or More of Imprisonment Has the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry\nAlthough our conclusion on the question of the temporal application of the new text of s. 535 Cr. C. is sufficient to dispose of this appeal, we shall now examine the interpretation this provision should receive.\nTo date, appellate courts that have considered the matter have found that a preliminary inquiry is available only to accused persons who personally face a term of imprisonment of 14 years or more (see R. v. Sheppard, 2023 ABCA 381, 69 Alta. L.R. (7th) 1; R. v. S.S., 2021 ONCA 479, 493 C.R.R. (2d) 251; R. v. C.T.B., 2021 NSCA 58). In the same vein, the Crown submits that the legislative amendment to s. 535 Cr. C. has the effect of eliminating the right to a preliminary inquiry for accused persons charged with so-called historical offences for which the term of imprisonment was not 14 years or more at the time the offence was committed.\nWith respect, we are of the view that this interpretation is incorrect. The text, context and purpose of s. 535 Cr. C. demonstrate that an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offence, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment. Section 535 Cr. C. must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the intent expressed by Parliament to increase the sentences applicable to certain offences, where necessary. The right to a preliminary inquiry is therefore not affected by the accuseds right to the benefit of the lesser punishment.\nParliament Intended the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry To Be Tied to the Seriousness of the Offence\nThere is no ambiguity in the wording of s. 535 Cr. C. A preliminary inquiry can be held only [i]f an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment is before a justice and a request has been made for [an] inquiry. Both the adjective punishable in English and its equivalent passible in the French version, which states [l]orsquun prevenu inculpe dun acte criminel passible dun emprisonnement de quatorze ans ou plus, relate to the indictable offence and not to the sentence the accused may receive. In addition, the English version of the provision is enlightening in this regard, since the word that very clearly links the adjective punishable to the term indictable offence. This phrasing refers to the seriousness of the alleged offence, and its logic is not directed at the accused personally. Parliament thus intended the right to a preliminary inquiry to be tied to the seriousness of the alleged offence, not to the degree of jeopardy faced by the accused. This is an objective criterion.\nThe expression acte criminel passible dun emprisonnement maximal de is used more than a hundred times in the French version of the Cr. C. to establish the maximum sentence that applies and thus to define the objective seriousness of offences. As this Court stated in R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 96, the maximum sentence established by Parliament for an offence determines the objective seriousness of the offence (see also R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 36; H. Parent and J. Desrosiers, Traite de droit criminel, t. III, La peine (3rd ed. 2020), at p. 53; C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at 2.19). According to the presumption of consistent expression, the meaning of the words used in statutes remains consistent, because the legislature is presumed to use language such that the same words have the same meaning both within a statute and across statutes (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 44, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at p. 217). There is therefore no reason, in interpreting the text of s. 535 Cr. C., to depart from the usual meaning of this expression, which refers to the objective seriousness of the offence.\nThis interpretation is not only supported by the text of s. 535 Cr. C. but is also reinforced by an examination of the parliamentary debates that led to the amendment in issue. It must be kept in mind that Parliament has always understood the category of the most serious offences by reference to the maximum sentence specified for the offence, which, here again, is reflected in the provision as enacted. The first version of the amendment at issue would have maintained the right to a preliminary inquiry only for accused persons charged with offences punishable by life imprisonment. As a result of a public outcry and a compromise that followed, Parliament instead chose to preserve the right to a preliminary inquiry for the most serious offences, meaning those punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years or more. In doing so, Parliament presumably had in mind offences in the nature of those Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault were charged with, which today fall within the category of the most serious offences. Parliament made the choice to increase the maximum sentences for such offences to convey its view of the gravity of a particular offence (R. v. Bertrand Marchand, 2023 SCC 26, at para. 168).\nWhile it is not in dispute that Parliament intended to limit the right to a preliminary inquiry to the most serious offences, it strikes us as contradictory to adopt an approach based on the severity of the maximum sentence to which the accused is personally liable (or the jeopardy actually faced by the accused), as the Crown does in this case.\nIn reality, the Crowns interpretation does not rest on the text or context of s. 535 Cr. C., but rather on the abstract purpose of reducing the number of offences for which a preliminary inquiry is available. With respect, such an interpretation disregards the new wording of the provision and the compromise from which it resulted. While the purpose of the amendment plays an important role in the interpretation of the new provision, it cannot serve as a basis for rewriting the provision so amended or for ignoring the clear meaning it conveys (see R. v. D.A.I., 2012 SCC 5, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 149, at para. 26; R. v. McColman, 2023 SCC 8, at para. 36; Reference re Impact Assessment Act, 2023 SCC 23, at para. 193; see also Cote and Devinat, at No. 1366; Sullivan, at p. 293; M. Mancini, The Purpose Error in the Modern Approach to Statutory Interpretation (2022), 59 Alta. L. Rev. 919, at pp. 920-22). In construing a legislative provision, courts do not have to interpret  let alone implement  the objective underlying a legislative scheme or provision; what they must interpret is the text through which the legislature seeks to achieve [its] objective (MediaQMI inc. v. Kamel, 2021 SCC 23, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 899, at para. 39). It is clear that Parliament did not seek to achieve at any cost its purpose of reducing the number of offences for which a preliminary inquiry is available, but rather confined itself to a very specific compromise, which is reflected in the wording of the provision (Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v. United Steelworkers, 2013 SCC 6, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 271, at para. 174; see also Mancini, at pp. 920-21).\nThe Crown relies in part on R. v. Windebank, 2021 ONCA 157, 154 O.R. (3d) 573, to argue that any interpretation of s. 535 Cr. C. that increased the number of offences for which a preliminary inquiry is available would be contrary to Parliaments purpose. In that case, the accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm and assault by choking, suffocation or strangulation, offences punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10 years (s. 267(b) and (c) Cr. C.). The Crown advised the accused that it intended to apply to have him remanded for an assessment under s. 752.1 Cr. C. if he was convicted. In response, the accused requested a preliminary inquiry, alleging that he was now at risk of indefinite detention (s. 753(4) Cr. C.). The Ontario Court of Appeal, per Nordheimer J.A., rightly rejected that argument on the ground that the language and legislative history of s. 535 Cr. C. point to an emphasis on the seriousness of the offence, not on the jeopardy faced by the accused:\n\tThere is nothing ambiguous about the language used in s. 535. The words used are plain. An offender is entitled to a preliminary inquiry if charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment. The respondent is not charged with any such offence.\n\tIn my view, the flaw, both in the respondents argument and in the decisions below, is that they confuse the seriousness of the offence with the seriousness of the offender, that is, their individual circumstances. Proceedings by way of a dangerous offender designation are separate and apart from the proceedings leading to a conviction for the offence. It is a proceeding that may only be invoked after a finding of guilt has been made on the offence charged. It requires a separate process where separate factual findings are made, and its determination turns on the nature of the offender, not the nature of the offence. While a specific offence may trigger the dangerous offender proceeding, its determination goes well beyond the originating offence: R. v. Wilson, [2020] O.J. No. 30, 2020 ONCA 3, 384 C.C.C. (3d) 355, at para. 66.\n\tAs s. 535 makes clear, it is the seriousness of the offence that dictates the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry. This conclusion is reinforced by the legislative history leading to the changes to s. 535, including the change from offences carrying a maximum sentence of life imprisonment to offences carrying a maximum sentence of 14 years. It is also reinforced by the various speeches made in Parliament regarding the purpose behind the amendments. [Underlining added; paras. 35-37.]\nClearly, and with respect for the distinction drawn by the Ontario Court of Appeal in S.S., the jeopardy actually faced by the accused as a result of the time when the offence was committed is part of the accuseds individual circumstances and does not go to the seriousness of the alleged offence. An offence is not less serious today because it was committed before a certain date. In determining the right to a preliminary inquiry, Parliament did not intend to draw a distinction between charges of the same nature based on the date of commission of the offence. To conclude otherwise would only create more complexity and uncertainty, which would be contrary to Parliaments intent (Windebank, at para. 31).\nThe objective seriousness of an offence is not confined to the maximum sentence for the offence at the time it was committed. On the contrary, the legislative amendments increasing maximum sentences indicate Parliaments determination that . . . offences . . . are to be treated as more grave than they had been in the past (Friesen, at para. 99; see also Bertrand Marchand, at para. 168). The jeopardy faced by an accused who is not personally liable to a maximum sentence of 14 years is similar to that faced by an accused who is personally liable to that maximum sentence. In applying the principles of sentencing, courts are required to impose sentences higher than those imposed prior to the increases, in accordance with the will of Parliament (Friesen, at para. 100; see, e.g., R. v. Fruitier, 2022 QCCA 1225, at paras. 32-40). Parliament did not intend to exclude historical offences from the category of the most serious offences.\nFinally, like the appellate courts that have considered the matter (see S.S., at paras. 17-20; C.T.B., at paras. 21 and 42-43), the Crown supports its interpretation of the new s. 535 Cr. C. by drawing an analogy between this provision and the one in dispute in Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289. With respect, that analogy does not hold up. In Tran, the accused had committed an offence that was punishable by a maximum sentence of seven years at the time it was committed. After the accused was charged, but before he was convicted, a legislative amendment increased the maximum sentence for that offence to imprisonment for 14 years. Under s. 36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, the accused was inadmissible to Canada on grounds of serious criminality for having been convicted in Canada of a federal offence punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. That provision, which has since been amended, was worded as follows:\n\t36 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality for\n\t(a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, or of an offence under an Act of Parliament for which a term of imprisonment of more than six months has been imposed;\nOn the basis of this wording, the parties were divided on the question of whether the maximum sentence should be assessed by reference to the Act of Parliament defining the offence or the maximum sentence that could be imposed on the person. In that particular context, this Court departed from the usual meaning of the words punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. Such an interpretation was justified by the context of the provision, given the temporal marker (set at the time of conviction) and the disjunctive clauses (the maximum term of imprisonment and the actual term imposed), as well as by the purpose of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Tran, at paras. 36-40). The opposite interpretation would have led to the conclusion that one and the same conviction could both entitle a permanent resident to remain in the country at the time the conviction was entered and lead to their deportation later, without any indication from Parliament that such a retroactive effect was intended (paras. 43-53). In light of all of these considerations, this Court held that the provision could refer only to the maximum sentence that could have been imposed on the accused at the time the offence was committed (para. 36).\nUniformly transposing the interpretation of s. 36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to s. 535 Cr. C. disregards the text, context and purpose of each of the two provisions. Statutory interpretation is meant to determine the intent reflected in a particular enactment and cannot be reduced to an artificial comparative exercise that does not take account of the context in which the words are used.\nWhere the maximum sentence for an offence was increased to 14 years between the commission of the offence and the laying of charges, a preliminary inquiry can be held even if the accused is not personally facing a maximum sentence of 14 years. In such a case, it must be asked whether the seriousness of the alleged offence, as it is defined today, places it within the category of the most serious offences. The fact that the accused is charged and convicted on the basis of the criminal provisions in force at the time the offence was committed changes nothing in this regard.\nAn Accuseds Right to the Benefit of the Lesser Punishment Does Not Affect the Determination of the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry\nAlthough an accused may receive a reduced maximum sentence for a crime committed before the sentence was increased, the accuseds right to the benefit of the lesser punishment does not defeat the right to a preliminary inquiry. To conclude otherwise would lead to an absurd result, in addition to penalizing the accused and disregarding the sequence of the various stages of a trial.\nIn establishing an accuseds right to a preliminary inquiry, s. 535 Cr. C. is closely linked to the right set out in s. 548(1)(b) Cr. C., that is, the right to be discharged of any charge if, on the whole of the evidence adduced during the preliminary inquiry, no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial on the charge. In this sense, it is a provision favourable to the accused. Section 535 Cr. C. cannot be interpreted narrowly in light of other provisions that are equally favourable to the accused, such as s. 11(i) of the Charter and ss. 43(d) and 44(e) of the Interpretation Act, which establish the accuseds right to the benefit of the lesser punishment. Concluding that accused persons who enjoy such protection have no right to a preliminary inquiry leads to an absurdity, which results from the application of provisions whose purpose is precisely to preserve their interests.\nWe are also unable to agree with the conclusion of our colleague Karakatsanis J. that Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault would not be penalized by such an interpretation. While an accuseds right to the benefit of the lesser punishment guarantees a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment because of the date of the alleged offence for which the statutory sentence has since been increased, the accused can be given a sentence heavier than the one that would have been imposed at the time, as we explained above (Friesen, at paras. 3, 5 and 107; Bertrand Marchand, at para. 31). There is therefore a significant difference between the situation of an accused charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10 years and that of an accused charged with a historical offence for which the statutory sentence has since been increased.\nWe reiterate that Tran does not support the conclusion that the accused must be personally facing a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years in order to have the right to a preliminary inquiry. Drawing an analogy with s. 36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, as our colleague Karakatsanis J. does, overlooks the sequence of stages in criminal trials. The preliminary inquiry and sentencing occur at different times and are separated by the trial. The order in which these stages proceed plays an important role, because the preliminary inquiry takes place well before sentencing. To hold otherwise could lead to results that are absurd in practice, if not harmful. There are circumstances in which the justice cannot say with certainty that the accused will have the rights set out in s. 11(i) of the Charter. Adopting the reasoning proposed by our colleague would create the risk of denying a preliminary inquiry to an accused who should be entitled to one. The application of s. 11(i) of the Charter is a question of law, which a judge decides only at the sentencing stage.\nApplication to the Facts\nIt must be kept in mind that, since 2015, offences in the nature of those with which Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault were charged, or the equivalent offences, have been punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years. Under s. 11(i) of the Charter, the respondents are entitled to the benefit of the lesser maximum punishment in effect at the time the alleged acts were committed, that is, a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. The fact remains that the intent expressed by Parliament is to toughen the sentences applicable to the offences charged against Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault. Section 535 Cr. C. must be interpreted in a manner consistent with that intent.\nThe offences with which Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault were charged fall within the category of the most serious offences, because if the acts in question were committed today, they would be punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years. This is not in dispute. They therefore have the right, under the new s. 535 Cr. C., to request a preliminary inquiry.\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.\n\tEnglish version of the reasons of Kasirer and Jamal JJ. delivered by\n\tKasirer J.  \nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons prepared by my colleagues, but, with respect, I do not share their views. In my opinion, given the respondents particular circumstances, their right to request a preliminary inquiry vested prior to the coming into force of the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (Cr. C.), on September 19, 2019. This allowed for their preliminary inquiries to be held at a later date. I would therefore dismiss the Crowns appeal, but, again with respect, for reasons that differ from those of the Court of Appeal.\nIn substance, I agree with Karakatsanis J.s analysis of vested rights with regard to the temporal application of s. 535 Cr. C. In particular, I agree with the importance my colleague attaches to the request made by an accused for a preliminary inquiry. I also agree with her that local practices regarding the administration of justice can legitimately vary from one province or territory to another and that this is not necessarily incompatible with the uniform application of substantive criminal law in Canada in a context similar to that of this appeal. However, in light of the practice followed in Quebec and its effect on the respondents right to request a preliminary inquiry, I am of the view that the respondents had vested rights in the circumstances. This conclusion should not be seen as a way of circumventing the effect of legislation duly passed by Parliament. Given that Parliament did not enact a transitional provision specifying how the new s. 535 Cr. C. was to apply to an existing situation, it is for the courts to interpret it to determine whether accused persons had vested rights at the time it came into force. There is no justification for excluding the Quebec practice from the analysis.\nThe rule governing vested or acquired rights was stated as follows by this Court in R. v. Puskas, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207: A right can only be said to have been acquired when the right-holder can actually exercise it (para. 14). As Lamer C.J. explained, a right cannot accrue, be acquired, or be accruing until all conditions precedent to the exercise of the right have been fulfilled (ibid.; see also Dikranian v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530, at para. 37; R. v. Dineley, 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, at para. 52).\nBoth as it read at the time of each respondents first appearance before the Court of Quebec and in its amended form, s. 535 Cr. C. grants certain accused persons what the Superior Court judge in Mr. Greniers case rightly called [translation] the right to request a preliminary inquiry (2021 QCCS 1876, at para. 32 (CanLII)). Once a preliminary inquiry has been requested, the justice shall inquire into the charge (s. 535 Cr. C.).\nI agree with Karakatsanis J. that once an accused requests a preliminary inquiry, all conditions precedent to the exercise of the right are then fulfilled within the meaning of Puskas. Accordingly, where a request was made before the amendment to s. 535 Cr. C. came into force on September 19, 2019, but the inquiry was not held before that date, the right to an inquiry at a later date had vested. In my opinion, however, this is not the only situation in which all of the conditions precedent are fulfilled, such that the right to request a preliminary inquiry for the existing situation vests. In my respectful view, to conclude otherwise would undermine the judicially endorsed practice that allows an accused to reserve their right to elect the mode of trial at a later date, a practice that determined the outcome for the two respondents in this case.\nIn Quebec, by all accounts, accused persons proceed [translation] as is customary in that province, that is, by reserv[ing] their election . . . so that they [can] examine the evidence disclosed (R. v. Chretien-Barrette, 2023 QCCQ 5857, at para. 27 (CanLII)). It is also [translation] customary for judges to agree to requests made by accused persons to reserve their election as to the mode of trial, a practice recognized both by the courts and in legal scholarship (para. 29; see also Aucoin v. R., 2023 QCCS 3024, at paras. 41 and 43 (CanLII); A. Stylios, J. Casgrain and M.-E. OBrien, Procedure penale (2023), at pp. 704-5; author Nicolas Bellemare uses the term [translation] postpone to refer to the same practice: Les procedures precedant le proces en matiere criminelle, in Collection de droit de lEcole du Barreau du Quebec 2024-2025, vol. 12, Droit penal  Procedure et preuve (2024), 39, at pp. 70-71). It is therefore not surprising in this case that the Crown and Mr. Archambault both point to this practice in their submissions to the Court, by referring to [translation] reserv[ing] [the] election as to the mode of trial (A.F., at para. 8) and [translation] reservation of [the] election (R.F. (Archambault), at paras. 68-71), and do not dispute its existence. Healy J.A., writing for the unanimous panel of the Court of Appeal, made the same observation when noting that [a]t the first appearance, at least in Quebec, the accused typically reserves the right of election to a future date and that, in doing so, the accused has effectively preserved the entitlement to request a preliminary inquiry (2022 QCCA 1170, 84 C.R. (7th) 174, at paras. 40 and 43).\nThis is what occurred in respect of the two respondents. When they first appeared before the Court of Quebec, the accused each asked the court to reserve their election as to the mode of trial, and their request was granted (see 2021 QCCS 1966, at paras. 12 and 15; C.Q. reasons (Grenier), reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at pp. 7-8; A.F., at para. 8). All of this happened before the amendments to s. 535 Cr. C. came into force, that is, before September 19, 2019. The respondents understanding  which is generally shared by Quebec judges and lawyers  was that reserving the election as to the mode of trial had the effect of preserving the right to make a request for a preliminary inquiry at a later date, so that the right could be exercised in an informed manner (see, e.g., C.A. reasons, at para. 42; R.F. (Archambault), at para. 68). By agreeing to their requests, the Court of Quebec was thus assuring them that they could request a preliminary inquiry at a later date.\nThis understanding is clearly reflected in the record, including in the following exchange between a Court of Quebec judge and counsel for Mr. Archambault:\n\t[translation]\n\tBRIGITTE MARTIN:\nThe time of the request for a preliminary inquiry. And what I wanted to add is that once the accused reserves their election, because thats what he did, in the case of Mr. Agenor [Archambault], not just Mr. Agenor, but in the majority of cases, whats done at the appearance stage is to appear and reserve the election. And the purpose of reserving the election is to make an informed decision . . .\n\tTHE COURT:\nAh, I understand all of that.\n\tBRIGITTE MARTIN:\n. . . to examine . . .\n\tTHE COURT:\nOf course.\n\tBRIGITTE MARTIN:\n. . . to examine the evidence. And what I wanted to put to you is that once that election is reserved, the possibility of making an election that will lead to a preliminary inquiry is reserved for them.\nSo if the election is reserved, well at that point, it follows that . . .\n\tTHE COURT:\nWell in fact, what youre arguing is a vested right. By reserving the election.\n\tBRIGITTE MARTIN:\nIts . . . youre ahead of me. Its a vested right.\n\tTHE COURT:\nExactly.\n\tBRIGITTE MARTIN:\nAnd that was Mr. Archambaults position, through what you were able to read in the arguments. But I still wanted to come back to this concept of reserving the right . . . [Emphasis added.]\n\t(A.R., vol. I, at pp. 17-18)\nTo be clear, I am not quoting this exchange as evidence of what actually occurred earlier, when Mr. Archambault reserved his election as to the mode of trial. Moreover, there is no disputing the fact that such exchanges between a judge and counsel are not binding on the court and do not constitute evidence in the strict sense. However, this exchange is an indication, drawn from the record before us, that at the time, the parties, counsel and the judge concerned all understood that the reservation had been approved by the court in keeping with the established practice.\nIt is true that the judge did not accept Mr. Archambaults argument, but this was because he was of the view that even an accused with a vested right lost their right to a preliminary inquiry when s. 535 Cr. C. came into force, given that the judge had held that the provision applied with immediate effect. Indeed, while the Court of Quebec judge recognized that reserving the right to elect the mode of trial could result in a vested right to request a preliminary inquiry, he adopted an interpretation of s. 535 Cr. C. that denied Mr. Archambault the benefit of such an inquiry. According to the judge, who relied on R. v. Lamoureux, 2019 QCCQ 6616, the right to request a preliminary inquiry is purely procedural, such that the new s. 535 Cr. C. applied with immediate effect, an interpretation that Karakatsanis J. rightly rejects. That being so, the question of whether a vested right exists, in accordance with Puskas and on the basis of Mr. Archambaults decision to reserve his election, remains an open one. Although the question has become factually moot in this case, this does not alter the importance of answering it for the benefit of other individuals who might find themselves in the same situation as the respondents.\nAccording to this understanding of reserving the election as to the mode of trial, which is an understanding I adopt, the effect of a reservation authorized by the court is to preserve the accuseds rights pursuant to the rule stated in Puskas. All of the conditions precedent to the holding of a preliminary inquiry are indeed fulfilled when the election is reserved: the accused receives the courts assurance that they can make a request at a later date and, by the terms of s. 535 Cr. C., that request must be honoured. The accuseds legal situation is therefore tangible, concrete and sufficiently constituted at that time (P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at Nos. 619-20, citing, among others, Dikranian, at paras. 37 et seq.). These criteria serve to distinguish the vested rights of the respondents in this case from what would be mere expectations. Reserving the right to elect the mode of trial is thus different from where the accused simply puts off their election without a judicial undertaking that entails the preservation of their rights. Moreover, the effectiveness of reserving the election as to the mode of trial does not turn on the fact that certain accused persons, having received this assurance from the court, were or were not represented by counsel at the time, which could create an injustice for a class of accused persons who nevertheless face the same potential deprivation of liberty.\nIt remains true that, by assuring the accused that a request for a preliminary inquiry can be made at a later date, the fact of reserving the right to elect the mode of trial ensures that all of the conditions precedent are fulfilled within the meaning of Puskas. It may well be that other local practices have the same effect. It is equally possible that the Court of Appeal for Ontario was correct to find in R. v. R.S., 2019 ONCA 906, that the right to a preliminary inquiry cannot vest until the accused has made a request to that effect in that province. However, this does not take away from the fact that, in Quebec, this right vests each time a court agrees to reserve an accuseds right to elect their mode of trial, in keeping with the standard practices. I wish to make clear that this must not be seen as a special rule for Quebec, but only as a reflection of the application of Puskas to a legitimate procedure used in part of the country.\nI would add that to conclude otherwise could lead to injustices and undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. The respondents relied on the assurance that they each obtained from the court on the basis of a well-established local practice. The respondents relied  to their detriment  on the local practice of reserving their rights, with the courts approval. It is true that the respondents will not actually suffer any injustice, since the appeal is moot as far as they are concerned. However, I am mindful that other individuals  the numbers are of course uncertain  could find themselves in the same situation. In my opinion, public confidence in the administration of justice and in the rule of law might well be undermined if accused persons  especially those whose liberty is at stake  cannot rely on the assurances they receive from the very court that administers the proceedings brought against them. The Crown may be right in arguing that the amendment of s. 535 Cr. C. is a change that [translation] should have been anticipated and caught no one by surprise (A.F., at para. 88), but accused persons in Quebec who believed that their right was reserved will surely be caught by surprise if they later discover that this right has been taken away from them despite the assurances they received. Nonetheless, I would add that my interpretation of s. 535 Cr. C. and of its impact on vested rights is based on the application of Puskas and not solely on the observation that an injustice could result from a contrary interpretation. In other words, the question at the heart of this appeal remains the interpretation of what constitutes a vested right following the amendment to s. 535 Cr. C., a question that was settled in Puskas.\nHowever, I also hasten to note that, given Parliaments silence regarding the application of s. 535 Cr. C. to existing situations, interpreting the new legislation on the basis of presumptions would face a second difficulty. The fact is that authors warn the courts against interpreting new legislation in a manner that may cause injustice. Pierre-Andre Cote has written that [translation] the courts try to reserve protection from the application of the new legislation for those who would actually be prejudiced by its application, that is, those whose expectations based on the former legislation have had practical consequences, have led them to take specific actions, to compromise themselves, to change their situation (Le juge et les droits acquis en droit public canadien (1989), 30 C. de D. 359, at p. 419).\nHere, the purpose of reducing the number of preliminary inquiries that Parliament seeks to advance should not have a disproportionately unjust impact on accused persons like Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault, given the absence of a transitional provision for existing situations. In a context analogous to that of this case, authors Cote and Devinat explain as follows:\n\t[translation] However, denying the existence of vested rights and opting for the immediate application of the new legislation also has its share of disadvantages for individuals or, to state matters otherwise, involves individual costs that may be very high. The life of the law needs a degree of stability in order to develop: legal reform, if not carried out gradually, can entail serious prejudice for individuals. The perception of injustice in relation to affected individuals weighs heavily in the judicial determination of whether it is appropriate for the former legislation to survive.\n\t(No. 614, quoting Ciecierski v. Fenning, 2005 MBCA 52, 258 D.L.R. (4th) 103, at para. 31, per Steel J.A. (The presumption against interference with vested rights is not as weighty as the presumption against retroactivity and the question of unfairness is a critical component); see also R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  25.13.)\nIn this case, both of the accused reserved their right at the time of their respective first appearance before the Court of Quebec, and thus before September 19, 2019, when the new s. 535 Cr. C. came into force. They were therefore governed by the former s. 535 Cr. C., which recognized their right to request a preliminary inquiry. In the circumstances, I am of the view that they could request a preliminary inquiry.\nBefore concluding, I would add the following. It is apparent that this practice, which was followed in this case by the two respondents, may not be ideal in light of the time limits imposed by R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. As the Crown noted before this Court, [translation] it is a practice that is certainly a source of problems in that it results in significant delays. If you look at the number of times, for example, that these cases here were postponed pro forma without any decision having been made, without the judge putting the accused to an election, it can be seen here that there was a postponement, a postponement and no decision that was made in each instance (transcript, at p. 18). Given its impact on court delays, it might be appropriate to rethink the wisdom of the practice of reserving the right to elect the mode of trial in the future.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tMartin J. \nOverview\nParliaments decision to remain silent about when many provisions in former Bill C-75, An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 25 (2019 Amendments), apply has created considerable legal uncertainty across all levels of court (see R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, at paras. 86-87). This is the second time this Court has been asked to provide clarity on the temporal application of amendments introduced by this Act. The first time, in Chouhan, a majority of this Court determined that the Acts changes to the jury selection process were procedural in nature and could therefore apply retrospectively (paras. 103, 109 and 124).\nHowever, in this case, my colleagues and I agree that the amendments at issue, which restrict preliminary inquiry eligibility only to offences attracting a maximum punishment of at least 14 years, are not purely procedural and instead can affect an accuseds substantive legal interests. Accused persons no longer entitled to preliminary inquiries under the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C46 (Cr. C.), have lost the opportunity to be discharged at the close of a preliminary inquiry should the evidence prove insufficient to order the accused to stand trial. This loss is significant as a discharge usually puts an early end to criminal liability for those charges. A discharge will also often mean that there will be no trial at all, or that the accused will be released from custody pending trial or relieved from restrictive pre-trial release conditions (Karakatsanis J.s reasons, at para. 158). \nIn light of Parliaments failure to legislate on the timing of these amendments, the judicial task is to determine when the new s. 535 applies based on the principles and presumptions concerning the temporal application of legislation, as well as the values of fairness, rule of law and reasonable reliance they protect. This task must be approached with the interests of justice top of mind. \nThe parties and the courts below proposed different points in time for the application of the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code: \nthe date of the alleged offence (argued by the respondents Agenor Archambault and Gilles Grenier, and accepted by the Court of Appeal of Quebec); \nthe date of the accuseds first appearance (an alternative argument raised by Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier, and addressed by the Court of Appeal of Quebec); and \nthe date the accused requests a preliminary inquiry (argued by the Crown, and adopted by my colleague Karakatsanis J.). \nMy colleagues Cote and Rowe JJ. prefer the date on which the charge is laid and Kasirer J. suggests that any vesting must take into account if and when the accused reserves their right to request a preliminary inquiry at a future date.\nTo some extent, all of these possibilities represent reasonable alternatives and have their respective benefits and drawbacks. None of these possibilities offers a perfect answer. In my view, however, the date of the offence is the preferable option.\nThe date of the offence best protects the accuseds ability to have a preliminary inquiry, and in turn, potentially to be discharged, released from pre-trial custody, or relieved from onerous bail conditions. It is a principled choice that is consistent with the time ordinarily used as a reference point for legislative changes made to the availability of ancillary orders, constituent elements of offences, applicable maximum sentences, and legal defences to criminal charges (see R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at paras. 1-3; R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 45; R. v. Dineley, 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, at paras. 18-20). It reflects that the accused persons interests at stake are significant and carry great weight in the interpretative exercise. Further, it does not subject these interests to a determination of when, why, or how the Crown decides to prosecute a charge, or the many factors that may influence the timing of an accuseds choice as to their mode of trial. It also establishes a bright-line rule that operates fairly and consistently across the country, irrespective of regional differences in procedure. \nAccordingly, I see no basis to interfere with the decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec holding that the entitlement to the preliminary inquiry attaches to the offence date, and I would dismiss the appeal. Accused persons alleged to have committed an offence that rendered them eligible for a preliminary inquiry before September 19, 2019, the date on which the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code came into force, should retain that eligibility today. I agree with my colleague Karakatsanis J. that going forward, under s. 535, an accused is only eligible for a preliminary inquiry if they personally face a maximum punishment of 14 years or greater. \nAnalysis\nThe New Section 535 of the Code Impacts Substantive Rights\nI agree that limiting the availability of the preliminary inquiry can interfere with the accuseds substantive rights and is not purely procedural. An accused who is no longer entitled to a preliminary inquiry under the new s. 535 loses the substantive right to be discharged at the close of the preliminary inquiry, if the Crown does not meet the required threshold to order the accused to stand trial (Cr. C., s. 548(1)(b); R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at para. 33; R. v. R.S., 2019 ONCA 906, at paras. 47-58). \nA discharge will issue following a preliminary inquiry when, on the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is made out to put the accused on trial for the offence charged or any other indictable offence in respect of the same transaction (Cr. C., s. 548(1)(b)). A discharge cannot be appealed and is reviewable only for certiorari: . . . the reviewing court should only intervene where the preliminary inquiry judge committed a jurisdictional error (R. v. Sazant, 2004 SCC 77, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 635, at para. 14). Other than certiorari, if the Crown wishes to proceed with the charges against the accused, its only option is to prefer an indictment under s. 577 of the Criminal Code, which requires the personal written consent of either the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General. Aside from these two narrow avenues to continue the proceedings, being discharged at the close of the preliminary inquiry effectively ends the criminal case against the accused.\nIn my view, the loss of the possibility of being discharged at the close of a preliminary inquiry is significant. Although not a perfect analogy, it approximates the loss of a legal defence, which the majority in Dineley held affected the substantive and constitutional rights of the accused (paras. 18-21; see also Angus v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co., [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256, at pp. 266-67). Dineley considered a legislative change to the Criminal Code that eliminated access to the Carter defence in impaired driving cases, which had formerly allowed the accused to rely on an expert opinion to argue that the amount of alcohol consumed was inconsistent with the breathalyzer test results. A majority of the Court in Dineley held that removing this defence affected the accuseds substantive rights and therefore the legislative change applied prospectively only. Just as mounting a successful Carter defence would often have left a trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to the accuseds criminal responsibility prior to the change, being discharged at the close of a preliminary inquiry, in most cases, will end the criminal case against the accused on those charges (see paras. 17-18; Arcuri, at paras. 20-21). \nThe impact of the amendments on the accuseds constitutionally protected interests must also be considered in determining whether the legislation affects the accuseds substantive rights. In Dineley, this Court considered that [w]hen constitutional rights are affected, the general rule against the retrospective application of legislation should apply (para. 21 (emphasis added); see also Chouhan, at para. 93). The respondents in this case make no claim that the removal of this screening mechanism violated rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, they argue that the impact of its loss on the accuseds substantive legal interests, which include constitutionally protected interests, must be considered when interpreting this new legislation to determine when and to whom it applies. \nAlthough this Court in R. v. S.J.L., 2009 SCC 14, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 426, held that the accused does not have a constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry, the question of whether legislation is constitutional is distinct from the question of its temporal application (paras. 21-22; see also R.S., at para. 55). In determining the temporal application of legislation, the lack of a formal finding of unconstitutionality does not prevent a court from considering whether the accuseds constitutionally protected interests may be affected by the change in the law. In other words, an amendment to a provision like s. 535 may affect a Charter right in the substantive manner required to give rise to the presumption against retrospectivity without there being an actual infringement of the implicated Charter right.\nFor example, Dineley did not involve a constitutional challenge to the legislative changes to the Carter defence. It was in the companion case of R. v. St-Onge Lamoureux, 2012 SCC 57, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 187, that the majority of this Court held that the amendments infringed neither s. 7 nor s. 11(c) of the Charter. While the Court held that the amendments did infringe s. 11(d) of the Charter, it found that the infringement of s. 11(d) was justified under s. 1 (para. 101). Nevertheless, despite not having found a constitutional violation in St-Onge Lamoureux, when considering the temporal application of the amendments in Dineley, the Court emphasized that the amendments intersected with the presumption of innocence and that the constitutional, and therefore necessarily substantive, rights of the accused were affected (Dineley, at paras. 20-21).\nEliminating the possibility of a discharge at the close of the preliminary inquiry may also affect the accuseds constitutionally protected interests. The opportunity to obtain a timely judicial evaluation of the Crowns case, and to be discharged should that case prove insufficient, implicates an accuseds rights to liberty and security of the person under s. 7 of the Charter, especially for those in custody pending trial or on stringent bail terms (R.S., at para. 52). Even where a discharge is ordered in respect of only some charges, the accuseds jeopardy is reduced accordingly, which may lead to loosening their bail conditions or to their pre-trial release from detention (R.S., at para. 58; Cr. C., s. 523(2)(b)). This, in turn, may cause the Crown to revisit the strength of the remaining case against the accused, thereby opening avenues for plea negotiations or withdrawals of other charges. \nFurther, the paramount purpose [of the preliminary inquiry] is to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the process (R. v. Hynes, 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at para. 30, citing Skogman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93, at p. 105). A preliminary inquiry is a pre-trial screening mechanism and does not determine guilt (S.J.L., at para. 21). Nevertheless, a case ought not proceed to trial without meeting the low threshold for an order to stand trial  meaning there is no evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty (Arcuri, at paras. 20-21; see also United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080). \nIn summary, limiting the availability of the preliminary inquiry is not purely procedural; it affects the accuseds substantive rights. \nThe Proper Interpretive Approach for Legislation That Affects Substantive Rights\nGiven the need for certainty as to the legal consequences that attach to past facts and conduct, courts have long recognized that the cases in which legislation has retrospective effect must be exceptional (Dineley, at para. 10). As thoroughly discussed by some of my colleagues, the case law and the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, provide legal presumptions which guide the interpretation of legislation when Parliament has failed to clearly set out its temporal application (see also Dineley; Chouhan, at paras. 86-87; R. v. Puskas, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207, at paras. 5-7; Dikranian v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530, at paras. 29-40). I will focus on two presumptions which apply to legislation that affects an accuseds substantive rights. \nThe first is the presumption against the retrospective application of legislation affecting substantive legal interests. This presumption is clearly reflected in this Courts most recent jurisprudence on the temporal application of amendments to the Criminal Code. The guiding principle is that new legislation that affects substantive rights is presumed to apply prospectively, absent clear legislative intent otherwise. New legislation that deals with procedure will also not apply immediately if, in its application, it affects substantive rights (Dineley, at paras. 10-11; Chouhan, at paras. 87 and 91). \nThe second is the presumption against interfering with vested rights. This presumption frequently arises in the civil context, for example, when discussing the inability of legislation to interfere with rights already accrued under contract (see, e.g., Dikranian, at para. 32; see also R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at pp. 762-63). In criminal cases, this Courts jurisprudence on vested rights has previously required that a right-holder be able to actually exercise the right and that the eventual accrual [be] certain, and not conditional on future events (see, e.g., Puskas, at para. 14). \nThere is a difference of opinion as to which pre-amendment criminal cases  and which accused  these two presumptions protect. I analyze the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code based on the approach articulated and applied in Dineley, this Courts most recent authority concerning the temporal application of legislation which affects substantive interests. Dineley makes clear that in order to engage the presumption against retrospectivity, it is sufficient that the legislation affects substantive rights. While Chouhan came later and addressed the changes to the jury selection procedures under the 2019 Amendments, a majority in that case applied the presumption that procedural law applies retrospectively. The majority was not concerned with, and did not address, the framework of analysis for amendments which affect substantive rights (para. 103).\nConversely, in Dineley, which involved a substantive right and not a purely procedural one, a majority of this Court held that legislative amendments that eliminated the availability of the Carter defence in impaired driving cases applied prospectively, as of the date of the offence. In doing so, the majority explicitly set out the governing test for legislation that affects substantive rights. In describing the rules of interpretation that can be helpful in identifying the situations to which new legislation applies, the Court explained at para. 10 that: \nMore specifically, where legislative provisions affect either vested or substantive rights, retrospectivity has been found to be undesirable. New legislation that affects substantive rights will be presumed to have only prospective effect unless it is possible to discern a clear legislative intent that it is to apply retrospectively. However, new procedural legislation designed to govern only the manner in which rights are asserted or enforced does not affect the substance of those rights. Such legislation is presumed to apply immediately to both pending and future cases. [Citations omitted.]\nThe above represents this Courts most recent statement concerning the timing of amendments that affect substantive rights. Overall, Dineley stands for two key propositions that directly impact my conclusion on the outcome of this appeal. \nEither Substantive or Vested Rights Will Trigger the Presumption Against Retrospectivity\nWriting for the majority in Dineley, Deschamps J. stated there would be no retrospectivity when the legislative provisions affect either vested or substantive rights (para. 10). On its face, this is a disjunctive requirement built upon the separate existence of the two presumptions noted above. The express inclusion of the word either can only mean that the presence of one or the other engages the presumption against retrospectivity. This either-or formulation is based upon, reflects, and best respects the separate existence of these two presumptions. While some amendments may affect both substantive and vested rights, in employing this clear language, the Court in Dineley conveyed that either of these two avenues is available to a claimant seeking to have legislation apply prospectively only. \nDissenting in Dineley, Cromwell J. was of the view that the amendments were purely procedural and therefore applied retrospectively. Nevertheless, his reasons also identify the two presumptions as distinct and refer to them as substantive or vested rights, effectively positioning them as two alternative paths to reaching the same result (see, e.g., paras. 46, 52 and 54-55).\nFurther, the majority in Dineley treated its conclusion that the amendments affected substantive rights as fully dispositive of the appeal. Paragraph 10 of Dineley, cited above, largely references legislation that affects substantive rights, with little discussion of the second presumption relating to vested rights. Once Deschamps J. found that the elimination of a defence affected the accuseds substantive rights, she did not consider it necessary to conduct a subsequent, separate analysis of whether the defence had somehow vested or accrued in the accused (Puskas, at paras. 6 and 14). The majority canvassed other relevant decisions on the temporal application of legislation without ever referencing the need for vesting. The majority did not even cite to Puskas and it cannot simply be assumed that they somehow neglected to do so. A more compelling explanation is that the majority did not need to refer to Puskas, because the impact on substantive interests alone was sufficient to allow the Court to conclude that the legislation could not apply retrospectively. \nThus, in my view, Dineley makes clear that legislation which affects either vested or substantive rights offers two alternative routes to the presumption of prospective application (para. 10 (emphasis added); see also I.F. (Canadian Civil Liberties Association), at paras. 23-28). As a result, once there has been a finding that the substantive rights of the accused are affected, it is unnecessary to impose the additional requirement that those rights must also have somehow vested or accrued to the accused. \nThe majoritys approach in Dineley is also complementary and consistent with this Courts decision in Dikranian, in which the Court held that new legislation modifying certain rules concerning interest for student loan payments did not apply retrospectively based on the presumption against interfering with vested rights (Dikranian, at paras. 32-40 and 49-54). Just as the majority in Dineley did not consider whether the substantive right to a legal defence had also vested in the accused, the Court in Dikranian did not consider whether the interest rate entitlement under the old regime was a substantive right or a procedural one. The simple explanation for why the Court did not analyze both presumptions in either case is that it did not have to: either one, standing alone, was sufficient to trigger the presumption of prospective application, which was not rebutted in either case. \nI therefore do not think it is necessary to also show that any substantive interest the legislation affects must also have vested in the accused before the presumption against retrospectivity can apply. There is no need to combine or collapse the presumption against retrospectivity where substantive rights are affected and the presumption against interfering with vested rights because they have distinct purposes and separate spheres of application. They may share the goal of protecting people who have relied on the state of law prior to the amendments, but in my view, courts should preserve the independent integrity of each. Although in some cases these presumptions may arise together, there will equally be some interferences with substantive interests that do not qualify as interference with a vested right, or for which the idea of vesting may create theoretical or practical problems, or even generate unfairness. The separate definitions and distinct roles of the presumption against retrospectivity and the presumption against interference with vested rights has been recognized in the jurisprudence, in legislation and by legal scholars (see, e.g., Interpretation Act, s. 43(b) to (e); R. Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed. 2016), at p. 342; see also pp. 357-61 and 363; Sullivan (2022), at pp. 726-27 and 729-30).\nIn my view, Dineley is most closely analogous to the case before us. Both the repeal of the Carter defence in Dineley and the amendments to preliminary inquiry eligibility in this case eliminated one way in which the criminal charges could be resolved in the accuseds favour and implicated the accuseds constitutionally protected interests. Puskas, which concerned the elimination of the accuseds right of appeal to this Court without leave after a lower court of appeal had overturned their acquittal at trial, is a different type of case (para. 1). While the amendment in Puskas affected the accuseds substantive rights, it did not implicate the accuseds constitutionally protected interests. Removing a right to appeal at the last possible stage in a criminal case is not the same as taking away a substantive legal defence at trial (Dineley) or the choice of whether to have a preliminary inquiry  matters which are not only substantive but also implicate the accuseds constitutional rights. \nThe nature of the entitlement in Puskas depended upon four preconditions. The specificity of these preconditions is perhaps one reason why it has only been cited twice by this Court (see Dineley, at para. 72, per Cromwell J., dissenting; R. v. R.V., 2021 SCC 10, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 131, at para. 76). The right to appeal to this Court, which the amendments limited in Puskas, could only have arisen after: (1) the accused had been charged with an indictable offence; (2) the accused had been acquitted at trial; (3) the accuseds conviction had been reversed on appeal; and (4) a new trial had been ordered (para. 15). In that particular context, where there were legal preconditions necessary before the particular right to appeal could even arise, it made some sense for the Court to focus on vesting and ensuring that all conditions precedent had been met (para. 15). I do not read dicta from that case as creating a general requirement that all substantive rights must also have vested before legislative amendments must be presumed to apply prospectively.\nIn any event, if a vesting of the substantive right is also required, it should be characterized sufficiently broadly to ensure that rigid legal characterizations and formalities are not favoured over fairness and an accuseds substantive interests (see Sullivan (2016), at p. 365; Sullivan (2022), at pp. 735-36). Any dispute over whether what must vest in this case is the right to a preliminary inquiry or the right to request to have a preliminary inquiry should be resolved to best respect fairness to an accused. A substantive legal interest that intersects with, implicates or affects constitutional rights, does not depend on the fulfilment of future conditions precedent in order to bear on the analysis. In respect of the constitutional rights at play in this matter, s. 7 Charter rights are held by [e]veryone and s. 11 protects [a]ny person charged with an offence. \nGiven the significance of the preliminary inquiry and the possibility of a discharge to the accused, it appears unjust to require the fulfilment of all statutory prerequisites to render the accrual of that right certain, including to require that the accused actually have exercised that choice themselves. As noted by my colleague Kasirer J., public confidence in the administration of justice should not be compromised (para. 93).\nIn sum, where Parliament is silent as to the temporal application of an amendment to criminal legislation, a determination that such an amendment affects the substantive rights of the accused will normally be sufficient to conclude that the legislation applies prospectively. This conclusion considers the actual impact of the impugned legislation on the accuseds interests and underscores how courts should protect as fully as possible both the substantive and vested rights of those affected by changes in legislation. It also reflects the animating principles behind the presumption against retrospectivity  fairness and the rule of law  and is consistent with the rule that cases departing from such a presumption must be exceptional (Dineley, at para. 10; see also K.R.J., at para. 25; Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289, at para. 45). Treating substantive rights and vested rights as two distinct concepts and giving full effect to each presumption in no way limits Parliaments capacity to legislate. Subject to constitutional challenges to the legislation itself, rebutting the presumption of prospective application of new legislation that affects substantive or vested rights will often simply require Parliament to stipulate its intent in express terms. When Parliament does not do so, it also understands that the courts will rely upon the jurisprudence on temporal application to aid in the interpretation of its legislation. \nIf the Accuseds Substantive Rights Are Affected, the Date of the Offence Should Govern \nSecond, I also rely on Dineley for the proposition that new criminal legislation will apply as of the date of the offence if it affects an accuseds substantive legal interests (para. 18). The question before the Court in Dineley was whether the amendments at issue applied retrospectively, that is, to conduct which occurred before the Amendments came into force (para. 3 (emphasis added)). The Court held that the amendments did not apply retrospectively and instead applied prospectively only, meaning to conduct occurring only after the amendments came into force (Dineley, at paras. 3 and 25). The temporal application of amendments therefore hinged on the date of the impugned conduct  or the date of the alleged offence. \nSimilarly, because the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code affects the accuseds substantive rights, and in turn because it must apply prospectively only, the date of the offence should govern its temporal application. Although the Court of Appeal of Quebec took a somewhat different reasoning path, it ultimately decided that the entitlement to the preliminary inquiry attaches to the date of the offence, and I see no reason to interfere with that conclusion. \nThe court below duly focused on the impact on the accused in determining the temporal application of the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code (2022 QCCA 1170, 84 C.R. (7th) 174, at para. 11). With reference to this Courts decision in Dineley, as well as the Ontario Court of Appeals decision in R.S., the court considered that the temporal application of a legislative amendment depends not on a formal and categorical distinction between procedural and substantive law but on a functional assessment [of] whether the amendment affects an acquired right or interest (para. 26, citing Dineley and R.S.). The key question to be determined, in its view, was whether the effect of an amendment is to create a negligible or significant risk to a party in the range of possible outcomes in a proceeding as a result of forced compliance with the amendment or voluntary reliance upon it (C.A. reasons, at para. 29). In other words, the more significant the impact on the party affected, the stronger the argument for prospective application. This reasoning is sound, well supported by this Courts jurisprudence, and properly reflective of the concrete impact of the legislation on the individuals most affected by it (see also Sullivan (2016), at p. 365; Sullivan (2022), at pp. 735-36). \nTo the extent I would depart from the reasoning of the court below, it is with respect to its finding that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry vested or accrued as of the date of the accuseds first appearance (paras. 11 and 39-40). For the reasons discussed above, having found that the offence date was the appropriate reference point in light of the impact of the amendment on the accused, in my respectful view, it was unnecessary to turn to a further assessment of whether and when the right vested. In any event, the right to have a preliminary inquiry could be said to have also vested on the date of the offence. \nI add that the offence date remains preferable for a variety of reasons. It is a feature common to all criminal files. It is independent of any given procedure such as the accuseds first appearance, and thus adaptable to potential regional differences in criminal procedure across the country. It is also attuned to the reality of delays or variables that may arise throughout the course of the criminal process, at no fault of the accused. \nImportantly, the date of the offence is the same across Canada and is not subject to significant variations in procedure, at the first appearance or otherwise, depending on the province or territory. For example, while the respondents before us were able to formally reserve their right to a preliminary inquiry at their first appearances given local practice in Quebec, in other jurisdictions, the first appearance may allow for no such option (I.F. (Attorney General of Ontario), at paras. 13-14; see also oral submissions of the Criminal Lawyers Association (Ontario), transcript, at p. 115). Determining the temporal application of the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code requires a solution that applies consistently across the country. The accuseds substantive rights should not be dependent on or shaped by regional differences in procedure, especially when it may result in unfairness. \nIn my view, the accuseds request is not the preferable time as it is, under recent versions of the Criminal Code, the final procedural step that must take place to ensure they can exercise their right to a preliminary inquiry. However, that does not mean such a request is necessary for that right to have been initially acquired by the accused, with the choice to exercise it at a later stage in the proceedings. Furthermore, such an analysis would not align well with some of s. 535s pre-2004 iterations, which imposed a mandatory preliminary inquiry. For certain historical offences committed under previous versions of the Criminal Code, there may be no request to mark the time the right was acquired. Additionally, the possibility that the Crown may proceed summarily on a hybrid charge, or that the accused may ultimately elect trial in the provincial court, does not mean the accused never acquired the right to a preliminary inquiry. The right may no longer exist from that point forward, but this does not make its existence in the first place conditional on the accuseds request. I note that this rationale is in fact consistent with Puskas, in which the final condition precedent associated with the accuseds right to appeal was that the court of appeal below had ordered a new trial. The accused was not required to actually exercise his right  i.e., by filing a notice of appeal  in order to have acquired it (para. 15). \nI would add this: in my respectful view, when a change in the law deprives the accused of a substantive right and Parliament is silent as to the temporal application of that change, it is hard to see why a court should insist that accused persons must act in a particular manner to preserve that right. In this case, requiring an actual request for a preliminary inquiry in order to remain entitled to one after September 19, 2019, has significant consequences for the accused, which run against the animating principle of fairness that guides the presumption against retrospectivity (K.R.J., at para. 25; Tran, at para. 45). Namely, there is a risk that the accused will be forced to choose between their right to a preliminary inquiry, and their right to make a free and fully informed election. \nThe accuseds ability to request a preliminary inquiry is, in all provinces and territories other than Nunavut, intrinsically linked to their election as to mode of trial. An accused who elects trial in the superior court, either by judge alone or by judge and jury, may be eligible for a preliminary inquiry, whereas an accused who elects trial in the provincial court is not (see Cr. C., ss. 536(2) and 536.1(2)). In turn, the accuseds election as to mode of trial has been recognized as one of the most fundamental decisions they can make in their case  often considered, along with how to plead and whether to testify, as one of few decisions so important that the accuseds counsel cannot make it on their behalf (R. v. White, 2022 SCC 7, at para. 5; R. v. W. (R.), 2023 ONCA 250, 167 O.R. (3d) 1, at paras. 20-21, citing G. A. Martin, The Role and Responsibility of the Defence Advocate (1970), 12 Crim. L.Q. 376, at pp. 387-88). \nGiven the significance of the election, the accused should be free to make it without fear of potentially jeopardizing other rights. As the Court of Appeal of Quebec held, to suggest that a failure to formalize an election or request until after September 19, 2019, diminishes the accuseds entitlement to a preliminary inquiry would eviscerate the election of its content [and imperil] a variety of entitlements, including the right to choose trial by judge and jury or judge alone and, if the latter, at which level of court that trial will occur (para. 37). The accused should also, within the limits expressly set out in the Criminal Code, in rules of court and by individual justices, remain in control of the timing of their own election, which in turn may be subject to a range of considerations. For example, in the context of s. 11(b) of the Charter, accused persons may be entitled to hold off on electing the mode of trial if they have not yet received sufficient disclosure to enable them to make a fully informed decision  a problem that, at its core, may in fact overlap with the same delay-related concerns Parliament intended to address with the amendment to s. 535 (see, e.g., R. v. L. (L.), 2023 ONCA 52, 166 O.R. (3d) 561, at paras. 15-18). Indeed, this Court in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, noted that timely requests for initial disclosure should be complied with so as to enable the accused sufficient time before election . . . to consider the information (p. 343 (emphasis added)). \nIf the accused, at first, elects a mode of trial that allows them to preserve their right to request a preliminary inquiry within a limited time, and then later wishes to re-elect to be tried by provincial court judge, in many cases their ability to do so is subject to the written consent of the Crown (Cr. C., s. 561(1)(a); R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 62). If the Crown refuses to consent, as the Criminal Code allows, a court may only review the scope of prosecutorial discretion when there is an abuse of process (see R.W., at para. 31, and references cited therein). Because the Crown is not required to provide reasons for its refusal, an abuse of process claim on this basis often proves extraordinarily difficult (para. 32, citing S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at 9.02). Therefore, an accused seeking to preserve their right to a preliminary inquiry by electing early risks locking themselves into that decision should the Crown refuse to consent to a re-election down the road. The unfairness of this situation, which is to the accuseds detriment, give me great pause about grounding the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry on the accused having made a request prior to September 19, 2019. Nor does the 90-day notice period between when the amendments received royal assent and when they came into effect alleviate these concerns. Without suggesting that, in some cases, ignorance of the law should be an excuse or defence, the reality is that despite efforts by Parliament and the government to publicize the amendments, many accused persons may not actually have learned of the change, particularly if they were self-represented. Mere knowledge that the law will be changing is also of little assistance to an accused holding off on their election for valid, unrelated reasons. Such an accused would remain in the same undesirable position described above of having to choose between preserving their entitlement to a preliminary inquiry, and making a free and fully informed election as to mode of trial. Finally, the notice provided would simply have communicated that the law would be changing on September 19, 2019. It would not have specifically communicated that the accused had to request a preliminary inquiry before that date in order to claim the protections of the old regime.\nThe offence date is neither insufficiently concrete nor overly speculative as a reference point. The fact that the accused may not ultimately be charged with the offence does not prevent other substantive entitlements from attaching to the offence date. For example, in addition to defences to criminal charges as this Court determined in Dineley, the applicable maximum punishment is also determined with reference to the offence date, subject to the entitlement to the lesser punishment if it has changed between the date of the offence and sentencing under s. 11(i) of the Charter (see, e.g., R. v. Stuckless, 2019 ONCA 504, 146 O.R. (3d) 752, at para. 93; R. v. Fones, 2012 MBCA 110, 288 Man. R. (2d) 86, at para. 60; L.L. v. R., 2016 QCCA 1367, at paras. 134 and 150 (CanLII); K.R.J., at para. 25). Furthermore, by the time a court is in a position to determine whether an accused is eligible for a preliminary inquiry, the accused has indeed been charged  transforming what was once a mere possibility into a concrete reality, with plain consequences for an accused who is deemed ineligible. \nSummary\nPreliminary inquiry eligibility following the 2019 Amendments should be determined based on the date of the alleged offence. Where the alleged offence date is prior to September 19, 2019, an accused who would have been eligible for a preliminary inquiry but for the amendments remains eligible, regardless of the applicable maximum punishment. As mentioned above, where the alleged offence date is on or after September 19, 2019, the accused must personally be facing a maximum punishment of at least 14 years imprisonment in order to be eligible for a preliminary inquiry under the new regime. \nHad Parliament intended this amendment to apply retrospectively, it was free to have said so expressly. Because Parliament chose to remain silent on this amendments temporal application, courts should interpret the amendment based on the relevant presumptions and their animating purposes. In this case, tying preliminary inquiry eligibility to the date of the alleged offence is preferable, both in principle and in practice. The rule this Court sets in respect of offences committed prior to the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code will involve a limited number of cases, which will reduce with the passage of time. \nAs Parliament continues to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction to legislate amendments to the Criminal Code, it would be well advised to clearly articulate the intended temporal application of those changes. Absent clear direction, when presented with a range of reasonable options, courts will prefer the one which best protects the accuseds substantive rights. \nDisposition\nI would dismiss the appeal.\n\tThe reasons of Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ. were delivered by\n\tKarakatsanis J.  \nOverview\nFaced with significant delays in criminal proceedings  threatening the right of accused persons to be tried within a reasonable time, and resulting in stays of criminal charges  Parliament sought to improve the efficiency of the justice system by eliminating preliminary inquiries for all but the most serious cases. This appeal raises two interpretative questions about the amendments. First, to which pre-existing criminal proceedings do they apply? Second, what is the scope of cases in which a preliminary inquiry remains available under the new rule?\nIn 2019, s. 535 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C46 (Cr. C.), was changed to restrict the availability of preliminary inquiries to accused persons charged with offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. Before the amendment, there was no condition related to the maximum penalty for the offences. There is no explicit transitional provision governing the temporal application of this amendment. Both immediately before and after the 2019 amendment, a preliminary inquiry was only available upon request by either the accused or the Crown. \nEach respondent before this Court was accused of one or more historical sexual offences against a child. After the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to 14 years imprisonment. Because the penalty for a criminal offence is presumed to be that in force when the offence was committed  and because of the guarantee under s. 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the lesser punishment  they are each liable to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. \nThe amendment of s. 535 came into effect a few months after the charges were laid and after the respondents first appeared in court. At each of their first appearances the respondents reserved their right to elect their mode of trial to a later date, meaning their election was postponed to a future appearance. Neither respondent requested a preliminary inquiry until months after the new s. 535 came into force. If the new rule applies to them, they must meet the condition that they be charged with an offence with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. \nThe Crowns position is that because the requests were not made before the new s. 535 came into force, the new rule applies. As the respondents were not charged with offences for which they could be personally liable to 14 years or more of imprisonment, the Crown says a preliminary inquiry was not available under that rule. In separate proceedings, the Court of Quebec and the Superior Court agreed and concluded that Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault had no right to a preliminary inquiry.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the appeals, remitting the files to the Court of Quebec for preliminary inquiries. It concluded that the respondents were not subject to the new limitation in s. 535 of the Criminal Code as amended because their entitlement to a preliminary inquiry arose on the commission of the alleged offences. Thus, they were entitled to request a preliminary inquiry under the provision as it read at that time, which did not restrict availability to those charged with offences punishable by 14 or more years imprisonment. The Court of Appeal declined to consider whether they would have had the right to a preliminary inquiry under s. 535 as it now reads. \nThe Crown appeals to this Court. My colleagues would dismiss the appeal. They conclude, for different reasons, that the new rule in s. 535 does not apply to the respondents. My colleague Justice Martin concludes, like the Court of Appeal, that the new rule does not apply because it came into force after the time of the alleged offences. My colleagues Justices Cote and Rowe conclude that the new rule does not apply because it came into force after the respondents had been charged with those offences. Finally, my colleague Justice Kasirer concludes that the new rule does not apply because it came into force after the respondents reserved their right to elect their mode of trial at first appearance. \nI am unable to agree with any of the positions advanced by my colleagues on the issue of temporal application. In my view, the correct interpretation of the new s. 535, firmly grounded in the applicable provisions of the Criminal Code, is that it applies to accused persons where no request for a preliminary inquiry was made prior to its coming into force. \nAssuming there are no constitutional constraints, the ultimate question when determining the temporal application of a new rule is whether the legislature intended it to apply in the circumstances. Ordinary principles of legislative interpretation may disclose legislative intent regarding whether the rule applies  for example where there are explicit transitional provisions. Where legislative intent is not clear, the jurisprudence has developed presumptions, now codified in the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, to guide courts in determining how Parliament has balanced the underlying legal values engaged by applying new law to circumstances that existed before that laws coming into force.\nHere, it is not immediately clear whether Parliament intended the amended s. 535 to apply to the respondents. Intent must therefore be determined in reference to the presumptions of temporal application. The relevant inquiry in determining the application of s. 535 can be summarized as follows: new rules are presumed not to apply where they interfere with a substantive legal interest that has vested before their coming into force. \nLimiting access to a preliminary inquiry can interfere with an accuseds opportunity to obtain a discharge, which is a substantive legal interest. Like the right to an appeal, and unlike merely evidentiary hearings in the criminal trial process, the opportunity to obtain a discharge could put an end to the risk of criminal liability. If successful, an accused person will not face the ordeal of an unjustified criminal trial, and may be freed from custody or restrictive conditions pending trial. These interests are not merely relevant to how an accused person conducts their criminal defence  they exist separately from that litigation and have a direct, immediate impact on the accuseds life outside the courtroom. I conclude this substantive legal interest only vests once a preliminary inquiry has been requested, given the statutory right is expressly conditioned on this request. Absent a request, the accused holds no statutory right to a preliminary inquiry. Thus, where there has been no request before it came into force, the new limitation can apply without interfering with a vested substantive legal interest.\nAs to the interpretation of the new limitation in s. 535, a preliminary inquiry is available only to an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment. In this context, the objective seriousness of the offence is determined by the maximum prison sentence the accused actually faces for the offence as charged, not the maximum penalty for an equivalent offence were it committed today. This interpretation is grounded in the ordinary meaning of the text, the broader context and Parliaments purpose of reducing the number of preliminary inquiries based on a clear criterion limiting eligibility.\nFor the reasons that follow, I conclude that a preliminary inquiry is only available to an accused person where either: a request was made before the coming into force of the amendment on September 19, 2019; or the accused actually faces criminal liability of 14 years imprisonment or more in respect of an indictable offence with which they are charged. The respondents had no right to a preliminary inquiry because they do not meet either criterion. I would therefore allow the appeal.\nBackground\nThe respondent Agenor Archambault was charged with committing, between the years 1958 and 1960, the historical crime of indecent assault against another male person, an indictable offence carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years (Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 148). The crime was repealed in 1983 (An Act to amend the Criminal Code in relation to sexual offences and other offences against the person and to amend certain other Acts in relation thereto or in consequence thereof, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 125, s. 8). \nThe respondent Gilles Grenier was charged with committing, between the years 2003 and 2007, the crimes of sexual interference and sexual assault against a person under 14, both hybrid offences which at the time carried a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years (Cr. C., ss. 151 and 271(1)(a) as they read before August 9, 2012). In 2015, Parliament raised the maximum imprisonment from 10 to 14 years (Tougher Penalties for Child Predators Act, S.C. 2015, c. 23, ss. 2 and 14).\nThe respondents first appeared in the Court of Quebec in the summer of 2019. At first appearance, they reserved or postponed their right to elect their mode of trial to a later date, and the matters were adjourned. Regarding Mr. Archambault, he agrees with the Crown that he had not yet elected his mode of trial at first appearance despite contrary findings below. \nOn September 19, 2019, the amendment to s. 535 came into force (An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 25 (2019 Amendments), ss. 238 and 406). While both respondents could have elected their mode of trial and requested a preliminary inquiry before that date, they had not yet done so. \nIn 2020, each respondent requested a preliminary inquiry. In both matters, the Crown argued that the Court of Quebec lacked jurisdiction under s. 535 to hold a preliminary inquiry.\nDecisions Below\nCourt of Quebec\nOn February 4, 2020, the Court of Quebec (per Rousseau J.C.Q.) held that it lacked jurisdiction to preside over Mr. Greniers preliminary inquiry. The court concluded that applying the new rule did not impact Mr. Greniers substantive rights because it was procedural. Mr. Grenier had no right to a preliminary inquiry under the new rule because the offences with which he was charged were punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. The court concluded the new rule therefore denied Mr. Grenier the right to a preliminary inquiry.\nOn December 21, 2020, the Court of Quebec (per Delisle J.C.Q.) dismissed Mr. Archambaults request for a preliminary inquiry for similar reasons. The court concluded that preliminary inquiries were of a purely procedural nature, as they could always be set aside should the prosecution decide to move forward by way of a direct indictment. \nSuperior Court of Quebec\nMr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault each challenged these decisions, applying to the Superior Court for certiorari and mandamus on two grounds. They argued first they had the right to a preliminary inquiry because the new rule in s. 535 did not apply to them. They said it would violate the presumption against retrospective application of legislation. Second, even if the new rule applied to them, they argued they nevertheless had the right to a preliminary inquiry, since the offences with which they were charged currently carry a liability of up to 14 years imprisonment.\nOn April 29, 2021, the Superior Court (2021 QCCS 1966, per Charbonneau J.) issued reasons for having dismissed Mr. Archambaults application, characterizing the right to a preliminary inquiry as purely procedural. Moreover, the court concluded that the new s. 535 required the accused to be charged with an offence for which they could be personally punishable by 14 years imprisonment or more. Thus, it did not apply to Mr. Archambault, given he benefited from the Charter protection under s. 11(i) that brings the maximum punishment for the offences below 14 years. Section 535 [translation] is unambiguous in that regard (para. 52 (CanLII)).\nOn May 4, 2021, the Superior Court (2021 QCCS 1876, per Thibault J.) dismissed Mr. Greniers application. As for the temporal application of the amendment to s. 535, the court relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. R.S., 2019 ONCA 906, and held preliminary inquiries affected an accuseds substantive right to a discharge. It concluded, however, that Mr. Greniers entitlement had not vested by the time the amendment to s. 535 came into force. To get the benefit of the old rule, he should have both elected his mode of trial and asked for a preliminary inquiry before September 19, 2019, the date the amendment came into force. \nCourt of Appeal of Quebec\nThe Court of Appeal released one set of reasons disposing of both appeals (2022 QCCA 1170, 84 C.R. (7th) 174). The court concluded that the new rule in s. 535 of the Criminal Code did not apply to Mr. Grenier and Mr. Archambault and that they were therefore each entitled to a preliminary inquiry. It allowed the appeals, finding it unnecessary to address whether they would have the right to preliminary inquiries under the new rule. \nWriting for a unanimous court, Healy J.A. (Vauclair and Hamilton JJ.A. concurring) interpreted the jurisprudence, including this Courts decision in R. v. Dineley, 2012 SCC 58, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, as holding that the temporal application of a legislative amendment does not depend on a formal and categorical distinction between procedural and substantive law but on a functional assessment whether the amendment affects an acquired right or interest (para. 26).\nIn his view, the analysis required an evaluation of the interests at stake as a result of the amendment (para. 26). The greater their significance, the more likely an amendment would apply on a prospective basis only. Here, the amendment would deprive the accused of the possibility of a discharge and the opportunity for enhanced disclosure under oath. Given these significant interests, the rights at stake were acquired from the moment of the commission of the offence and that was the relevant date for determining the entitlement to ask for a preliminary inquiry. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeals and remitted each file to the Court of Quebec for a preliminary inquiry.\nIssues\nFollowing the release of the Court of Appeals judgment, both respondents had the benefit of a preliminary inquiry. Thus, the Crowns appeal is moot (A.F., at para. 20). The Crown, however, obtained leave and asks this Court to address the important issues at stake given conflicting appellate court decisions interpreting s. 535 of the Criminal Code (para. 21). This Court has residual discretion to hear a moot appeal on the merits (R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 26; Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342). Given the disagreement between appellate courts on these issues of national importance and the fact that the issues raised have been fully argued by adversarial parties both here and in the courts below, it is in the interests of justice to address the appeal on the merits. \nThe parties raise two questions of law on this appeal, about the proper interpretation of the amended s. 535 of the Criminal Code:\nAre accused persons subject to the new rule, limiting eligibility for a preliminary inquiry, where no request for a preliminary inquiry was made before the coming into force of the new s. 535? \nI would answer yes. Accused persons are subject to the new limitation if a request for a preliminary inquiry was not made before its coming into force.\nAre preliminary inquiries available under the new s. 535 where an accused has been charged with an indictable offence for which they are not personally liable to imprisonment for 14 years or more, even though the offence, if committed today, would carry maximum liability of 14 years imprisonment?\nI would answer no. Under the amended provision, only those who are charged with an offence for which they actually face imprisonment of 14 years or more are entitled to a preliminary inquiry on request.\nAnalysis\nThe History and Availability of Preliminary Inquiries\nPreliminary inquiries have been part of the criminal process in Canada since before Confederation (Department of Justice of Canada, Working Document prepared by D. Pomerant and G. Gilmour, A Survey of the Preliminary Inquiry in Canada (April 1993), Annex D, at pp. 19-20). They trace their roots to procedures of criminal investigation in early English law, in which justices of the peace performed investigative or prosecutorial functions (pp. 2-4). Over time, the role of the justice of the peace has evolved considerably to take on judicial characteristics (Skogman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93, at pp. 105-6, citing Law Reform Commission of Canada, Study Report: Discovery in Criminal Cases (1974), at p. 8; see also pp. 64-65). \nThe preliminary inquiry primarily acts as a procedural safeguard  a screening mechanism to put an end to cases where the evidence is insufficient to order the accused to stand trial (R. v. Hynes, 2001 SCC 82, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 623, at para. 30, citing Caccamo v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 786; see also Patterson v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409, at p. 412, per Judson J.). Where the threshold is not met (Cr. C., s. 548(1)(a); R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at paras. 21-22), the justice must discharge the accused, ending criminal proceedings regarding that offence (Cr. C., s. 548(1)(b); see generally A. D. Gold and J. R. Presser, Lets Not Do Away with the Preliminaries: A Case in Favour of Retaining the Preliminary Inquiry (1996), 1 Can. Crim. L.R. 145, at pp. 147-48 and 164). \nAs this Court noted in Hynes, [o]ver time, the preliminary inquiry has assumed an ancillary role as a discovery mechanism (para. 31). Preliminary inquiries offer strategic benefits to the defence. They can be useful to test the evidence and gauge the strength of the Crowns case and to provide testimony on which to test credibility at trial (see, e.g., D. M. Paciocco, A Voyage of Discovery: Examining the Precarious Condition of the Preliminary Inquiry (2004), 48 Crim. L.Q. 151, at pp. 160-61; R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 40). The discovery function has, however, lost some of its significance given the Crowns constitutional disclosure obligations, following this Courts decision in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326 (R. v. S.J.L., 2009 SCC 14, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 426, at para. 23).\nIt is settled law that there is no constitutional right to a preliminary inquiry (S.J.L., at para. 21). This is because, even without it, the accused keeps the presumption of innocence and the right to make full answer and defence (R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at para. 32). The Crown must in all cases prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at the eventual trial. \nThe availability of a preliminary inquiry to an accused is grounded in statute. Before June 2004, the text of s. 535 of the Criminal Code read:  \n535 Where an accused who is charged with an indictable offence is before a justice, the justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into that charge and any other indictable offence, in respect of the same transaction, founded on the facts that are disclosed by the evidence taken in accordance with this Part.\nOver time, questions about the continuing utility and relevance of the preliminary inquiry (see generally J. A. Epp, Abolishing Preliminary Inquiries in Canada (1996), 38 Crim. L.Q. 495, at pp. 502-3) resulted in reforms reducing its availability. Criminal Code amendments made the preliminary inquiry available only on request and allowed for the narrowing of its focus (Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001, S.C. 2002, c. 13; see also Library of Parliament, Bill C-15A: An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to amend other Acts, Legislative Summary LS-410E, October 12, 2001, at pp. 13-15). These amendments have generally reduced the number of preliminary inquiries and their length (see S.J.L., at para. 24). As of June 2004, s. 535 made clear that the preliminary inquiry would be held only where it has been requested: \n535 If an accused who is charged with an indictable offence is before a justice and a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4) or 536.1(3), the justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into the charge and any other indictable offence, in respect of the same transaction, founded on the facts that are disclosed by the evidence taken in accordance with this Part.\nDespite these changes, concern continued to grow over delays in criminal proceedings, sparking further consideration of the need for preliminary inquiries. In R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, this Court specifically encouraged Parliament to consider the value of preliminary inquiries in light of expanded disclosure obligations to ensure the criminal process focusses on what is truly necessary to a fair trial (para. 140; see also Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Delaying Justice is Denying Justice: An Urgent Need to Address Lengthy Court Delays in Canada (Final Report) (2017), at pp. 47-48). \nIn that context, Parliament opted to reform preliminary inquiries to improve the efficiency of criminal proceedings, notably with the desire to unclog court resources, reduce delays, and to avoid the need for witnesses to testify twice (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 300, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 24, 2018, at p. 19604).\nSection 535 was changed in 2019 to eliminate preliminary inquiries except in the most serious cases. Since then, the availability of preliminary inquiries has been subject to an additional limitation related to the maximum penalty for the relevant offences:\n535 If an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment is before a justice and a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4) or 536.1(3), the justice shall, in accordance with this Part, inquire into the charge and any other indictable offence, in respect of the same transaction, founded on the facts that are disclosed by the evidence taken in accordance with this Part.\nThe amendment to s. 535 came into force on September 19, 2019, 90 days after the amending legislation received royal assent (2019 Amendments, ss. 238 and 406). This amendment is the focus of this appeal.\nDetermining Whether the New Rule Applies\nWhen Parliament provides no explicit transitional provisions, determining whether the new rules apply to a particular case can be challenging. The principles relating to the temporal application of legislation are sometimes in tension, and relationships between the presumptions that may apply to a situation can be unclear (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at pp. 724-25; P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at paras. 416-18; Canada (Attorney General) v. Almalki, 2016 FCA 195, [2017] 2 F.C.R. 44, at paras. 26-28). \nHere, lower courts have come to different solutions as to when the new restrictions apply. The Court of Appeal, citing difficulties in the application of the presumptions governing the temporal application of legislation, adopted an open-textured analysis focused on factors such as the importance of the amendment and the impact on the accused (paras. 26-31). Applying that analysis, it concluded that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is determined with reference to the state of the law at the date of the commission of the alleged offence (para. 11).\nSeveral courts across the country, including all four judges from the Court of Quebec and Superior Court in this case, have differed from the Court of Appeal in how they characterized the effect of the amendments and their temporal application (see, e.g., R.S.; R. v. B.J.M., 2021 BCPC 151; R. v. Lamoureux, 2019 QCCQ 6616; R. v. Kozak, 2019 ONSC 5979, 148 O.R. (3d) 396; R. v. A.S., 2019 ONCJ 655; R. v. N.F., 2019 ONCJ 656, 383 C.C.C. (3d) 550; R. v. Fraser, 2019 ONCJ 652; R. v. Corneillier, 2019 QCCQ 6028). Some courts have concluded that the s. 535 right to a preliminary inquiry is of a purely procedural nature such that the new limitation applies immediately in all cases (see, e.g., Lamoureux). Still others have found that although the amendment is not purely procedural, it only impacts substantive rights where a preliminary inquiry had been requested before the rule came into force, such that it applies where no request had been made (see, e.g., R.S.). \nAs I shall explain, a predictable approach to determining temporal application must clarify and build on the law interpreting the relevant presumptions developed in this Courts jurisprudence and codified by Parliament (Interpretation Act, ss. 43 and 44). I would clarify and summarize the relationship among the three presumptions relevant to the disposition of this appeal in line with the underlying legal values they engage, not abandon them.\nPrinciples Governing the Temporal Application of Legislation\nQuestions about the temporal application of legislation concern whether new legislative rules apply to a given circumstance or whether the previous state of the law continues to apply (Cote and Devinat, at paras. 341-42; see also Sullivan, at p. 770). \nUnderlying legal values like fairness and the rule of law may militate against applying new rules when to do so would negatively affect people who had reasonably relied on the previous state of the law in governing their affairs (see generally Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289, at paras. 44-45 and 48; R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at paras. 23-25; Poulin, at paras. 59 and 62).\nIssues of temporal application are sometimes framed in terms of whether a particular legislative amendment is prospective, retroactive, retrospective or of immediate application in the abstract (see, e.g., C.A. reasons, at paras. 11 and 15). However, this terminology can be confusing and difficult to apply in practice (Sullivan, at p. 735; see also Cote and Devinat, at paras. 518-27; Benner v. Canada (Secretary of State), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 358, at para. 39; Almalki, at paras. 26-28; J. P. Salembier, Understanding Retroactivity: When the Past Just Aint What It Used to Be (2003), 33 Hong Kong L.J. 99, at pp. 99-100). And it is often insufficient to resolve the actual issue before the court. Here the parties agree that the new rule does not apply to all immediately; the disagreement is about the class of accused persons to whom it applies. The better framing in a case like this is to ask in which circumstances the new rule applies. \nIn the criminal context, some principles of temporal application have constitutional protection (Charter, s. 11(g) and (i); K.R.J., at paras. 22-24). Where, as here, constitutional constraints do not arise, the legislatures intent is paramount (Cote and Devinat, at paras. 452-53 and 457). Did Parliament intend the new rule to apply in the circumstances? \nAs with any question of statutory interpretation, determining the temporal application of a new rule must be grounded in the text of the legislation read in its full context and in harmony with the legislatures intention (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21). In conducting that analysis, courts must rely on all the principles of statutory interpretation (Dikranian v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 73, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 530, at para. 36, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (4th ed. 2002), at p. 576). Presumptions of temporal application function as tool[s] (Tran, at para. 48) or guide[s] (R. v. Ali, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 221, at p. 235) in this interpretative exercise. \nWhere the legislatures intention as to the temporal application of specific legislation can be discerned using principles of interpretation other than those presumptions of temporal application, courts are bound to give effect to that intention (R. v. Clarke, 2014 SCC 28, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 612, at paras. 10-11; see also Ali, at p. 239). \nHowever, absent transitional provisions and where those principles of interpretation fail to provide a clear answer, the general presumptions governing temporal application become central to the analysis. They have been developed in the jurisprudence, drawing on first principles, to guide courts in determining what legislatures must have intended regarding the temporal application of new legislative provisions. These presumptions are themselves expressed in legislation, such as the federal Interpretation Act (see, e.g., ss. 43 and 44). Among them are the presumption of immediate application of purely procedural law, the presumption against retrospectivity, and the presumption against interference with vested rights, discussed in further detail below.\nParliament of course remains free to depart from the default rules it prescribes (Interpretation Act, s. 3(1)), including by specifying how the temporal presumptions are to be applied in given circumstances (see, e.g., Venne v. Quebec (Commission de protection du territoire agricole), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 880, at p. 909). Throughout the analysis, courts must thus be mindful of indicators of Parliaments contrary intention. \nAs I will explain, using these presumptions to determine whether the new limitation in s. 535 applies in a given circumstance requires asking the following question: would applying the new rule interfere with a substantive legal interest that has vested before the coming into force of the new rule? If so, the new rule is presumed not to apply in the circumstances. Otherwise, the new rule is presumed to apply.\nTo answer that question, we must first look to the definition of a substantive legal interest; and second, ask whether such an interest has vested. As I shall elaborate below, a substantive legal interest is a right, privilege, obligation or liability that is not merely about how a litigant conducts litigation but has direct implications for the individual outside the courtroom (see R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, at paras. 91-92). Whether the substantive legal interest has vested before the coming into force of the new rule depends on whether all factual prerequisites to its recognition have occurred (see R. v. Puskas, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207, at para. 14). \nPrior jurisprudence may already provide whether a given rule presumptively applies. Thus, where the new rule bears directly on criminal liability (i.e., offences, defences and sentence), which is clearly substantive, it is presumed not to apply where the alleged criminal offence was committed before the coming into force of the new rule (Poulin, at para. 58). Conversely, if jurisprudence establishes that a new rule is purely procedural (e.g., new judicial investigative hearings as in Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re), 2004 SCC 42, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248), it is presumed to apply immediately in all circumstances (Chouhan, at paras. 91-92 and 103). \nOtherwise, where the application of the presumptions has not been authoritatively determined, the presumptions must be directly considered (Puskas, at para. 14). As explained by this Court in Tran and Poulin, the presumptions are rooted in the inherent tension between the legal values of fairness and the rule of law. \nIn the sections that follow, I explain why the question of temporal application before us turns on whether applying the new rule would interfere with a substantive legal interest that vested before it came into force. First, I consider the three relevant presumptions of temporal application as identified in the jurisprudence and in the Interpretation Act. I next address the combined effect of these presumptions. Finally, I review the distinction between substantive as opposed to procedural legal interests and provide guidelines to identify when a substantive legal interest can be said to have vested. \nThe Presumptions of Temporal Application \nThe present case asks this Court to determine the temporal application of the amendment of a Criminal Code provision. It turns on the interpretation and interrelationship between three presumptions: (1) the presumption of immediate application of purely procedural legislation; (2) the presumption against retrospective application of legislation; and (3) the presumption against interference with vested rights. \nI turn first to the presumption of immediate application of purely procedural legislation. Where the change in the law is purely procedural, in that applying it would not, in any circumstances, affect a substantive legal interest, such as a substantive right or liability, the new rule is presumed to apply immediately to all (Dineley, at paras. 10-11; see also Application under s. 83.28, at para. 56; Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, at pp. 331-32; Wright v. Hale (1860), 6 H. & N. 227, 158 E.R. 94, at pp. 95-96; Interpretation Act, s. 44(c) and (d)). Whether the legislation could be classified as procedural in the abstract is not determinative. As recognized by this Court in Dineley, all that matters for this presumption is the presence or absence of an effect on substantive matters (para. 11; see also Chouhan, at paras. 91-92; Yew Bon Tew v. Kenderaan Bas Mara, [1983] 1 A.C. 553 (P.C.), at pp. 562-63, cited in Martin v. Perrie, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 41, at pp. 48-49). The corollary of the purely procedural presumption is that only effects on substantive legal interests provide grounds to presume a new rule does not apply.\nAlthough the inquiry has sometimes been expressed in terms of substantive rights (see, e.g., Dineley, at paras. 10-11), it also involves other substantive legal interests that may not be commonly understood as rights, such as substantive liabilities and obligations (Sullivan, at p. 786; R. v. Bourque (2005), 193 C.C.C. (3d) 485 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 11; Yew Bon Tew, at pp. 562-63). Past decisions of this Court make it clear that the term right in this context has a broad meaning and clearly includes, for example, matters touching the accuseds criminal liability, such as available defences or sentence (Chouhan, at para. 92, citing Dineley, at paras. 52-66, per Cromwell J., dissenting, but not on this point). The term legal interests may be more appropriate when describing this broad category of substantive effects, because as Professors Pierre-Andre Cote and Mathieu Devinat have observed, it may be unnatural to speak of an accused person having a right to be tried in accordance with the law as it existed at the time of an alleged offence that has since been repealed, for example (para. 600). As a result, I refer to the more general term substantive legal interests rather than substantive rights, encompassing the full breadth of this category reflected in this Courts jurisprudence.\nSecond, the presumption against retrospectivity means that a change to the law is presumed not to attach new prejudicial consequences to events that occurred before the change (Tran, at para. 43, citing E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 186; Sullivan, at p. 750, citing E. A. Driedger, Statutes: Retroactive Retrospective Reflections (1978), 56 Can. Bar Rev. 264, at p. 276). Professor Ruth Sullivan notes that while the presumption is sometimes invoked . . . in an attempt to protect a common law or statute-based right it is more often invoked where new prejudicial consequences are attached to an offence committed before the legislation came into force (pp. 750-51; see, e.g., Poulin, at paras. 58-59; K.R.J., at para. 23). While the presumption is subject to certain exceptions including an exception related to public protection (Tran, at paras. 47 and 50, citing Brosseau v. Alberta Securities Commission, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 301), they are not relevant here. The presumption is focused on whether the new rule interferes with the legal consequences flowing from events that occurred before the change. If so, the new rule is presumed not to apply. \nThis Court has said that retrospectivity should not be confused with retroactivity (Epiciers Unis Metro-Richelieu Inc., division Econogros v. Collin, 2004 SCC 59, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 257, at para. 46; see also Cote and Devinat, at paras. 519-20; Sullivan, at pp. 728-29). In broad strokes, the retroactive application of law does not merely attach new consequences to past facts (as is the case with retrospective application), but rather deems the law applicable to those facts to have been different from what it actually was (Sullivan, at pp. 737-38; Driedger (1978), at pp. 268-69; Benner, at para. 39). Here, the new s. 535 of the Criminal Code does not deem the law to have been different than it was in the past and the parties did not argue that it does. \nThird, there is the presumption against interference with vested rights. This presumption has a different focus than the presumption against retrospectivity but can be similar in effect. Legislation is presumed not to interfere with rights held by individuals that were tangible, concrete and distinctive before it came into force (Dikranian, at paras. 32-34 and 39). These rights may arise in private law, such as rights in property, contractual rights or rights to damages, or may be statutory creations, such as certain substantive rights in the litigation process (Sullivan, at pp. 760 and 762). The threshold of tangible, concrete and distinctive has two primary facets: (1) the right must be that of a particular individual rather than belonging to a community or general class; and (2) the right must be sufficiently constituted before the coming into force of the legislative change, in that it exists and is possessed by individuals at the relevant time (Dikranian, at paras. 37 and 39). If a new rule would interfere with a right with these features, such that it has vested, it is presumed not to apply. \nThese presumptions of temporal application and others have been in part codified by Parliament in the Interpretation Act, which provides:\n3 (1) Every provision of this Act applies, unless a contrary intention appears, to every enactment, whether enacted before or after the commencement of this Act.\n\n. . .\n\n43 Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not\n\n. . .\n\n(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the enactment so repealed,\n\n(d) affect any offence committed against or contravention of the provisions of the enactment so repealed, or any punishment, penalty or forfeiture incurred under the enactment so repealed, or\n\n(e) affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any right, privilege, obligation or liability referred to in paragraph (c) or in respect of any punishment, penalty or forfeiture referred to in paragraph (d), \n\nand an investigation, legal proceeding or remedy as described in paragraph (e) may be instituted, continued or enforced, and the punishment, penalty or forfeiture may be imposed as if the enactment had not been so repealed.\n\n\n44 Where an enactment, in this section called the former enactment, is repealed and another enactment, in this section called the new enactment, is substituted therefor,\n\n. . .\n\n(c) every proceeding taken under the former enactment shall be taken up and continued under and in conformity with the new enactment in so far as it may be done consistently with the new enactment;\n\n(d) the procedure established by the new enactment shall be followed as far as it can be adapted thereto\n\n(i) in the recovery or enforcement of fines, penalties and forfeitures imposed under the former enactment,\n\n(ii) in the enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the former enactment, and\n\n(iii) in a proceeding in relation to matters that have happened before the repeal;\nThe Combined Effect of the Presumptions\nHow are we to understand the relationship among these three relevant presumptions such that we can apply them together in a principled way? The inquiry starts by asking whether the new rule is purely procedural, since, in the affirmative, it is unnecessary to consider the other temporal presumptions. This is because, as I have said, where it is shown that a new rule is purely procedural, it applies immediately in all circumstances. The longstanding principle that there can be no vested rights in procedure (see Wright, at pp. 95-96; Angus v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co., [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256, at pp. 265-66; Wildman, at p. 331; Application under s. 83.28, at para. 62; Chouhan, at para. 99) means there is no need to ask about vesting where only procedure is affected. Where, however, the new rule is not purely procedural, the analysis must continue to consider the other presumptions.\nSome argue before us, to the contrary, that a finding that an amendment is not purely procedural ends the analysis and renders recourse to other presumptions of temporal application unnecessary. According to this theory, as soon as substantive rights are engaged, the new rule presumptively does not apply to any accused alleged to have committed an offence before the change in the law (I.F. (Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA)), at para. 30; see also R.F. (Archambault), at para. 41). The CCLA, in particular, relies on the statement in Dineley, at para. 10, that where legislative provisions affect either vested or substantive rights, retrospectivity has been found to be undesirable. This statement means, the CCLA says, that if an amendment affects a substantive right, the amendment does not apply to any accused whether or not the right has vested (I.F., at para. 23).\nI do not accept this interpretation of Dineley. There is no indication that this Court in Dineley intended vested or substantive rights to suggest the existence of two distinct types of rights for the purpose of the temporal presumptions, as opposed to offering two adjectives to describe the same class of rights (para. 10). None of the references cited in Dineley (Angus, at pp. 266-67; Application under s. 83.28, at para. 57; Wildman, at pp. 331-32) appear to apply that bifurcation. Further, while this Court relied on Dineley more recently in Chouhan, there is nothing in the reasons of Moldaver and Brown JJ. on this issue that purports to apply substantive and vested rights as disjunctive ideas (see paras. 91-92 and 96). That language from Dineley is absent from their restatement of the relevant principles (paras. 91-92) and at para. 96 they wrote that even where a procedure operates more favourably to the accused than its replacement, there is no vested interest, and by extension, no substantive right to a specific procedure, expressly equating them. This Court in Dineley did not have to consider vesting in any detail given, in that case, the amendment at issue was found to affect a criminal defence and only came into force midway through trial. \nHow then do the other two presumptions described above apply where the new rule is not purely procedural? The relationship between the presumptions against retrospectivity (against a change in the law attaching new prejudicial consequences to events that occurred before the change) and against interference with vested rights (against legislation interfering with an individuals rights that were vested before it came into force) can be vexing, because while they are framed to focus on different elements of temporal application, they can be understood as overlapping, or as different sides of the same coin (Sullivan, at p. 770). They are both invoked in circumstances, as here, where parties seek to protect rights (p. 750). As Ruth Sullivan explains, [i]nterference with a vested right is always retrospective in that rights arise by virtue of facts that fulfil the conditions precedent to the right and subsequently impairing them changes the legal consequences of those facts in a prejudicial way (pp. 750-51, fn. 91). The two presumptions both target legislation that change[s] the future legal consequences of past facts (p. 770). It is unsurprising that this Court referenced the presumptions in the same breath in Dineley (at para. 10) and that other courts have done the same (see, e.g., Bell Canada v. Amtelecom Limited Partnership, 2015 FCA 126, [2016] 1 F.C.R. 29, at paras. 34-35).\nThis overlap is consistent with the codification of the vested rights presumption in the Interpretation Act, which makes clear that repeal does not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability arising under the repealed legislation (s. 43(c); see also Sullivan, at p. 761). In all these cases, whether conceived as the presumption against retrospectivity or the presumption against interference with vested rights, the presumption prevents changes to legal interests that have arisen because of past facts. The presumption against retrospectivity says that if the new rule attaches new prejudicial consequences to those facts, for example because it eliminates a right that those facts gave rise to under the previous state of the law, it is presumed not to apply. The presumption against interference with vested rights and the remainder of s. 43(c) of the Interpretation Act say that the new rule will also be presumed not to apply if applying it would affect any pre-existing right, privilege, obligation or liability (i.e., legal interest), for example by eliminating a pre-existing right. \nThe combined effect of these presumptions, therefore, is to look at the facts that had occurred before the new rule came into force and decide whether they establish a legal interest that the law is presumed to protect. If so, the new rule will be presumed not to apply where it would interfere with that interest. \nOur jurisprudence refers to a legal interest as vested when all the facts, or in the language of Puskas conditions precedent (para. 14), have occurred for the law to recognize it. Where the legal interest has vested before a new rule came into force, the new rule is presumed not to apply if it would interfere with that legal interest. And because the purely procedural presumption provides that only substantive legal interests can raise a presumption of non-application  there is no vested substantive legal interest in procedure  these legal interests must necessarily be substantive. \nThus, in applying these three presumptions, the key question is whether the new rule would interfere with a substantive legal interest that had vested before its coming into force. \nAnswering that question requires understanding when a legal interest is substantive and when it has vested. These two thresholds are the heart of the presumptions relevant to the disposition of this appeal. Both concepts are thresholds seeking to balance the underlying legal values of fairness and the rule of law (see, e.g., Tran, at paras. 44-45; Poulin, at para. 62).\nThe Substantive Threshold\nIt has sometimes proven difficult for courts to identify whether a new rule can interfere with a substantive legal interest or whether it is purely procedural (Cote and Devinat, at para. 707, citing Dineley). Reconciling all past precedents may be an impossible task (Dineley, at para. 15). \nThe balance of fairness and the rule of law in the presumption of immediate application of purely procedural legislation is reflected in the substantive threshold, which starts from the premise that interference with existing legal interests and other unjust results of applying new legislation should be avoided (Sullivan, at p. 786). However, if those legal interests are to be protected, it is necessary to have effective procedural rules that allow them to be vindicated in court. Giving procedural reform immediate effect ensures that courts do not continue to carry out procedures that the legislature has decided are less than ideal for that purpose (see Cote and Devinat, at para. 690; see also P. Roubier, Le droit transitoire: conflits des lois dans le temps (2nd ed. 1993), at p. 548; D. Bailey and L. Norbury, Bennion, Bailey and Norbury on Statutory Interpretation (8th ed. 2020), at pp. 271-72). In this way, applying new procedural rules immediately to all is deemed beneficial for all and protects, rather than interferes with, settled expectations (Application under s. 83.28, at para. 62). As a legal interest becomes less a means to establish other rights and liabilities through litigation and more as an end in itself independent of that litigation, it becomes more likely that the legal interest will meet the substantive threshold (see Chouhan, at para. 92, per Moldaver and Brown JJ.). \nThe appropriate balance as reflected in the substantive threshold should be guided by the case law on temporal application, which shows how it is achieved in particular contexts. The jurisprudence reveals at least three broad categories of recognized interference with substantive legal interests in the criminal litigation context. In the first category are those effects that can be said to bear directly on criminal liability, specifically the penal consequences the law will attach to impugned conduct (see, e.g., Poulin, at paras. 58-59). This group includes material changes to the elements of the offence, applicable defences and sentences, which could leave the accused facing different consequences for the impugned conduct at the close of litigation (Chouhan, at para. 92; see, e.g., Dineley). The second category are effects on the jurisdiction of courts to hear matters and related appeals (Sullivan, at pp. 788-89; Puskas, at paras. 6-7). Changes to the availability of these hearings could also ultimately leave the accused facing different consequences. For example, an accused erroneously convicted at trial may be in a very different position in terms of their criminal record and liberty interest depending on whether they have a right of appeal. The third category includes effects to constitutional protections that attach to the criminal process, given these rights are necessarily substantive (Dineley, at para. 21).\nIn determining whether a new rule can interfere with a substantive legal interest, courts should be mindful that substantive law creates rights and obligations and is concerned with the ends which the administration of justice seeks to attain, whereas procedural law is the vehicle providing the means and instruments by which those ends are attained (Sutt v. Sutt, [1969] 1 O.R. 169 (C.A.), at p. 175, cited in Chouhan, at para. 94). As noted in Chouhan, procedural amendments will generally alter the method by which a litigant conducts an action or establishes a defence or asserts a right (para. 92 (emphasis added)). However, even if a right is dependent on litigation to exist, it may still be substantive. Many of our constitutional rights, including the right to be tried within a reasonable time, depend on litigation. Section 11 of the Charter provides explicitly that the rights it protects arise where a person is charged with an offence. They remain, however, necessarily substantive (Dineley, at para. 21), because their protection is not merely instrumental but an end our law seeks to guarantee. \nIn addition, where a potentially relevant substantive legal interest has been identified, the new rule must affect [its] content or existence to establish an interference with that interest for the purpose of the temporal presumptions; a mere impact on the manner of its enforcement or use does not amount to interference unless it renders enforcement or use practically impossible (Angus, at pp. 265-66 (emphasis in original); see also Dineley, at paras. 15-16; Cote and Devinat, at para. 707). \nThe Vesting Threshold\nThe presumptions against retrospectivity and against the interference with vested rights can also be understood in light of the underlying legal values, namely fairness and the rule of law, which the vesting threshold seeks to hold in balance (see generally Cote and Devinat, at paras. 615-16). On the one hand, the law acknowledges that people have the right to proceed in reliance on their substantive legal interests such that it could be unfair to abruptly change these interests by legislation (Sullivan, at p. 761, citing Upper Canada College v. Smith (1920), 61 S.C.R. 413, at p. 417). Setting the threshold too high could undermine public confidence in the laws stability necessary to uphold the rule of law. But the legislature must have the flexibility to change the law to achieve evolving public policy goals. Setting the threshold too low could frustrate the democratic evolution of the law (Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 271, at pp. 282-83). As the affected substantive legal interest becomes one on which people are likely to place greater reasonable reliance in conducting their affairs, the less likely it is that the new rule should apply. \nMany different words have been used in our jurisprudence and in the Interpretation Act to capture the idea that legal interests must be sufficiently constituted to benefit from a presumptive protection against interference (acquired, e.g. Interpretation Act, s. 43(c); accrued, e.g. Interpretation Act, s. 43(c), Gustavson Drilling, at p. 284, and Dikranian, at para. 39; vested, e.g. Gustavson Drilling, at p. 282; crystallize[d], e.g. Benner, at para. 51, and Dikranian, at paras. 30 and 43; materialized, e.g. Dikranian, at para. 40; tangible and concrete, e.g. Dikranian, at para. 37). Thus, vesting, as the term is used here, must be understood to capture the full breadth of these circumstances. \nFor some legal interests the jurisprudence will provide clear answers about when it has vested. For example, it is clear from the authorities that criminal liability, that is the substantive law governing elements of the offence, corresponding defences and applicable sentence, vests at the time of the commission of the alleged offence (Poulin, at paras. 58-59; R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, at para. 41; K.R.J., at para. 1; Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at pp. 1151-52; Interpretation Act, s. 43(c) to (e)). The accuseds criminal liability is determined under the law prevailing at the time of the alleged offence and law coming into force after that date is presumed not to interfere with the liability so incurred. \nAs compared with criminal liability, determining when vesting occurs will be more difficult when dealing with unique statutory rights created to achieve specific legislative goals. As Professor Sullivan has observed, the methods of enforcing such rights and claims follow no fixed pattern (p. 762). The legislature has the freedom to craft the features of such a right, including when it can be considered to have vested. A courts task is to identify the conditions precedent to vesting based on the unique right the legislature has created, which requires careful attention to the statutory context and to the purposes of the threshold described above.\nThe facts that must occur for a statutory legal interest to vest therefore depend on its unique nature (Dikranian, at para. 40). In the tax context, for example, it is imperative that legislation conform to changing social needs and governmental policy. A taxpayer may plan his financial affairs in reliance on the tax laws remaining the same; he takes the risk that the legislation may be changed (Gustavson Drilling, at pp. 282-83). In contrast, in the immigration law context, it is imperative that permanent residents be able to organize their lives, such that clear obligations must be communicated to them in advance (Tran, at para. 41). In examining when a legal interest vests under the Criminal Code, courts should thus be mindful of the delicate balancing exercise underlying the threshold in light of the specific context in which the statutory right arises.\nThat said, it will be difficult to say a legal interest is vested where it remains contingent on an intervening action or event. For example, when the creation of the legal interest requires a third party to exercise discretion in a particular way, and that discretion could lawfully be exercised differently, the threshold is unlikely to be met (Sullivan, at pp. 766-67; see, e.g., Tuffnail v. Meekes, 2020 ONCA 340, 449 D.L.R. (4th) 478, at para. 104). In other words, the favourable exercise of that discretion by the third party is likely to be considered a condition precedent for the legal interest to vest. Likewise, if people had the ability to take the action necessary to acquire a certain benefit but failed to do so before the coming into force, it is more difficult to conclude that any reliance placed on that unrealized possibility deserves to be protected (see, e.g., Attorney General of Quebec v. Expropriation Tribunal, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 732, at pp. 742-43; Abbott v. Minister for Lands, [1895] A.C. 425 (P.C.), at pp. 430-31). Alternatively, where actions are not required to obtain the interest under the law but are only mere formalities in exercising it, they are unlikely to be preconditions to the vesting of that interest (see, e.g., Re Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. v. Minister of Revenue for Ontario (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 240 (C.A.), at p. 250).\nConclusion on the Applicable Principles\nThe presumptions governing temporal application are tools used to determine the legislatures intent. There may be other bases on which courts will decline to apply a new rule, in accordance with other principles of interpretation. But where other principles fail to provide a clear answer regarding the temporal application of a new rule, the presumptions become central to the analysis. \nThe three presumptions at issue all direct careful focus on the effects to an individuals legal interests of applying the new rule. Together, they provide that the new rule will presumptively apply unless it interferes with a substantive legal interest that had vested before it came into force. This inquiry can be understood in two stages. \nFirst, if the new rule is purely procedural, in that applying it could not interfere with any substantive legal interest, it is presumed to apply immediately in all circumstances. Whether a legal interest is substantive is guided by categories settled in the jurisprudence, and the underlying legal values of fairness and the rule of law rather than the abstract procedural nature of the legislation itself. \nSecond, if the new rule can interfere with a substantive legal interest, the next question is whether applying it in the circumstances would affect a substantive legal interest that vested before it came into force. A legal interest vests once all the facts necessary to recognize its existence have occurred. While those facts may generally be settled for recurring categories such as criminal liability, in cases involving unique statutory rights, careful attention must be paid to the nature of the right as expressed in the statute in light of how the legislature has balanced the reasonable expectations of interest holders against the democratic evolution of the law.\nThe Temporal Application of Section 535\nTo answer the question of which accused are subject to the new limitation on the right to a preliminary inquiry in s. 535 (that the offence charged be punishable by 14 years or more imprisonment), the parties have proposed three possibilities. First, the Crowns position is that the new rule applies immediately, unless a preliminary inquiry was in progress or a request to hold one had been made before it came into force (A.F., at para. 77). It argues that preliminary inquiries are not part of the substantive law that is presumptively determined by the law in force at the time of the commission of the alleged offence (paras. 49-62). In the Crowns view, changes to the availability of preliminary inquiries should not be put on the same footing as the changes to the elements of an offence or contemporaneous defences (paras. 64-65). \nSecond, the respondents answer that because it is substantive, the right to a preliminary inquiry arose at the time of the alleged commission of the offence (R.F. (Archambault), at para. 41; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 1). Courts are and should be reluctant to apply penal provisions retrospectively. Under the principle of legality, according to the respondents, substantive law includes not only the elements of the offence, any relevant defences and the maximum sentence, but also incidental procedures like the preliminary inquiry. The new limitation therefore only applies to accused persons whose offences were allegedly committed after its coming into force. \nAnd third, the respondents submit in the alternative that the new limitation only applies to accused who had not yet had their first appearance. They submit that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry vested at first appearance, because accused persons then have their first possibility to make a request (R.F. (Archambault), at para. 45; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 3). Because there was no impediment to their election as to the mode of trial, and depending on their election, to ask for a preliminary inquiry, their statutory right to a preliminary inquiry was vested (R.F. (Archambault), at paras. 48 and 54-65; transcript, at pp. 91-96). On the facts of this case, the respondents had specifically reserved or deferred their election and request before the coming into force of the new limitation (R.F. (Archambault), at para. 46).\nLooking first to the legislation, there are no explicit transitional provisions that apply to s. 535. While Parliaments general purpose of eliminating delay in the criminal justice system is well understood (see, e.g., House of Commons Debates, at pp. 19602-4), courts must be careful not to equate the purpose of the new rule with Parliaments specific intention as to temporal application. Regardless of the conclusion as to the class of accused to which it applies, the amendment here would still limit the availability of preliminary inquiries, thus serving Parliaments general purpose. \nThe delayed coming into force of the amendment by 90 days can, like the rest of the statutory context, be a relevant factor to consider in the broader analysis (Sullivan, at p. 775; Newton v. Crouch, 2016 BCCA 115, 384 B.C.A.C. 164, at para. 78). Here, it may be an indication that Parliament intended to provide notice to people that could immediately be impacted by the new rule (i.e., accused persons already in the criminal justice system). However, a delay in coming into force is not on its own determinative of legislative intent (Ali, at pp. 242-43), and it is insufficient here to give a definitive answer as to the circumstances in which Parliament meant the new rule to apply. \nThe Crown notes that the sponsoring Ministers department later stated that the amendment applied to those who had not asked for a preliminary inquiry by the time of coming into force (Department of Justice, Legislative Background: An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, as enacted (Bill C-75 in the 42nd Parliament) (2019), at p. 24, fn. 68; A.F., at para. 90). This Court cannot, though, put undue weight on these statements made outside of Parliament after enactment, since it is intent of the enacting Parliament that determines the proper interpretation (see Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 SCC 71, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 660, at para. 98). \nAs there is no clear basis on which to draw a conclusion about Parliaments specific intention regarding the temporal application of the new s. 535, the temporal application therefore falls to be determined using the temporal presumptions, in line with the framework set out above.\nCan the Limitation on the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry Impact a Substantive Legal Interest?\nOne of the effects of denying accused persons a preliminary inquiry is the loss of the benefits derived from its discovery function, including the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses before trial, and to test the strength of the case. Even though the discovery function of preliminary inquiries has lost some of its significance over time, in practice, the discovery function still offers important strategic value to accused persons (see, e.g., N.S., at para. 40; R. v. Rao, 2012 BCCA 275, 323 B.C.A.C. 165, at para. 95). For many accused, that may be its real worth (Paciocco, at p. 160; see also K. Roach, Preserving Preliminary Inquiries (1999), 42 Crim. L.Q. 161, at p. 162). The preliminary inquiry enables the defence to flesh out a Crown witnesss story and commit the witness to a specific and detailed account. If a witnesss testimony at trial conflicts with his or her evidence at the preliminary inquiry, such inconsistencies will provide a basis for impeachment (S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at 9.126; see also M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2024 (31st ed. 2024), at pp. 579-80).\nAn accused has a constitutional right to disclosure under Stinchcombe (R. v. Gubbins, 2018 SCC 44, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 35, at para. 18), and constitutional protections in the criminal process are necessarily substantive (Dineley, at para. 21). However, the removal of the preliminary inquiry does not interfere with this constitutional right. Whether a change is said to be strategically important to the accused does not, on its own, establish that it interferes with a substantive legal interest (Chouhan, at paras. 96-98, per Moldaver and Brown JJ.). Here, the Crowns duty to disclose does not extend to making witnesses available for examination (R. v. Khela, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 201, at para. 18). The Crown must meet its duty regarding disclosure despite the availability of the preliminary inquiry. Thus, losing an additional discovery function cannot interfere with the constitutional right to disclosure. \nMoreover, although proceeding without a preliminary inquiry may affect how an accused conducts their defence, for example by losing the possibility of cross-examining to establish an evidentiary basis for trial (see R. v. George (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 144 (C.A.), at pp. 144-45), changing a purely evidentiary hearing will generally be relevant only to the means (or method) by which the related litigation is resolved. Cross-examining witnesses at a preliminary inquiry is simply not a component of the right to make full answer and defence (Bjelland, at para. 32). Changes to hearings in the criminal context for the purpose of gathering evidence or information have been understood as purely procedural (see, e.g., Application under s. 83.28, at para. 61).\nStill, I agree with Doherty J.A. in R.S. that the rule limiting the right to a preliminary inquiry can interfere with a substantive legal interest when its effect is to eliminate the opportunity for accused persons to be discharged at the close of the inquiry (para. 49). Where the Crown cannot meet its low evidentiary burden for an accused to be ordered to stand trial, the accused must be discharged following the preliminary inquiry (Cr. C., s. 548(1)(b)). In my view, the opportunity available at a preliminary inquiry to be spare[d] . . . the ordeal of an unjustified criminal trial (Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at 9.131) is a substantive legal interest. As noted by our Court in Skogman, the screening function of the preliminary inquiry is to protect the accused from a needless, and indeed, improper, exposure to public trial where the enforcement agency is not in possession of evidence to warrant the continuation of the process (p. 105).\nThis opportunity to be discharged at the preliminary inquiry may also be an opportunity for the accused to remove limits on their liberty, where the accused is remanded to custody or subject to restrictive terms pending trial. When there is no preliminary inquiry, the accused may remain subject to these restrictions on liberty until the proceedings are concluded (Gold and Presser, at pp. 147-48 and 164; C. M. Webster and H. H. Bebbington, Why Re-open the Debate on the Preliminary Inquiry? Some Preliminary Empirical Observations (2013), 55 C.J.C.C.J. 513, at p. 521; see also R.S., at paras. 57-58). These effects cannot be understood only in the litigation; they do not merely change how the accused advances their defence. The opportunity to avoid the stigma and personal stress related to an unresolved criminal charge, to avoid a needless trial where evidence is insufficient, and to be free of any restrictions on liberty, exists apart from the methods or means of conducting the litigation. This opportunity is thus a substantive legal interest that can be interfered with should the availability of a preliminary inquiry be removed.\nThe right to a preliminary inquiry is analogous in this way to the right to have an appeal heard, which is a substantive right (Cote and Devinat, at para. 718, citing Puskas). Like the right to an appeal, the right to a preliminary inquiry entitles the holder to a further opportunity to challenge or mitigate their criminal liability. Although they arise at different times in the proceedings (one before trial and the other after judgment), both may end in a disposition that bears on the accuseds (or appellants) circumstances outside the courtroom. They are in this way distinct from hearings that are merely evidentiary and do not culminate in this kind of determination (see, e.g., Application under s. 83.28). \nIn sum, adding this new limitation on the right to a preliminary inquiry can interfere with a substantive legal interest. It can affect the very existence of the opportunity to obtain a discharge. It is not purely procedural and does not attract immediate application in every circumstance. To determine whether or not the new rule is presumed to apply in a given circumstance, we must ask whether applying it in that circumstance would interfere with a substantive legal interest that had vested before its coming into force.\nWhen Does the Right to a Preliminary Inquiry Vest?\nHere, the parties disagree as to which preconditions are essential for the right to a preliminary inquiry to have vested. As this is a statutory right that has never been considered by this Court, we must determine the necessary preconditions by looking to the statutory construction of the right, understood in light of the underlying values of fairness and the rule of law that govern this area of the law. In line with the submissions of the parties, I examine three key points in the criminal process: first, the time of the commission of the alleged offence; second, the point in the proceedings at which there are no further conditions outside the control of the accused to ask for a preliminary inquiry; and third, when the request is made. As I shall explain, I conclude that requesting a preliminary inquiry is a necessary precondition to exercising the right, such that the right only vests at that third point.\nFirst, the right to a preliminary inquiry does not vest when the offence is alleged to have been committed. While the removal of the right to a preliminary inquiry interferes with a substantive legal interest, it does not follow that the opportunity to be discharged at a preliminary inquiry forms part of the substantive law about criminal liability that is understood to vest at the time of the commission of the offence. Respectfully, the Court of Appeal erred to the extent it held otherwise (para. 17). It is clear from our jurisprudence that not all substantive legal interests will vest at the time of the commission of the offence. For example, the right to an appeal, while substantive, is determined in reference to the date when the judgment below is issued, not the date the underlying offence was committed (see Puskas, at para. 14; see also Tcheng v. Cooperative dhabitation Chung Hua, 2016 QCCA 461, at paras. 36-38 and 59-60). The elements of the offence establishing guilt, the existence of a defence and the applicable sentence all determine the criminal liability the law attaches, if any, to the impugned conduct. The availability of an appeal or a preliminary inquiry have no such impact and do not fall within the substantive law described in Poulin.\nIn Poulin, our Court explained that the substantive law which directly governs criminal liability is generally determined as of the commission of the offence (paras. 58-59; see also Tran, at paras. 43-45). The reasoning outlined in that case is the principle of legality  the idea that we ought to protect a persons reliance on the state of the law when they were deciding how to conduct themselves and whether to risk the liability associated with breaking the law (Poulin, at para. 59; see also Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, at p. 1152). As I have said, the preliminary inquiry, like an appeal, does not directly affect the criminal liability the law attaches to impugned conduct. Conduct is not made legal or illegal, nor made subject to greater or lesser penal consequence because it could be examined at a preliminary inquiry or on appeal. Thus, it does not implicate the principle of legality in the same way as a change to the substantive law defining whether that conduct is subject to the consequences of criminal liability. It strains credulity to imagine that people weigh the availability of a preliminary inquiry, or of an appeal, in determining how to conduct themselves and whether to risk criminal liability. At the time of the commission of the offence, no expectation is created with which it would be unfair to interfere. \nThe availability and exercise of the right ultimately depends on significant contingencies standing between the commission of the offence and the holding of a preliminary inquiry, including whether a charge will actually be laid and, in the case of a hybrid offence, whether prosecutorial discretion will be exercised to proceed summarily. The existence of these discretionary steps before a preliminary inquiry could ever be available is fundamentally incompatible with a vested legal interest (Sullivan, at pp. 766-67; Tuffnail, at para. 104). There is nothing unfair about changing a persons entitlement to a preliminary inquiry when it is unclear if they will ever have the right to one, depending on the Crowns exercise of discretion on whether to charge or what charge to lay, or how to prosecute the charge that is laid.\nI now turn to the respondents alternative submission, that the first appearance of the accused is the point where there is no additional contingency and the right has vested, given the accused can make a request for a preliminary inquiry at any time (R.F. (Archambault), at paras. 9 and 45; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 3). The respondents say that, in Quebec, an accused generally reserves their election at first appearance (R.F. (Archambault), at para. 68). After that point they may elect their mode of trial, and if they elect to be tried in the Superior Court, they may request a preliminary inquiry.\nThe Criminal Code provides that where an accused does not elect a mode of trial when put to their election they will be deemed to have elected to be tried by judge and jury (ss. 536(2) and (2.1) and 565(1)(b); see also Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at p. 574; Martins Annual Criminal Code 2025 (2024), by M. Henein and M. R. Gourlay, at pp. 1150-51). The accused may re-elect to another mode of trial where permitted by the Criminal Code (s. 561).\nIt is in this context that the respondents say a practice has developed in Quebec where an accused generally postpones (reporte) their election to a future time. According to Nicolas Bellemare [translation] [i]n practice, at the appearance, the election as to the mode of trial is postponed (Les procedures precedant le proces en matiere criminelle, in Collection de droit de lEcole du Barreau du Quebec 2024-2025, vol. 12, Droit penal - Procedure et preuve (2024), 39, at p. 70 (emphasis added); see also A. Gagnon-Rocque and J. Heroux, Arrestation, comparution et mise en liberte, in JurisClasseur Quebec  Collection Droit penal  Preuve et procedure penales (loose-leaf), fasc. 5, at No. 110). By deferring the election, the accused will obtain the benefit of disclosure and the opportunity to retain and be advised by counsel (ibid.; see also Henein and Gourlay, at p. 1150). In that sense, the reserve of the election, noted by the court in the indictment, may be taken to confirm the accused can elect and request a preliminary inquiry at any time. From that point on, whether the accused will ultimately have a preliminary inquiry is dependent only on the law and their own actions. \nAlthough this may be true of the first appearance in Quebec, this may not be true of the first appearance across the country. In post-charge screening jurisdictions  which, according to the Attorney General of Ontario, include Ontario, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island (I.F., at para. 15)  the eligibility for a preliminary inquiry remains contingent even after first appearance, as the accused may not yet have the possibility to elect the mode of trial (ibid.; see also Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at 9.43). However, at some point in the pre-trial stage of a criminal proceeding, there may be no impediment to the accuseds election and potential request for a preliminary inquiry.\nWe must, of course, remain mindful that while criminal procedure is national in scope, there is important variation in the specifics of how that procedure is applied across jurisdictions and levels of court (see, e.g., S. Coughlan, Criminal Procedure (4th ed. 2020), at p. 29). Local practices regarding the administration of justice can vary throughout the country, as long as they remain consistent with the enacted criminal law provisions.\nThe general issue here is whether the right to a preliminary inquiry vests once the accused is able, through their own choices and actions, such as electing their mode of trial and making a request for a preliminary inquiry, to ensure they have a preliminary inquiry. The respondents submit the right vests when accused persons have their first opportunity to make a request. In Quebec, therefore, this occurs on first appearance because that is when the election as to mode of trial is put to the accused. In other provinces and territories, the manner in which the court acknowledges the accuseds deferral of these rights may vary. \nThere are fewer contingencies here than at earlier points in the criminal process, such as the moment of the commission of the offence or the point at which the accused is charged. In effect, the choice between the Crowns position and the respondents alternative depends on the answer to the question of whether actually making a request  rather than the ability to make a request  is a precondition of vesting. Not every formal requirement in a proceeding is necessary for a right to vest. Because the right to a preliminary inquiry is a statutory right, the answer turns on the terms through which Parliament defines that right as seen through the lens of the legal values underlying transitional law.\nUnder the legislation considered in Puskas, the right to appeal was not framed as contingent on a notice of appeal being filed (Cr. C., s. 691(2)), even though an existing right to appeal could be lost if the appellant did not file a notice of appeal within the applicable time limit (see, e.g., Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, ss. 58 to 60). It is unsurprising then that the notice of appeal was not identified as a condition precedent to the right of appeal at issue in that case (Puskas, at para. 15).\nIn contrast to the right of appeal in Puskas, s. 535 frames the request as a precondition of the existence of the right. Section 535 expressly provides that [i]f . . . a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry, the justice shall . . . inquire into the charge. The French version reads: Lorsquun[e] . . . demande a ete presentee en vue de la tenue dune enquete preliminaire . . ., le juge de paix doit . . . enqueter sur laccusation . . . . The Criminal Code ties the request to the election of mode of trial (or deemed election). A preliminary inquiry will not be available if the accused elects to be tried by a provincial court judge without a jury and without having had a preliminary inquiry (s. 536(2)). Section 536(2) further requires that where an accused is charged with an indictable offence punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, other than an offence that is listed in s. 469, the justice put the accused to an election in words that include: . . . you will have a preliminary inquiry only if you or the prosecutor requests one. \nThere is no express requirement of form as to how an accused may make that request other than that it be made under s. 536(4) of the Criminal Code. Section 536(4) provides (and provided prior to the 2019 amendments to the Criminal Code) that where an accused elects (or is deemed to have elected) to be tried other than before a judge of the provincial court, the justice shall, . . . on the request of the accused or the prosecutor made at that time or within the period fixed by rules of court . . . or . . . by the justice, hold a preliminary inquiry into the charge. Under s. 536(4.1) the information must be endorsed to show whether the accused or the prosecutor has requested that a preliminary inquiry be held. The request also has concrete legal consequences that go beyond the obligation of the justice to hold the preliminary inquiry. For instance, it may also fix the conditions on which the accused has a right to re-elect the mode of trial (see Cr. C., s. 561). Read together, the provisions surrounding the election of the mode of trial make clear that what triggers the holding of a preliminary inquiry is both the election of the mode of trial in which a preliminary inquiry is available (trial other than before a judge of the provincial court for an offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment), and the request for a preliminary inquiry to be held. Indeed, even where the accused is sure to be tried by a mode through which a preliminary inquiry is available, the statute still mandates a request (s. 536(4)). And absent a request, the justice shall fix the date for the trial (s. 536(4.3)).\nThus, s. 535 (as well as s. 536(2), (2.1) and (4)) makes clear that there is a distinction between the ability to make a request, and the right to a preliminary inquiry. The latter can only be sufficiently vested once a request has been made (see also s. 555(1.1) and (1.2)).\nIn some cases, recourse to the broader statutory context may reveal that explicit textual requirements are only mere formalities, as opposed to preconditions, or reveal more preconditions that may not be directly apparent from the text itself. However, this is a statutory right and the text and statutory scheme make clear that Parliament intended to make the availability of a preliminary inquiry conditional on a request actually having been made. It therefore cannot be dismissed as a mere procedural or formal step required to exercise a right that has already vested. Rather, it defines whether a preliminary inquiry can be held. \nGranted, where the contingencies that are dependent on third parties have been removed (i.e., a charge has been laid and the prosecution has decided to proceed by way of indictment), the accused may have a greater expectation that depending on their election of mode of trial, they would be able to eventually request a preliminary inquiry. In Quebec for example, the accused may formally postpone or reserve their election. But in my view, whether the accused postpones or reserves their election, or merely indicates they are not ready to elect, cannot be determinative of the temporal application of s. 535. This distinction finds no basis in the Criminal Code. Whether the accused has the opportunity, based on the jurisdiction in which they find themselves, to reserve their right, or whether they are at a point in the process at which they could elect and make a request at any time, the further steps the accused needs to take to secure a preliminary inquiry are substantively identical: they must elect, or be deemed to elect, their mode of trial and then make a request for a preliminary inquiry for which they are eligible under the Criminal Code. In each case, the accused may have expected that acquiring the right to a preliminary inquiry was entirely within their control. However, the classification of a right as vested is based on the facts as they exist when the new rule comes into force, not on facts that could have existed had the accused chosen to proceed differently. In light of the manner in which Parliament has framed the statutory right to a preliminary inquiry, it is not the ability to make a request, but rather the request itself that acts as a statutory precondition to acquiring the right. \nThe statutory text of s. 535 makes plain that the request is central to the right to the preliminary inquiry. This has been so since 2004 when the previous amendment came into force transforming the right to a preliminary inquiry as one conditional on a request being made (Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001, s. 24). Because there was a 90-day period before the amendment at issue came into force, the accused had notice of the rule change. In this context, Parliament signaled that any unfairness resulting from depriving the accused of expectations that a request could be made would give way in favour of the clear legislative direction that a request must be made. There is always an element of unfairness, to a lesser or greater extent depending on the circumstances, when Parliament changes a rule that an accused may have thought would be of benefit. The presumptions of temporal application recognize, however, that only where all the preconditions mandated by Parliament have been met will an accused have a statutory right with which Parliament presumably wished not to interfere.\nThere are important rule of law considerations animating the availability of preliminary inquiries in s. 535. The requirement that a request be made ensures there is a clear rule that can be given a uniform interpretation across Canada, and avoids the need for a factual inquiry into whether there are any impediments to a given accuseds ability to make a request. Parliament intended to create clear and readily ascertainable conditions limiting the right to a preliminary inquiry in s. 535. And in determining the temporal application of legislation, Parliaments intent remains key. Recognizing the importance of the actual request as a condition to the right to the inquiry therefore follows Parliaments choice of text and its intent. Thus, I conclude that a preliminary inquiry is not available under s. 535 until an actual request has been made. \nWhether a request has been made is a factual question dependent on the circumstances of each individual case. As the Crown suggested in its oral arguments, an informal demand made outside of court (as for example during the 90-day period between the new rules enactment and its coming into force) may be enough to constitute the equivalent of a request within the meaning of ss. 535 and 536(4) (transcript, at pp. 10-11; see also R.S., at para. 15). It may depend on the rules of practice of the particular court. In sum, where the accused has not expressed a clear demand for a preliminary inquiry, the right to a preliminary inquiry has not vested. To conclude otherwise would be to ignore the specific way Parliament designed this right  and its relationship to the rest of the criminal process. The Criminal Code permits courts to set out rules that are best suited to the local context, provided they are not inconsistent with the Criminal Code itself (ss. 482 and 482.1). Variation in practice across jurisdictions and courts can ensure that justice is administered in a manner responsive to local circumstances.\nMy colleagues Justices Cote and Rowe advance another possibility, namely that the right to a preliminary inquiry could have vested at the time charges were laid. While the laying of a charge removes one of the most obvious conditions precedent for the exercise of the right, the availability of a preliminary inquiry still remains subject to the numerous contingencies described above. Beyond the need for a request, the Crown will not necessarily have elected how to proceed at the time charges are laid, depending on the jurisdiction. In those circumstances, the accused cannot expect that they will have a preliminary inquiry, given the Crown may either decide to continue to proceed by indictment, where a preliminary inquiry would be possible, or summarily, where it would not.\nMy colleague Justice Kasirer advances a final possibility, that an accused has a vested right as soon as they reserve the election of their mode of trial, due to the assurance they receive from the court about the future availability of a preliminary inquiry (paras. 91-92). There is no evidence in the record that when an accused reserves their election as to mode of trial, they receive a judicial undertaking that they will be provided a preliminary inquiry on request (para. 91), a practice which has no basis in the legislation. My colleague relies on transcript of the Court of Quebecs decision denying Mr. Archambault a preliminary inquiry, which occurred more than a year after he had reserved his election (para. 88). The submissions made on behalf of Mr. Archambault during that hearing are not evidence of what occurred at the time of the reserve. Even if there were evidence that the local practice of courts in Quebec actually creates, in accused persons, some kind of reasonable reliance, the right at issue is conferred by Parliament, not by the courts. Courts do not, through their informal practices and representations, have the power to vest a statutory right in an accused that was never extended to them by the legislation.\nConclusion on the Temporal Application of Section 535\nThe amendment to s. 535 was not purely procedural because it can interfere with a substantive legal interest by depriving an accused of the opportunity to be discharged at a preliminary inquiry. As that right vests only once a request for a preliminary inquiry is made, the new rule is presumed to apply unless the request has been made before the amendment came into force. \nTherefore, properly interpreted, the new limitation in s. 535 applies to all accused persons where a request for a preliminary inquiry was not made before the amendment came into force on September 19, 2019.\nApplication to the Respondents\nAs of September 19, 2019, no request for a preliminary inquiry had been made by Mr. Archambault, nor by Mr. Grenier. They each eventually made a request, but only months later. Can their reserve or deferral of their election, which occurred before September 19, 2019, amount to a request? In other words, is it possible, to characterize the reserve of the election of the mode of trial at first appearance in Quebec as the equivalent of a request for a preliminary inquiry as required by s. 535?\nAs noted above, a reserve amounts to delaying the accuseds election to a later date. It does not mean the accused has elected a mode of trial, or made their intention for a preliminary inquiry known. There is no factual basis on which this Court could conclude that a reserve or deferral of the election by the respondents indicated an actual desire to have a preliminary inquiry. In the case of Mr. Grenier, for example, the Court of Quebec merely noted on the indictment that at first appearance, he had [translation] postponed his election to a later date (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 7-8). The reserve or postponement of an election does not amount to an actual request for a preliminary inquiry for the purposes of s. 535 Cr. C. \nAssimilating a reserve to a request would effectively mean that the mere possibility of making a request is enough, despite the clear intent of Parliament to make the request an essential prerequisite to the existence of this statutory right. Merely leaving open the possibility that a request may be made in the future is insufficient for this purpose. \nThe respondents had no vested right at the time the new rule came into force, but merely the possibility of acquiring such a right had they made requests before the ninetieth day after its enactment. As this Court held in Expropriation Tribunal, at p. 742: A vested right . . . does not include a right which could have been exercised but was not, and which is no longer available under the law.\nInterpreting the New Rule\nHaving found that an accused in the circumstances of the respondents is subject to the new rule at s. 535, I turn to whether such an accused would be eligible for a preliminary inquiry in accordance with its terms. This question turns on whether they qualify as an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment within the meaning of s. 535. This case raises the issue squarely.\nMr. Grenier is charged with sexual interference and sexual assault, which, where the victim is a person under the age of 16 years, are now punishable by up to 14 years. As for Mr. Archambault, he is charged with indecent assault on another male person (who was under the age of 16 years at the time of the alleged offence), which has no modern equivalent. He argues that the alleged criminal conduct would likely now be charged under either s. 271 or ss. 151 to 153 of the Criminal Code (R.F. (Archambault), at para. 76); these offences are all now punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment.\nIn each case, the respondents have the benefit of s. 11(i) of the Charter which, consistent with the presumptions discussed above, limits their personal liability to the maximum term of imprisonment in force at the time of the commission of the offences charged. Thus, the respondents face a maximum of 10 years imprisonment in respect of each offence with which they are charged  although the acts they are alleged to have committed would, if committed today, each be punishable by imprisonment for a maximum of 14 years. None of the offences charged attract a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment.\nThe Crown submits that only an accused facing a personal liability of 14 years imprisonment or more for an offence can ask for a preliminary inquiry (A.F., at para. 120). For this new rule, the yardstick by which the seriousness of an offence is measured is the maximum sentence faced by the accused regarding that offence.\nThe respondents answer that Parliaments intent was to keep the availability of preliminary inquiries for the most serious offences, as determined by reference to contemporaneous societal values and the current maximum sentence of the offence (R.F. (Archambault), at paras. 82 and 89; R.F. (Grenier), at paras. 35-37). They agree with the intervener the Criminal Lawyers Association (Ontario) that the focus cannot be the personal liability of the accused, because what matters is the seriousness of the offence, not the offender (I.F., at para. 8, citing R. v. Windebank, 2021 ONCA 157, 154 O.R. (3d) 573, at paras. 36-37). The respondents submit that modern societal views on the seriousness of the offence are reflected in the sentencing principles and the actual sentences that an accused would receive today. In addition, they say it is not fair to penalize them based on the fact that they benefit from Charter rights.\nFor the reasons that follow, I conclude that the text in s. 535, read in context and in light of the purposes of the provision, requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years imprisonment in respect of the offence for a preliminary inquiry to be available. Parliament intended for only those accused facing greater maximum jeopardy to retain the benefit of a preliminary inquiry.\nThe 14-Year Imprisonment Threshold\nThis issue requires interpreting the scope of the 14-year imprisonment threshold in s. 535 of the Criminal Code. While the respondents and the Crown agree that the maximum penalty has been used in s. 535 as a marker of the seriousness of the offences for which preliminary inquiries remain available (A.F., at paras. 108-11; R.F. (Archambault), at para. 77; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 37), the question is whether the maximum penalty is that of the specific offence with which the accused is charged  or whether it is that of the broader class of offence. In undertaking this statutory interpretation exercise, I will consider the text, context and purpose of the provision, and then address specific concerns raised by the parties.\nI turn first to the text of s. 535. A preliminary inquiry is only available when an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment is before a justice and a request has been made for a preliminary inquiry under subsection 536(4). The French text similarly centres on un prevenu inculpe dun acte criminel passible dun emprisonnement de quatorze ans ou plus. The focus of the text is on the accused and the accuseds proceedings: the offence with which an accused . . . is charged, and whether a request has been made for them to have a preliminary inquiry. It is not focused on hypotheticals or the general nature of the offence. The indictment sets out the particulars (including the date) of the offence that the accused must answer and limits the criminal proceedings. As illustrated in the case of Mr. Archambault, there is no modern equivalent to the offence with which he is charged; he is charged with indecent assault on another male person, which is punishable by 10 years imprisonment. \nOf course, the seriousness of an offence is not measured in reference to the individual circumstances surrounding the offender, such as the possibility of a dangerous offender designation (Windebank, at paras. 35-37). Rather, as Nordheimer J.A. explained in R. v. S.S., 2021 ONCA 479, 493 C.R.R. (2d) 251, the relevance of the accused is that the provision speaks to the specific offence with which that accused actually has been charged (para. 19), as opposed to a hypothetical offence involving the similar alleged actions occurring in the present day.\nThis interpretation of these words in the Criminal Code is also consistent with how those words have been understood in other statutes dealing with similar subject matter. The presumption of consistent expression provides that the meaning of recurring patterns of expression is presumed to remain the same both within a statute and across statutes (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 44). \nIn Tran, this Court was concerned with s. 36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, which defined the serious criminality of a permanent resident or foreign national to include having been convicted . . . of an offence . . . punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years. The maximum penalty for the offence with which Mr. Tran was convicted had been raised from a maximum term of imprisonment of 7 to 14 years between its commission and sentencing. This Court unanimously concluded Mr. Trans conviction did not fall under the umbrella of serious criminality, within the meaning of s. 36(1)(a), as the only acceptable interpretation was that the provision referred to the maximum term that [Mr. Tran] could have received at the time of the commission of the offence (para. 35). The language of the provision was taken to refer to the circumstances of the offender, i.e., the maximum penalty he had faced, rather than the abstract maximum penalty (para. 38).\nThere is no reason to think Parliament meant something different in s. 535 of the Criminal Code by the analogous formulation an accused who is charged with an indictable offence that is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment. That s. 36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act speaks to the relevant offences after conviction, while s. 535 speaks to offences on which persons have been charged but not convicted, is a distinction without a difference. In both contexts Parliament is distinguishing offences based on their severity in reference to their maximum term of imprisonment. This Court held in Tran we must look to the actual offence committed by the person directly referenced in the provision, not a hypothetical offence committed in other circumstances where it would attract a higher maximum sentence.\nThis focus on the specific proceedings of the accused also follows the broader context of the new provision, which makes clear that preliminary inquiries are now generally unavailable. Their availability is now restricted only to those accused who meet specific and clear conditions. The accuseds personal jeopardy is usually readily ascertainable. The maximum liability of the offence with which an accused has actually been charged and convicted must be determined in sentencing them. If the accused may be liable for at least 14 years of imprisonment in respect of an offence charged, then a preliminary inquiry should be available if either the accused or the prosecution requests one. \nThus, I disagree with the intervenor the Criminal Lawyers Association (Ontario) that relying on personal liability would lead to uncertainty or absurd results, for example when the dates of the offence straddle the date of the increase in the maximum penalty (I.F., at paras. 13-17). Rather, it is determining maximum liability by reference to a hypothetical that introduces uncertainty: what would the maximum punishment be for the alleged conduct underlying those offences if that conduct occurred in the present day, or on September 19, 2019, the date s. 535 came into force? Obviously, an accused actually facing 14 years imprisonment (no matter when s. 535 came into force) should have the right to request a preliminary inquiry. The efficiency and coherence of the scheme is focused on maintaining the benefit of a preliminary inquiry for the accused facing serious jeopardy, where the preliminary inquiry is requested.\nFinally, the overall purpose of limiting the availability of the preliminary inquiry was to reduce delays, to alleviate the burden of witnesses and victims of testifying twice, and more generally, to improve the efficiency of the criminal justice system (see R. v. C.T.B., 2021 NSCA 58, at para. 39; Windebank, at paras. 19-22; S.S., at para. 14). In limiting the availability of a preliminary inquiry, Parliament decided that it was not a necessary procedural step to a fair trial.\nThese broader purposes in reducing the availability of the preliminary inquiry inform the specific objectives of s. 535. Although Parliament kept the availability of preliminary inquiries in serious cases, the exception for serious offences must itself be read in light of the problem [the legislation] was intended to address (Canada 3000 Inc. (Re), 2006 SCC 24, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865, at para. 36). \nThus, s. 535 represents an exception for serious offences. While Parliament was seeking to reduce systemic obstacles to the Charter right to a trial without unreasonable delay, the exception recognizes that a preliminary inquiry can still be of significant benefit to an accused facing more significant legal jeopardy. The Parliamentary debates reveal a key concern that the rule limiting access to preliminary inquiries be clear and certain. Other proposed amendments to Bill C-75, which would have expanded the eligibility for preliminary inquiries based on the opinion of the justice as to the best interests of the administration of justice, were ultimately not adopted by Parliament (Windebank, at paras. 24-25). In speaking against that proposal, the Minister of Justice expressed the concern that their complex criteria would lead to further litigation and delay (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 435, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., June 17, 2019, at p. 29245). Given these purposes, it is difficult to accept that Parliament adopted a threshold meant to invite a hypothetical inquiry into what the maximum sentence for the accused would have been had it occurred at another time.\nThe respondents and the interveners Association quebecoise des avocats et avocates de la defense (AQAAD) and Association des avocats de la defense de Montreal-Laval-Longueuil (AADM) argue those accused of historical child sexual offences, even where they benefit from a lesser maximum punishment, actually face the same criminal jeopardy as those accused of more recent offences, since a judge considers the current maximum liability in determining the proper sentence (R.F. (Archambault), at para. 93; I.F. (AQAAQ and AADM), at para. 13). The actual sentences imposed  and the associated stigma  will be more severe than they would have been at the time of the commission of the offence (R.F. (Grenier), at para. 37).\nGranted, in exercising discretion in sentencing, a sentencing judge must consider the current values of society, as reflected by the maximum sentences in force for the offence (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 100; see also R. v. Bertrand Marchand, 2023 SCC 26, at paras. 31, 46-47, 153 and 167-68; Poulin, at paras. 3-5). Sentences must not only be proportionate to an individuals culpability (Cr. C., s. 718.1), they must serve sentencings fundamental purpose of maintaining a just, peaceful and safe society (s. 718). In particular, for sexual offences against children, sentencing serves the primary objectives of denunciation and deterrence (s. 718.01). The principle of parity requires that courts impose similar sentences for similar offenders in similar circumstances (s. 718.2(b)). By nature, the courts role in sentencing includes consideration of societys legitimate shared values and concerns (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 49; see also R. v. Stuckless, 2019 ONCA 504, 146 O.R. (3d) 752, at para. 112). \nBut sentencing principles and societal values are of little assistance in interpreting the intention of Parliament under s. 535. The proxy for seriousness selected by Parliament here is the maximum sentence carried by the offence charged  not the fit sentence. The maximum sentence is not determined in reference to the discretionary sentencing regime. Even if the fit sentence would now be more severe than it would have been at the time of the commission of the offence, the maximum sentence the accused faces is the same. To ensure its objective of a clear and predictable standard on which to determine eligibility for a preliminary inquiry, Parliament opted to focus on the maximum sentence. Sentencing principles do not help to interpret this statutory right to a preliminary inquiry which is determined by reference to the maximum penalty an accused faces for the conduct that gives rise to the offence with which they are charged.\nThe respondents argue that it would be unfair to penalize accused persons, by denying them a preliminary inquiry, simply because they benefit from the protection under s. 11(i) of the Charter (R.F. (Archambault), at paras. 83-85; R.F. (Grenier), at para. 50). In my view, however, the respondents are not penalized; they are simply in the same position of any accused who faces a maximum sentence of less than 14 years.\nSection 11(i) of the Charter provides: Any person charged with an offence has the right . . . if found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment. Even setting aside the constitutional protection provided by s. 11(i), there is a common law rule that an accuseds penal consequences must generally be determined in reference to the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence (Poulin, at para. 60; K.R.J., at para. 22). An accused would, presumptively, still be liable only for the lesser punishment in force at the time of the commission of the offence (S.S., at para. 16; C.T.B., at paras. 25, 34 and 45-46; Interpretation Act, s. 43(d) and (e)), in this case a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.\nThat the same type of alleged criminal conduct would today give rise to the benefit of a preliminary inquiry works no injustice, as contemporaneous offenders face greater jeopardy, as reflected by the current 14-year maximum sentence. The result for both offenders may be different, but they are treated fairly [and] they each receive protections which are connected to them and their proceedings (Poulin, at para. 96 (emphasis deleted)). \nThus, I cannot accept the interpretation urged by the respondents. It contradicts the ordinary meaning of the text and would blunt Parliaments goals of reducing the number of preliminary inquiries and of creating a clear criterion limiting eligibility for a preliminary inquiry.\nThe 14-year requirement imposed by s. 535, read in its entire context, leaves room for only one interpretation. Parliament chose to restrict preliminary inquiries based not on the general nature of the conduct underlying the offence, as it could have done, but through the proxy of the maximum jeopardy faced by an accused for the actual offence with which they are charged. I agree with the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that the requirement imposed by the text of s. 535 is clear and unequivocal (C.T.B., at para. 38; see also S.S., at paras. 15-16). As noted in S.S., to achieve its purpose of restricting the entitlement to preliminary inquiries, Parliament expressly coupled [that] entitlement . . . to the maximum sentence for the offence charged (para. 15; see also C.T.B., at para. 29). \nI conclude that an accused has the right to make a request for a preliminary inquiry if charged with an offence for which their maximum sentence is imprisonment of 14 years or more. \nApplication to the Respondents\nHere, neither respondents request for a preliminary inquiry met the requirements of the new s. 535, as the offences with which they are charged are each punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. Mr. Grenier, even though the alleged offences with which he is charged would now each be punishable by up to 14 years if they occurred today, benefits from the lesser sentences in force at the time of the alleged commission of the offences. Mr. Archambault is charged under a section of the Criminal Code that has been repealed, but the alleged offence with which he is charged remains punishable by 10 years imprisonment. Even if we were to conclude that the impugned conduct underlying this offence, if it happened today, would be an offence punishable by a term of 14 years, Mr. Archambault is not subject to that jeopardy.\nConclusion\nThe respondents had no right to preliminary inquiries. As no request had been made before the coming into force of the new s. 535, their proceedings were governed by the new limitation on the availability of preliminary inquiries. These respondents are not charged with an offence for which they are punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment and do not meet the requirements for eligibility under the new rule. The Court of Appeal erred in remitting the respondents files for preliminary inquiries.\nI would allow the appeal. As the appeal is moot, I would make no further order.\n\tAppeal dismissed, Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, Longueuil.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent Agenor Archambault: Melina Le Blanc, Montreal; Hugo T.

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Clarifies the Temporal Application of Amendments to Section 535 of the Criminal Code\n\nThis appeal concerns the temporal application of amendments to Section 535 of the Canadian Criminal Code and the interpretation of the new provision, including the scope of cases in which a preliminary inquiry remains available.\n\nThe respondents, Agenor Archambault and Gilles Grenier, were charged with historical sexual offences against children, which at the time of their commission carried a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. However, the maximum penalty for these offences was later increased to 14 years. The respondents first appeared in the Court of Quebec in the summer of 2019 and reserved or postponed their right to elect their mode of trial to a later date. After the amendment to section 535 came into force on September 19, 2019, the respondents requested a preliminary inquiry, but the Crown argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry under the new rule.\n\nThe Court of Quebec held that the new section 535 applied to the respondents and that it lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. The respondents challenged this decision, and the Court of Appeal concluded that the new rule did not apply to the respondents and that they had a vested right to preliminary inquiries. The Court of Appeal remitted the files to the Court of Quebec for preliminary inquiries. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the respondents had no right to a preliminary inquiry because they were not charged with offences for which they could be personally liable to 14 years or more of imprisonment.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada considered the temporal application of the new section 535 and the interpretation of the 14-year imprisonment threshold. The court held that the new rule applies to accused persons where no request for a preliminary inquiry was made prior to its coming into force. The court also held that the 14-year imprisonment threshold refers to the maximum sentence faced by the accused regarding the actual offence with which they are charged, rather than the maximum sentence that could have been imposed if the offence had been committed at a different time.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that the right to a preliminary inquiry vests at the time charges are laid and is considered a substantive right that can interfere with an individual's liberty and security. The amendment to section 535 of the Criminal Code cannot be considered purely procedural and does not apply retroactively to cases where the charging of the accused occurred before its coming into force.\n\nWriting for the majority, the court held that the respondents had a vested right to a preliminary inquiry, as this right crystallizes at the time charges are laid. The majority concluded that the legislative amendment does not eliminate the right to a preliminary inquiry for accused persons charged before it came into force, and that the amendment is procedural in nature but affects a substantive right. The majority also interpreted the scope of section 535 of the Criminal Code, holding that an accused has the right to a preliminary inquiry if their alleged offense, or its equivalent, is punishable by 14 years or more of imprisonment, and that this right is not affected by the accused's right to the benefit of the lesser punishment.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that new restrictions on the availability of preliminary inquiries do not apply  to certain ongoing criminal proceedings.</strong>This is an appeal about the interpretation of a new rule limiting  who is eligible to have a preliminary inquiry as part of their criminal  proceedings. A preliminary inquiry is a hearing before a court to determine  whether there is enough evidence against an accused person to proceed with a  trial.In unrelated cases, Ag\u00e9nor Archambault and  Gilles Grenier were charged with one or more historical sexual offences against  a child. After the dates of the alleged offences and before charges were laid in  2019, the maximum penalty for the impugned conduct was increased from 10 to 14  years\u2019 imprisonment. Since the law in place at the time  of the alleged crime governs the maximum sentence, the maximum that applies to  the cases of Mr. Archambault and Mr. Grenier is 10 years, not 14 years.In 2020, Mr.\u00a0Archambault and  Mr.\u00a0Grenier each requested a preliminary inquiry. However, under an  amendment to s.\u00a0535 of the <em>Criminal  Code</em> that took effect on September 19, 2019, the availability of  preliminary inquiries was now restricted to accused persons charged with  offences with a maximum penalty of 14 years or more of imprisonment. In both cases,  the Crown argued that, under the amended version of s.\u00a0535, the court  could not hold a preliminary inquiry.The Court of Qu\u00e9bec held that the new  s.\u00a0535 applied to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier and that it  lacked jurisdiction to preside over the preliminary inquiry. Both of them  challenged that interpretation before the Superior Court but were unsuccessful.  They argued that they had the right to a preliminary inquiry because the new  rule in s. 535 did not apply to their proceedings. They also argued that even  under the new rule they were still entitled to a preliminary inquiry. They said  their offences should be considered punishable by 14 years or more for the  purposes of the new rule.The Court of Appeal  allowed their further appeals and sent the cases back to the Court of Qu\u00e9bec  for preliminary inquiries. The  Court of Appeal concluded that the amended version of s.\u00a0535 did not apply  to Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier. They had an entitlement to  preliminary inquiries before s.\u00a0535 was amended. The Court of Appeal  decided that the entitlement to a preliminary inquiry is based on the date of  the alleged offence. Given its conclusion, the Court of Appeal did not address  the question of how the amended version of s.\u00a0535 should be interpreted.The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that Mr.\u00a0Archambault and Mr.\u00a0Grenier were not entitled to a preliminary inquiry. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>A  preliminary inquiry is available where the person is charged with an offence for  which they actually face a maximum sentence of at least 14 years</strong><strong> and in some other cases on  a transitional basis.</strong>A majority of the Court held that both Mr.  Archambault and Mr. Grenier were entitled to the preliminary inquiries they  requested. The old version of s. 535 continued to apply to them, rather than  the new rule. The fact that they had not requested a preliminary inquiry before  the change in the law was not determinative of their entitlement to preliminary  inquiries.A different majority of the  Court held that neither Mr. Archambault nor Mr. Grenier was eligible for a  preliminary inquiry under the new rule if it applied, as the offences were each  punishable by a maximum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. The new rule in s. 535  requires that the accused actually be liable to 14 or more years\u2019 imprisonment  in respect of the offence with which they are charged for a preliminary inquiry  to be available."

Wolfe\n2024 SCC 34\nFile No.: 40558.\n2024: March 26; 2024: October 18.\nPresent: Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Cote, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ.\non appeal from the court of appeal for saskatchewan\n\tCriminal law  Sentencing  Criminal negligence  Driving prohibition  Criminal Code permitting discretionary driving prohibition to be imposed as sentence for several enumerated offences  Enumerated offences including dangerous operation of conveyance but not criminal negligence causing death or criminal negligence causing bodily harm  Accused convicted of criminal negligence causing death and causing bodily harm for role in head-on collision  Trial judge imposing driving prohibition  Whether driving prohibition may be imposed upon conviction for criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm in operation of conveyance  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 320.24(4).\n\tThe accused drove on the wrong side of a divided highway and caused a head-on collision, killing two people and seriously injuring another. He was found guilty of two counts of criminal negligence causing death contrary to s. 220 of the Criminal Code and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to s. 221. In his reasons, the trial judge alternatively held that, if his analysis of the criminal negligence counts set out in the indictment was faulty, then he would convict the accused of two counts of dangerous driving causing death contrary to s. 320.13(3) and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily injury contrary to s. 320.13(4). In addition to sentencing the accused to terms of imprisonment, the trial judge issued a driving prohibition order imposing concurrent 10-year driving prohibitions for each criminal negligence causing death count and a concurrent 7-year prohibition for the criminal negligence causing bodily harm count.\n\tThe Court of Appeal dismissed the accuseds sentence appeal. With respect to the availability of the driving prohibition order, the court interpreted s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, which permits sentencing judges to impose a discretionary driving prohibition where an offender has been found guilty of one of the provisions enumerated offences, as authorizing that order, even though the offences in ss. 220 and 221 are not enumerated offences. It held that the criminal negligence convictions under ss. 220 and 221 necessarily included a finding of guilt for the lesser and included offence of dangerous driving under s. 320.13, which is enumerated.\n\tHeld (Cote, Kasirer, Jamal and Moreau JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the driving prohibition order set aside.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin and OBonsawin JJ.: The driving prohibitions imposed on the accused were unlawful. The accused was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which are not enumerated offences under s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code. He was not found guilty of an enumerated offence within the meaning of that provision. Accordingly, discretionary driving prohibitions were not available as a sentencing option.\n\tBill C-46, which introduced s. 320.24 into the Criminal Code in 2018, contained a complete overhaul of the Criminal Codes driving provisions. All of the former driving-related offences were repealed and re-enacted under Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code to ensure a clear, coherent structure in an area that had become complex and difficult to understand. Bill C-46 made two noteworthy changes to discretionary driving prohibition orders. First, the new s. 320.24 enumerates fewer offences that are eligible for that punishment. Removed from the list previously found in the former s. 259(2) are the general offences of criminal negligence causing death, criminal negligence causing bodily harm and manslaughter. Second, the description of the event that triggers the provisions operation has been modified, in English, from convicted or discharged of an enumerated offence to found guilty, and in French from declare coupable ou absous to declare coupable.\n\tDetermining whether s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code now permits a discretionary driving prohibition upon a conviction for criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm requires the Court to interpret s. 320.24(4) by employing longstanding principles of statutory interpretation. Words of a statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.\n\tWith respect to the text, s. 320.24(4) expressly enumerates 12 offences for which a discretionary driving prohibition is available and authorized; on its face a closed list that does not include s. 220 or s. 221. Where express reference is expected, the court can infer that the failure to mention something is a deliberate decision to exclude it. Furthermore, Parliaments usual practice is to specify available punishments expressly. If Parliament wished to enable driving prohibitions for criminal negligence convictions, it would have expressly listed ss. 220 and 221 in s. 320.24(4). As well, Parliament chose to remove ss. 220 and 221 from the list of enumerated provisions when it enacted s. 320.24(4). It is well established that prior enactments may throw some light on the intention of Parliament in repealing and replacing a statute. This textual evolution is consistent with legislative intention to exclude the general offences of criminal negligence and manslaughter from the ambit of s. 320.24(4).\n\tThe availability of a discretionary driving prohibition for a criminal negligence conviction is not implied through Parliaments use of the term found guilty in s. 324.24(4). Findings of guilt and convictions are conceptually distinct. A finding of guilt is a verdict following trial that occurs when the essential elements of the offence have been proven. A conviction is a final judgment of the court by which a finding of guilt is entered. A finding of guilt can lead to several different outcomes, including a conviction and sentence or a stay of proceedings or an absolute or conditional discharge. This distinction however offers little assistance because s. 320.24(4) plainly indicates that a discretionary driving prohibition is available when an offender has been found guilty of an enumerated offence. What must be considered is whether an offender is found guilty of an enumerated offence under s. 320.24(4) when convicted of an unenumerated offence for which an enumerated offence is included.\n\tThe included offence machinery in s. 662 of the Criminal Code does not facilitate the imposition of punishment by implication. Section 662 signals that the function of the included offence provisions is limited to situations where a charged offence is not proved. It makes clear that only where the evidence does not prove criminal negligence or manslaughter does it become possible to convict the accused of the included dangerous operation offence. This provides fair notice of an alternate pathway to a guilty verdict but it is not at all clear this gives notice of liability for punishments attached uniquely to included offences if convicted of the charged offence. Accused persons must be informed in advance and in a non-ambiguous manner of the punishments they are liable to if convicted of a particular offence. The included offence machinery should not be extended beyond situations where the charged offence is not proved absent a clear legislative signal.\n\tAn additional signal of Parliaments intent is that, when an offender is found guilty of an offence enumerated in s. 320.24(4), a driving prohibition can be imposed in addition to any other punishment for that offence. Criminal negligence is not enumerated; it cannot qualify as that offence. As well, the French version of s. 320.24(4) is equally authoritative and must be considered. With Bill C-46, there was no change to the declare coupable language akin to the switch in English from convicted or discharged to found guilty. This renders unpersuasive the argument that Parliament employed the distinction between concepts of conviction and guilt to create a new approach for imposing driving prohibitions. The text of s. 320.24(4) as a whole is clear and does not reveal any ambiguity. Criminal negligence offences are no longer listed as offences that can attract a discretionary driving prohibition and the use of found guilty strongly points to the need for an express judicial determination of guilt on an offence stipulated in the charging document or an included offence where the charged offence is not proved.\n\tStatutory interpretation also requires considering context, purpose, and relevant legal norms. Several considerations stemming from surrounding statutory context and criminal law principles shed light on s. 320.24(4), such as s. 320.24(1) and s. 320.25, as well as the Kienapple principle. Statutory interpretations that are consistent with or promote legislative purpose should be adopted. Bill C-46 raised certain maximum penalties and it is significant that penalties for the dangerous operation offences are now greater than or equal to those available for the criminal negligence offences. These changes further Parliaments objectives of developing a simplified, coherent, and efficient driving offence scheme under a single part of the Criminal Code. They signal that dangerous driving is best addressed by resorting to the dangerous operation offences under s. 320.13, which have been made more versatile and consistent with other driving offences resulting in similar harm. The exclusion of the criminal negligence offences from the ambit of s. 320.24(4) is therefore neither inconsistent with legislative purpose nor an absurdity.\n\tPer Cote, Kasirer, Jamal and Moreau JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. Section 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, properly interpreted, authorizes a driving prohibition order where an offender is convicted under ss. 220 or 221 of the Criminal Code. A finding of guilt for a principal offence necessarily entails findings of guilt for any lesser included offences. Under s. 662(5) of the Criminal Code, dangerous operation of a conveyance contrary to s. 320.13 is a lesser included offence of criminal negligence through the operation of a conveyance under ss. 220 and 221. Therefore, a finding of guilt in respect of criminal negligence through the operation of a conveyance necessarily entails a finding of guilt in respect of dangerous operation of a conveyance.\n\tThe modern approach to statutory interpretation entails discerning legislative intent by examining statutory text in its entire context and in its grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statutes scheme and objects. The plain meaning of the text is not in itself determinative. To ascertain legislative intent, the text of a provision must be placed in context and tested against other indicators of legislative meaning, including legislative objectives. The consequences of adopting a particular interpretation serve as an important interpretive aid. Consequences consistent with the purpose and scheme of the legislation are presumed to have been intended whereas consequences that are absurd or otherwise unacceptable are presumed not to have been intended.\n\tThere is a meaningful distinction between a finding of guilt and a conviction or discharge for the purpose of s. 320.24(4)  they are distinct concepts and are not interchangeable. The change from convicted or discharged in the former s. 259(2) to found guilty in s. 320.24(4) indicates that, for a valid driving prohibition order to be imposed, only a finding of guilt for a listed offence is required and a driving prohibition order may be imposed prior to the entry of a conviction. Several examples in the Criminal Code and the Youth Criminal Justice Act demonstrate that a conviction does not necessarily flow from a finding of guilt. However, when a conviction for an offence is recorded, it will always mean that the offender has been found guilty of that offence. Further, a conviction or discharge is not always necessary for a penalty to be imposed. Section 320.23 permits delaying sentencing for an offence in the operation of a conveyance to allow opportunity to attend a treatment program and apply for a medical discharge.\n\tThe use of declare coupable in the French version of 320.24(4) and its predecessor does not assist in determining whether Parliament intended to create a new approach. A declaration de culpabilite can refer either to a finding of guilt or a conviction. The change in the English wording from convicted or discharged to found guilty informs the interpretation of declare coupable and suggests that it now refers to a finding of guilt in the context of s. 320.24(4).\n\tA finding of guilt for a principal offence necessitates, by operation of law, findings of guilt for all lesser included offences. By definition, all elements of the lesser included offence are contained in the elements of the principal offence. As well, an indictment charging an offence also charges all lesser included offences, because they are necessarily committed in the commission of the principal offence. It is appropriate therefore for a penalty for a lesser included offence to formally attach to the principal offence. Section 662(5) explicitly makes dangerous operation of a conveyance under s. 320.13 a lesser included offence to criminal negligence where the offence involves the operation of a conveyance. This necessitates that if an individual is convicted under ss. 220 or 221, they are by operation of law found guilty of the offence under s. 320.13. It is impossible to act in a criminally negligent manner through the operation of a conveyance without dangerously operating a conveyance.\n\tParliaments choice not to expressly list ss. 220 and 221 in s. 320.24(4) signals an intention to include criminal negligence through the inclusion of dangerous operation under 320.13 in the listed offences. Parliament has determined that only a finding of guilt for one of the listed offences is required for a driving prohibition order to be imposed. This is consistent with criminal law principles including the requirement of fair notice, recognition of lesser included offences, and the rule against multiple convictions set out in Kienapple. The text of s. 662(5) and an indictment charging s. 220 or 221 offences provide adequate notice that a court may impose a driving prohibition order following a conviction for criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm where it arises out of the operation of a conveyance. Where an offender is found guilty through the operation of s. 662(5) of the lesser included offence, a driving prohibition order is required by the text of s. 320.24(4) as a punishment for that offence because it is one of the listed offences in s. 320.24(4). The driving prohibition order attaches to the conviction for criminal negligence.\n\tAn interpretation of s. 320.24(4) that does not authorize driving prohibition orders as a penalty for criminal negligence through the operation of a conveyance produces an absurd consequence. It creates an irrational distinction by authorizing a sanction for a lesser included offence, but not the more serious principal offence. It is inconsistent with Parliaments stated purposes for enacting Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code of reducing the significant number of deaths and injuries caused by impaired driving. Nor is it sufficiently clear that Parliament intended to signal through Bill C-46 that the Crown should resort to charging dangerous operation in preference to criminal negligence. Finally, the absence of the ss. 220 and 221 offences among the listed offences in s. 320.24(4) is not indicative of a drafting error that creates a legislative gap because no gap exists if s. 320.24(4) is properly read with s. 662(5).\nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\n\tReferred to: R. v.

Little and Katherine Pocha, for the appellant.\n\tPouria Tabrizi-Reardigan, for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin and OBonsawin JJ. was delivered by\n\tMartin J.  \nOverview\nThe Court is called upon to decide between competing interpretations of s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. This provision, which came into force in 2018 following the adoption of Bill C-46, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (offences relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2018, c. 21, permits sentencing judges to impose a discretionary driving prohibition where an offender has been found guilty of one of the provisions enumerated offences, an express list of driving-specific offences which includes dangerous operation of a conveyance contrary to s. 320.13. The former s. 259(2) provided for the ability to impose a prohibition where an offender had been convicted or discharged of a broader list of enumerated offences. Three general offences that apply beyond driving cases are no longer included in the list of offences that can attract a driving prohibition under the new s. 320.24(4): criminal negligence causing death (s. 220), criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221), and manslaughter (s. 236). \nThe appellant, Braydon Wolfe, was convicted of general criminal negligence-based offences, which are no longer expressly listed as giving rise to a discretionary driving prohibition under the new Criminal Code provision. The issue before this Court is whether, in addition to his term of imprisonment, it remains lawful to impose the further punishment of a driving prohibition upon him.\nThe Court of Appeal for Saskatchewans interpretation of s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code preserves the ability of sentencing judges to impose a driving prohibition on an offender convicted of driving-related criminal negligence. The Court of Appeal upheld the prohibition imposed on the appellant on the basis that his criminal negligence convictions in this context necessarily included findings of guilt for the included offence of dangerous operation, which is enumerated under s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code. \nConversely, in other cases, the Court of Appeal for Ontario and Court of Appeal for British Columbia have rejected the result and the reasoning adopted by the Saskatchewan court (R. v. Boily, 2022 ONCA 611, 163 O.R. (3d) 161; R. v. Francisco, 2023 BCCA 450, 433 C.C.C. (3d) 1).\nI conclude that the driving prohibitions imposed on the appellant were unlawful. Criminal negligence offences are no longer listed under s. 320.24(4) as offences that can attract a driving prohibition. The Crowns proposed interpretation depends on the proposition that, following the enactment of Bill C-46, Parliaments use of the term found guilty permits punishment to be imposed by implication and indirectly, rather than expressly and directly. This interpretation is implausible; it conflicts with the text of s. 320.24(4), sits in tension with the surrounding statutory context and purpose, and fails to fully accord with criminal law principles. \nWith Bill C-46, Parliament endeavoured to create a clear, coherent, and self-contained scheme for driving offences. Driving-specific offences were reorganized into a new part of the Criminal Code, they were made more versatile through hybridization, and their maximum penalties were increased. It is neither absurd nor inconsistent with legislative purpose to exclude criminal negligence and manslaughter  general offences that are not limited to driving cases  from the ambit of s. 320.24(4). Nor has it been shown that Parliament made a mistake in drafting the provision by somehow inadvertently omitting the previously enumerated offences from the new sections express list of captured offences. Rather, Parliament has broadly signalled through Bill C-46 that resorting to specific driving-related offences is preferable to general criminal negligence offences in driving cases. The changes to the availability of discretionary driving prohibitions reflect a logical and deliberate choice to limit driving-specific punishments to driving-specific offences. This is a choice Parliament was free to make.\nFor the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.\nBackground\nThe Relevant Legislation at Issue on This Appeal\nThe Criminal Codes driving-related provisions, which lie at the heart of this appeal, developed gradually and intermittently over a century. The Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, contained one of the first driving offences: causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving, or racing or other wilful misconduct while having the charge of any carriage or vehicle, which carried a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment (s. 253). Impaired driving was addressed for the first time in 1921 with the enactment of a prohibition on driving while intoxicated (S.C. 1921, c. 25, s. 3). In 1938, Parliament criminalized dangerous driving  defined as driving a motor vehicle recklessly, or in a manner which is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances of the case  regardless of whether death or injury ensued (S.C. 1938, c. 44, s. 16). Offenders were liable to up to two years imprisonment, a fine of up to $1,000, and a driving prohibition of up to three years.\nBoth prior to and following the introduction of the first dangerous driving and impaired driving offences, the Crown could prosecute serious driving-related misconduct that caused death or bodily harm by resorting to the manslaughter and criminal negligence offences (see K. Jokinen and P. Keen, Impaired Driving and Other Criminal Code Driving Offences (2nd ed. 2023), at p. 7). These offences carried significant maximum penalties of imprisonment, including life sentences (in cases where the driver caused death).\nOver time, there were gradual legislative reforms to the dangerous driving and impaired driving offences to account for developing consensus on what constitutes impairment, scientific advancements in breath testing, and a greater understanding of the harms caused by driving-related misconduct (see Jokinen and Keen, at pp. 8-12; Department of Justice Canada, Legislative Background: reforms to the Transportation Provisions of the Criminal Code (Bill C-46) (2017), at pp. 4-5). Maximum penalties were increased. The furious driving and dangerous driving offences were consolidated in 1954 into the offence of criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle, increasing the maximum term of imprisonment to five years (Criminal Code, S.C. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 221(1)). The enactment of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1985, R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 36, further increased penalties and trifurcated the offence into three separate dangerous operation offences: dangerous operation simpliciter (a hybrid offence that, when prosecuted by indictment, attracted a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment), dangerous operation causing bodily harm (10-year maximum), and dangerous operation causing death (14-year maximum) (s. 249).\nOver 30 years later, the government proposed Bill C-46  a comprehensive revision to the Criminal Codes driving-related provisions. The legislation proposed major changes (1) concerning the detection and prosecution of drug-impaired driving to coincide with the coming into force of the Cannabis Act, S.C. 2018, c. 16; and (2) authorizing mandatory roadside alcohol screening. These two proposals were largely the focus of the legislative debates. \nHowever, Bill C-46 also contained a complete overhaul of the Criminal Codes driving provisions. All of the former driving-related offences were to be repealed and re-enacted under the new Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code (Offences Relating to Conveyances). The Minister of Justice explained that this part of the bills purpose was to ensure a clear, coherent structure in an area that has become too complex and difficult to understand (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 181, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 19, 2017, at p. 11459 (Hon. J. Wilson-Raybould)). Speaking about the impaired driving regime in particular, the Minister noted:\nThis area of the criminal law perplexes even the most seasoned criminal professionals. It has developed in a piecemeal fashion since the first offence was enacted in 1921. It has never been comprehensively reformed, and according to a 1991 report by the former Law Reform Commission, its provisions are virtually unreadable.\n\nThis state of affairs cannot be permitted to continue, especially in the area of criminal law that is among the most litigated. Bill C-46 proposes to create a clear, simplified, and modernized legislative framework to ensure that the public can better understand the law and also ensure that the police can effectively enforce it.\n\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 224, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., October 27, 2017, at p. 14638 (Hon. J. Wilson-Raybould); see also Law Reform Commission of Canada, Report on Recodifying Criminal Procedure, vol. 1, Police Powers (1991), at p. 84; Legislative Background: reforms to the Transportation Provisions of the Criminal Code (Bill C-46), at p. 11.) \nBill C-46 was adopted by Parliament, and the new Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code came into force on December 18, 2018. Various maximum and minimum penalties were increased by the legislation. For example, the maximum punishment for the indictable offence of dangerous operation causing death (contrary to s. 320.13(3)) was increased from 14 years imprisonment to life imprisonment  consistent with the maximum penalties available for impaired operation causing death (s. 320.14(3)) and criminal negligence causing death (s. 220). The offence of dangerous operation causing bodily harm (contrary to s. 320.13(2)) was transformed into a hybrid offence, and its maximum penalty, when prosecuted by indictment, was increased to 14 years imprisonment (from the previous 10-year maximum). This 14-year maximum is now equal to the potential punishment for impaired operation causing bodily harm (s. 320.14(2)) and exceeds that of criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221).\nBill C-46 also made changes to driving prohibition orders. The new s. 320.24 governs the availability of such orders. Offenders found guilty of impaired operation simpliciter (s. 320.14(1)) or failing to comply with a breath demand simpliciter (s. 320.15(1)) are subject to a mandatory prohibition order under s. 320.24(1). For other driving-related offences, a sentencing judge has the discretion to impose an order under s. 320.24(4), which reads:\n(4) If an offender is found guilty of an offence under section 320.13, subsection 320.14(2) or (3), 320.15(2) or (3) or under any of sections 320.16 to 320.18, the court that sentences the offender may, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating the type of conveyance in question during a period to be determined in accordance with subsection (5).\n\n(4) Le tribunal qui inflige une peine au contrevenant declare coupable dune infraction prevue a larticle 320.13, aux paragraphes 320.14(2) ou (3) ou 320.15(2) ou (3), ou a lun des articles 320.16 a 320.18 peut rendre, en plus de toute autre peine applicable a cette infraction, une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire le moyen de transport en cause durant la periode etablie conformement au paragraphe (5).\nPrior to Bill C-46, discretionary driving prohibitions were an available sentencing tool under s. 259(2):\n(2) If an offender is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under section 220, 221, 236, 249, 249.1, 250, 251 or 252 or any of subsections 255(2) to (3.2) committed by means of a motor vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment, the court that sentences the offender may, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place, or from operating a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment, as the case may be . . . .\n\n(2) Lorsquun contrevenant est declare coupable ou absous sous le regime de larticle 730 dune infraction prevue aux articles 220, 221, 236, 249, 249.1, 250, 251 ou 252 ou a lun des paragraphes 255(2) a (3.2) commise au moyen dun vehicule a moteur, dun bateau, dun aeronef ou de materiel ferroviaire, le tribunal qui lui inflige une peine peut, en plus de toute autre peine applicable en lespece, rendre une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire un vehicule a moteur dans une rue, sur un chemin ou une grande route ou dans tout autre lieu public, un bateau, un aeronef ou du materiel ferroviaire . . . .\nParliament repealed the former s. 259(2) when it enacted Bill C-46 (s. 14).\nIt is apparent by comparing the versions of the provision that Bill C-46 made two noteworthy changes to discretionary driving prohibition orders. First, the new provision enumerates fewer offences that are eligible for the punishment. Sentencing judges may impose a discretionary driving prohibition for the driving-specific offences of dangerous operation (s. 320.13, formerly s. 249), impaired operation causing bodily harm or death (s. 320.14(2) and (3), formerly s. 255(2), (2.1), (3) and (3.1)), failure/refusal to comply with a demand while knowing or being reckless to whether they were involved in an accident causing bodily harm or death (s. 320.15(2) and (3), formerly s. 255(2.2) and (3.2)), failure to stop after accident (s. 320.16, formerly s. 252), flight (s. 320.17, formerly s. 249.1), and operation while prohibited (s. 320.18, formerly s. 259(4)). Removed from the list and no longer enumerated are the general offences of criminal negligence causing death (s. 220), criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221), and manslaughter (s. 236), along with the now-repealed offences of failure to keep watch on person towed (former s. 250) and unseaworthy vessel/unsafe aircraft (former s. 251).\nSecond, the description of the event that triggers the provisions operation has been modified. In the English version of the provision, a driving prohibition could previously be imposed when the offender was convicted or discharged under section 730 of an enumerated offence. Bill C-46 has changed the trigger to found guilty. However, Bill C-46 brought about a more minor change to the French version of the text. The former s. 259(2) permitted driving prohibitions when the offender was declare coupable ou absous sous le regime de larticle 730 of an enumerated offence. Following Bill C-46, a prohibition is available when the offender has been declare coupable.\nThe Underlying Offences and Proceedings\nCircumstances of the Offences\nOn August 21, 2017, the appellant drove on the wrong side of a divided highway near Langham, Saskatchewan. He caused a head-on collision, killing two people and seriously injuring another.\nThe indictment alleged that the appellant committed two counts of criminal negligence causing death (contrary to s. 220 of the Criminal Code) and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm (contrary to s. 221 of the Criminal Code). \nSaskatchewan Court of Queens Bench (Danyliuk J.) \nIn the Court of Queens Bench, the appellant was found guilty of the three criminal negligence charges set out in the indictment. Near the end of his reasons for judgment, the trial judge stated:\nThe findings of guilt on the criminal negligence counts effectively end my inquiry. However, I have gone on. Alternatively, in case I am in error in my analysis of criminal negligence, I have gone on to consider whether the evidence amounts to proof beyond a reasonable doubt of dangerous driving.\n\n(2020 SKQB 324, 73 M.V.R. (7th) 242 (trial reasons), at para. 171)\nThe trial judge then considered the facts of the case in relation to the elements of the dangerous operation offences (also referred to as dangerous driving). He concluded that, in the alternative, he was fully satisfied the Crown has met all the requirements to prove dangerous driving beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore [i]n the event [that the] analysis of the three criminal negligence counts is faulty, then [he] would convict the accused of three counts involving dangerous driving causing death and injury (para. 180). \nThe trial judge later sentenced the appellant to six years imprisonment on each of the criminal negligence causing death counts and three years imprisonment on the criminal negligence causing bodily harm count, all to run concurrently (2021 SKQB 141, 84 M.V.R. (7th) 257). The trial judge further imposed 10-year driving prohibitions on the criminal negligence causing death counts and a 7-year prohibition on the criminal negligence causing bodily harm count, all to run concurrently. He did not advert in his reasons to any issue regarding the availability of this sanction. \nThe formal record of conviction, dated May 13, 2021, and prepared under s. 570 of the Criminal Code, indicates that the appellant was convicted of two counts of criminal negligence causing death (contrary to s. 220) and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm (contrary to s. 221) and further indicates the punishment imposed for those offences. The formal driving prohibition order, dated the same day, recites that the appellant was convicted of the criminal negligence counts and prohibits the appellant from operating a motor vehicle in relation to those convictions.\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal, 2022 SKCA 132, [2023] 3 W.W.R. 574 (Kalmakoff J.A., Schwann and McCreary JJ.A. Concurring)\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants sentence appeal, having considered the length of the carceral sentence and the availability of the driving prohibition order. Only the latter is contested at this Court. Writing for a unanimous panel, Kalmakoff J.A. observed that Bill C-46 was driven by two key themes: . . . (i) coherence, efficiency, simplification, and modernization of the Criminal Code provisions relating to driving offences; and (ii) increased punishments, with a focus on deterring people from dangerous and impaired driving (para. 57). In Kalmakoff J.A.s view, Parliament intended for Bill C-46 to increase or, at the very least, maintain the penalties previously available for all criminal driving offences (para. 58). On its face, the removal of a driving prohibition from the roster of available sanctions for criminally negligent driving that causes death or bodily harm is inconsistent with such an intention.\nKalmakoff J.A. then examined a number of Criminal Code and Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, provisions, as well as common law rules, demonstrating the legal distinction between findings of guilt and convictions. Section 662(5) of the Criminal Code provides that the offence of dangerous operation is an included offence for criminal negligence under ss. 220 and 221. By operation of s. 662(5), it is not possible to be convicted of driving-related criminal negligence without also being guilty of the lesser included offence of dangerous operation. A conviction for criminal negligence necessarily includes a finding of guilt for dangerous operation. Moreover, while he was not obliged to, the trial judge also made an explicit finding that the Crown had proven all of the elements of the dangerous operation offences. \nThus, Kalmakoff J.A. reasoned, just as Parliament must be taken to have understood the difference between a finding of guilt and a conviction, it must also be taken, in drafting s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, as having been aware that dangerous operation is a lesser included offence of criminal negligence arising out of the operation of a conveyance. Interpreting s. 320.24(4) as authorizing a sentencing judge to impose a driving prohibition order following a criminal negligence conviction is the only interpretation that is consistent with the stated purpose of Bill C-46. An absurdity would result from the contrary interpretation; an offender would be subject to less serious consequences upon conviction of the more serious criminal negligence offence, compared to the lesser included dangerous operation offence.\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeal held that the driving prohibition orders against the appellant were lawful.\nIssue on Appeal\nThe sole issue on appeal to this Court is whether s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code permits the imposition of a driving prohibition upon conviction for the offence of criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm committed by means of a motor vehicle.\nParties Positions\nAppellant (Mr. Wolfe)\nThe appellant submits that the driving prohibitions were unlawful given that s. 320.24(4) does not list the offences of criminal negligence causing death (s. 220) and criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221) as offences that can attract that punishment. With respect to the Court of Appeals interpretation, the appellant points to examples where findings of guilt and convictions are used interchangeably in various contexts throughout the Criminal Code. He argues that the Court should therefore not assume that Parliament acted purposefully in drafting s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code and used the term found guilty to preserve the ability of a sentencing judge to impose a driving prohibition for an included offence. In effect, the Court of Appeals interpretation creates a situation where punishment can be imposed by implication rather than by express terms.\nRespondent (His Majesty The King)\nUnder the former legislation, a driving prohibition could be imposed where a person was convicted of an enumerated offence. Consistent with the public protection objectives of the amendments, the new approach casts a wider net: a driving prohibition is available so long as a conviction for the more serious offence entails a finding of guilt for one of the basic enumerated offences. \nThe Crown submits that the difference between a finding of guilt and a conviction is deeply entrenched in law, and Parliament must be taken to have understood the distinction. A finding of guilt is the proof of the essential elements of the offence and is a precondition to both a conviction and a discharge. At their highest, the appellants examples of Criminal Code provisions using the two terms only show that conviction can sometimes stand for its constituent element of guilt, which the Crown does not take issue with. But, the appellant fails to show that the Criminal Code uses the narrow concept of guilt in place of the end-result concept of conviction.\nDangerous driving is an included offence for criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. Thus, the Crown argues, the criminal negligence conviction proved the appellant guilty of one of the enumerated basic driving offences listed under s. 320.24(4). The driving prohibition orders were therefore lawful.\nAnalysis\nGoverning Principles of Statutory Interpretation\nDetermining whether the Criminal Code permits a discretionary driving prohibition when there has been a conviction for criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm requires the Court to interpret s. 320.24(4) by employing longstanding principles of statutory interpretation. \nWords of a statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, citing E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87). While it is a proper starting point, the ordinary meaning of text is not determinative (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  3.01[3]). Statutory interpretation is incomplete without considering context, purpose, and relevant legal norms (R. v. Alex, 2017 SCC 37, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 967, at para. 31; McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2013 SCC 67, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 43; Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10; R. v. Downes, 2023 SCC 6, at paras. 24-25; Sullivan, at  2.01[4]). \nIn the analysis that follows, text, context, and legislative purpose will each be considered in a separate section, but they are not intended to be watertight compartments. Statutory interpretation factors are closely related and interdependent (Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 31). Other principles of statutory interpretation also apply and will be referenced where applicable. \nInterpretation of Section 320.24(4)\nText\nFor convenience, I reproduce s. 320.24(4) below:\n(4) If an offender is found guilty of an offence under section 320.13, subsection 320.14(2) or (3), 320.15(2) or (3) or under any of sections 320.16 to 320.18, the court that sentences the offender may, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating the type of conveyance in question during a period to be determined in accordance with subsection (5).\n\n(4) Le tribunal qui inflige une peine au contrevenant declare coupable dune infraction prevue a larticle 320.13, aux paragraphes 320.14(2) ou (3) ou 320.15(2) ou (3), ou a lun des articles 320.16 a 320.18 peut rendre, en plus de toute autre peine applicable a cette infraction, une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire le moyen de transport en cause durant la periode etablie conformement au paragraphe (5).\nThe Criminal Negligence Offences Are Not Enumerated in Section 320.24(4)\nSection 320.24(4) expressly enumerates 12 offences for which a discretionary driving prohibition is available and authorized. On its face, it establishes a closed list. In interpreting s. 320.24(4) to determine whether a driving prohibition can be imposed where there has been a conviction for a criminal negligence offence, it is very significant that neither s. 220 (criminal negligence causing death) nor s. 221 (criminal negligence causing bodily harm) are expressly included on the list of offences that can attract that punishment. In my view, the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius (to express one thing is to exclude another) is of interpretive significance here. Sullivan explains that an implied exclusion argument lies whenever there is reason to believe that if the legislature had meant to include a particular thing within its legislation, it would have referred to that thing expressly ( 8.09[1]; see also Canada v. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 SCC 51, at para. 59; Cadieux (Litigation Guardian of) v. Cloutier, 2018 ONCA 903, 143 O.R. (3d) 545, at para. 114). Where express reference is expected, the court can infer that the failure to mention something is the result of a deliberate decision to exclude it. \nA driving prohibition is a punishment (see R. v. Poulin, 2019 SCC 47, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 566, at para. 38). Parliaments usual practice is to specify available punishments expressly. Within Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code, provisions authorizing punishment  whether fines, imprisonment, or driving prohibitions  expressly list the offences to which those punishments directly apply (see ss. 320.19, 320.2, 320.21 and 320.24). The same is true in other parts of the Criminal Code, where the usual drafting practice is to either specify the punishment to which an offender is liable in the provision creating the offence or to enumerate the offences to which a particular punishment can attach. \nThere is, therefore, strong reason to believe that if Parliament wished to enable driving prohibitions for criminal negligence convictions, it would have expressly listed ss. 220 and 221 in s. 320.24(4). The fact it did not do so signals that the intention of Parliament was to exclude criminal negligence from the ambit of s. 320.24(4).\nNot only are the criminal negligence offences absent from the list of offences that can attract a discretionary driving prohibition, they were listed under the former s. 259(2), and Parliament chose to remove them when it repealed the former provision and re-enacted a different provision as s. 320.24(4).\nIt is well established that [p]rior enactments may throw some light on the intention of Parliament in repealing, amending, replacing or adding to a statute (R. v. Ulybel Enterprises Ltd., 2001 SCC 56, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 867, at para. 33; see also Gravel v. City of St-Leonard, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 660, at p. 667; British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal v. Schrenk, 2017 SCC 62, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 795, at para. 60; Sullivan, at  23.02[2]). Courts must presume that amendments to the wording of a legislative provision are made for some intelligible purpose (Sullivan, at  23.02[3]). This remains so where the amendment takes the form of repeal and re-enactment, which is generally viewed as the amendment of the former law from a substantive perspective (P.-A. Cote, in collaboration with S. Beaulac and M. Devinat, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (4th ed. 2011), at p. 111). Here, Parliament deliberately chose to repeal the former provision that listed the criminal negligence offences and replace it with a new one that does not. The textual evolution of the discretionary driving prohibition provision is consistent with legislative intention to limit the availability of that sanction to the driving-specific offences in Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code, excluding the general offences of criminal negligence and manslaughter.\nIn short, criminal negligence offences are not listed as offences that can attract a discretionary driving prohibition. They used to be listed, but are no longer. Parliament has expressed a strong legislative signal by repealing the provision that listed such criminal negligence offences and enacting another section that excludes them. This situation is a significant obstacle to the Crowns submission that a driving prohibition remains an available punishment where an offender has been convicted of a criminal negligence offence. \nThe Distinction Between Findings of Guilt and Convictions\nTo get around the lack of express reference to the criminal negligence offences in s. 320.24(4), the Crown argues that the continued availability of a discretionary driving prohibition for a criminal negligence conviction is implied through Parliaments use of the term found guilty in the provision. As noted above, compared to the previous English version of the legislation, Bill C-46 changed the event that triggers the availability of a discretionary driving prohibition from situations where an offender is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an enumerated offence to situations where the offender is found guilty.\nI proceed to consider whether the term found guilty in s. 320.24(4) can perform the function argued by the Crown and reflects Parliaments introduction of a new circular drafting technique into the Criminal Code.\nFindings of guilt and convictions are conceptually distinct in the criminal trial context. A finding of guilt is a verdict of the court following trial. It occurs when there has been a finding that the essential elements of the offence have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt (see Quigleys Criminal Procedure in Canada (loose-leaf), by D. Rose, ed., at  22:7; Boily, at para. 55; see also, regarding the related concept of a plea of guilt, Criminal Code, s. 606(1.1)(b); Ontario Courtroom Procedure (5th ed. 2020), by M. Fuerst, M. A. Sanderson and S. Firestone, eds., with the assistance of R. N. Beaudoin et al., at p. 586). A conviction, on the other hand, is a final judgment of the court by which a finding of guilt is entered (R. v. Berube, 2012 BCCA 345, 326 B.C.A.C. 241, at paras. 44 and 49; see also Boily, at para. 55; R. v. Senior (1996), 181 A.R. 1 (C.A.), at para. 19). There is some authority to the effect that the meaning of the term conviction can vary based on the context (see Morris v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 405, at p. 429; R. v. McInnis (1973), 1 O.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.)). There is no doubt, however, that a finding of guilt is a distinct and earlier step in the trial process than the recording of a conviction (see R. E. Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure (6th ed. (loose-leaf)), at  6:88; Fuerst, Sanderson and Firestone, at p. 586). Section 570 of the Criminal Code describes the process by which a trial for an indictable offence concludes and the judgment of the court is recorded:\n570 (1) If an accused who is tried under this Part is determined by a judge or provincial court judge to be guilty of an offence on acceptance of a plea of guilty or on a finding of guilt, the judge or provincial court judge, as the case may be, shall endorse the information accordingly and shall sentence the accused or otherwise deal with the accused in the manner authorized by law and, on request by the accused, the prosecutor, a peace officer or any other person, a conviction in Form 35 and a certified copy of it, or an order in Form 36 and a certified copy of it, shall be drawn up and the certified copy shall be delivered to the person making the request.\nA finding of guilt can lead to several different outcomes, including a conviction and the passing of sentence. Some issues that arise in criminal trials  such as whether to stay proceedings based on the entrapment defence or the rule against multiple convictions  are considered by the trial judge after a finding of guilt has been made but before a conviction is recorded (see R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 972; R. v. Pearson, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620, at paras. 10, 13 and 16; Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729; R. v. Provo, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3; see also Salhany, at  6:88). Courts must, as soon as practicable after an offender has been found guilty, conduct proceedings to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed (s. 720(1)). For some offences, where an accused pleads guilty . . . or is found guilty, the court may direct that the accused be absolutely or conditionally discharged instead of convicting the accused (s. 730(1)). \nIn short, a finding of guilt is not synonymous with a conviction. Indeed, the former is a precondition to the latter. \nThe parties written submissions (see A.F., at paras. 46-87; R.F., at paras. 31-53), and much of the discussion from the Court of Appeal (see C.A. reasons, at paras. 59-74), focus on whether findings of guilt and convictions are used interchangeably throughout the Criminal Code and the common law and whether this heightens or lessens the significance of Parliaments choice (in the English version of the text) to change the event triggering s. 320.24(4)s operation from convicted or discharged to found guilty. Kalmakoff J.A. stated that Parliament must be taken to have acted intentionally when it changed the description of the event that triggers the operation of the section . . . and to have done so with the difference between those concepts in mind (para. 74 (emphasis deleted)). \nHowever, it is my view that, despite the emphasis in the parties submissions on this issue, this appeal does not turn on whether the concepts of a finding of guilt and conviction are used interchangeably at various parts of the Criminal Code. Throughout the Criminal Code, it is possible to identify provisions that signal that Parliament was alive to the conceptual distinction between findings of guilt and convictions (such as ss. 570(1), 570(4) and 730(1), noted above), and other provisions where the distinction is not so clear. This exercise offers little assistance in resolving this appeal. The issue in this case is not whether a conviction or a finding of guilt is the gateway to a driving prohibition under s. 320.24(4); the text plainly indicates that this sentencing option is available when an offender has been found guilty of an enumerated offence. Rather, this Court must consider whether, as the Crown submits and the Court of Appeal accepted, an offender is found guilty of an enumerated offence under s. 320.24(4)  triggering the availability of a discretionary driving prohibition  when they are convicted of an unenumerated offence for which an enumerated offence is included. The Crowns incorporation by implication argument depends in part on the proper meaning of found guilty in the context of the provision. \nIncluded Offences\nThe Crown argues that the appellants convictions on the criminal negligence counts proved him guilty of dangerous operation. Further, they point to the fact that the trial judge conducted a separate analysis of the dangerous operation offence in the reasons and explicitly found him guilty of that included offence (R.F., at paras. 54 and 86-87).\nSection 662 of the Criminal Code governs included offences. It provides, in part:\n662 (1) A count in an indictment is divisible and where the commission of the offence charged, as described in the enactment creating it or as charged in the count, includes the commission of another offence, whether punishable by indictment or on summary conviction, the accused may be convicted\n\n(a) of an offence so included that is proved, notwithstanding that the whole offence that is charged is not proved; or\n\n(b) of an attempt to commit an offence so included.\n\n. . .\n\n(5) For greater certainty, when a count charges an offence under section 220, 221 or 236 arising out of the operation of a conveyance, and the evidence does not prove that offence but proves an offence under section 320.13, the accused may be convicted of an offence under that section.\nStated briefly, an offence is included if its elements are embraced in the offence charged (as described in the enactment creating it or as charged in the count) or if it is expressly stated to be an included offence in the Criminal Code itself (R. v. G.R., 2005 SCC 45, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 371, at para. 25).\nThe terms of the included offence provisions signal that their function is limited to situations where the charged offence is not proved. The provisions provide fair notice of an alternate pathway to a guilty verdict. Section 662(5) makes clear that the dangerous operation offence (contrary to s. 320.13) is an included offence for criminal negligence offences arising out of the operation of a conveyance (ss. 220 and 221). But, s. 662(5) also makes clear that only where the evidence does not prove the charged offence does it become possible the accused could be convicted of the included dangerous operation offence (as demonstrated by Parliaments use of the phrases does not prove that offence and may be convicted). The trial judge in this case recognized this when he stated that he was satisfied that the appellant was guilty of dangerous operation in the alternative and in case [he was] in error in [his] analysis of criminal negligence (paras. 171 and 183). Similarly, in jury trials, the trial judge should not instruct a jury on potential liability for an included offence when there is no realistic possibility of an acquittal on the charged offence and a conviction on the included offence (see R. v. Ronald, 2019 ONCA 971, at para. 42; R. v. Wong (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 520 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 12; R. v. Savage, 2023 ONCA 240, at para. 42). This reflects the role of included offences as being an alternative basis for a finding of guilt.\nThe Crowns argument jumps from the uncontroversial principle that the accused may, in the alternative, be convicted (or discharged) of an included offence, to the novel principle that the accused may be liable for a punishment available for an included offence even if not convicted or discharged of that offence. The words used in s. 662 speak clearly to the former idea but not the latter. The Crowns position stretches the included offence rules beyond their current understanding in law and amounts to a novel method of statutory interpretation of criminal offences and penalties.\nThe jurisprudence on included offences typically centers on the idea of fair notice (see, e.g., G.R., at paras. 11-12). In R. v. Pawluk, 2017 ONCA 863, 357 C.C.C. (3d) 86, Paciocco J.A. explained that the very concept of an included offence is predicated on the fact that it is not unfair to try the accused on an included offence since the charge laid alerts the accused person that they are alleged to have satisfied all of the elements of the included offence, as well as the charged offence (para. 28; see also G.R., at para. 30). In G.R., Binnie J. outlined three categories of included offences: (1) offences included by statute; (2) offences included in the enactment creating the offence charged; and (3) offences which become included by the addition of apt words of description to the principal charge (paras. 29-33). Each of these categories meets the test for fair notice; the accused is notified of the extent of their possible jeopardy by either the terms of the Criminal Code or by the words of the indictment (see also Rose, at  22:8).\nAccordingly, an accused has no complaint if, in the alternative, they are found guilty by the court of an included offence, even if that offence is not stipulated on the charging document. It is not at all clear, however, that an accused has been fairly put on notice of their liability for punishments attached uniquely to included offences in situations where they are convicted of the charged offence. Accused persons must be informed in advance and in a non-ambiguous manner of the punishments they are liable to if convicted of a particular offence. This imperative is particularly consequential where an accused pleads guilty to an offence, given the requirement that they be aware of the criminal consequences of their plea (see R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at para. 4). I do not think that offenders who have pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing death  as in Boily  would reasonably have understood based on the legislation that they may be liable to a driving prohibition for that offence at the time of their plea. \nI understand the logic of the Crowns argument, but I am not persuaded that the relevance of the included offence machinery, which provides fair notice of an alternative basis upon which an accused could be found guilty and subsequently convicted, should be extended beyond situations where the charged offence is not proved. It is well established that [a]bsent clear legislative intention to the contrary, a statute should not be interpreted as substantially changing the law (R. v. D.L.W., 2016 SCC 22, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 402, at para. 21; see also La Presse inc. v. Quebec, 2023 SCC 22, at para. 59; R. v. Summers, 2014 SCC 26, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575, at paras. 55-56; R. v. T. (V.), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 749, at pp. 763-64; R. v. Basque, 2023 SCC 18, at para. 49; Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 45(2)). In my view, Parliaments use of the term found guilty in s. 320.24(4) does not amount to a clear legislative signal that the included offence machinery should take on a new role and facilitate the imposition of punishment by implication rather than express reference. This would be a subtle and peculiar expression of legislative intent.\nI add that it is of no moment in this case that the trial judge chose to conduct a separate analysis of the included dangerous operation offences (paras. 171-80). It was not improper for the trial judge to conduct an alternative analysis on the included offences. But the availability of a driving prohibition should not depend on whether a trial judge chose to analyze the elements of an included offence in circumstances where they were not required to do so.\nIn my view, the use of the wording found guilty in s. 320.24(4) is suggestive of an express judicial determination, whether by a jury in announcing its verdict or a judge. McGuinness defines a finding as a determination made by an adjudicator during the course of a proceeding on some question of fact (K. P. McGuinness, The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Canadian Law (2021)). Blacks Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) defines to find as [t]o determine a fact in dispute by verdict or decision and offers the phrase find guilty as an illustration. I agree with Skolrood J.A. that the natural and ordinary meaning conveyed by found guilty is that there has been a specific finding of guilt (Francisco, at para. 42). Given the usual function of included offences that I have described above, I cannot accept that a finding of guilt within the meaning of s. 320.24(4) can be the implied result of some other judicial determination (i.e., a conviction for an offence not enumerated in s. 320.24(4)). \nAn Additional Signal in the Text of Section 320.24(4)\nAnother obstacle to the Crowns proposed interpretation lies in the fact that s. 320.24(4) provides that when an offender is found guilty of an enumerated offence, a driving prohibition can be imposed in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence. In other words, the provision contemplates the imposition of punishment  including a driving prohibition and other punishment such as imprisonment  for the commission of an enumerated offence (see Francisco, at para. 43). Criminal negligence is not enumerated; it cannot qualify as that offence. The Crowns proposed interpretation contemplates a form of bifurcation that conflicts with this limitation: a driving prohibition would be imposed for the enumerated dangerous operation offence, and other punishment (in the appellants case, imprisonment) would be imposed for the unenumerated criminal negligence offence. Put differently, the second half of the text of s. 320.24(4) signals that a driving prohibition can be ordered in addition to other punishment imposed for an enumerated offence  not in addition to punishment imposed for another offence. \nComparison of the English and French Changes to Section 320.24(4)\nThe English and French versions of s. 320.24(4) are equally authoritative and both must be considered (see R. v. Quesnelle, 2014 SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, at para. 53; Sullivan, at  5.02[3]-[5]). As explained, the gateway to a discretionary driving prohibition as a sentencing option in s. 320.24(4) is where an offender has been found guilty (in the English version) or declare coupable (in the French version) of an enumerated offence. With Bill C-46, while the convicted language in the former s. 259(2) was dropped from the English version and replaced with found guilty, the French version of former s. 259(2) permitted driving prohibitions when the offender was declare coupable ou absous sous le regime de larticle 730. There was no change to the declare coupable language in the French version akin to the switch in English from convicted or discharged to found guilty.\nFor this reason, the Crowns submission that Parliament employed the long-recognized distinction between concepts of conviction and guilt to create a new approach for imposing driving prohibitions is unpersuasive (R.F., at para. 3 (emphasis added)). While there is no doubt that there is a distinction between convictions and findings of guilt, the force of the Crowns submission is derived from the change in English from the deletion of the word convicted and the introduction of the found guilty language  a change which did not occur in the equally authoritative French version. \nConclusion on the Text of Section 320.24(4)\nIn my view, the text of s. 320.24(4) as a whole is clear and does not reveal any ambiguity. Criminal negligence offences are no longer listed as offences that can attract a discretionary driving prohibition. Moreover, Parliaments use of the phrase found guilty strongly points to the need for an express judicial determination of guilt on an offence stipulated in the charging document or included in one that is (in situations where the charged offence is not proved). The Crown fails to persuade me that a finding of guilt on an included offence  sufficient to attract punishment under s. 320.24(4)  necessarily flows from conviction on the charged offence. This a very weak basis on which to argue that the text implies the inclusion of something that was repealed and not carried forward in a fundamentally altered scheme for driving offences.\nIn such circumstances, the text of the provision usually dominates the interpretive exercise, but the relevant jurisprudence directs that the Court must still go on to consider context and legislative purpose (see Canada Trustco Mortgage Co., at para. 10; ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, at para. 48).\nStatutory and Broader Criminal Law Context\nThere are several considerations stemming from the surrounding statutory context and broader criminal law principles that shed light on s. 320.24(4).\nOther Provisions in Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code\nThe upshot of the Crowns position is that when one is convicted of an offence, there is, by necessary implication, a finding of guilt on any included offence. And they attach legal consequences to that implied finding of guilt. The Court must assess the implications of this position.\nIt is instructive to consider Criminal Code provisions that are closely proximate to s. 320.24(4). Section 320.24(1) provides for a mandatory driving prohibition order in certain situations and contains similar wording to that in s. 320.24(4):\n320.24 (1) If an offender is found guilty of an offence under subsection 320.14(1) or 320.15(1), the court that sentences the offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating the type of conveyance in question during a period to be determined in accordance with subsection (2).\nBy its terms, the provision mandates a driving prohibition where an offender has been found guilty of impaired operation simpliciter (contrary to s. 320.14(1)) or failure/refusal to comply with a demand simpliciter (s. 320.15(1)). On a first offence, the duration of the prohibition order is to be not less than one year and not more than three years, plus the entire period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment (s. 320.24(2)). \nThe Crowns proposed interpretation of s. 320.24(4) sits uneasily with the mandatory driving prohibition provision. I note that the more serious offences of impaired operation causing bodily harm (s. 320.14(2)) and impaired operation causing death (s. 320.14(3)), and their equivalents in s. 320.15, fall under the discretionary driving prohibition provision in s. 320.24(4). Suppose a first-time offender were to be convicted of impaired operation causing death, which provides that: Everyone commits an offence who commits an offence under subsection (1) and who, while operating the conveyance, causes the death of another person (s. 320.14(3)). As this offence fully embraces the impaired operation simpliciter offence as one of its components, the effect of the Crowns position in this case would be that there would be a conviction on the s. 320.14(3) offence and a finding of guilt on the included s. 320.14(1) offence. Could the offender be subject to both a discretionary driving prohibition of any duration that the court considers appropriate with respect to the former and a mandatory prohibition of not less than one year and not more than three years (in addition to the duration of any prison term) with respect to the latter (s. 320.24(2) and (5))? Would any discretionary driving prohibition imposed for impaired operation causing death have to comply with the minimum and maximum temporal parameters of s. 320.24(2)  ostensibly mandatory upon a finding of guilt for impaired operation simpliciter? That the implications of the Crowns position are unclear in relation to its application to a closely proximate statutory provision detracts from its plausibility in relation to s. 320.24(4).\nI consider also s. 320.25, which governs stays of driving prohibition orders pending appeal:\n320.25 (1) Subject to subsection (2), if an appeal is taken against a conviction or sentence for an offence under any of sections 320.13 to 320.18, a judge of the court to which the appeal is taken may direct that the prohibition order under section 320.24 arising out of the conviction shall, on any conditions that the judge imposes, be stayed pending the final disposition of the appeal or until otherwise ordered by that court.\nThis section contemplates stays of driving prohibition orders when an appeal is brought against a conviction or sentence for an offence under ss. 320.13 to 320.18. The conviction language in English was retained with the enactment of Bill C-46 compared to the former s. 261(1) of the Criminal Code. In French, Parliament replaced declaration de culpabilite (finding of guilt) with condamnation (conviction). Although the criminal negligence offences were listed under the former s. 261(1), they have been dropped from the stay pending appeal provision following Bill C-46.\nIt is not clear that s. 320.25(1) could operate to stay the appellants driving prohibitions pending appeal if the Crowns interpretation is accepted, as the appellant was not convicted of any of the offences listed under that subsection. Though it perhaps could be argued that the effect of the Crowns proposed interpretation would be that the appellant was sentenced to a driving prohibition for the included s. 320.13 offence, Crown counsel clarified during the oral hearing that, in his submission, punishment attaches to the offence for which an offender is convicted  not the finding of guilt (transcript, at pp. 60-61). In any event, s. 320.25(1) refers to a driving prohibition order arising out of the conviction  referring to the conviction specified in the opening words of the provision that is limited to those falling between ss. 320.13 and 320.18. The argument that s. 320.24(4) operates to allow for driving prohibitions to be imposed for criminal negligence convictions (under ss. 220 and 221) sits uncomfortably with s. 320.25(1), whose text appears not to contemplate stays pending appeal for this situation. Further, Bill C-46s deletion of any reference to the criminal negligence offences from what is now s. 320.25(1) also supports the conclusion that driving prohibitions are no longer contemplated for criminal negligence convictions. \nFinally, the Crown relies on the new s. 320.23 to illustrate how Parliament was attuned to the liminal space between a finding of guilt and conviction or discharge to create a unique post-guilt but pre-sentence treatment option (R.F., at para. 68). Section 320.23 also uses the found guilty language and provides:\n320.23 (1) The court may, with the consent of the prosecutor and the offender, and after considering the interests of justice, delay sentencing of an offender who has been found guilty of an offence under subsection 320.14(1) or 320.15(1) to allow the offender to attend a treatment program approved by the province in which the offender resides. If the court delays sentencing, it shall make an order prohibiting the offender from operating, before sentencing, the type of conveyance in question, in which case subsections 320.24(6) to (9) apply.\n\n(2) If the offender successfully completes the treatment program, the court is not required to impose the minimum punishment under section 320.19 or to make a prohibition order under section 320.24, but it shall not direct a discharge under section 730.\nThis mechanism only applies to those found guilty of the simpliciter impaired driving and failure/refusal to comply offences in ss. 320.14(1) and 320.15(1). Ordinarily, these offenders would be sentenced to a mandatory driving prohibition under s. 320.24(1), but s. 320.23(2) permits an exception where the offender successfully completes a treatment program. Where sentencing is delayed for the purpose of allowing the offender to attend such a treatment program, the court is required to make a temporary driving prohibition order under this section (and not under s. 320.24).\nThe pre-sentencing context of this section differs from s. 320.24(4), which authorizes a particular punishment on sentencing. Delaying sentencing to allow the offender to attend a treatment program is conditional upon the consent of the Crown and the offender, which distinguishes the interim driving prohibitions authorized by s. 320.23(1) from the punishments that s. 320.24 authorizes in the sentencing context. The most that can be said of s. 320.23 in support of the Crowns position on this appeal is that it demonstrates that a finding of guilt is not synonymous with a conviction, which I accept. \nRule Against Multiple Convictions\nThe Crowns proposed interpretation of s. 320.24(4) would permit the appellant to be sentenced to custody as a result of his convictions for criminal negligence causing death and bodily harm and sentenced to driving prohibitions as a result of having been found guilty of dangerous operation causing death and bodily harm. In Boily, Fairburn A.C.J.O. raised the concern that if charged with the included offence, the [Crowns] interpretation has the effect of creating a punishment for a crime that, through the operation of the principles in Kienapple, would necessarily attract a conditional stay because a person cannot be punished twice for the same offence (para. 57; see also para. 58).\nThe Kienapple principle prevents an accused from being convicted of multiple offences when there is a factual and legal nexus connecting the offences (Kienapple; R. v. Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480). There is a factual nexus where the same act grounds both charges (Prince, at pp. 492-93). A legal nexus exists where there is no additional and distinguishing element that goes to guilt contained in the offence for which a conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple principle (pp. 498-99; see also S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at 14.33). In short, the rule precludes more than one conviction arising out of the same delict (Kienapple, at p. 748; Prince, at pp. 488-90). \nIn situations where there have been multiple findings of guilt and Kienapple is found to apply, the offender should be convicted and sentenced on the more serious offence, and a conditional stay should be ordered on the less serious offence (Provo, at p. 16; R. v. J.F., 2008 SCC 60, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 215, at paras. 13 and 15).\nThe rule can apply to bar multiple convictions for two charges arising out of the same delict where one charge is included in the other (see, e.g., R. v. Doliente, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 11). This could certainly be the case where an offender has been found guilty of both a criminal negligence offence and a separately charged dangerous operation offence (see, e.g., R. v. Lights, 2017 ONSC 5153, 18 M.V.R. (7th) 110, at para. 1, affd 2020 ONCA 102, 60 M.V.R. (7th) 47; R. v. Bhangal, 2016 ONCA 857, 100 M.V.R. (6th) 173, at para. 3; R. v. Mowlai, 2017 ONSC 4815, 15 M.V.R. (7th) 38). Whether barring multiple convictions in the case of included offences is properly described as an application of the Kienapple principle or some other similar rule that specifically pertains to included offences (see R. v. Doliente (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (Alta. C.A.), at pp. 152-54, per Harradence J.A., dissenting, revd [1997] 2 S.C.R. 11; R. v. K. (R.) (2005), 198 C.C.C. (3d) 232 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35), it is not in doubt that multiple convictions in this context are precluded.\nIn this case, there is no suggestion that the rule from Kienapple is directly engaged as the appellant was not convicted of multiple offences arising out of the same delict. He was only convicted of the criminal negligence offences. But had there been separate counts on the indictment alleging dangerous operation, the appellant could not have been convicted of all of the counts. The trial judge would have been required to determine which counts would be stayed under the Kienapple rule. As I see it, accepting the Crowns argument on s. 320.24(4) would nonetheless have the effect of permitting punishment for the stayed offences. \nI appreciate the clarification offered by Crown counsel during the oral hearing to the effect that, on the Crowns argument, the driving prohibitions would formally attach to the criminal negligence convictions and not the implied findings of guilt on the included dangerous operation offences (transcript, at pp. 60-61). This clarification may serve to address Fairburn A.C.J.O.s practical concern about how [one would] reflect a punishment for a stayed offence on someones criminal record (Boily, at para. 58). But s. 320.24(4) nonetheless provides for punishment  a discretionary driving prohibition  in relation to dangerous operation, not criminal negligence. \nIn my view, the well-established rule against multiple convictions is a relevant legal principle that bears on the interpretation of s. 320.24(4). The notion that a conviction for an offence opens the door to punishments not expressly provided for that offence, but by implication based on those available for an included offence, sits in tension with the rule against multiple convictions. This is because the rule would operate to prevent punishment in relation to the included offence had it been charged separately on the indictment. \nLegislative Purpose\nSullivan explains that [i]n so far as the language of the text permits, interpretations that are consistent with or promote legislative purpose should be adopted, while interpretations that defeat or undermine legislative purpose should be avoided ( 9.01[1]; see also Cote, Beaulac and Devinat, at pp. 421-22).\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that Bill C-46 furthered objectives of coherence, efficiency, simplification, and modernization of the Criminal Code provisions relating to driving offences (para. 57; see also Boily, at para. 11). With this legislation, Parliament repealed the Criminal Codes driving-related provisions and re-enacted them in a new, self-contained Part VIII.1 (Offences Relating to Conveyances). This new part contains the declaration of principles, driving offences, punishments, other sentencing provisions, investigative provisions, and evidentiary rules. Several offences were transformed from straight indictable to hybrid offences, affording greater flexibility to prosecutors in less serious cases (ss. 320.13(2), 320.14(2), 320.15(2) and 320.16(2)). Hansard records reveal that parliamentarians were attuned to this change (House of Commons Debates, May 19, 2017, at pp. 11491-92 (P. Damoff); Debates of the Senate, vol. 150, No. 156, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., November 7, 2017, at p. 4103 (Hon. G. Boniface)). \nBill C-46 also raised certain maximum penalties, which the Court of Appeal noted was another key theme of the legislation (para. 57). In my view, while these changes no doubt promote the statutory goal of deterring persons from operating conveyances dangerously or while their ability to operate them is impaired by alcohol or a drug (s. 320.12(b)), they mainly serve to further Bill C-46s aims of simplification, coherence, and efficiency. The new maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment for dangerous driving causing bodily harm (s. 320.13(2)), when prosecuted by indictment, aligns with the punishment provided for the other driving-related offences in situations where bodily harm ensues (ss. 320.14(2), 320.15(2) and 320.16(2)). The same goes for dangerous driving causing death (s. 320.13(3)), whose maximum penalty was increased to life imprisonment  like other driving-related offences resulting in death. Again, parliamentarians recognized that Bill C-46 brought about consistency to the penalty scheme (House of Commons Debates, May 19, 2017, at p. 11492 (P. Damoff); Debates of the Senate, November 7, 2017, at p. 4103 (Hon. G. Boniface)).\nIt is significant that the increased penalties expressly enacted by Bill C-46 for the dangerous operation offences are greater than or equal to those available for the criminal negligence offences. The maximum penalty for dangerous operation causing death (s. 320.13(3)) is now equal to criminal negligence causing death (s. 220): life imprisonment, the highest prison term available in the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty of 14 years for dangerous operation causing bodily harm (s. 320.13(2)) now exceeds the 10-year maximum available for criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221). \nIn my view, these changes further Parliaments objectives of developing a simplified, coherent, and efficient driving offence scheme under a single part of the Criminal Code. They signal that dangerous driving is best addressed by resorting to the dangerous operation offences under s. 320.13, which have been made more versatile (with respect to hybridization) and consistent with other driving offences resulting in similar harm (with respect to penalties). As one parliamentarian noted during the debates: With the increase of the dangerous driving causing death maximum penalty, there would no longer be a need for the prosecution to pursue separate offences in order to allow for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (House of Commons Debates, May 19, 2017, at p. 11492 (P. Damoff) (emphasis added)).\nI note that practitioners and courts have recognized the prosecutorial advantages following Bill C-46 of resorting to dangerous operation as opposed to criminal negligence. In their book Impaired Driving and Other Criminal Code Driving Offences, Jokinen and Keen write that they predict that criminal negligence will fall into disuse in driving cases, as it is a harder offence to prove and other available offences, such as dangerous driving, now bear harsher penalties (p. 531). They list several advantages, from the Crowns perspective, of proceeding under the dangerous operation offences: the increased maximum penalties, the hybrid nature of the dangerous operation causing bodily harm offence, and the minimum fines and jail sentences that do not apply to criminal negligence (p. 157). In Boily, Fairburn A.C.J.O. made a similar observation related to the equal maximum penalties of life imprisonment for dangerous operation causing death and criminal negligence causing death (para. 73). \nThe Court of Appeal below reasoned that it would be absurd if s. 320.24(4) did not allow for a driving prohibition for criminal negligence convictions given that the result would be that being convicted of the more serious offence  criminal negligence  would leave the offender subject to less serious consequences than being convicted of a lesser included offence (para. 79; see also Boily, at para. 50). The Crown argues that the effect of the appellants interpretation of s. 320.24(4) is that there would be an inversion of the relationship between punishment and seriousness of the offence (R.F., at para. 81; see also para. 93).\nGiven the objectives advanced by Bill C-46, I do not accept that the exclusion of the criminal negligence offences from the ambit of s. 320.24(4) would be inconsistent with legislative purpose or represent an absurdity. Rather, this interpretation is perfectly consistent with Bill C-46s stated purpose and what Parliament has actually enacted. Over time, Parliament has increasingly underscored the seriousness of dangerous driving by gradually raising the penalties attached to the dangerous operation offence. Bill C-46 marked the point where those penalties matched or exceeded those available for criminal negligence  a more general offence that is not unique to the driving context. Jokinen and Keen have observed, as a result, that criminal negligence is no longer the most serious penal offence in driving cases (Impaired Driving and Other Criminal Code Driving Offences: A Practitioners Handbook (2019), at p. 137). I recognize that dangerous operation is nonetheless an included offence for criminal negligence under s. 662(5). But, the legislative changes to the penalty scheme significantly detract from the Crowns absurdity argument. The assumption that criminal negligence is relatively more serious than dangerous operation may need to be revisited following the enactment of Bill C-46.\nMy colleague states that although lengthier penalties are available for the offence of dangerous operation of a conveyance, the offence of criminal negligence is at least as serious as dangerous [operation] (Moreau J.s reasons, at para. 140 (emphasis added)). In my view, for the absurdity argument to have any purchase, the criminal negligence offences must be shown to be more serious than dangerous operation. The existence of countervailing considerations pointing in different directions with respect to the comparative seriousness of these offences forecloses the absurdity argument being raised by the Crown. Parliament was entitled to modify the sentencing regime for driving offences; the exclusion of the criminal negligence offences from the ambit of s. 320.24(4) is only absurd if one applies old law to changed law and ignores what Parliament did by overhauling the penalty scheme in Bill C-46.\nI conclude that the exclusion of the criminal negligence offences from the list of enumerated offences that can attract a discretionary driving prohibition under s. 320.24(4) is not absurd or inconsistent with legislative purpose. There is therefore no need to give the phrase found guilty in that provision the meaning argued by the Crown in order to avoid such a result.\nMoreover, changing the event that triggers the operation of s. 320.24(4) from convicted or discharged under section 730 language to found guilty in the English version and from declare coupable ou absous sous le regime de larticle 730 to declare coupable in the French version makes sense in light of the legislative objectives of simplicity, coherence, and efficiency. As I have explained, a finding of guilt on a particular charge can lead to several different outcomes, including a conviction, discharge, and stay of proceedings. However, s. 320.24(4) pertains to the sentencing context (given its reference to the court that sentences the offender). As the Crown notes, [o]nly two options are available at this point: a conviction and sentence, or a discharge (R.F., at para. 49). Using the term found guilty promotes simplicity and economy of language, as the term would capture both situations of conviction and discharge (see Boily, at para. 61). The change also suggests an attempt to harmonize the English and French versions of the provision, given that the French versions of both the former s. 259(2) and the new s. 320.24(4) have used declare coupable. Such harmonization would be entirely consistent with the objective of Bill C-46, as expressed by the Minister of Justice, to re-enact the driving offence scheme in a manner that is more clearly drafted and organized (Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, No. 34, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., January 31, 2018, at p. 34:10 (Hon. J. Wilson-Raybould)).\nConclusion on Interpretation of Section 320.24(4)\nA driving prohibition can be imposed under s. 320.24(4) when the offender has been found guilty of an offence enumerated under that subsection. This requires an express judicial pronouncement on an offence stipulated in the charging document or included in one that is (where the charged offence is not proved). This interpretation is supported by the plain and clear text of s. 320.24(4), the surrounding statutory context and purpose, and criminal law principles  which Parliament should not be taken to have departed from lightly. \nThe Crown argues that where an offender is convicted of a criminal negligence offence, they are necessarily found guilty within the meaning of the provision of the included offence of dangerous operation. It acknowledges this would be a new approach for imposing driving prohibitions (R.F., at para. 3). However, I agree with Fairburn A.C.J.O. in Boily that if Parliament had intended to navigate such a novel . . . course in criminal law, one would think that clarity would have been the order of the day (para. 59). That Parliament employed a new drafting technique, as the Crown argues, is anything but evident. The machinery of included offences, which provides fair notice of an alternative path to a guilty verdict, does not provide persuasive support for the notion that a finding of guilt (that opens the door to punishment) can be implied. The Crowns proposed interpretation sits in tension with statutory provisions contained in the new Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code as well as the rule against multiple convictions. \nFinally, I am not persuaded that accepting the Crowns proposed interpretation of s. 320.24(4) is necessary to avoid an absurdity or inconsistency with legislative purpose. With Bill C-46, Parliament chose to group driving-specific offences together in a self-contained part of the Criminal Code, make them more versatile, increase their penalties, and provide for unique driving-specific sentencing options. Parliaments logic in excluding the general offences of criminal negligence and manslaughter  which are not specific to the driving context  from the ambit of s. 320.24(4) is apparent given the emphasis on promoting the utility of the driving-specific Criminal Code provisions. The reforms are consistent with the purposes of Bill C-46 and the Minister of Justices stated goals of clarifying and simplifying the criminal driving provisions. \nConclusion\nThe appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which are not enumerated offences under s. 320.24(4). He was not found guilty of an enumerated offence within the meaning of that provision. Accordingly, discretionary driving prohibitions were not available as a sentencing option.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and set aside the order of driving prohibition imposed on Mr. Wolfe.\n\tThe reasons of Cote, Kasirer, Jamal and Moreau JJ. were delivered by\n\tMoreau J.  \n\nOverview\nThe issue in this appeal is whether s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, authorizes a court to impose a driving prohibition order following convictions for criminal negligence causing death or criminal negligence causing bodily harm under ss. 220(b) and 221 of the Criminal Code, respectively. Section 320.24(4) came into force on December 18, 2018, through the adoption of Bill C-46, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (offences relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2018, c. 21. \nBill C-46 contained amendments related to driving-related offences in the Criminal Code. Section 15 of Bill C-46 became Part VIII.1, Offences Relating to Conveyances, in the Criminal Code, and replaced many of the former provisions of Part VIII that pertained to driving offences. The amendments in Bill C-46 included the replacement of s. 259(2) with s. 320.24(4). There are two noteworthy differences between s. 320.24(4) and the former s. 259(2). First, the former s. 259(2) authorized a driving prohibition order where an offender was convicted or discharged of a listed offence. That is, a driving prohibition order could only be imposed upon a conviction or a discharge under s. 730 of the Criminal Code for an offence listed in former s. 259(2). The current s. 320.24(4) applies where an offender is found guilty of a listed offence. Second, the former s. 259(2) expressly included the offences of criminal negligence causing death (s. 220) and bodily harm (s. 221). Section 320.24(4), however, has omitted any mention of those sections and, among the listed offences, only includes specified driving offences, including dangerous operation causing death or bodily harm (s. 320.13).\nSection 320.24(4) states:\n(4) If an offender is found guilty of an offence under section 320.13, subsection 320.14(2) or (3), 320.15(2) or (3) or under any of sections 320.16 to 320.18, the court that sentences the offender may, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating the type of conveyance in question during a period to be determined in accordance with subsection (5).\n\n(4) Le tribunal qui inflige une peine au contrevenant declare coupable dune infraction prevue a larticle 320.13, aux paragraphes 320.14(2) ou (3) ou 320.15(2) ou (3), ou a lun des articles 320.16 a 320.18 peut rendre, en plus de toute autre peine applicable a cette infraction, une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire le moyen de transport en cause durant la periode etablie conformement au paragraphe (5).\nThe introduction of the term found guilty in the English version is a clear change from the former s. 259(2), which previously stated: \n(2) If an offender is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under section 220, 221, 236, 249, 249.1, 250, 251 or 252 or any of subsections 255(2) to (3.2) committed by means of a motor vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment, the court that sentences the offender may, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place, or from operating a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment, as the case may be . . . .\n\n(2) Lorsquun contrevenant est declare coupable ou absous sous le regime de larticle 730 dune infraction prevue aux articles 220, 221, 236, 249, 249.1, 250, 251 ou 252 ou a lun des paragraphes 255(2) a (3.2) commise au moyen dun vehicule a moteur, dun bateau, dun aeronef ou de materiel ferroviaire, le tribunal qui lui inflige une peine peut, en plus de toute autre peine applicable en lespece, rendre une ordonnance lui interdisant de conduire un vehicule a moteur dans une rue, sur un chemin ou une grande route ou dans tout autre lieu public, un bateau, un aeronef ou du materiel ferroviaire . . . .\nI conclude that s. 320.24(4), properly interpreted, does authorize sentencing judges to impose a driving prohibition order where an offender is convicted of an offence under ss. 220 or 221 of the Criminal Code. I depart with the majority on two main points. First, a finding of guilt for a principal offence necessarily entails findings of guilt for any lesser included offences. Under s. 662(5) of the Criminal Code, where criminal negligence under ss. 220 and 221 arises through the operation of a conveyance, dangerous operation of a conveyance contrary to s. 320.13 is a lesser included offence of criminal negligence. Therefore, where criminal negligence arises through the operation of a conveyance, a finding of guilt in respect of criminal negligence necessarily entails a finding of guilt in respect of dangerous operation of a conveyance.\nSecond, the majoritys interpretation of s. 320.24(4) produces the absurd consequence that a driving prohibition order can be imposed for a lesser included offence, but not the principal offence, which has a higher mens rea requirement. It is inconsistent with the purposes of Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code (Offences Relating to Conveyances), including coherence, public safety, and deterrence of driving-related offence. Given the seriousness of criminal negligence and Parliaments policy concerns with respect to public safety, it would be absurd to suggest that Parliament intended for driving prohibition orders to be unavailable following a conviction for criminal negligence. \nFor the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. \nBackground\nThe appellant, Braydon Wolfe, drove his vehicle into oncoming traffic and crashed head-on into a family vehicle. The collision seriously injured a woman and killed her husband and child. Following trial, the appellant was convicted on December 8, 2020, of two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to ss. 220(b) and 221 of the Criminal Code, respectively. In his reasons, the trial judge indicated that if he was mistaken on the elements of the offence of criminal negligence, the Crown had proven all the elements of the offences of dangerous operation of a conveyance causing death and dangerous operation of a conveyance causing bodily harm contrary to s. 320.13 of the Criminal Code (2020 SKQB 324, 73 M.V.R. (7th) 242). \nThe trial judge sentenced the appellant to a global period of imprisonment of 6 years and imposed driving prohibition orders of 10 years on each count of criminal negligence causing death and 7 years on the count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, along with a DNA order (2021 SKQB 141, 84 M.V.R. (7th) 257).  \nThe appellant appealed the length of his term of incarceration to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal raised the issue of whether the driving prohibition orders were authorized by law and invited further submissions from the parties. The Court of Appeal ultimately dismissed the appeal and maintained the driving prohibition orders (2022 SKCA 132, [2023] 3 W.W.R. 574). \nThe appellant now appeals the driving prohibition orders to this Court. He argues that the sentencing judge had no authority to make the driving prohibition orders pursuant to s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code because s. 320.24(4) does not include ss. 220 and 221 of the Criminal Code among the listed offences for which a driving prohibition order may be imposed.\nIssue\nThe issue in this appeal is whether s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code permits sentencing judges to impose driving prohibition orders following convictions for criminal negligence causing death and criminal negligence causing bodily harm under ss. 220(b) and 221 of the Criminal Code, respectively, when those offences arise out of the operation of a conveyance. \nAnalysis\nThe Modern Approach to Statutory Interpretation \nSection 320.24(4) must be interpreted according to the modern approach to statutory interpretation. The modern approach requires that the words of a statutory provision are read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (R. v. Alex, 2017 SCC 37, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 967, at para. 24, citing Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87). Statutory interpretation entails discerning legislative intent by examining statutory text in its entire context and in its grammatical and ordinary sense, in harmony with the statutes scheme and objects (Michel v. Graydon, 2020 SCC 24, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 763, at para. 21; see also La Presse inc. v. Quebec, 2023 SCC 22, at para. 22; Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at paras. 21 and 27). The plain meaning of the text is not in itself determinative. To ascertain legislative intent, the text of a provision must be placed in context and tested against other indicators of legislative meaning, including legislative objectives (La Presse, at para. 23; Alex, at para. 31). \nThe consequences of adopting a particular interpretation serve as an important interpretive aid within the modern approach to statutory interpretation. Consequences that are consistent with the purpose and scheme of the legislation are presumed to have been intended. Conversely, consequences that are absurd or otherwise unacceptable are presumed not to have been intended (Rizzo, at para. 27; Wang v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2023 BCCA 101, 480 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at paras. 42-43, cited in R. v. Francisco, 2023 BCCA 450, 433 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 34; R. Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation in a New Nutshell (2003), 82 Can. Bar Rev. 51, at p. 63). The greater the absurdity that flows from a particular interpretation, the more justified an interpreter is in rejecting it, provided that the words of the provision can reasonably bear the interpretation ultimately adopted (Wang, at paras. 42-43; Sullivan, at p. 64).\nThis case largely turns on the interpretation of the words found guilty in s. 320.24(4). In interpreting s. 320.24(4), I first consider the operation of findings of guilt for lesser included offences and then the consequences of the available competing interpretations of s. 320.24(4). \nA Finding of Guilt for the Principal Offence Necessarily Entails a Finding of Guilt for Lesser Included Offences\nThere is agreement with the majority that there is a meaningful distinction between a finding of guilt and a conviction or discharge for the purpose of s. 320.24(4). However, as I am of the view that a finding of guilt necessarily entails findings of guilt for lesser included offences, a finding of guilt for criminal negligence, where it arises through the operation of a conveyance, is also a finding of guilt for dangerous operation. \nA Finding of Guilt Is Distinct From a Conviction or Discharge in Section 320.24(4) \nA finding of guilt and a conviction or discharge are distinct concepts and are not interchangeable. The change from convicted or discharged to found guilty indicates that a conviction or discharge for one of the listed offences in s. 320.24(4) is not essential for a valid driving prohibition order to be imposed. Rather, only a finding of guilt for one of the listed offences is required. The language of found guilty instead of convicted or discharged permits a driving prohibition order to be imposed prior to the entry of a conviction (R. v. Boily, 2022 ONCA 611, 163 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 62). \nThe Saskatchewan Court of Appeal referred to several examples in the Criminal Code and the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (YCJA), that demonstrate the distinction between a finding of guilt and a conviction. For example, the provisions relating to the granting of a discharge pursuant to ss. 730(1) and 667(1) of the Criminal Code clearly demonstrate that there are alternatives to conviction following a finding of guilt. Similarly, ss. 42 and 82 of the YCJA make it clear that young offenders are found guilty but not convicted.  \nAnother example is the defence of entrapment, which can only be considered after a finding of guilt but before the entry of a conviction (R. v. Pearson, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620, at para. 5; R. v. Ahmad, 2020 SCC 11, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 577). While entrapment offers a defence for those who have been found guilty of a particular offence, it operates differently than other defences in the Criminal Code in three respects. First, a finding of entrapment does not negate the elements of the offence. In other words, where a court determines that the police entrapped an individual into committing an offence, the court recognizes that each of the essential elements of the offence has been proven (see R. v. Mack, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, at p. 972; Ahmad, at para. 17). Second, when entrapment is established on a balance of probabilities, a stay of proceedings is entered, and unlike other defences, the accused is not acquitted of the associated charge or charges. Third, the defence of entrapment, unlike most other defences, must be considered after a finding of guilt but before the entry of a formal conviction in order to retain the availability of a stay of proceedings (see Pearson, at para. 5).  \nThe difference in the wording of ss. 259(2) and 320.24(4), considered along with examples of provisions in the Criminal Code and YCJA described above, support the conclusion that a conviction and a finding of guilt are not interchangeable. As these examples illustrate, it is not the case that a conviction necessarily flows from a finding of guilt. However, when a conviction for an offence is recorded, it will always mean that the offender has been found guilty of that offence. \nA conviction or discharge is not always necessary for a penalty to be imposed. Section 320.23, which was also an amendment introduced by Bill C-46, permits a court to delay sentencing of someone found guilty of an offence in the operation of a conveyance to allow them the opportunity to attend a treatment program and apply for a medical discharge. In those circumstances, the offender having been found guilty, a driving prohibition order may be imposed under s. 320.24(4), thereby curtailing the offenders driving privileges prior to a conviction being entered. \nMy colleague rightly notes that there was no change to the wording of the French version of former s. 259(2)  declare coupable  while the English version of s. 320.24(4) was changed from convicted to found guilty, and that the French and English versions of the Criminal Code are equally authoritative. However, a declaration de culpabilite can refer either to a finding of guilt or a conviction, though there remains an important distinction between them (see, e.g., R. v. Basque, 2023 SCC 18, at paras. 57-58). Declare coupable is used elsewhere in the Criminal Code, regardless of whether the English version uses convicted or found guilty (see, e.g., ss. 2.2(2), 9, 15 and 284). Therefore, in this case, the use of declare coupable in the French versions of both ss. 259(2) and 320.24(4) does not assist in determining whether Parliament intended to create a new approach to imposing driving prohibition orders by distinguishing between a finding of guilt and a conviction or discharge. \nThe legislative evolution of a provision is relevant to determining its intended meaning (R. v. Ulybel Enterprises Ltd., 2001 SCC 56, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 867, at para. 33; Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 471, at paras. 43-44; R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  23.02[2]). If the concepts of a finding of guilt and a conviction or discharge were intended to be interchangeable, there would have been no reason for the change in the English version of s. 320.24(4). The French and English versions of s. 320.24(4) must be read together. The change in the English wording from convicted or discharged in s. 259(2) to found guilty in s. 320.24(4) informs the interpretation of declare coupable in the French version and suggests that it now refers to a finding of guilt in the context of s. 320.24(4).  \nAs noted in the Court of Appeal decision, at para. 74:\n. . . just as Parliament must be taken to have acted intentionally when it removed the explicit reference to ss. 220 and 221 in s. 320.24(4), it must also be taken to have acted intentionally when it changed the description of the event that triggers the operation of the section from being convicted or discharged under section 730 of an enumerated offence to being found guilty of an enumerated offence, and to have done so with the difference between those concepts in mind. [Emphasis in original.]\nIn order to resolve this appeal, however, we must determine the further issue of whether a finding of guilt for a principal offence is also a finding of guilt for each lesser included offence.\nA Finding of Guilt for a Principal Offence Necessarily Entails Findings of Guilt for Lesser Included Offences in the Criminal Code\nA finding of guilt for a principal offence necessitates, by operation of law, findings of guilt for all lesser included offences. \nI respectfully disagree with my colleague that the use of the wording found guilty in s. 320.24(4) is suggestive of an express judicial determination, whether by a jury in announcing its verdict or a judge (majority reasons, at para. 56). An express ruling or verdict of guilt is unnecessary, as a finding of guilt is constituted by each of the elements of the offence being proven beyond a reasonable doubt and the negation of any applicable defences (Quigleys Criminal Procedure in Canada (loose-leaf), by D. Rose, ed., at  22:7). This can be expressed either by a single finding of guilt of the offence, or individual findings that each of the elements have been proven. \nA finding of guilt for a lesser included offence is established by a finding of guilt for the principal offence because, by definition, all elements of the lesser included offence are contained in the elements of the principal offence (R. E. Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure (6th ed. (loose-leaf)), at  6:89). A finding of guilt signifies that the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, as previously held by this Court, an indictment charging an offence also charges all offences which as a matter of law are necessarily committed in the commission of the principal offence (R. v. G.R., 2005 SCC 45, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 371, at para. 30 (emphasis in original), quoting R. v. Harmer and Miller (1976), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 17 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 19). Because an indictment charging a principal offence entails all lesser included offences, it is appropriate for a penalty for a lesser included offence to formally attach to the principal offence. \nA Finding of Guilt for Criminal Negligence Under Sections 220 or 221, Where It Arises From the Operation of a Conveyance, Contains Findings of Guilt for the Lesser Included Offence of Dangerous Operation Under Section 320.13\nThe text of s. 662(5), read in combination with s. 320.24(4), is sufficient for a conviction for criminal negligence arising out of the operation of a conveyance to authorize a driving prohibition order. Section 662(5) explicitly makes dangerous operation of a conveyance under s. 320.13 a lesser included offence to criminal negligence where the offence involves the operation of a conveyance:\n(5) For greater certainty, when a count charges an offence under section 220, 221 or 236 arising out of the operation of a conveyance, and the evidence does not prove that offence but proves an offence under section 320.13, the accused may be convicted of an offence under that section.\n\n(5) Il est entendu que lorsquun chef daccusation vise une infraction prevue aux articles 220, 221 ou 236 et decoule de la conduite dun moyen de transport, et que la preuve netablit pas la commission de cette infraction, mais plutot celle dune infraction prevue a larticle 320.13, laccuse peut etre declare coupable de cette derniere.\nThe operation of s. 662(5) necessitates that if an individual is convicted under ss. 220 or 221 for criminal negligence arising out of the operation of a conveyance, they are, by operation of law, found guilty of the offence under s. 320.13. The elements of dangerous operation of a conveyance under s. 320.13 are imbedded within the elements of criminal negligence under ss. 220, 221 or 236, where it arises through the operation of a conveyance (see R. v. Al-Kassem, 2015 ONCA 320, 78 M.V.R. (6th) 183, at para. 8 (judgment rendered prior to Bill C-46 coming into force); R. v. Abau-Jabeen, 2019 ONSC 5399, 58 M.V.R. (7th) 304, at paras. 60-61; R. v. Gardner and Fraser, 2021 NSCA 52, 406 C.C.C. (3d) 156, at para. 20). Therefore, it is impossible to act in a criminally negligent manner through the operation of a conveyance contrary to ss. 220 or 221 without dangerously operating a conveyance contrary to s. 320.13.\nThe Availability of a Driving Prohibition Order as a Penalty for Criminal Negligence Is Consistent With Criminal Law Principles\nParliaments choice not to expressly list ss. 220 and 221 in s. 320.24(4), in light of the relationship between principal and lesser included offences and the purposes of the scheme for driving-related offences, signals an intention to include criminal negligence through the inclusion of dangerous operation under s. 320.13 in the listed offences in s. 320.24(4).\nIt is a matter for Parliament to determine what is procedurally required for a punishment to be imposed, provided it is constitutionally permissible. With respect to s. 320.24(4), Parliament has determined that only a finding of guilt for one of the listed offences in s. 320.24(4) is required for a driving prohibition order to be imposed, rather than any additional procedural steps that typically follow a finding of guilt (Salhany, at  6:88). This approach to the imposition of driving prohibition orders is consistent with existing criminal law principles, including the requirement of fair notice to accused and the public, the recognition of lesser included offences, and the rule against multiple convictions.\nThe text of s. 662(5) serves to provide adequate notice to an accused and the public that a court may impose a driving prohibition order following a conviction for criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm where it arises out of the operation of a conveyance. Both accused and the public as a whole have adequate notice that lesser included offences are included within principal offences. Moreover, an indictment charging an accused with one offence gives fair notice to the accused regarding their legal jeopardy in relation to offences that are included within the charged offence (G.R., at para. 30). \nHaving been found guilty of at least one of the s. 220 or s. 221 offences, an offender is also found guilty through the operation of s. 662(5) of the lesser included offence under s. 320.13. Therefore, a driving prohibition order is, as required by the text of s. 320.24(4), a punishment for that offence  that offence being one of the listed offences in s. 320.24(4). The driving prohibition order attaches to the conviction for criminal negligence. However, for the driving prohibition order to be imposed, it is only necessary that an accused is found guilty of that offence, which occurs when an accused is necessarily found guilty of the lesser included offence of dangerous operation upon being found guilty of criminal negligence. \nThis interpretation of s. 320.24(4)  which authorizes judges to impose driving prohibition orders provided one of the listed offences is a lesser included offence of one for which the offender was convicted  is also consistent with this Courts decision in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The Kienapple principle applies to avoid multiple convictions for offences where the offences do not describe different criminal wrongs, but instead describe different ways of committing the same criminal wrong (see R. v. Heaney, 2013 BCCA 177, 337 B.C.A.C. 43, at para. 25, per Bennett J.A.; see also Sarazin v. R., 2018 QCCA 1065, at para. 28 (CanLII), per Healy J.A.). \nIn Kienapple, this Court held that a stay of proceedings must be entered to avoid multiple convictions for the same underlying criminal conduct. However, the rule against multiple convictions is not violated by s. 320.24(4), as no conviction is necessary for a driving prohibition order to be imposed. As noted in R. v. J.F., 2008 SCC 60, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 14: The rule against multiple convictions applies, of course, only to multiple convictions  which is not our case (emphasis in original). Accordingly, duplicate punishments do not result from our conclusion that a driving prohibition order can be granted where there is a conviction under ss. 220 and 221. \nMy colleague questions whether an offender could be subject to both a discretionary driving prohibition order plus the entire prison term for one offence as well as a mandatory driving prohibition order plus the entire prison term for another offence (majority reasons, at para. 65). However, the Kienapple principle ensures that the offender is not punished twice for essentially the same criminal conduct. \nIn summary, a finding of guilt for a lesser included offence is necessitated by a finding of guilt for its principal offence. Given that s. 662(5) makes dangerous operation under s. 320.13 a lesser included offence of criminal negligence under ss. 220 and 221, s. 320.24(4) is sufficient for a conviction for criminal negligence arising out of the operation of a conveyance to authorize an order under s. 320.24(4). Parliaments approach of indirectly incorporating principal offences of criminal negligence by reference to the lesser offence of dangerous operation under s. 320.13 is both consistent with how lesser included offences operate in our legal system and Parliaments objective of achieving simplicity in its approach to driving-related offences. \nConsequences of Competing Interpretations of Section 320.24(4) \nAn interpretation of s. 320.24(4) that does not authorize driving prohibition orders as a penalty for criminal negligence under ss. 220 and 221 where the negligence arose through the operation of a conveyance produces an absurd consequence. An interpretation may be considered absurd if it, for example, creates irrational distinctions, defeats the purpose of the legislation, leads to incoherence, undermines the efficient administration of justice, or violates important norms of justice or fairness (Sullivan (2003), at p. 64; La Presse, at para. 54). \nThe appellants interpretation creates an irrational distinction by making a sanction for a lesser included offence, but not the more serious principal offence, and is inconsistent with Parliaments stated purposes for enacting Part VIII.1 of the Criminal Code. The appellants interpretation produces an absurd consequence because it authorizes the imposition of driving prohibition orders for the lesser included offence of dangerous operation, but not for the more serious principal offence of criminal negligence, and subverts Parliaments policy aim to reduce the significant number of deaths and injuries caused by impaired driving.\nThe interpretation that permits driving prohibition orders to be imposed in such circumstances should be preferred because it avoids the absurdity raised by the majoritys interpretation (see Sullivan (2022), at  10.01). The interpretation that permits driving prohibition orders where an offender has been convicted under ss. 220 or 221 for an offence arising from the operation of a conveyance should be preferred in part because it is consistent with the purpose of s. 320.24(4) and the scheme in which it operates. I reiterate that this interpretation is supported by the text of s. 320.24(4), in light of the text of s. 662(5) and the distinction between a finding of guilt and a conviction or discharge. \nThe Availability of a Driving Prohibition Order as a Punishment for Criminal Negligence Is Consistent With the Stated Purposes of Section 320.24(4)\nThe availability of driving prohibition orders for criminal negligence where it arose through the operation of a conveyance is consistent with the purposes of Bill C-46. The purpose and object of the 2018 amendments, as described by the Honourable Jody Wilson-Raybould, then Minister of Justice, as she introduced Bill C-46 in Parliament, was to reduc[e] the significant number of deaths and injuries caused by impaired driving (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 181, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 19, 2017, at p. 11459). She further stated that the proposed legislation was drafted with all victims of impaired driving in mind and that the hope and expectation [of the amendments was] that the combined effects of the many reforms proposed in Bill C-46 [would] be enormously effective in deterring drug and alcohol impaired driving (pp. 11459 and 11461).\nThe preamble to Bill C-46 sets out nine considerations and objectives underlying the amendments, including: dangerous driving and impaired driving injure or kill thousands of people in Canada every year; dangerous driving and impaired driving are unacceptable at all times and in all circumstances; and the Parliament of Canada is committed to . . . deterring the commission of offences relating to the operation of conveyances, particularly dangerous driving and impaired driving. \nThe Court of Appeal noted that the legislative intent behind Bill C-46 reflected two key themes: . . . (i) coherence, efficiency, simplification, and modernization of the Criminal Code provisions relating to driving offences; and (ii) increased punishments, with a focus on deterring people from dangerous and impaired driving (para. 57). The preamble of Bill C-46 is consistent with s. 320.12 of the Criminal Code, which states:\n320.12 It is recognized and declared that \n\n(a) operating a conveyance is a privilege that is subject to certain limits in the interests of public safety that include licensing, the observance of rules and sobriety;\n\n(b) the protection of society is well served by deterring persons from operating conveyances dangerously or while their ability to operate them is impaired by alcohol or a drug, because that conduct poses a threat to the life, health and safety of Canadians; \n\n(c) the analysis of a sample of a persons breath by means of an approved instrument produces reliable and accurate readings of blood alcohol concentration; and \n\n(d) an evaluation conducted by an evaluating officer is a reliable method of determining whether a persons ability to operate a conveyance is impaired by a drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug.\nPreserving the authority of sentencing judges to impose a driving prohibition order where an offender has been convicted, and therefore found guilty, of criminal negligence arising out of the operation of a conveyance is consistent with these objectives of protecting society and achieving coherence of Criminal Code provisions relating to driving-related offences. This includes the recognition in s. 320.12(b) that the protection of society is well served by deterring persons from operating conveyances dangerously.\nI cannot accept that Parliament intended to exclude criminal negligence from the scheme for driving-related offences. My colleague notes that Parliament has broadly signalled through Bill C-46 that resorting to specific driving-related offences is preferable to general criminal negligence offences in driving cases (majority reasons, at para. 6). However, Parliament clearly intended to include criminal negligence within the scope of driving-related offences, having expressly contemplated criminal negligence arising from the operation of a conveyance in s. 662(5). Parliament, in making sweeping amendments to the scheme for driving-related offences in the Criminal Code, kept s. 662(5) intact, rather than repealing or qualifying this provision. \nWith respect, it does not appear sufficiently clear to me that Parliament intended to signal through Bill C-46 that the Crown should resort to charging dangerous operation in preference to criminal negligence. One would have expected that if the intent of Parliament was to alter the statutory scheme in this way, it would have done so explicitly and would not have made s. 320.13 a lesser included offence of ss. 220 and 221. \nCriminal Negligence Is at Least as Serious an Offence as Dangerous Operation of a Conveyance\nThe availability of a driving prohibition order for the lesser included offence of dangerous operation, but not for the principal offence of criminal negligence, creates an irrational situation. While lengthier penalties are available for the offence of dangerous operation of a conveyance, the offence of criminal negligence is at least as serious as dangerous conveyance. This is for two reasons. First, s. 662(5) expressly makes dangerous operation a lesser included offence of criminal negligence. Second, as the Crown argued during the hearing, the higher mens rea requirement for criminal negligence makes it a normatively more serious offence. Sections 220 and 221 have a heightened mens rea element in the form of a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care of the reasonable person (R. v. Javanmardi, 2019 SCC 54, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 3, at para. 23 (emphasis added)). This is in contrast to the mens rea for dangerous operation, which is met through only a marked departure in the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe (R. v. Beatty, 2008 SCC 5, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49 (applying the former s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code); see also R. v. Roy, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 60, at paras. 33-36). \nIn summary, an interpretation of s. 320.24(4) that does not authorize sentencing judges to impose driving prohibition orders where an offender is convicted of criminal negligence under ss. 220 or 221 is absurd because it irrationally bars a punishment for the offence with the heightened mens rea requirement when that punishment is clearly available for the offence with a less onerous mens rea element. As noted by Kalmakoff J.A., being convicted of criminal negligence would leave the offender subject to less serious consequences than being convicted of a lesser included offence. That cannot be what Parliament intended (C.A. decision, at para. 79). Furthermore, it stands in opposition to the purposes of the scheme, including coherence and increased punishments.\nFinally, I am not persuaded that the absence of the ss. 220 and 221 offences among the listed offences results from a drafting error that creates a legislative gap as found by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Boily, as this conclusion fails to account for the operation of s. 662(5). I agree with Kalmakoff J.A. that when s. 320.24(4) is properly interpreted, no such gap exists (C.A. decision, at para. 58). Read with s. 662(5), s. 320.24(4) vests sentencing judges with the authority to impose driving prohibition orders upon those found guilty of criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm in the operation of a conveyance.\nConclusion \nThe omission of criminal negligence from s. 320.24(4) was coupled with the amendment of convicted or discharged to found guilty, dispensing with a requirement for a conviction or discharge for the imposition of a driving prohibition. Section 662(5) makes the offence under s. 320.13 a lesser included offence of criminal negligence causing death or bodily harm under ss. 220 or 221. A conviction under ss. 220 or 221 (where that conviction arises from criminal conduct involving the operation of a conveyance) necessarily entails a finding of guilt for dangerous operation causing death or bodily harm by operation of s. 662(5), which provides the basis for the imposition of a driving prohibition order under s. 320.24(4). This interpretation is most consistent with a harmonious reading of the text of s. 320.24(4), its broader context, and the objects of the law within the legislative scheme as a whole, and avoids absurd consequences that are presumed not to have been intended by Parliament. \nDisposition \nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. \n\tAppeal allowed, Cote, Kasirer, Jamal and Moreau JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Little & Company, Saskatoon.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Office of the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, Regina.",

Wolfe was found guilty of two counts of criminal negligence causing death (s. 220) and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm (s. 221) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge imposed a driving prohibition order pursuant to s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, in addition to the sentence of imprisonment. The relevant offences under the Criminal Code are s. 220, s. 221, and s. 320.24(4), which permits discretionary driving prohibition for enumerated offences, including dangerous operation of a conveyance (s. 320.13).\n\nThe court process began with the trial judge convicting Wolfe of the three criminal negligence charges and imposing driving prohibition orders of 10 years on each count of criminal negligence causing death and 7 years on the count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan dismissed Wolfe's appeal, holding that the driving prohibition orders were lawful. However, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and set aside the order of driving prohibition imposed on Wolfe.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established that a driving prohibition can only be imposed under s. 320.24(4) of the Canadian Criminal Code if the offender is found guilty of an offense that is explicitly enumerated under that subsection. \n\nWriting for the majority, Martin J. disagreed with the Court of Appeal's interpretation of s. 320.24(4) of the Criminal Code, concluding that the driving prohibitions imposed on Wolfe were unlawful.

He was found guilty of two counts of criminal  negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily  harm. In his reasons, the trial judge held that, if his analysis of the  criminal negligence counts was wrong, then he would convict the accused of two  counts of dangerous driving causing death and one count of dangerous driving  causing bodily injury. In addition to sentencing the accused to terms of  imprisonment, the trial judge issued a driving prohibition order imposing  concurrent 10-year driving prohibitions for each criminal negligence causing  death count and a concurrent 7-year prohibition for the criminal negligence  causing bodily harm count. Concurrent sentences are sentences for more than one  crime which are to be served at one time. Mr. Wolfe appealed against the length  of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge. On appeal, the  court raised the question of whether the driving prohibitions could stand in  light of recent amendments to the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed Mr.  Wolfe\u2019s sentence appeal. With respect to the availability of the driving  prohibition order, the court interpreted s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which permits sentencing  judges to impose a driving prohibition where an offender has been \u201cfound  guilty\u201d of one of the offences specified in that provision, as authorizing that  order, even though the offences are not specified offences. It held that the  criminal negligence convictions necessarily included a finding of guilt for the  lesser offence of dangerous driving, which is one of the offences specified in  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.  Mr. Wolfe appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that recent  amendments to the <em>Criminal Code </em>did  not allow the sentencing judge to impose driving prohibition orders.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal and set aside the driving prohibition order imposed on Mr. Wolfe.<strong>Driving prohibitions could not be ordered because that sentence was not  available as an option to the sentencing judge.</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin held that the driving prohibitions imposed on Mr. Wolfe  were unlawful. Mr. Wolfe was convicted of criminal negligence causing death and  criminal negligence causing bodily harm, which are not specified offences under  s. 320.24(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He  was not \u201cfound guilty\u201d of a specified offence within the meaning of that  provision.

The company and L went into receivership and made assignments in bankruptcy, and a trustee in bankruptcy of their estates was appointed. \n\tIn 2015, the trustee launched actions against the companys lenders, including 17 actions to recover illegal interest and commissions paid to investors by the company before its bankruptcy. In those actions, the trustee advanced statutory claims under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA) as well as unjust enrichment claims, arguing that there was no juristic reason for the interest payments made to the investors by the company because the interest rates were illegal, and the investors were enriched at the companys expense. The trustee also asserted that the commissions paid to the investors for referring new investors to the company were unlawful and thus the referral agreements could not supply a juristic reason for the commissions.\n\tThe investors raised four main defences to the actions. First, they argued that the actions were statute-barred under ss. 4 and 12(1) of Ontarios Limitations Act, 2002, which imposes a two-year limitation period beginning when the bankrupt knew or ought to have known of its claims. They asserted that because L knew of the impugned payments when they were made between June 6, 2011 and April 3, 2013,  Ls knowledge should be attributed to the company under the common law doctrine of corporate attribution. Second, the investors asserted that they were not unjustly enriched. Third, they invoked s. 97(3) of the BIA to set off amounts they owed the estate against the principal of the loans owed to them. Fourth, they argued that their referral agreements with the company were lawful and thus provided a juristic reason for them to keep the commissions that they had received.\n\tThe trial judge found the company was a Ponzi scheme and attributed Ls knowledge to the company, but she concluded that the trustees actions were not statute-barred because legal proceedings were not appropriate, under s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002, before the trustee had been appointed, investigated the causes of the bankruptcy, and discovered the Ponzi scheme. She ordered the investors to return the illegal interest payments they had received, and refused to allow them to set off under s. 97(3) of the BIA the interest amounts they owed the estate against the principal they were owed. She rejected the trustees unjust enrichment claims for repayment of the referral commissions. Lastly, the trial judge granted the trustees claim that the interest and commissions paid by the company to a real estate agent, S, were unlawful preferences under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA because S was not acting at arms length from the company.\n\tThe Court of Appeal dismissed the investors appeal. It agreed with the decision of the trial judge to reject the limitations defence but held that the trial judge should have exercised her discretion not to attribute Ls knowledge to the company on public policy grounds. In its view, the actions were not statute-barred because the company lacked the knowledge to initiate the actions before it entered into bankruptcy. It also agreed with the conclusion of the trial judge to reject the set-off defence and with her ruling on the unlawful preference claims against S. The Court of Appeal allowed the trustees cross-appeal on the issue of whether the referral agreements constituted a juristic reason to deny the unjust enrichment claims for the commission payments, holding that they did not.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J., Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: The trustees actions are not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002. The principles of the corporate attribution doctrine, summarized in Aquino v. Bondfield Construction Co., 2024 SCC 31, apply to one-person corporations. The Court of Appeal appropriately exercised its discretion to refuse to attribute Ls knowledge to the company because this would not have promoted the purposes of the laws under which attribution was sought. \n\tUnder the discoverability rule, a cause of action arises for purposes of a limitation period when the material facts on which it is based have been discovered or ought to have been discovered by the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable diligence. Discoverability is a common law principle that is now codified by statute in Ontario under the Limitations Act, 2002. Section 5(1) sets out when a claim is discovered on the basis of actual or constructive knowledge. Section 12 sets out rules for when persons shall be deemed to have had the knowledge referred to in s. 5(1)(a). Section 12(1) addresses claims brought by a successor in right, title, or interest to the person with a claim, and stipulates when the successor is to be imputed with the knowledge of a predecessor. Section 12(2) addresses claims brought by a principal, and stipulates when the principal is to be imputed with the knowledge of an agent. \n\tIn the instant case, although the trustees actions were launched more than two years after the illegal interest and commissions were paid, the actions would not be statute-barred if the commencement of the limitation period were deferred by the rule of discoverability. The companys knowledge must be imputed to the trustee under s. 12(1) of the Limitations Act, 2002, because the trustee is the successor in interest to the company. However, Ls knowledge cannot be attributed to the company under s. 12(2) of the Limitations Act, 2002. Section 12(2) only applies to a proceeding commenced by a principal. Assuming, without deciding, that the company acted as principal and L as its agent, and that L acted within the scope of the authority granted to him, the underlying proceedings were not commenced by the company, the supposed principal, but by the trustee, who was not a principal of L. Furthermore, there were insufficient findings at trial as to whether L was an agent of the company and whether he was acting within the scope of his authority, hampering the Courts ability to apply common law agency principles for the first time. As a result, if Ls knowledge is to be attributed to the company, it must be under the doctrine of corporate attribution.\n\tAs noted in Aquino, the doctrine of corporate attribution provides guiding principles for when the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind of a corporation may be attributed or imputed to the corporation. It must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically to give effect to the policy of the law under which attribution is sought. These principles provide sufficient flexibility to address most if not all situations of corporate attribution, including for one-person corporations. There is no principled basis to apply different guiding principles for corporate attribution to one-person corporations. Moreover, accepting the argument that the knowledge of a sole directing mind must always be attributed to the corporation would effectively disregard the bedrock principle of corporate separateness. Even one-person corporations have an existence that is separate from that of their sole owner and directing mind.\n\tAs stated in Aquino, courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when this would be in the public interest, in the sense that it would promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought. Attributing Ls knowledge to the company would undermine the purpose of the discoverability rules of the Limitations Act, 2002 by making the trustees claims statute-barred before the trustee was even able to assert them, creating an injustice. Attributing Ls knowledge to the company would also undermine the purposes of the BIA, and would allow the investors to retain the proceeds of their wrongful conduct and thereby reduce the value of the debtors assets available for distribution to other creditors. This would not be in the public interest. \n\tWith respect to the other issues, the investors cannot rely on the principles of equitable set-off under s. 97(3) of the BIA to set off the interest payments they owe the estate against the loan principal owed to them. The investors did not come to court with clean hands because their wrongful conduct was at the heart of their claim for set-off, thus disentitling them from the benefit of the defence of equitable set-off. Nor is there any basis to impugn the Court of Appeals conclusion that the referral agreements were illegal contracts at common law. The investors lack of subjective knowledge of illegality does not defeat the trustees illegality argument, because the question of whether a contract was entered into at least in part with the purpose of committing an illegal act is examined from the objective standpoint of a reasonable person. The investors all knew, or should have known, that they were entering into illegal agreements. Lastly, the lower courts did not err in finding that S was not dealing at arms length from the company for the purposes of s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA.\n\tPer Cote J.: There is agreement with the majority that the trustees claims in unjust enrichment against the investors are not time-barred by the two-year limitation period set out in s. 4 of the Limitations Act, 2002; however, there is disagreement as to how this conclusion is reached. There is no need to resort to the corporate attribution doctrine, since codified rules of attribution exist in s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002 and provide a complete answer. Rather, during the time that the company was solely controlled by L, claims against the investors were not discoverable because legal proceedings by the company were not an appropriate means to seek to remedy that injury, loss or damage for the purposes of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002.\n\tAs stated by the majority, the trial judge correctly held that the trustee asserted the claims in unjust enrichment as a successor in interest to the bankrupt company. Whether the trustees claims in unjust enrichment are time-barred then hinges on when the claims were discovered by the company. To answer this question, it is not necessary to resort to the common law by way of the corporate attribution doctrine. That doctrine is reserved for exceptional cases. This is not such an exceptional case, as the question of discoverability can be answered using the codified rules of attribution, which include the general principles of agency. As a codified means of attribution exists, this precludes the application of the corporate attribution doctrine on the basis of the principle that the common law should not displace the will of the legislature expressed in a statute. Specifically, the legislature has codified the deeming rules of agency in s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002. Indeed, s. 12(2) provides that the principal shall be deemed to have knowledge of the matters referred to in s. 5(1)(a) where the agent was duty-bound to communicate knowledge of those matters to the principal. Under the law of agency, Ls knowledge was that of the company throughout the Ponzi scheme. By finding L to be the corporations sole directing mind, the trial judge effectively found him to be an agent. This finding of fact by the trial judge is owed deference. The company therefore had knowledge more than two years before the actions were commenced of the payments to the investors that gave rise to the claims in unjust enrichment.\n\tHowever, even though the company had the legal capacity to sue the investors, the claims in unjust enrichment were not appropriate and therefore not discoverable until the trustee was authorized by the court to bring them. The fact that the company, through L, knew of the injury, loss or damage and knew that it was caused by or contributed to by the investors is not enough to establish that the claims were discovered for the purposes of the Limitations Act, 2002. Section 5(1)(a)(iv) establishes that the company must also have known that, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would have been an appropriate means to seek to remedy it. Whether legal proceedings are appropriate is a fact-specific inquiry. The trial judge was correct to hold that although the company may have known, through L, about its dealings with the investors, it did not and could not have known that it would be legally appropriate for it to sue them to recover its losses so long as it was directed by L. When the company became insolvent, L ceased to have unfettered control over it, and the possibility that the company could make claims in unjust enrichment actualized. The trustee was appointed receiver on July 9, 2013. Therefore, the claims in unjust enrichment brought by the trustee between June 23 and July 9, 2015, were all brought within the limitation period. As for the actions commenced between July 10 and July 23, 2015, they are not time-barred since it was not appropriate for the trustee to bring the actions until June 16, 2015, when the court supervising the insolvency process issued an interim order permitting the trustee to serve the statements of claim on the investors and to issue the actions.\n\tThere is agreement with the majority and the courts below that the investors are not entitled to set off the interest payments they were ordered to repay to the bankrupt estate of the company against the outstanding principal of their loans pursuant to s. 97(3) of the BIA. However, the trial judge erred in considering the effect of preferring one creditor over the general body of creditors as part of her set-off analysis. Parliament has indicated that set-off in insolvency must be considered in the same manner and to the same extent as it would outside of the insolvency context. In this way, Parliament has given its blessing for the reordering of a claimants priority in bankruptcy by virtue of the operation of the law of set-off. Finally, there is agreement with the majority that the referral agreements between some of the investors and the company were illegal contracts at common law; and that S was not dealing at arms length with the company under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA. \nCases Cited\nBy Jamal J.\n\tApplied: Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v.

This question arises in the context of determining whether actions commenced by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover funds that a corporation paid out under a Ponzi scheme are statute-barred under the Limitations Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B.\nGolden Oaks Enterprises Inc. was ostensibly a legitimate rent-to-own residential property business operated by its sole officer, shareholder, and directing mind, Joseph Gilles Jean Claude Lacasse. In reality, Golden Oaks was a classic Ponzi scheme: the company continuously needed new loans to repay existing loans. It paid short-term investors interest at criminal interest rates to raise funds to pay its existing investors. Some investors also helped perpetuate the Ponzi scheme by entering into referral agreements with Golden Oaks to refer new investors to the company in exchange for commissions based on a percentage of the amounts invested. When the Ponzi scheme eventually collapsed, Golden Oaks and the respondent, Mr. Lacasse, went into receivership and made assignments in bankruptcy.\nThe respondent trustee in bankruptcy, Doyle Salewski Inc., launched several actions to recover amounts that Golden Oaks had paid the appellant investors in interest under the loans and in commissions under the referral agreements. The trustees actions were based mainly on unjust enrichment. The appellants were all victims of the Ponzi scheme who lost their invested principal when Golden Oaks went bankrupt but managed to recoup some of their early investments through interest and commission payments before its bankruptcy.\nThe appellants asserted that the trustees actions were statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002 because they were commenced more than two years after Golden Oaks had paid the interest and commissions. The appellants argued that Mr. Lacasse knew about these payments before the limitation period expired, and they asserted that Mr. Lacasses knowledge should be attributed to Golden Oaks under the common law doctrine of corporate attribution developed by this Court in Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 662, Deloitte & Touche v. Livent Inc. (Receiver of), 2017 SCC 63, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 855, and Christine DeJong Medicine Professional Corp. v. DBDC Spadina Ltd., 2019 SCC 30, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 530.\nThe trial judge attributed Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks, but she concluded that the trustees actions were not statute-barred because legal proceedings were not appropriate under s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002 before the trustee had been appointed, had investigated the causes of the bankruptcy, and had discovered the Ponzi scheme.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed that the limitations defence failed, but held that the trial judge should have exercised her discretion not to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks on public policy grounds in accordance with this Courts decision in Livent.\nThe appellants main submissions before this Court rely on the Limitations Act, 2002 and the corporate attribution doctrine. The appellants note that the Courts decision in Livent left open whether the judicial discretion not to attribute the knowledge of a directing mind to a corporation applies in the case of a one-person corporation. They assert that the knowledge of a directing mind must always be attributed to a one-person corporation because the two are essentially one and the same. The result, the appellants submit, is that Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the interest and commission payments should be imputed to Golden Oaks, and then attributed to the trustee, with the consequence that the trustees actions are statute-barred because they were not commenced within two years after the payments were made.\nThis appeal also raises questions as to whether: (i) the appellants can rely on the principles of equitable set-off under s. 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (BIA), to set off the interest payments they owe the estate against the loan principal owed to them; (ii) the referral agreements are illegal contracts at common law; and (iii) one appellant, Lorne Scott, was dealing at arms length from Golden Oaks under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA.\nI would dismiss the appeal. As this Court noted in Aquino v. Bondfield Construction Co., 2024 SCC 31, at para. 1, the corporate attribution doctrine provides guiding principles for when the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind of a corporation may be attributed or imputed to the corporation. The attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically to give effect to the policy of the law under which attribution is sought (paras. 56, 64, and 82). In my view, the same principles apply to one-person corporations. These principles provide sufficient flexibility to address most if not all situations of corporate attribution, including for one-person corporations. Moreover, accepting the appellants argument that the knowledge of a sole directing mind must always be attributed to the corporation would effectively disregard the bedrock principle of corporate separateness.\nIn this case, the Court of Appeal properly exercised its discretion to decline to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks because attribution of that knowledge would undermine the purposes of the limitations and bankruptcy provisions at issue. Attribution would create an injustice by precluding the trustees claims to recover the unlawful payments before the trustee was even able to assert them. It would also allow the appellants to retain the proceeds of their wrongful conduct of entering into illegal agreements and reduce the value of the debtors assets available to the other creditors in bankruptcy. I would also dismiss the remaining grounds of appeal.\nBackground\nThe Golden Oaks Ponzi Scheme\nGolden Oaks was founded by Mr. Lacasse and operated in Ottawa between 2009 and 2013. Mr. Lacasse was the companys sole shareholder, officer, and directing mind. He publicly advertised Golden Oaks as an altruistic rent-to-own business that gave people who did not qualify for a mortgage a path to home ownership. Tenants would make a down payment and pay a slightly inflated rent for a property, which they would then acquire an option to purchase after three to five years.\nMr. Lacasse also promoted Golden Oaks to prospective investors as a way to make a quick profit by lending the company money to fund its operations in exchange for high-interest promissory notes. Investors in Golden Oaks were short-term lenders to the company. Some investors also had referral agreements with Golden Oaks under which they recruited new investors in exchange for commissions of 8 percent of the amount invested.\nTo outside observers, Golden Oaks appeared to be successful. The reality was completely different. Golden Oaks was a textbook Ponzi scheme. A fraudster, Mr. Lacasse, lured investors to lend money to the company for unreasonably high rates of return on promissory notes, and then paid existing investors by recruiting new investors, rather than by generating revenue from a legitimate business. \nBetween 2009 and 2013, Golden Oaks issued 504 promissory notes to 153 investors. Rates of interest on the promissory notes were initially between 12 and 40 percent per year for loans at one- or two-year terms. Later, rates increased to over 60 percent per year  the threshold for the criminal rate of interest under s. 347 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. On one occasion, Golden Oaks even offered interest at a rate approaching 67,000 percent per year. By 2012, most promissory notes involved loans at criminal interest rates. Overall, nearly two-thirds of all the promissory notes issued by Golden Oaks were at criminal interest rates. During the life of the Ponzi scheme, Mr. Lacasse personally pocketed about $1.3 million in profits.\nThe Ponzi scheme collapsed in July 2013. Soon afterwards, Golden Oaks and Mr. Lacasse went into receivership and made assignments in bankruptcy, and Doyle Salewski Inc. was appointed trustee in bankruptcy of their estates.\nLegal Actions Commenced by the Trustee\nIn 2015, the trustee launched over 80 legal actions against Golden Oaks lenders, including 17 actions to recover illegal interest and commissions paid by Golden Oaks before its bankruptcy.\nThe trustees 17 actions to recover the interest and commissions were consolidated and heard together in one trial. The trustee made two broad categories of claims. First, the trustee advanced statutory claims to recover alleged preferential payments and transfers under the BIA. It argued that because Golden Oaks was a Ponzi scheme, it was insolvent by definition and never had enough money to pay its legitimate creditors. The interest and commissions paid by Golden Oaks were therefore preferential payments that deprived legitimate creditors of their share of the companys remaining equity. \nSecond, the trustee advanced unjust enrichment claims. It argued that there was no juristic reason for the interest payments made by Golden Oaks because the interest rates that it offered were illegal, and that the defendants  including all the appellants before this Court  were enriched at Golden Oaks expense. The trustee also asserted that the commissions paid for referring new investors to Golden Oaks were unlawful and contrary to the Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5, and thus the referral agreements could not supply a juristic reason for the commissions.\nThe appellants raised four main defences.\nFirst, the appellants argued that the trustees actions were statute-barred under ss. 4 and 12(1) of the Limitations Act, 2002, which impose a two-year limitation period beginning when the bankrupt, Golden Oaks, knew or ought to have known of its claims. The appellants asserted that because Mr. Lacasse knew of the impugned payments when they were made between June 6, 2011, and April 3, 2013, Golden Oaks also knew or ought to have known of the payments at that time. This was over two years before the trustee sued in its capacity as successor of Golden Oaks beginning in June 2015.\nSecond, the appellants asserted that even if the trustees actions were not statute-barred, the appellants were not unjustly enriched. They invoked the doctrine of notional severance, which allows a court to partially enforce an otherwise illegal agreement by reading down a contractual provision to make the rest of the agreement legal and enforceable, rather than declaring the entire agreement to be void ab initio. The appellants argued that the court should reduce the criminal rate of interest to the maximum legal rate of interest and order the appellants to return only the interest above that rate, but not the principal or the lawful interest.\nThird, the appellants invoked s. 97(3) of the BIA to set off amounts they owed the estate against the principal of the loans owed to them. The appellants claimed a complete set-off because the loan principal exceeded what they owed.\nFourth, those appellants who had referral agreements with Golden Oaks argued that their agreements were lawful and not contrary to the Securities Act and hence provided a juristic reason for them to keep the commissions they had received.\nJudicial History\nOntario Superior Court of Justice, 2019 ONSC 5108, 76 C.B.R. (6th) 3 (Gomery J. (as she then was))\nThe trial judge readily found that Golden Oaks was a Ponzi scheme. This had two implications. First, Golden Oaks never had enough money to pay its legitimate creditors and was insolvent by definition. Second, as of mid-2011, Golden Oaks operations were fraudulent.\nThe Limitations Defence and the Corporate Attribution Doctrine\nThe trial judge rejected the appellants argument that the trustees unjust enrichment claims were statute-barred.\nThe trial judge noted that, under s. 5(2) of the Limitations Act, 2002, Golden Oaks was presumed to have known about the matters giving rise to its claims when it made the payments unless the contrary was proved. She also accepted that because the trustee advanced the unjust enrichment claims as the successor in interest to Golden Oaks under s. 71 of the BIA, it was deemed, by operation of s. 12(1) of the Limitations Act, 2002, to have known of Golden Oaks claims when the company discovered or reasonably could have discovered them. She found that the question of whether Golden Oaks knew or reasonably could have known about the payments had to be resolved by considering whether Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the payments should be attributed to Golden Oaks under the corporate attribution doctrine.\nThe trial judge held that Mr. Lacasses knowledge should be attributed to Golden Oaks. She relied on Canadian Dredge for the proposition that the acts of the directing mind of a corporation are attributed to the corporation unless those acts were totally in fraud of the corporation or were not by design or result partly for its benefit. She found that neither exception applied. The trustee had not shown that Mr. Lacasse had acted totally in fraud of the corporation or solely for his own benefit. Of the $16.4 million raised from investors, Mr. Lacasse pocketed only $1.3 million. Another $7.7 million was used to pay other investors, while the rest was used partly for the benefit of the company, including to pay for operating expenses, the purchase, renovation, and repair of properties, advertising, and other administrative expenses. The trial judge therefore imputed Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the payments to Golden Oaks.\nDespite finding that Golden Oaks discovered its claims as early as 2011 when the payments were first made, the trial judge concluded that a legal proceeding was not appropriate under s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002 before Golden Oaks went into receivership on July 9, 2013. Until then, Golden Oaks was controlled solely by Mr. Lacasse, who would not have launched proceedings on the companys behalf because this would have exposed the Ponzi scheme. The delay in the running of the limitation period thus arose from Mr. Lacasses unfettered control of the company, which only ended when the company entered into receivership.\nLegal and Equitable Set-Off\nThe trial judge applied the doctrine of notional severance to the trustees unjust enrichment claims to recover the illegal interest payments. She ordered the appellants to return all the illegal interest payments they had received, but not the principal amounts they had invested in Golden Oaks. At the same time, the trial judge refused to allow the appellants to invoke s. 97(3) of the BIA to set off the interest amounts they owed the estate against the principal they were owed.\nThe trial judge ruled that the appellants did not meet the criteria for legal set-off because the appellants debts only became liquidated after the trustees legal actions. The ruling on legal set-off was not appealed further.\nThe trial judge also ruled that the appellants could not rely on equitable set-off. She referred to her earlier findings that the appellants did not conduct themselves with Golden Oaks in a manner consistent with above-board commercial dealings and that they knew or ought to have known that they had entered into illegal agreements. She also noted that because the effect of granting a set-off in bankruptcy is to prefer one creditor over the general body of creditors, the permissible set-off under s. 97(3) of the BIA must be confined within narrow limits (para. 550, citing King Insurance Finance (Wines) Inc. v. 1557359 Ontario Inc., 2012 ONSC 4263, 99 C.B.R. (5th) 227, at para. 21).\nAs a result, the trial judge ruled that the estate could recover the interest received by the appellants and distribute the proceeds pro rata to the unsecured creditors.\nCommissions Under the Referral Agreements\nThe trial judge rejected the trustees claims in unjust enrichment for repayment of the referral commissions received by some of the appellants. She did not accept that the referral agreements involved the unlicensed sale of securities contrary to the Securities Act, and concluded that the agreements provided a juristic reason for the commission payments that defeated the trustees claims.\nUnlawful Preference Claims Against Mr. Scott\nLastly, the trial judge granted the trustees claim that the interest and commissions paid by Golden Oaks to the appellant Mr. Scott were unlawful preferences under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA. Mr. Scott is a real estate agent who became involved in Golden Oaks operations in 2011. The trial judge found that Mr. Scott was not acting at arms length from Golden Oaks at the time he received the interest and commission payments. Although Mr. Scott was never employed by Golden Oaks, he regularly represented that he acted on the companys behalf and continued to solicit investments even after he became aware of the Ponzi scheme. The trial judge ordered Mr. Scott to pay the estate $72,575 of the interest and commissions that he had received. \nCourt of Appeal for Ontario, 2022 ONCA 509, 162 O.R. (3d) 295 (Sossin J.A., Strathy C.J. and Roberts J.A. concurring)\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The court agreed with the conclusion of the trial judge to reject the limitations and set-off defences and with her ruling on the unlawful preference claims against Mr. Scott. The trustee also cross-appealed on several issues. The only issue from the cross-appeal that is relevant to this appeal is whether the referral agreements constituted a juristic reason to deny the trustees claims in unjust enrichment for the commission payments. The court held that they did not and allowed the trustees cross-appeal on this issue.\nThe Limitations Defence and the Corporate Attribution Doctrine\nThe Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the trustees actions were not statute-barred under the Limitations Act, 2002, but reached this conclusion for different reasons. \nThe Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge should not have attributed Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks under the corporate attribution doctrine. The Livent decision recognized a courts discretion to refrain from applying corporate attribution when doing so would be in the public interest, but left open whether the same principles apply to one-person corporations. The Court of Appeal saw no basis not to apply the Livent framework to a one-person corporation such as Golden Oaks. As a result, the trial judge should have considered whether to exercise her discretion not to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the payments to Golden Oaks. In the Court of Appeals view, attribution in this case would undermine the policy of insolvency law of ensuring equitable distribution of the assets among creditors. It would also compromise the social policy of promoting corporate responsibility to prevent fraud and regulatory non-compliance.\nBecause the Court of Appeal declined to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks, the court held that Golden Oaks lacked the knowledge to initiate the actions before it entered into bankruptcy, and hence the actions were not statute-barred. The court held that it was unnecessary to consider whether, by operation of s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002, Golden Oaks and the trustee were deemed to have had knowledge of the payments, or whether, under s. 5(1)(a)(iv), the trustees claims were not appropriate before the trustees appointment.\nEquitable Set-Off\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge did not err in applying the test for equitable set-off under s. 97(3) of the BIA. There was no basis to interfere with the trial judges conclusion that the appellants lacked the clean hands required to seek an equitable remedy. The trial judge had found the appellants had not engaged in above-board dealings and they knew or ought to have known that they were entering into illegal agreements.\nThe Unlawful Preference Claims Against Mr. Scott\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Scotts appeal from the trial judges finding that he was not acting at arms length from Golden Oaks when he received the commission and interest payments, and hence these payments were unlawful preferences under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA.\nThe Trustees Cross-Appeal on the Referral Agreements\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the trustees cross-appeal in part. The court held that the referral agreements were unlawful at common law and could not provide a juristic reason for the recipients enrichment. It ordered Mr. Scott and several of the other appellants to pay the estate the commissions that they had received.\nIssues\nThis appeal raises four issues:\nDid the Court of Appeal err in concluding that the trustees actions are not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002?\nDid the Court of Appeal err in concluding that the appellants are not entitled to rely on equitable set-off under s. 97(3) of the BIA?\nDid the Court of Appeal err in concluding that the referral agreements were illegal contracts at common law?\nDid the Court of Appeal err in affirming the trial judges conclusion that Mr. Scott and Golden Oaks were not dealing at arms length for the purpose of s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA?\nAnalysis\nAre the Trustees Actions Statute-Barred by the Limitations Act, 2002?\nThe first and main issue on this appeal is whether the trustees unjust enrichment claims against the appellants are statute-barred by the two-year limitation period under s. 4 of the Limitations Act, 2002. \nAlthough the trustees actions were launched more than two years after the illegal interest and commissions were paid to the appellants, the actions would not be statute-barred if the commencement of the limitation period were deferred by the rule of discoverability. Under the discoverability rule, a cause of action arises for purposes of a limitation period when the material facts on which it is based have been discovered or ought to have been discovered by the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable diligence (Grant Thornton LLP v. New Brunswick, 2021 SCC 31, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 704, at para. 29, citing Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147, at p. 224, and Kamloops (City of) v. Nielsen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2). Discoverability is a common law principle that is now codified by statute in Ontario. The relevant discoverability rules for this appeal are contained in ss. 5 and 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002.\nThe appellants argue that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the trustees actions are not statute-barred. They advance three arguments. \nFirst, the appellants submit that s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002 deemed the trustee to have had knowledge of the illegal interest and commission payments before the limitation period expired. They argue that, by operation of s. 12, Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the payments must be imputed to Golden Oaks and to the trustee as Golden Oaks successor. \nSecond, in the alternative, the appellants seek to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks under the corporate attribution doctrine. Again, therefore, Golden Oaks would be deemed to have known about the payments before the limitation period expired.\nThird, the appellants claim that the trial judge erred by concluding that it would not have been appropriate within the meaning of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002 for Golden Oaks to have sued the appellants before the trustees appointment. Thus, once again, the actions were not commenced before the limitation period expired. \nAs I will explain, I do not accept the first and second arguments, and it is unnecessary to address the third.\nSection 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002 Does Not Resolve Whether the Trustees Actions Are Statute-Barred\nSections 5(1)(a), 5(2), and 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002 are the relevant discoverability rules in this appeal.\nSection 5(1) sets out when a claim is discovered on the basis of actual or constructive knowledge. It provides that a claim is not discoverable until the person with the claim knew or ought to have known that: (i) an injury, loss, or damage had occurred; (ii) the injury, loss, or damage was caused by a particular act or omission; (iii) the act or omission was that of the person against whom the claim is made; and (iv) a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy the injury, loss, or damage. Section 5(2) states that a person with a claim is presumed to know of the matters referred to in s. 5(1)(a) on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based took place, unless the contrary is proved. Sections 5(1) and 5(2) provide:\n5 (1) A claim is discovered on the earlier of,\n\nthe day on which the person with the claim first knew,\n\nthat the injury, loss or damage had occurred,\n\nthat the injury, loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or omission,\n\nthat the act or omission was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and\n\nthat, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and\n\nthe day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and in the circumstances of the person with the claim first ought to have known of the matters referred to in clause (a).\n\nA person with a claim shall be presumed to have known of the matters referred to in clause (1)(a) on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based took place, unless the contrary is proved.\nSection 12 sets out rules for when persons shall be deemed to have had the knowledge referred to in s. 5(1)(a). Section 12(1) addresses claims brought by a successor in right, title, or interest to the person with a claim. It stipulates when the successor is to be imputed with the knowledge of a predecessor. Section 12(2) addresses claims brought by a principal. It stipulates when the principal is to be imputed with the knowledge of an agent. Section 12 provides:\n12 (1) For the purpose of clause 5(1)(a), in the case of a proceeding commenced by a person claiming through a predecessor in right, title or interest, the person shall be deemed to have knowledge of the matters referred to in that clause on the earlier of the following:\n\nThe day the predecessor first knew or ought to have known of those matters.\n\nThe day the person claiming first knew or ought to have known of them. \n\n(2)\tFor the purpose of clause 5(1)(a), in the case of a proceeding commenced by a principal, if the agent had a duty to communicate knowledge of the matters referred to in that clause to the principal, the principal shall be deemed to have knowledge of the matters referred to in that clause on the earlier of the following:\n\nThe day the agent first knew or ought to have known of those matters.\n\nThe day the principal first knew or ought to have known of them. \n\n(3)\tThe day on which a predecessor or agent first ought to have known of the matters referred to in clause 5(1)(a) is the day on which a reasonable person in the predecessors or agents circumstances and with the predecessors or agents abilities first ought to have known of them.\nThe appellants argue that the trustees actions are statute-barred by the combined effect of ss. 12(1) and 12(2) of the Limitations Act, 2002, making it unnecessary to consider the corporate attribution doctrine at common law. The appellants base this argument on two propositions. First, the appellants say that Mr. Lacasses knowledge must be imputed to Golden Oaks under s. 12(2) before the expiry of the limitation period, because Mr. Lacasse knew of the impugned payments and was Golden Oaks sole officer, director, and agent and acted within the scope of his authority when directing that the payments be made. Second, the appellants say that Golden Oaks knowledge must be imputed to the trustee under s. 12(1), because the trustee is the successor in interest to Golden Oaks. As a result, the appellants claim that the trustees actions were statute-barred. \nI agree with the second proposition  that Golden Oaks knowledge must be imputed to the trustee  but not with the first  that Mr. Lacasses knowledge must be imputed to Golden Oaks. \nI pause to note that the Court of Appeal concluded that it was unnecessary to decide whether the trustee was the successor of Golden Oaks under s. 12(1) (para. 60). In my view, this point must be addressed because the appellants argue that s. 12 is a sufficient basis to defeat the trustees actions without resorting to the corporate attribution doctrine.\nGolden Oaks knowledge should be imputed to the trustee because the trustee is the successor in interest to Golden Oaks. Section 12(1) applies to a proceeding commenced by a person claiming through a predecessor. The trustee began the proceedings against the appellants as successor to, and claiming through its predecessor, Golden Oaks. As this Court has noted, when a trustee takes control of a bankrupts property under s. 71 of the BIA, the trustee is the bankrupts successor (Lefebvre (Trustee of), 2004 SCC 63, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 326, at para. 36).\nHowever, even though Golden Oaks knowledge must be imputed to the trustee, I conclude that Mr. Lacasses knowledge cannot be attributed to Golden Oaks under s. 12(2) of the Limitations Act, 2002. Section 12(2) only applies to a proceeding commenced by a principal. Assuming, without deciding, that Golden Oaks acted as principal and Mr. Lacasse as its agent, and that Mr. Lacasse acted within the scope of the authority granted to him by Golden Oaks (both of which points the trustee disputes), the underlying proceedings were not commenced by Golden Oaks, the supposed principal, but by the trustee, who was not a principal of Mr. Lacasse. Therefore, s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002 alone does not resolve whether the trustees actions are statute-barred.\nThe question therefore remains: When might Golden Oaks be said to have acquired the knowledge of the matters referred to in s. 5(1)(a) of the Limitations Act, 2002? \nThe appellants assert before this Court that Mr. Lacasses knowledge can be imputed to Golden Oaks under the common law principles of agency. By contrast, both the trial judge and Court of Appeal addressed the question of attribution by examining the common law doctrine of corporate attribution. As the trustee correctly notes, however, [t]he [t]rial [j]udge did not determine whether [Mr.] Lacasse was an agent of Golden Oaks, and if so, whether he was acting within the scope of that authority (R.F., at para. 46, fn. 27). The trustee further submits that, in any event, the knowledge of an agent should not be attributed to a principal when the agent is acting in fraud of the principal or beyond the scope of the agents authority.\nIn my view, as the trustee correctly argues, there were insufficient findings at trial as to whether Mr. Lacasse was an agent of Golden Oaks and whether he was acting within the scope of his authority. This hampers this Courts ability to apply common law agency principles for the first time in this appeal. Although the trial judge concluded that Mr. Lacasse was the directing mind of Golden Oaks, this is a different question from whether Mr. Lacasse was an agent of Golden Oaks at the relevant times. I would therefore decline to address the appellants agency argument.\nAs a result, if Mr. Lacasses knowledge is to be attributed to Golden Oaks, it must be under the doctrine of corporate attribution, to which I now turn. \nThe Court of Appeal Did Not Err by Exercising Discretion Not to Attribute Mr. Lacasses Knowledge to Golden Oaks Under the Corporate Attribution Doctrine\nGuiding Principles of Corporate Attribution\nAs I noted in Aquino, [t]he common law doctrine of corporate attribution provides guiding principles for when the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind of a corporation may be attributed or imputed to the corporation (para. 1). In Aquino, I reviewed this Courts corporate attribution decisions in Canadian Dredge, Livent, and DeJong and persuasive authority from the United Kingdom, and summarized the guiding principles for the common law corporate attribution doctrine under Canadian law as follows:\nAs a general rule, a persons fraudulent acts may be attributed to a corporation if two conditions are met: (1) the wrongdoer was the directing mind of the corporation at the relevant times; and (2) the wrongful actions of the directing mind were performed within the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to them (Canadian Dredge, at pp. 681-82; Livent, at para. 100). \n\nAttribution will generally be inappropriate when: (1) the directing mind acted totally in fraud of the corporation (the fraud exception); or (2) the directing minds actions were not by design or result partly for the benefit of the corporation (the no benefit exception) (Canadian Dredge, at pp. 712-13; Livent, at para. 100).\n\nIn addition to the fraud and no benefit exceptions, courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when this would be in the public interest, in the sense that it would promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought (Livent, at para. 104; DeJong, at para. 2).\n\nIn all cases, courts must apply the common law corporate attribution doctrine purposively, contextually, and pragmatically. The corporate attribution doctrine is not a standalone principle (Livent, at para. 97); there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The court must always determine whether the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of a person should be treated as those of the corporation for the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought (Livent, at paras. 102-3). This may require the court to tailor the general rule of attribution or its exceptions to the particular legal context. Attribution may be appropriate for one purpose in one context but may be inappropriate for another purpose in another context. [para. 82]\nIn Livent, this Court had decided to leave for another day whether the same approach to corporate attribution should be taken in the context of a one-person corporation when the directing mind is the sole director and shareholder (para. 104). That question arises in this case, because Mr. Lacasse was the sole directing mind, shareholder, and director of Golden Oaks. \nThe Same Principles Apply to One-Person Corporations\nThe appellants argue that this Court should adopt a different approach to corporate attribution for one-person corporations. They say that the corporate attribution doctrine is superfluous in such cases because the corporation and sole directing mind are de facto alter egos of one another and are indistinguishable (A.F., at paras. 67, 70-71 and 76, citing Stone & Rolls Ltd. v. Moore Stephens, [2009] UKHL 39, [2009] 1 A.C. 1391). In a one-person corporation, the appellants claim, the sole director and shareholder cannot be committing a fraud on the corporation (A.F., at paras. 67 and 72, citing 373409 Alberta Ltd. (Receiver of) v. Bank of Montreal, 2002 SCC 81, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 312). For the same reason, the appellants assert that the judicial discretion not to attribute the knowledge of a directing mind to a corporation should never apply in the case of a one-person corporation.\nI do not accept these submissions. There is no principled basis to apply different guiding principles for corporate attribution to one-person corporations. As this Court explained in Aquino, the principles of corporate attribution must always be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically, having regard to the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought (paras. 56, 64 and 82). Those principles provide sufficient flexibility to deal with most if not all situations of corporate attribution, including for one-person corporations. Moreover, accepting the appellants argument that the knowledge of a sole directing mind must automatically be attributed to the corporation would effectively disregard the bedrock principle of corporate separateness. Even one-person corporations have an existence that is separate from that of their sole owner and directing mind.\nNor am I persuaded that the authorities cited by the appellants warrant a different approach for one-person corporations. The appellants cite this Courts decision in 373409 Alberta Ltd. as holding that a directing mind cannot commit a fraud against a one-person corporation. The appellants misinterpret that decision, which dealt with corporate authority, not corporate attribution. The sole shareholder and directing mind of two corporations (companies A and B) had altered a cheque payable to company A by adding company B as a payee and depositing the cheque in company Bs account. The bank accepted the cheque for deposit in company Bs account and the funds were later withdrawn. A receiver and manager of company A brought a claim in conversion against the bank for accepting the cheque for deposit. This Court held that the bank was not liable in conversion because the directing mind had corporate authority to deposit the cheque made payable to company A into company Bs account. Applying Canadian Dredge, the Court concluded that the action of the directing mind was not in fraud of company A, since the directing mind had full authorization as sole shareholder and director of company A to act as he did (paras. 22-23). This decision does not stand for the proposition that a sole directing mind can never commit a fraud against a one-person corporation.\nThe appellants also cite the House of Lords decision in Stone & Rolls as suggesting that a one-person corporation must always be imputed with the knowledge of its directing mind. The appellants view finds some support in the speech of Lord Walker in Stone & Rolls, who concluded that one or more individuals who for fraudulent purposes run a one-man company . . . cannot obtain an advantage by claiming that the company is not a fraudster, but a secondary victim (para. 174). The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom would later note that Stone & Rolls was interpreted by some as establishing a rule of law that the dishonesty of the controlling mind in a one-man company could be attributed to the company . . . whatever the context and purpose of the attribution in question (Singularis Holdings Ltd. v. Daiwa Capital Markets Ltd., [2019] UKSC 50, [2020] A.C. 1189, at para. 33). \nHowever, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has now repudiated this view and has embraced a purposive, contextual, and pragmatic approach to corporate attribution akin to the Canadian approach.\nIn Bilta (UK) Ltd. v. Nazir, [2015] UKSC 23, [2016] A.C. 1, Lord Neuberger wrote that, subject to certain caveats, Stone & Rolls should be put on one side in a pile and marked not to be looked at again (para. 30, citing In re King, [1963] Ch. 459, at p. 483, per Lord Denning M.R. (in another context)). Lords Toulson and Hodge similarly questioned the precedent set by Stone & Rolls, observing that the case had no majority ratio decidendi (para. 154).\nA few years later, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom revisited this issue in Singularis and unequivocally rejected the view that one-person corporations should be subject to an automatic rule of attribution. Speaking for the court, Lady Hale noted that Stone & Rolls had prompted much debate and criticism (para. 30). She held that there is no principle of law that the fraudulent conduct or knowledge of a director of a one-person corporation should always be attributed to the corporation (para. 34). Instead, she ruled, the answer to any question whether to attribute the knowledge of the fraudulent director to the company is always to be found in consideration of the context and the purpose for which the attribution is relevant (para. 34, citing the trial judge in the case, [2017] EWHC 257 (Ch), [2017] 2 All E.R. (Comm.) 445, at para. 182). She emphasized that even one-person corporations have their own legal existence and personality separate from that of any of the individuals who own or run them and that a sole shareholder can steal from his own company (para. 37). Lady Hale concluded that because the context and purpose of relevant law under which attribution is sought is now the guiding principle in questions of corporate attribution, Stone & Rolls can finally be laid to rest (para. 34; see also J. C. Fisher, The one man company after Patel v Mirza: attribution and illegality in Singularis Holdings v Daiwa Capital Markets (2020), 71 N.I.L.Q. 387).\nI agree that there is no rule that the knowledge or state of mind of the directing mind of a one-person corporation must invariably be imputed to the corporation. Context and purpose always serve as the primary considerations. The guiding principles for corporate attribution outlined in Aquino apply to all corporations, including one-person corporations.\nApplication to This Case\nIn my view, the Court of Appeal properly declined to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the illegal interest and commission payments to Golden Oaks. Under the discoverability rules in s. 5(1) of the Limitations Act, 2002, the limitation period did not commence until the trustee acquired knowledge of Golden Oaks claims, which at the earliest was only when the trustee was appointed. The trustees actions to recover payments from the appellants were thus started before the limitation period expired.\nAt the outset, I acknowledge that under the common law doctrine of corporate attribution, Mr. Lacasses knowledge may prima facie be attributed to Golden Oaks because Mr. Lacasse was the directing mind of Golden Oaks and his wrongful actions were performed in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. I also acknowledge, as the trial judge found, that Mr. Lacasse did not act solely to defraud the company for his own benefit, because some of the money raised from investors as part of the Ponzi scheme benefitted Golden Oaks and was used to pay for its operating expenses, the repair of properties, advertising, and other administrative expenses.\nEven so, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred by failing to consider the discretion not to apply the corporate attribution doctrine on public interest grounds (para. 56). It was therefore appropriate for the Court of Appeal to consider how the discretion should have been exercised.\nAs this Court noted in Aquino, courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when this would be in the public interest, in the sense that it would promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought (para. 82(c); see also Livent, at para. 104; DeJong, at para. 2). Here, the appellants seek to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks to trigger the discoverability rule under the Limitations Act, 2002 so as to bar the trustees claims under the BIA. There are two relevant laws engaged, and it is necessary to consider whether attribution would promote the purpose of each.\nThe purpose of the Limitations Act, 2002, like other modern limitations statutes, is to balance the interests of plaintiffs and defendants by promoting the established certainty, evidentiary, and diligence rationales underlying limitation periods (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Green, 2015 SCC 60, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 801, at para. 57; Novak v. Bond, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 808, at paras. 64-67). The certainty rationale seeks to promote accuracy and certainty in the adjudication of claims; the evidentiary rationale seeks to provide fairness to persons who might be required to defend against claims based on stale evidence; and the diligence rationale seeks to prompt persons who might wish to commence claims to be diligent in pursuing them in a timely fashion (Green, at para. 57, citing P. M. Perell and J. W. Morden, The Law of Civil Procedure in Ontario (2nd ed. 2014), at p. 123). \nMore specifically, the purpose of discoverability rules, such as s. 5(1)(a) of the Limitations Act, 2002, is to avoid the injustice of precluding an action before the person is able to raise it (Peixeiro v. Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549, at para. 36, per Major J.; see also Grant Thornton LLP, at para. 29).\nIn this case, attributing Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks would undermine the purpose of the discoverability rules of the Limitations Act, 2002. It would preclude Golden Oaks claims, even though, realistically, the company was not able to advance them before the trustee was appointed and the limitation period had expired. Mr. Lacasse had no interest in suing the appellants on behalf of Golden Oaks while he was solely in charge of the corporation. This would have exposed the Ponzi scheme he had orchestrated and from which he was profiting. As a practical matter, a lawsuit could only have been brought by the trustee, which was only after the trustee was appointed. As a result, attributing Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks would create an injustice by making the trustees claims statute-barred before the trustee was even able to assert them. \nThe main purposes of the BIA are the equitable distribution of the bankrupts assets among its creditors and the bankrupts financial rehabilitation (Orphan Well Association v. Grant Thornton Ltd., 2019 SCC 5, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 150, at para. 67; Alberta (Attorney General) v. Moloney, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para. 32; Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453, at para. 7; Poonian v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2024 SCC 28, at para. 1; Aquino, at para. 36). Other objectives of the BIA include preserving and maximizing the value of a debtors assets and protecting the public interest (9354-9186 Quebec inc. v. Callidus Capital Corp., 2020 SCC 10, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 521, at para. 40; Aquino, at para. 36).\nIn this case, attributing Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks would undermine the purposes of the BIA. Attribution would allow the appellants to retain the proceeds of their wrongful conduct and reduce the value of the debtors assets available for distribution to other creditors. As the Court of Appeal noted, attribution would lead to the perverse outcome of saving the appellants from the consequences of their collection of usurious interest, as well as depriving the trustee of a civil remedy that would inure solely for the collective benefit of legitimate creditors (para. 57). This would not be in the public interest. \nAs a result, the Court of Appeal appropriately exercised its discretion to refuse to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks because this would not have promoted the purposes of the laws under which attribution was sought.\nIt Is Not Necessary to Address Section 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002\nIn view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to address the trial judges conclusion that the trustees actions were not statute-barred on the basis that the actions were not appropriate within the meaning of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002. \nConclusion\nThe trustees actions are not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002.\nAre the Appellants Entitled to Claim Equitable Set-Off Under Section 97(3) of the BIA? \nThe appellants advance two arguments supporting their position that they should have been allowed to set off the interest payments they were ordered to pay the estate against the outstanding principal of their loans to Golden Oaks. First, the appellants say that there were no equitable grounds to deny them a set-off defence because they, too, were victims of the Ponzi scheme. Second, the appellants claim that the courts below erred in applying the principles of equitable set-off under s. 97(3) of the BIA by considering, as part of the equities, whether allowing a set-off would give them a priority over other creditors. They argue that this Court has accepted that the effect of s. 97(3) is that the party claiming set-off has Parliaments blessing for the reordering of his priority in bankruptcy by virtue of the operation of the law of set-off (A.F., at para. 101 (emphasis deleted), citing Husky Oil, at para. 60, per Gonthier J.).\nAs I will explain, I do not accept the appellants first submission, making it unnecessary to address the second.\nGeneral Principles of Set-Off in Bankruptcy\nThe law of set-off in the common law provinces or compensation under Quebec civil law allows parties with reciprocal claims to net out amounts owed to each other (J. D. Honsberger and V. W. DaRe, Honsbergers Bankruptcy in Canada (5th ed. 2017), at p. 332; D.I.M.S. Construction inc. (Trustee of) v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 52, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 564, at para. 34). \nSection 97(3) of the BIA governs claims of set-off or compensation in bankruptcy:\n(3) The law of set-off or compensation applies to all claims made against the estate of the bankrupt and also to all actions instituted by the trustee for the recovery of debts due to the bankrupt in the same manner and to the same extent as if the bankrupt were plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, except in so far as any claim for set-off or compensation is affected by the provisions of this Act respecting frauds or fraudulent preferences.\nSection 97(3) of the BIA incorporates the relevant provincial law of set-off or, in Quebec, the law of compensation, into proceedings the trustee institutes, in the same manner and to the same extent as that law would ordinarily apply in non-bankruptcy proceedings between the bankrupt and the creditor, subject to statutory exceptions relating to fraud and fraudulent preferences (see K. R. Palmer, The Law of Set-Off in Canada (1993), at pp. 176-77 and 192-93; L. W. Houlden, G. B. Morawetz and J. Sarra, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada (4th ed. rev. (loose-leaf)), at p. 5-1,086; Honsberger and DaRe, at pp. 332-33, 449 and 452-53; K. P. McElcheran, Commercial Insolvency in Canada (4th ed. 2019), at pp. 43-45; R. J. Wood, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law (2nd ed. 2015), at pp. 99-102). None of the statutory exceptions is at issue here.\nAllowing set-off in bankruptcy avoids the injustice of making a person who in the balance is not a debtor to the estate pay in full the sum due to the estate and receive only a dividend on the sums due from the estate (Lister v. Hooson, [1908] 1 K.B. 174 (C.A.), at p. 178, per Fletcher Moulton L.J., cited in Husky Oil, at para. 56; see also Palmer, at pp. 205-6; Honsberger and DaRe, at pp. 450-51).\nUnder legal set-off, which generally arises by statute, both obligations must be liquidated debts and there must be mutuality, meaning that the debts must be between the same parties and in the same capacity (Holt v. Telford, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 193, at p. 204; Palmer, at pp. 4-5 and 21; J. A. M. Judge and M. E. Grottenthaler, Legal and Equitable Set-Offs (1991), 70 Can. Bar Rev. 91, at pp. 94-97; Honsberger and DaRe, at pp. 332 and 451-52; Wood, at pp. 100-101).\nEquitable set-off is available on a broader basis than legal set-off. Equitable set-off applies to both liquidated and unliquidated claims and regardless of whether there is mutuality (Holt, at p. 212; Palmer, at p. 5; Judge and Grottenthaler, at p. 99; Honsberger and DaRe, at p. 332; Wood, at pp. 101-2). In considering whether to grant equitable set-off, courts look at the connection between debts that are sought to be set off against each other. If the connection between the debts is such that it would be unfair or inequitable to stand without set-off, then the courts will permit it (Honsberger and DaRe, at p. 332 (footnote omitted); see also McElcheran, at p. 44; Judge and Grottenthaler, at pp. 113-14; Palmer, at p. 5; Wood, at pp. 101-2). Equitable set-off is available if the transactions or dealings are so inseparably connected that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the plaintiff to enforce payment without taking into consideration the cross-claim (Wood, at p. 102).\nThe leading case on equitable set-off in Canada is this Courts decision in Holt, in which Wilson J. affirmed the following summary of the principles governing equitable set-off:\n1. The party relying on a set-off must show some equitable ground for being protected against his adversarys demands . . . .\n\n2. The equitable ground must go to the very root of the plaintiffs claim before a set-off will be allowed . . . .\n\n3. A cross-claim must be so clearly connected with the demand of the plaintiff that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the plaintiff to enforce payment without taking into consideration the cross-claim . . . .\n\n4. The plaintiffs claim and the cross-claim need not arise out of the same contract . . . .\n\n5. Unliquidated claims are on the same footing as liquidated claims . . . . [Citations omitted.]\n\n(Holt, at p. 212, citing Coba Industries Ltd. v. Millies Holdings (Canada) Ltd., [1985] 6 W.W.R. 14 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 22, per Macfarlane J.A.)\nCanadian courts have recognized a judicial discretion to disallow a defence of equitable set-off when the party invoking the defence does not have clean hands or is tainted by some other form of inequity (Palmer, at pp. 66-67; see also Grand Financial Management Inc. v. Solemio Transportation Inc., 2016 ONCA 175, 395 D.L.R. (4th) 529, at para. 98; Stewart v. Bardsley, 2014 NSCA 106, 353 N.S.R. (2d) 284, at paras. 58-59 and 61). This is because Courts of Equity do not permit parties to gain advantages that accrue to them solely through their own default (Palmer, at p. 67, citing Re Jason Construction Ltd. (1972), 29 D.L.R. (3d) 623 (Alta. S.C. (App. Div.)), at p. 628, per Johnson J.A.). To seek equitys assistance, [t]he plaintiff must not only be prepared now to do what is right and fair, but he must also show that his past record in the transaction is clean; for he who has committed inequity . . . shall not have Equity (Palmer, at p. 66, citing Snells Principles of Equity (28th ed. 1982), by P. V. Baker and P. St. J. Langan, at pp. 32-33). It is also settled that the iniquitous conduct must have an immediate and necessary relation to the particular transaction at issue, such that it would be unjust to grant relief in light of the conduct; the claimants general depravity, for instance, is irrelevant (Snells Equity (34th ed. 2020), by J. McGhee and S. Elliott, at p. 96; I. C. F. Spry, The Principles of Equitable Remedies: Specific Performance, Injunctions, Rectification and Equitable Damages (9th ed. 2014), at p. 254; see also Stewart, at paras. 62 and 65; DeJesus v. Sharif, 2010 BCCA 121, 284 B.C.A.C. 244, at paras. 85-86).\nCourts have refused to allow equitable set-off in a wide range of circumstances. Examples include when the claimant abused a position of trust within a corporation or was otherwise guilty of corporate misfeasance; wrongfully retained funds or failed to disburse them in contravention of an agreement; or waived payment of their claim (see Palmer, at pp. 67-71). The circumstances in which courts will deny equitable set-off are not closed or well defined, as undoubtedly the capacity for defendants to act inequitably will continue to grow over time (p. 67).\nThe Trial Judge Did Not Err in Denying Equitable Set-Off\nThe trial judge was correct to deny the appellants claim for equitable set-off on the basis that they did not come to court with clean hands.\nAlthough the trial judge accepted that the appellants were not aware they were involved with a fraudulent Ponzi scheme, she nevertheless concluded that they all knew, or should have known, that they were entering into illegal agreements (para. 484). She found that the evidence of the parties interactions shows that they did not conduct themselves in a manner consistent with above-board commercial dealings, such as by failing to undertake basic due diligence and ignoring several red flags in entering into the investment contracts with Golden Oaks (para. 509; see also para. 494). She also found the appellants were unjustly enriched by the payment of the illegal interest on the promissory notes (para. 514).  \nIn essence, the appellants did not come to court with clean hands because their wrongful conduct was at the heart of their claim for set-off, thus disentitling them from the benefit of the defence of equitable set-off (see Strellson AG v. Strellmax Ltd., 2018 ONSC 1808, 62 C.B.R. (6th) 328, at para. 43). This is a sufficient basis to dismiss this ground of appeal. \nIn view of this conclusion, it is not necessary to address the appellants second argument, that courts should apply the principles of equitable set-off under s. 97(3) of the BIA without considering whether a set-off would give the claimant a priority over other creditors.\nI nevertheless acknowledge that some cases appear to suggest that a court may consider, as part of the equities, the effect of allowing an equitable set-off on other creditors (see King Insurance, at para. 21; Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Sugarman (1999), 179 D.L.R. (4th) 548 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 24). Both the appellants and the intervener the Insolvency Institute of Canada argue that these cases conflict with s. 97(3) of the BIA and this Courts decision in Husky Oil. Since I have concluded that this important question of law does not affect the outcome in this appeal, I would leave it for consideration on another day (see Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at para. 6).\nConclusion\nThe appellants were not entitled to claim equitable set-off.\nWere the Referral Agreements Illegal Contracts at Common Law?\nThe appellants Mr. Scott, Judy McKenna, Mark McKenna, Susan McKillip, and 1531425 Ontario Inc. contend that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that their referral agreements with Golden Oaks were illegal contracts at common law. They argue that the trustee did not plead or argue common law illegality at trial and hence this issue was not properly before the Court of Appeal. They also say that the Court of Appeal erred in how it applied the illegality doctrine. They claim that they did not know that the referral agreements were illegal contracts and that they were less blameworthy than Golden Oaks. They therefore say that they should have been allowed to retain the commissions under their referral agreements.\nI do not accept these submissions. Based on my review of the record, the trustee pleaded and argued at first instance that the referral agreements were illegal contracts at common law. Although the trial judge erred by failing to address common law illegality, the Court of Appeal considered and correctly dismissed this argument.\nThe Trustee Pleaded and Argued Common Law Illegality at Trial\nI see no merit in the appellants argument that the trustee did not plead or argue at trial that the referral agreements were illegal contracts at common law. \nThe trustee pleaded and argued that the referral agreements were illegal contracts contrary to the Securities Act, and the trial judge rejected this argument. This conclusion was not appealed to the Court of Appeal and is not before this Court.\nThe trustee also pleaded and argued that the referral agreements were illegal contracts at common law. Each of the trustees statements of claim pleaded that the commissions received under the referral agreements were unlawful and contrary to the Ontario Securities Act (see A.R., vol. II, at p. 9; A.R., vol. III, at pp. 54, 109 and 218 (emphasis added)). At trial, the trustee continued to rely on common law illegality, arguing that the referral agreements were all illegal contracts with a criminal purpose that [were] all void ab initio (Road Map of Issues and Law of Doyle Salewski Inc., at paras. 43-44, reproduced in appellants book of authorities, at p. 25 (emphasis added)).\nThe trial judge herself noted that the trustee argued both common law and statutory illegality. The trustees first argument was that the referral agreements were contracts with a criminal purpose; that is, the operation of a fraudulent Ponzi scheme (para. 535); its second argument was that the appellants were engaged in the unlicensed sale of promissory notes, which met the definition of a security and was therefore contrary to the Securities Act. The trial judge rejected the second argument, but did not address the first (see C.A. decision, at para. 83). As the Court of Appeal noted, this was an error of law. Common law illegality was also fully argued before the Court of Appeal.\nThe Court of Appeal Correctly Held That the Referral Agreements Were Illegal Contracts at Common Law\nNor do I see any basis to impugn the Court of Appeals conclusion that the referral agreements were illegal contracts at common law.\nGeneral Principles of Contractual Illegality\nA contract may be unenforceable because of illegality if it is contrary to statute (statutory illegality) or void at common law on grounds of public policy (common law illegality) (S. M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts (8th ed. 2022), at p. 393; G. H. L. Fridman, The Law of Contract in Canada (6th ed. 2011), at p. 361; J. D. McCamus, The Law of Contracts (3rd ed. 2020), at pp. 500-502 and 544-46; A. Swan, J. Adamski and A. Y. Na, Canadian Contract Law (4th ed. 2018), at pp. 1079 and 1112; G. R. Hall, Canadian Contractual Interpretation Law (4th ed. 2020), at pp. 171-72).\nThe doctrine of illegality is sometimes expressed in the Latin maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio, which means that from an immoral consideration an action does not arise (Blacks Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), at p. 732; A. Mayrand, Dictionnaire de maximes et locutions latines utilisees en droit (4th ed. 2007), at pp. 173-74; Holman v. Johnson (1775), 1 Cowp. 341, 98 E.R. 1120, at p. 1121; Hall v. Hebert, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 159, at p. 175 (a plaintiff will not be allowed to profit from his or her wrongdoing)). This doctrine seeks to maintain the integrity of the legal system by ensuring that illegal conduct is treated consistently across the justice system, so that courts do not punish conduct with the one hand while rewarding it with the other (Hall, at p. 176, per McLachlin J., as she then was).\nA contract may be found illegal in one of two ways. First, a contract may be illegal per se if the performance of the contract violates a statutory or common law prohibition (Youyi Group Holdings (Canada) Ltd. v. Brentwood Lanes Canada Ltd., 2020 BCCA 130, 35 B.C.L.R. (6th) 326, at para. 47; see also Zimmermann v. Letkeman, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1097, at p. 1101, citing Alexander v. Rayson, [1936] 1 K.B. 169 (C.A.), at p. 182). For example, a contract may be illegal per se if it contains an agreement to do an act or for a consideration that is illegal, immoral, or contrary to public policy (Zimmermann, at p. 1101).\nSecond, even if a contract is not illegal per se, it may still be unenforceable if it was entered into, at least in part, with the object of committing an illegal act. Enforcement of such a contract may be so tainted with illegality that a court is entitled to refuse to enforce it (Youyi Group, at para. 48; see also Zimmermann, at p. 1101). Whether a contract was entered into with the object of committing an illegal act is a question of contractual interpretation that is evaluated objectively from the perspective of a reasonable person (Hall, at pp. 57-63; P. Benson, Justice in Transactions: A Theory of Contract Law (2019), at pp. 112-17).\nApplication to This Case\nThe appellants assert that the Court of Appeal applied the doctrine of common law illegality incorrectly. They claim they did not know that the illegal purpose of the referral agreements was to perpetuate a Ponzi scheme when they entered into these agreements and hence the agreements provided a juristic reason for the commissions they received from Golden Oaks. This juristic reason, they say, defeats the trustees unjust enrichment claims. \nI disagree. Even assuming, without deciding, that the referral agreements were not illegal per se, the Court of Appeal concluded that the referral agreements were tainted with illegality (para. 83). This conclusion is entirely consistent with the trial judges finding that the appellants were not aware they were involved in a fraudulent Ponzi scheme (para. 494). The appellants lack of subjective knowledge of illegality does not defeat the trustees illegality argument, because the question of whether a contract was entered into at least in part with the purpose of committing an illegal act is examined from the objective standpoint of a reasonable person. \nIn this case, each appellant that earned referral commissions also lent money to Golden Oaks under one or more promissory notes and received illegal interest as part of the Ponzi scheme (S.C.J. decision, at para. 95). The trial judge found as fact that the appellants, as lenders to Golden Oaks, all knew, or should have known, that they were entering into illegal agreements (para. 484). Although this finding relates specifically to the payment of illegal interest, it also bears on the appellants referral agreements, under which they agreed to recruit new investors to lend money to Golden Oaks at a criminal rate of interest in order to perpetuate the Ponzi scheme. The purpose of the referral agreements was, at least in part, to induce others to enter into the illegal loan agreements, a purpose that is contrary to public policy at common law (see McCamus, at p. 503; Waddams, at p. 396; Swan, Adamski and Na, at pp. 1083-84; Fridman, at p. 364). In such a case, a court is entitled to refuse to enforce the contracts. I therefore agree with the Court of Appeal that the referral agreements were illegal contracts at common law and hence could not provide a juristic reason to justify the commission payments.\nThe appellants also argue that the Court of Appeal did not consider whether the appellants could assert that they were not in pari delicto to defeat the trustees unjust enrichment claim. The appellants submit that they were less blameworthy than Golden Oaks and should not have to pay the estate of Golden Oaks what they received under the referral agreements. I would not give effect to this submission.\nAs part of the illegality doctrine, the Latin maxim in pari delicto, potior est conditio defendentis (in a case of equal fault, the position of the defending party is the better one) addresses the allocation of fault between parties and provides that, in a case of equal fault, the defendants position is stronger (Mayrand, at pp. 240-41; Hydro Electric Commission of Nepean v. Ontario Hydro, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 347, at pp. 410-11; Canada Cement LaFarge Ltd. v. British Columbia Lightweight Aggregate Ltd., [1983] 1 S.C.R. 452, at pp. 475-77; Waddams, at pp. 408-11; Fridman, at p. 414; McCamus, at pp. 546-56; Swan, Adamski and Na, at pp. 1102-3; L. Caylor and M. S. Kenney, In Pari Delicto and Ex Turpi Causa: The Defence of Illegality  Approaches Taken in England and Wales, Canada and the US (2017), 18 B.L.I. 259, at p. 260).\nThe law also recognizes that a plaintiff may recover, notwithstanding illegality, if the plaintiff is less blameworthy than the defendant (or not in pari delicto) (M. McInnes, The Canadian Law of Unjust Enrichment and Restitution (2nd ed. 2022), at p. 1152). The purpose of this rule is to avoid the injustice of allowing a defendant to be unjustly enriched by their wrongful conduct when they are more blameworthy than the plaintiff (pp. 1150 and 2257; McCamus, at pp. 546-47 and 552-54; Waddams, at p. 408).\nAssuming, without deciding, that the appellants as defendants can argue that they were not in pari delicto with Golden Oaks in order to enforce their illegal referral agreements and retain the commissions they received, rather than simply to seek restitution of payments made under their illegal agreements, this rule does not assist the appellants. It cannot be said that the appellants were less blameworthy than Golden Oaks, unless Golden Oaks is first attributed with Mr. Lacasses knowledge under the corporate attribution doctrine.\nI would decline to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks in the circumstances. As already noted, I accept that Mr. Lacasse was the directing mind of Golden Oaks and that neither the fraud nor the no benefit exception to corporate attribution applies. Even so, courts have discretion to decline to attribute the knowledge of the directing mind to a corporation when attribution would not promote the public interest, in the sense that it would not promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought. In this case, attributing Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks would not promote the purpose of either the BIA or the rule that a party who is less at fault should be entitled to recover under an illegal contract. Attribution would reduce the value of the estate available for distribution to creditors, thereby undermining the purpose of the BIA. Attribution would also allow the appellants to be unjustly enriched by retaining the proceeds of their wrongful conduct, thereby undermining the purpose of the illegality doctrine.\nThe consequence of declining to attribute Mr. Lacasses knowledge to Golden Oaks is that the appellants cannot be said to be less blameworthy than Golden Oaks so as to allow them to retain the commissions they received under their illegal referral agreements.\nConclusion\nI see no error in the Court of Appeals conclusions regarding the doctrine of common law illegality.\nWere Mr. Scott and Golden Oaks Not Dealing at Arms Length for the Purpose of Section 95(1)(b) of the BIA?\nFinally, the appellant Mr. Scott argues that the trial judge erred in concluding that he and Golden Oaks were not dealing at arms length when Golden Oaks paid him commissions under their referral agreement and interest on his loans in the year before Golden Oaks bankruptcy. If these payments were not at arms length, they would constitute unlawful preferences and would be void as against the trustee and recoverable under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA. \nMr. Scott claims that the trial judge and Court of Appeal erred in law by focussing on his relationship with Golden Oaks writ large, as its real estate agent, rather than focussing on the specific transactions at issue (A.F., at para. 122). He says that the trial judges own factual findings show that he and Golden Oaks were in an adversarial relationship and acting in their own interests with respect to the impugned transactions (para. 122).\nI would reject this argument. I first set out the approach to non-arms length dealing under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA, and then address why the trial judge made no reviewable error.\nGeneral Principles of Non-Arms Length Dealing Under Section 95(1)(b) of the BIA\nPreferences occur when a debtor with insufficient assets to satisfy all its creditors pays one creditor preferentially over other creditors. Such payments are unfair because they undermine the scheme of distribution that would otherwise prevail in bankruptcy (Wood, at pp. 205-6; Honsberger and DaRe, at p. 375). Section 95(1)(b) of the BIA provides that transactions that have the effect of giving one creditor a preference over other creditors are void as against the trustee when they involve a non-arms length creditor within a specified period of time surrounding the bankruptcy. Section 95(1)(b) provides:\n95 (1) A transfer of property made, a provision of services made, a charge on property made, a payment made, an obligation incurred or a judicial proceeding taken or suffered by an insolvent person\n\n. . .\n\n(b) in favour of a creditor who is not dealing at arms length with the insolvent person, or a person in trust for that creditor, that has the effect of giving that creditor a preference over another creditor is void as against  or, in Quebec, may not be set up against  the trustee if it is made, incurred, taken or suffered, as the case may be, during the period beginning on the day that is 12 months before the date of the initial bankruptcy event and ending on the date of the bankruptcy.\n\n(See also Wood, at p. 215; Honsberger and DaRe, at p. 387.)\nThe BIA does not define an arms length transaction. It does, however, stipulate that [i]t is a question of fact whether persons not related to one another were at a particular time dealing with each other at arms length (s. 4(4)). A finding of non-arms length dealing attracts a high level of appellate deference and is reviewable only for palpable and overriding error (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 36).\nCourts generally examine the following criteria in determining whether unrelated persons are dealing at arms length: (i) whether there was a common mind that directed the bargaining for both parties to a transaction; (ii) whether the parties to a transaction were acting in concert without separate interests; and (iii) whether there was de facto control (Canada v. McLarty, 2008 SCC 26, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 79, at paras. 43 and 62; Montor Business Corp. (Trustee of) v. Goldfinger, 2016 ONCA 406, 36 C.B.R. (6th) 169, at para. 68, citing Piikani Nation v. Piikani Energy Corp., 2013 ABCA 293, 86 Alta. L.R. (5th) 203, at para. 29; Wood, at pp. 204-5).\nThe Trial Judge Did Not Err in Finding Non-Arms Length Dealing\nThe trial judge correctly addressed the question of non-arms length dealing under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA. I agree with the Court of Appeal that although the trial judge was required to focus on the transactions at issue between Golden Oaks and Mr. Scott, it was appropriate for her to consider these transactions in the overall context of the parties relationship, including the Ponzi scheme that these transactions facilitated and Mr. Scotts role in that scheme. In McLarty, this Court rejected a restrictive approach under which a trial judge could examine only an impugned transaction, but not the parties relationship at any other time or the facts relating to any other transaction (para. 65). Likewise, here, the trial judge was entitled to consider the totality of the evidence in determining whether parties were dealing at arms length (see National Telecommunications Inc., Re, 2017 ONSC 1475, 45 C.B.R. (6th) 181, at para. 48; National Telecommunications v. Stalt, 2018 ONSC 1101, 59 C.B.R. (6th) 263, at para. 41). \nI also see no palpable and overriding error in the trial judges findings that Mr. Scott and Golden Oaks were not dealing at arms length and were acting in concert under Mr. Lacasses direction to perpetuate the Ponzi scheme. The trial judge found that Mr. Scott participated in Golden Oaks operations in 2012 and regularly represented the company or acted on its behalf. She also found that Mr. Scott knew that he was helping to prop up a Ponzi scheme. She quoted text messages from Mr. Scott to another real estate agent in which he described Golden Oaks as a pyramid, Ponzie [sic] like, and a house of cards (para. 319). Mr. Scott understood, to quote his own words, that if [o]ne day investors stop, the whole house of cards would collapse (para. 319 (emphasis deleted)). \nThe trial judges factual and credibility findings were extensive. She rejected most of Mr. Scotts evidence, noting that he was not in any way a credible witness, and concluding that [h]is account of his involvement with Lacasse and Golden Oaks in his affidavits was manifestly untrue (para. 276). She found that he lied to the court (para. 276), and highlighted gross inconsistencies between his evidence and other evidence that she found credible (para. 291). As a result, the trial judge said she gave no weight to any of Scotts testimony, unless it was corroborated by other evidence that she did accept (para. 291). I see no basis for this Court to intervene with any of these findings.\nConclusion\nThe trial judge had ample basis in the record to find as fact that Mr. Scott and Golden Oaks were not acting at arms length in the impugned transactions.\nDisposition\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nI agree that the claims in unjust enrichment brought by the respondent trustee in bankruptcy, Doyle Salewski Inc., against the appellant investors are not time-barred by the two-year limitation period set out in s. 4 of the Limitations Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B. However, I reach this conclusion for different reasons than my colleague.\nWith respect, the main question raised by this appeal is not how the common law doctrine of corporate attribution should be applied to a one-person corporation (majority reasons, at para. 1). Rather, the relevant question is the following: Are the trustees claims in unjust enrichment against the appellants time-barred? As I will explain, there is no need to resort to the corporate attribution doctrine to answer this question  be it in connection with a one-person corporation or a different type of corporation. This is especially so given that, as the appellants contend and as my colleague states, the same principles apply to one-person corporations as to other types of corporations (see majority reasons, at paras. 9, 65 and 71; A.F., at para. 1).\nFurthermore, I agree with my colleague and the courts below that the appellants are not entitled to set off the interest payments they were ordered to repay to the bankruptcy estate of Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc. (Golden Oaks) against the outstanding principal of their loans to Golden Oaks pursuant to s. 97(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (BIA). However, in my view, and with respect, the trial judge erred in considering the effect of preferring one creditor over the general body of creditors as part of her set-off analysis.\nIndeed, through s. 97(3), Parliament has indicated that set-off in insolvency must be considered in the same manner and to the same extent as it would outside of the insolvency context. In this way, Parliament has given its blessing for the reordering of [a claimants] priority in bankruptcy by virtue of the operation of the law of set-off (Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453, at para. 60).\nFinally, my colleague addresses two other issues in his reasons: first, whether the referral agreements between some of the appellants and Golden Oaks were illegal contracts at common law; and second, whether the appellant Mr. Scott was dealing at arms length with Golden Oaks under s. 95(1)(b) of the BIA. I am in agreement with his disposition of those two issues.\nAnalysis\nThe trustee brought numerous actions in which it asserted claims in unjust enrichment and sought repayment of usurious interest payments and commission payments that Golden Oaks made to the investor appellants. The trustee suggested that there was no juristic reason for the payments that flowed to the appellants, as they were based on illegal contracts. In the trustees view, those payments were made to the deprivation of the company and the enrichment of the [appellants] (2019 ONSC 5108, 76 C.B.R. (6th) 3 (S.C.J. reasons), at para. 391). The trustee maintained that Golden Oaks could not have sued the appellants for unjust enrichment given that Joseph Gilles Jean Claude Lacasse controlled Golden Oaks and was using it for a Ponzi scheme. On the other hand, the appellants argued that the claims could have been commenced at any time before the receivership and bankruptcy. They suggested that the trustees rights were no greater or lesser than the rights of the bankrupt corporation. In the appellants opinion, resorting to the corporate attribution doctrine would be superfluous (A.F., at para. 71). As for the respondent trustee, it contends that the doctrine does not apply in this context (S.C.J. reasons, at para. 408).\nThe trustees claims in unjust enrichment were subject to a two-year limitation period pursuant to s. 4 of the Limitations Act, 2002. According to the Act, that limitation period began when the bankrupt first knew or ought to have known of its claims (see s. 12). The appellants argued that the limitation period had expired and that the claims were therefore barred as they were brought more than two years after the payment of illegal interest and commissions. The question of whether the trustees claims are time-barred is now before our Court.\nWhether the trustees claims in unjust enrichment are time-barred hinges on when the claims were discovered. Section 5(1) of the Limitations Act, 2002 sets out the principles of discoverability and indicates that a claim is discovered once certain criteria are met:\n5 (1) A claim is discovered on the earlier of,\n\nthe day on which the person with the claim first knew,\n\nthat the injury, loss or damage had occurred,\n\nthat the injury, loss or damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or omission,\n\nthat the act or omission was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and\n\nthat, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it; and\n\nthe day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and in the circumstances of the person with the claim first ought to have known of the matters referred to in clause (a).\n\n(2)\tA person with a claim shall be presumed to have known of the matters referred to in clause (1)(a) on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based took place, unless the contrary is proved.\nOnce again, the trustee brought the claims in unjust enrichment against the appellants. The question at issue is therefore as follows: When did the trustee, as the person with the claims, first know of the facts giving rise to them?\nIn What Capacity Did the Trustee Bring the Claims in Unjust Enrichment?\nI am of the opinion that, as my colleague states at para. 56 of his reasons, the trial judge correctly held that the trustee asserted the claims in unjust enrichment as a successor in interest to Golden Oaks (S.C.J. reasons, at para. 396). The BIA establishes that the trustee is the successor in interest to Golden Oaks, the bankrupt. On bankruptcy, a bankrupt ceases to have any capacity to dispose of or deal with its property, which immediately passes to and vests in the trustee (BIA, s. 71). The bankrupts property includes any cause of action the bankrupt may have (BIA, s. 2). As stated in s. 30(1)(d) of the BIA, the trustee may, with the permission of inspectors, bring, institute or defend any action or other legal proceeding relating to the property of the bankrupt. When this occurs, the trustee has no greater or lesser rights than the bankrupt corporation. Rather, [t]he trustee simply steps into the shoes of the bankrupt corporation, accepting it warts and all (Saulnier v. Royal Bank of Canada, 2008 SCC 58, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 166, at para. 50).\nSection 12(1) of the Limitations Act, 2002 establishes that when a successor in interest commences a proceeding, the successor shall be deemed to have the predecessors knowledge:\n12 (1) For the purpose of clause 5(1)(a), in the case of a proceeding commenced by a person claiming through a predecessor in right, title or interest, the person shall be deemed to have knowledge of the matters referred to in that clause on the earlier of the following:\n\nThe day the predecessor first knew or ought to have known of those matters.\n\nThe day the person claiming first knew or ought to have known of them.\nTherefore, pursuant to s. 12(1), as the successor in interest bringing these claims, the trustee is deemed to have Golden Oaks knowledge. The question then becomes: When did Golden Oaks discover the claims in unjust enrichment? To answer this question, my colleague asserts that we must apply the common law doctrine of corporate attribution. With respect, I disagree for the reasons explained below. Furthermore, I am of the view that unlike the companion case, Aquino v. Bondfield Construction Co., 2024 SCC 31, the present appeal does not require us to resort to the common law by way of the corporate attribution doctrine given that codified rules of attribution exist and are sufficient to dispose of this appeal. The distinction between the two cases can be found in the different types of recourse sought. In Aquino, the trustee brought its claims under s. 96 of the BIA in its representative capacity. The circumstances in the instant appeal are such that the trustee is acting as a successor in interest; it has stepped into the shoes of Golden Oaks.\nThe Common Law Doctrine of Corporate Attribution Is Reserved for Exceptional Cases\nHaving found that the trustee is deemed to have Golden Oaks knowledge, I must now turn to the question of when Golden Oaks came to discover this knowledge. My colleague contends the answer to this question lies in the common law doctrine of corporate attribution. Respectfully, I do not agree, because that doctrine, as I will explain, is reserved for exceptional cases. In my view, this is not such an exceptional case, as the question of discoverability can be answered using the codified rules of attribution, which include the general principles of agency.\nA corporation is an abstraction and, as such, has no will or mind of its own; [i]t is incapable itself of doing any physical act or being in any state of mind (Tesco Supermarkets Ltd. v. Nattrass, [1972] A.C. 153 (H.L.), at p. 198). Therefore, it is a necessary part of corporate personality that there should be rules by which acts are attributed to the company (Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd. v. Securities Commission, [1995] 2 A.C. 500 (P.C.), at p. 506). These rules tell one what acts . . . count as acts of the company (ibid.). As a result, [a]ny statement about what a company has or has not done, or can or cannot do, is necessarily a reference to the rules of attribution (primary [or] general) as they apply to that company (ibid.).\nA corporations primary rules of attribution are generally found in its corporate constitution. Directors, and sometimes shareholders, normally derive their authority to act from procedures established by statute or by the companys constitutional documents (P. Watts and F. M. B. Reynolds, Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency (23rd ed. 2024), at pp. 26-27). For example, the articles of association may specify that a majority vote of shareholders shall be a decision of the company (Livent Inc. (Receiver of) v. Deloitte & Touche, 2016 ONCA 11, 128 O.R. (3d) 225 (Livent CA), at para. 83, citing Meridian, at p. 506, revd in part on other grounds 2017 SCC 63, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 855 (Livent SCC)). However, [t]here are also primary rules of attribution found in business law and general rules of attribution  such as agency law (Livent CA, at para. 83; see also G. H. L. Fridman, Canadian Agency Law (3rd ed. 2017), at 11.1).\nThe practical realities of operating a business preclude a corporation from having all of its decisions confirmed by a resolution of the board of directors or a unanimous decision of the shareholders. As a result, a corporation appoints agents, whose acts count as acts of the company:\nThese primary rules of attribution are obviously not enough to enable a company to go out into the world and do business. Not every act on behalf of the company could be expected to be the subject of a resolution of the board or a unanimous decision of the shareholders. The company therefore builds upon the primary rules of attribution by using general rules of attribution which are equally available to natural persons, namely, the principles of agency. It will appoint servants and agents whose acts, by a combination of the general principles of agency and the companys primary rules of attribution, count as the acts of the company. And having done so, it will also make itself subject to the general rules by which liability for the acts of others can be attributed to natural persons, such as estoppel or ostensible authority in contract and vicarious liability in tort.\n\n(Meridian, at p. 506)\nThe primary rules of attribution are complemented by general rules grounded in business law, as explained by Lord Hoffman in Meridian: The companys primary rules of attribution together with the general principles of agency, vicarious liability and so forth are usually sufficient to enable one to determine its rights and obligations. In exceptional cases, however, they will not provide an answer (p. 507 (emphasis added)).\nPeter Watts and F. M. B. Reynolds echo a sentiment similar to that of Lord Hoffman, indicating that resort to the corporate attribution doctrine is reserved for unusual cases:\nIn construing statutes, contracts, or other documents intended to have legal effect, it will frequently be necessary to consider how the text applies to the owners of businesses who rely on agents to run the business, as all companies must. Usually, there will be little difficulty in assuming that the drafter intended the acts, omissions, and states of mind of appropriate agents to be attributed to the owner. [Emphasis added; p. 28.]\nEven though [t]he question of whether knowledge possessed by a corporate officer should be attributed back to his or her corporation is complex, [i]f the officer in question is the effective directing mind of the corporation, then any knowledge acquired by the officer will normally be so attributed back (K. P. McGuinness and M. Coombs, Canadian Business Corporations Law (4th ed. 2023), at 9-74, fn. 147, citing El Ajou v. Dollar Land Holdings plc, [1994] 1 B.C.L.C. 464 (C.A.)).\nIn my view, the facts of the present case do not fall into the class of exceptional cases referred to in Meridian. Rather, in this case, the rules of attribution  and specifically the codified principles of agency  provide an adequate answer, and the corporate attribution doctrine therefore need not be applied (see Meridian, at p. 507).\nI would also note that to employ the corporate attribution doctrine is to actively attribute the intent or knowledge of a corporations directing mind to the corporation (see Livent SCC). As my colleague states, the doctrine provides the rules that govern when actions, knowledge, state of mind or intent may be attributed to the corporation (majority reasons, at para. 62). While courts have discretion to refrain from applying the doctrine, the application of the doctrine, by definition, involves attributing or imputing something to the corporation when there is no other means to reach that result. That is not the situation here, as a codified means of attribution exists and therefore precludes the application of the doctrine on the basis of the principle that the common law should not displace the will of a legislature expressed in a statute.\nWith respect, it is not necessary to apply the corporate attribution doctrine because the codified rules at issue in the present appeal provide a complete answer and take precedence over the common law doctrine. The common law doctrine should be invoked only where the codified rules are inapplicable.\nMr. Lacasse Was Golden Oaks Agent Through the General Principles of Agency\nAgency Law and Corporations\nThe notion that corporations primarily operate through the concept of agency dates back at least as far as Yarborough v Governor and Company of The Bank of England (1812) 16 East 6 at 7 (Watts and Reynolds, at p. 26, fn. 171; see also McGuinness and Coombs, at 9-80). The principles of agency apply equally to corporations (as mere legal abstractions) and to natural persons: . . . the physical acts and state of mind of the agent are in law ascribed to the principal in the same way (Tesco Supermarkets, at p. 199, cited in Watts and Reynolds, at p. 25).\nIt is true that the rules by which the acts and states of mind of agents are attributed to their principals must remain sensitive to the legal question that is engaged by the facts (Watts and Reynolds, at pp. 25-26). At common law, an agents knowledge will not always be imputed to the principal; whether or not a company is fixed with the knowledge acquired by an agent will depend on the circumstances (R. v. Rozeik, [1996] 1 B.C.L.C. 380 (C.A.), at p. 385; see also Watts and Reynolds, at p. 588).\nThe relevant considerations in determining whether an agents knowledge is to be imputed to the principal include (1) the position of the agent in relation to the principal and whether the agent had a wide or narrow sphere of operations, and (2) the position of the agent in relation to the relevant transaction and whether he represented the principal in respect of that transaction (McGuinness and Coombs, at 9-74, fn. 147, citing Regina Fur Co. v. Bossom, [1957] 2 Lloyds Rep. 466 (Q.B.D.), at p. 484).\nIt is therefore necessary to establish whether the natural person or persons in question have the status and authority which in law makes their acts in the matter under consideration the acts of the company so that the natural person is to be treated as the company itself (R. v. Andrews-Weatherfoil Ltd., [1972] 1 W.L.R. 118 (C.A.), at p. 124).\nAn agent who acts for the company within the scope of his employment will usually bind the company since he is the company for the purpose of the transaction in question (Rozeik, at p. 385 (emphasis in original)). However, different considerations apply where an agent obtains information privately or is guilty of a wrong against the company (McGuinness and Coombs, at 9-74, fn. 147). A flexible approach must be adopted in imputing an agents knowledge to a principal, since in circumstances where an agent has acted in breach of duty to the principal, the law needs to preclude the agent and parties associated with him from asserting that they cannot be sued by the principal because the principal must be deemed to know what the miscreant agent knew (Watts and Reynolds, at p. 590).\nIn 373409 Alberta Ltd. (Receiver of) v. Bank of Montreal, 2002 SCC 81, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 312, our Court considered whether 373409 Alberta Ltd. had authorized the Bank of Montreal to deposit the proceeds of a cheque into a particular account. As noted by Blair J.A. in Livent CA, that case depended on the primary rules of attribution in corporate law, where the actions of the sole shareholder and director are attributed to the corporation (para. 110). Our Court held that because Douglas Lakusta, the sole owner of 373409, had instructed the Bank to deposit the proceeds into the account as it did, 373409 had authorized the act. Writing for the Court, Major J. reasoned as follows:\nThere can be no doubt that Lakustas act of directing the Bank to deposit the proceeds of the cheque into Legacys account can be attributed to and considered authorized by 373409. See Lennards Carrying Co. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co., [1915] A.C. 705 (H.L.), per Viscount Haldane L.C., at p. 713:\n\n. . . a corporation is an abstraction. It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own; its active and directing will must consequently be sought in the person of somebody who for some purposes may be called an agent, but who is really the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation. That person may be under the direction of the shareholders in general meeting; that person may be the board of directors itself. . . .\n\nHere, Lakusta was the sole shareholder, director, and officer of 373409. He was the only person capable of acting as the corporations directing mind, and he formed the entire ego and personality of the corporation. In his capacity as sole shareholder and director of the corporation, he had the full capacity to delegate authority to the corporations agents. He was the sole officer of the corporation, and its only agent. Consequently, any act which he undertook as 373409s agent must be deemed authorized by the corporation. The only conclusion available on the evidence was that Lakusta, qua shareholder and director, authorized Lakusta, qua officer, to deposit 373409s funds into Legacys account. [paras. 19-20]\nResort to the corporate attribution doctrine was not necessary in 373409 Alberta Ltd. The case cited in relation to that doctrine was only used to explain why the wrongfulness of Lakustas actions with respect to the creditors did not prevent his actions from being attributed to the corporation for the purpose of determining whether the bank was authorized to deal with the cheque (Livent CA, at para. 110, citing Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 662). The actions in question were instead attributed to the corporation on principles of agency (para. 111).\nThe principles outlined above make it clear that corporations must act through agents. The assessment of whether knowledge possessed by an agent should be attributed to the corporate principal is context-specific. However, when the agent in question is the effective directing mind of the corporation, the knowledge acquired by the agent will normally be attributed back to the principal (McGuinness and Coombs, at 9-74, fn. 147). With this in mind, I will now consider whether Mr. Lacasse was acting as Golden Oaks agent and, if so, whether his knowledge ought to be attributed to Golden Oaks through the principles of agency.\nMr. Lacasse Was Golden Oaks Agent\nMr. Lacasse founded and operated Golden Oaks (S.C.J. reasons, at para. 2). The trial judge concluded that Mr. Lacasse was the only officer of Golden Oaks and the only person with complete insight into its operations and finances (para. 78; see also para. 55). Golden Oaks was under Lacasses direction and was controlled solely by Lacasse (paras. 363 and 421). At trial, [t]here [was] no evidence that anyone had the means to challenge [Mr. Lacasses] control of [Golden Oaks] (para. 421).\nThere can be no doubt that Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the impugned promissory notes and commission payments can be attributed to and considered authorized by Golden Oaks (see 373409 Alberta Ltd., at para. 19; see also McGuinness and Coombs, at 9-74, fn. 147). I arrive at this conclusion based on the trial judges findings and the principle that if the agent in question is effectively the directing mind of the corporation, then any knowledge acquired by the agent in that capacity will be imputed to the principal.\nPursuant to the principles of agency, Mr. Lacasses knowledge of the Ponzi scheme, including of the impugned promissory notes and commission payments, is attributable to Golden Oaks. As in other cases where any knowledge acquired by the officer will normally be . . . attributed back [to the corporate principal], attributing the knowledge of Mr. Lacasse, as agent, back to Golden Oaks is consistent with a typical application of the principles of agency (McGuinness and Coombs, at 9-74, fn. 147, citing El Ajou).\nThe trustee asserts that the common law principles of agency include an exception for situations where an agent is guilty of fraud or misfeasance vis-a-vis the corporation (R.F., at para. 34, citing Fridman, at 10.6). Even accepting that, the exception does not apply here for two reasons.\nFirst, while the trial judge found that [t]hrough Golden Oaks, Lacasse operated a Ponzi scheme [that] was built on fraudulent misrepresentations about how money lent to Golden Oaks would be used (para. 474), this finding does not mean that Mr. Lacasse, as agent, committed fraud against the principal, Golden Oaks. This is because, in operating this scheme, Mr. Lacasse did not act in breach of his duties to Golden Oaks. Rather, Golden Oaks and Mr. Lacasse were one and the same. Mr. Lacasse was the sole officer and director of Golden Oaks. He was the effective directing mind of the corporation. Throughout the Ponzi scheme, he was acting within the scope of the authority granted to him by Golden Oaks. In other words, Mr. Lacasse represented Golden Oaks and did not act privately or of his own accord. As held by the trial judge, both Mr. Lacasse and Golden Oaks benefitted from his actions (at para. 412), thereby negating any fraud exception to the common law principles of agency. Second, this exception would not apply because reliance on the common law principles of agency is not required in order to decide this matter, as the legislature has codified the deeming rules of agency in s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002.\nSimilarly, with respect for my colleagues contrary assertion, it is neither appropriate nor necessary to resort to the corporate attribution doctrine to determine whether Mr. Lacasses knowledge ought to be imputed to Golden Oaks. In my view, s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002 provides a complete answer (see A.F., at para. 21). Indeed, s. 12(2) provides that the principal shall be deemed to have knowledge of the matters referred to in s. 5(1)(a) where the agent was duty-bound to communicate knowledge of those matters to the principal. Under the law of agency, Mr. Lacasses knowledge was that of Golden Oaks throughout the Ponzi scheme. Golden Oaks therefore had knowledge more than two years before the actions were commenced of the payments to the appellants that gave rise to the claims in unjust enrichment.\nMy colleague asserts that there were insufficient findings at trial as to whether Mr. Lacasse was an agent of Golden Oaks (majority reasons, at para. 60). Respectfully, this fails to account for the trial judges factual finding that Mr. Lacasses knowledge ought to be imputed to Golden Oaks on the basis that he founded and operated Golden Oaks, he was its only officer, he was the only person with complete insight into its operations and finances, he was exercising direction and sole control over the corporation, and his control was beyond challenge by anyone (paras. 2, 55, 78, 363, 413 and 421-22). In effect, the trial judge found him to be the sole directing mind of Golden Oaks. In my view, while an agent may not always be the sole directing mind of a corporation, that is the case here. By finding Mr. Lacasse to be the corporations sole directing mind, the trial judge effectively found him to be an agent. This finding of fact by the trial judge is owed deference. I agree with the appellants that refusing to acknowledge that Golden Oaks had knowledge of the claims in unjust enrichment, through Mr. Lacasse, creates a fiction atop a fiction, where the corporation is divorced from its alter ego for the purposes of extending the limitations period (A.F., at para. 77).\nHowever, this does not mark the end of the analysis on discoverability, because of the existence of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002. Even though Golden Oaks had the legal capacity to sue the appellants, it would not have been legally appropriate for Golden Oaks to commence proceedings. As a result, the trial judge was correct to conclude, on the basis of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002, that the claims were not discovered. I elaborate on this point in the section that follows.\nThe Claims in Unjust Enrichment Were Not Appropriate and Therefore Not Discoverable Until the Trustee Was Authorized by the Court to Bring Them\nThe fact that Golden Oaks, through Mr. Lacasse, knew of the injury, loss or damage and knew that it was caused by or contributed to by the appellants is not enough to establish that the claims were discovered for the purposes of the Limitations Act, 2002. Section 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002 establishes that Golden Oaks must also have known that, having regard to the nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would [have been] an appropriate means to seek to remedy it.\nWhether legal proceedings are appropriate is a fact-specific inquiry, such that case law applying s. 5(1)(a)(iv) is of limited assistance (407 ETR Concession Co. Ltd. v. Day, 2016 ONCA 709, 133 O.R. (3d) 762, at para. 34; see also Beniuk v. Leamington (Municipality), 2020 ONCA 238, 150 O.R. (3d) 129, at para. 60; Nelson v. Lavoie, 2019 ONCA 431, 47 C.C.P.B. (2nd) 1, at para. 25).\nDespite the limited assistance it provided, the trial judge referred to Ridel v. Goldberg, 2019 ONCA 636, 147 O.R. (3d) 23, when determining whether legal proceedings were appropriate prior to Golden Oaks bankruptcy. In Ridel, shareholders of a company sued the companys director. According to the shareholders, their claim was not discoverable until the corporation was bankrupt because it would not have been appropriate for them to bring proceedings in the companys name while it was controlled by the director (para. 59). Justice van Rensburg held that it was unnecessary to consider this argument because, prior to the bankruptcy, the director did not have complete control of the company. Indeed, the shareholders could have assumed control of [the companys] board of directors and caused [the company] to make a claim against [the director], or they could have commenced a derivative action on [the companys] behalf (para. 69).\nThe critical difference between Ridel and the instant case is that Golden Oaks was solely controlled by Mr. Lacasse. There was no one apart from Mr. Lacasse who could have pursued the claims in unjust enrichment in Golden Oaks name. As found by the trial judge, [t]here is no evidence that anyone had the means to challenge [Mr. Lacasses] control of the company (para. 421). However, Lacasse had no motivation to begin lawsuits on the companys behalf. On the contrary, bringing the actions would end the arrangement from which he was profiting personally and would expose the fraudulent Ponzi scheme that he had orchestrated (ibid.).\nIn my opinion, the trial judge was correct to hold that [a]lthough Golden Oaks may have known, through Lacasse, about its dealings with the [appellants], it did not and could not have known that it would be legally appropriate for it to sue them to recover its losses so long as it was directed by Lacasse (para. 424). When Golden Oaks became insolvent, Mr. Lacasse ceased to have unfettered control over it, and the possibility that the company could make claims in unjust enrichment actualized.\nAs the trial judge clarified, this is not to say that receivership and bankruptcy automatically reset the limitations clock. The claims in unjust enrichment were inappropriate because Mr. Lacasse had complete control over Golden Oaks. That control could have been severed by another event: Had Lacasse sold the company prior to the receivership, or appointed other directors, the claims in unjust enrichment might also have become discoverable at that point (para. 426).\nThe trustee brought the claims in unjust enrichment giving rise to this appeal between June 23 and July 23, 2015. Doyle Salewski Inc. was appointed as receiver on July 9, 2013 (then appointed as trustee on July 26, 2013). Therefore, the claims in unjust enrichment brought between June 23 and July 9, 2015, were all brought within the limitations period.\nThe actions that were commenced between July 10 and July 23, 2015, are time-barred unless there is a reason why it was not appropriate for the trustee to bring them as soon as the receivership order was issued. Like the trial judge, I conclude that it was not appropriate for the trustee to bring the actions until June 16, 2015, when the Ontario Superior Court issued an interim order permitting the trustee to serve the statements of claim on the appellants and to issue the actions. The insolvency process in this case was court-supervised. In such a context, it is inappropriate for a trustee to begin legal proceedings without the authorization of the court (S.C.J. reasons, at para. 435).\nAlthough the investments and interest payments in the Ponzi scheme were made outside of the two-year limitation period, the trustees claims were only discoverable once the trustee was appointed and had legal authority to bring the actions. I therefore conclude that the claims in unjust enrichment are not time-barred.\nSection 97(3) of the BIA Expressly Permits the Reordering of Creditors\nI agree with my colleague and the courts below that the appellants are not entitled to set off the interest payments they owe to Golden Oaks estate against the principal amounts of the loans that Golden Oaks still owes them. However, on this point, I believe some clarification is in order.\nThe trial judge provided two reasons for refusing the appellants claim for equitable set-off. First, the appellants did not come to court with clean hands. Second, because the effect of set-off is to prefer one creditor over the general body of creditors (inasmuch as the effect is to give the setting-off creditor a full recovery of the amount set-off), the permissible set-off [under s. 97(3)] is confined within narrow limits (para. 550 (text in brackets in original), citing King Insurance Finance (Wines) Inc. v. 1557359 Ontario Inc., 2012 ONSC 4263, 99 C.B.R. (5th) 227, at para. 21). The Court of Appeal appears to have endorsed the trial judges statement in this respect (paras. 68-69).\nThe appellants and the intervener the Insolvency Institute of Canada submit that the trial judges second reason runs afoul of both s. 97(3) of the BIA and our Courts decision in Husky Oil. They assert that a court cannot disallow an otherwise valid claim for set-off because of the effect that the set-off may have on other creditors and the priority of the creditors claims. I agree.\nSection 97(3) of the BIA is clear: The law of set-off or compensation applies . . . in the same manner and to the same extent as if the bankrupt were plaintiff or defendant, as the case may be, except in so far as any claim for set-off or compensation is affected by the provisions of this Act respecting frauds or fraudulent preferences. As the Insolvency Institute of Canada correctly notes in its factum, [a] faithful application of section 97(3) will no doubt place one creditor further ahead of others by enabling the . . . creditor to use his indebtedness to the bankrupt as a form of security. But that result provides no license for judicial disregard of Parliaments unambiguous policy choice (para. 6, citing Husky Oil, at para. 57, citing Stein v. Blake, [1995] 2 All E.R. 961 (H.L.), at p. 964).\nOur Court came to the same conclusion in Husky Oil. After reviewing academic commentary on permitting set-off in bankruptcy, our Court stated the following:\nWhile this academic debate is undoubtedly interesting, the fact remains that our Parliament has recognized in s. 97(3) of the Bankruptcy Act that the law of set-off applies to all claims made against the estate of the bankrupt. As a result, in the bankruptcy context, the law of set-off allows a debtor of a bankrupt who is also a creditor of the bankrupt to refrain from paying the full debt owing to the estate, since it may be that the estate will only fulfil a portion, if that, of the bankrupts debt. Consequently, in this limited sense the party claiming set-off has Parliaments blessing for the reordering of his priority in bankruptcy by virtue of the operation of the law of set-off. [para. 60]\nNothing in s. 97(3) of the BIA points to a residual judicial discretion to deny an otherwise valid claim for set-off on the basis of the effect of the set-off on other creditors. Indeed, it is reasonable to suggest that courts should not take into account the impact of a set-off on other creditors, as they are not without legislative direction in this area (see I.F., Insolvency Institute of Canada, at para. 13). In fact, set-off helps prevent or mitigate another type of unfairness: . . . making a person who in the balance is not a debtor to the estate pay in full the sum due to the estate and receive only a dividend on the sums due from the estate (Husky Oil, at para. 56, citing Lister v. Hooson, [1908] 1 K.B. 174 (C.A.), at p. 178; see also I.F., Insolvency Institute of Canada, at paras. 11-13). Consequently, I would reiterate what our Court stated in Husky Oil and clarify that as long as a partys claim for set-off is otherwise valid, that party has Parliaments blessing for the reordering of his priority in bankruptcy by virtue of the operation of the law of set-off (Husky Oil, at para. 60).\nConclusion\nWhile I agree with my colleague that the claims in unjust enrichment are not time-barred, resort to the corporate attribution doctrine is unnecessary in this case. As I have noted in these reasons, s. 12 of the Limitations Act, 2002 provides a complete answer.\nRather, during the time that Golden Oaks was solely controlled by Mr. Lacasse, claims against the individuals to whom Mr. Lacasse had Golden Oaks pay usurious interest and commission amounts were not discoverable because legal proceedings by Golden Oakes were not an appropriate means to seek to remedy that injury, loss or damage for the purposes of s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the Limitations Act, 2002. The claims were not discovered until the Ontario Superior Court authorized the trustee to begin the legal proceedings. The claims were therefore brought within the two-year limitation period.\nFinally, to the extent that their reasons can be taken to suggest that a court can disallow an otherwise valid claim for set-off under s. 97(3) of the BIA on account of the effect that the set-off may have on other creditors, the courts below were incorrect.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants: David | Sauve, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the respondents: Chaitons, Toronto; Torkin Manes, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General  Crown Law Office  Civil, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Insolvency Institute of Canada: Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg, Toronto.

(Golden Oaks) and its sole owner, shareholder, and directing mind, Joseph Gilles Jean Claude Lacasse (Mr. Lacasse). The scheme involved offering investors high-interest rates on promissory notes, and using funds from new investors to pay existing investors. The scheme collapsed in 2013, and Golden Oaks and Mr. Lacasse filed for bankruptcy. The trustee in bankruptcy, Doyle Salewski Inc., commenced actions against the investors to recover the payments made by Golden Oaks, claiming that the interest rates were illegal and the investors were unjustly enriched.\n\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario initially heard the matter, and the trial judge found that Golden Oaks was a Ponzi scheme and attributed Mr. Lacasse's knowledge to the company. However, the judge concluded that the trustee's actions were not statute-barred because legal proceedings were not appropriate before the trustee was appointed. The Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed that the trustee's actions were not statute-barred but exercised discretion not to attribute Lacasse's knowledge to Golden Oaks on public policy grounds. The matter was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the trustee's actions were not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002. The majority of the Court applied the principles of corporate attribution, summarized in Aquino v. Bondfield Construction Co., which apply to one-person corporations. The Court of Appeal properly exercised its discretion not to attribute Lacasse's knowledge to Golden Oaks, as this would have undermined the purposes of the discoverability rules and bankruptcy provisions.\n\nThe key legal principle established in this case is that courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when doing so would not promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Jamal holds that the trustee's actions are not statute-barred by the Limitations Act, 2002, as the principles of the corporate attribution doctrine apply to one-person corporations. The Court of Appeal appropriately exercised its discretion to refuse to attribute Mr. Lacasse's knowledge to the company because this would not have promoted the purposes of the laws under which attribution was sought.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that claims against a company operating a Ponzi scheme are not  statute-barred. </strong>Joseph  Lacasse owned and operated Golden Oaks Enterprises Inc, a rent-to-own residential  property company. Lorne Scott, one of the  appellants, was a real estate agent who was paid interest and commissions to  recruit new investors. The company  appeared to be successful, but, in reality, was a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme  is a form of fraud in which existing investors are paid with funds collected  from new investors. In this case, Mr. Lacasse lured investors to lend money to  the company for unlawfully high interest rates, and then paid existing  investors by recruiting new investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed in July 2013.  Doyle Salewski Inc. served as the \u201ctrustee in bankruptcy\u201d. A trustee  administers the property of a bankrupt person under the <em>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </em>(\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d).  Salewski started legal proceedings against the investors to recover the illegal  interest and commissions they were paid by Golden Oaks, arguing that they were  unjustly enriched. The investors argued in response that the actions were  statute-barred under Ontario\u2019s <em>Limitations  Act, 2002</em>, because Mr. Lacasse knew of the illegal payments when they were  made. The <em>Limitations Act, 2002 </em>says  that legal proceedings generally cannot be started more than two years after  the person making the claim knew or ought to have known of the claims. After  that point, they become \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.The  trial judge attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to the company. However, she found  that the trustee\u2019s actions against the company were not statute-barred for  other reasons. She ordered the investors to return the illegal interest  payments they had received. The investors appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision,  arguing that she had wrongly concluded that the actions were not statute-barred.  The trustee also appealed the trial judge\u2019s decision that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s  knowledge should be attributed to Golden Oaks. The  Court of Appeal did not accept the investors\u2019 arguments, and agreed with the  trustee that the trial judge should not have attributed Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge  to the company. The Court of Appeal concluded that there are public interest reasons  to ensure that those who benefitted from the Ponzi scheme could not avoid being  held responsible in legal proceedings by attributing Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge to  the company. The legal proceedings were therefore not statute-barred because Golden  Oaks did not have the knowledge to bring the actions at the relevant time. The  investors appealed to the Supreme Court, primarily on the grounds that Mr.  Lacasse\u2019s knowledge must be attributed to Golden Oaks, because it is a  one-person corporation and the two are essentially the same. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The knowledge of the sole officer and  shareholder of Golden Oaks should not be attributed to the corporation.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice Jamal concluded that the trustee\u2019s actions are not  statute-barred by the <em>Limitations Act,  2002</em>. The principles of the corporate attribution doctrine, summarized in  the companion appeal <em>Aquino v. Ernest  &amp; Young Inc.</em>, 2024 SCC 31, apply to one-person corporations. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. The Court of Appeal was therefore correct to  conclude that Mr. Lacasse\u2019s knowledge should not be attributed to the company.  This would not have promoted the purposes of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> or the <em>BIA</em>,  which include avoiding the injustice of barring a claim before a person is able  to make it, and ensuring a fair distribution of the bankrupt person\u2019s assets  and protecting the public interest.

B-3, s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B).\n\tA was the president and directing mind of two family-owned construction companies that worked on large-sale construction projects. When the companies began experiencing serious financial difficulties, restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings were commenced. The monitor and trustee in bankruptcys investigations revealed that for years A and several others had been fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from the debtor companies through a false invoicing scheme. The monitor and trustee in bankruptcy challenged the transactions and sought to recover the monies on the basis of s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA). This provision provides that a trustee in bankruptcy or, through s. 36.1 of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act, a monitor, may apply to a court to impugn and recover from a non-arms length party to a transaction some or all of the amount of the transfer at undervalue (defined in s. 2 of the BIA as a transaction in which a debtor transfers property or provides services to another person for no consideration or conspicuously less than fair market value), if the trustee can show, among other things, that the debtor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor.\n\tThe application judge held that the false invoice payments were transfers at undervalue and could be recovered by the monitor and trustee in bankruptcy under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA. First, the debtor companies had paid the monies to certain suppliers who provided nothing in return. Second, the debtor companies made the payments with the intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, as revealed by several badges of fraud. She rejected the argument that the debtor companies could not have had this intent because the payments were made at a time when the companies were not insolvent or at risk of insolvency. She attributed As fraudulent intent to the debtor companies and ordered A and the others to pay the monitor and trustee in bankruptcy the monies they received under the false invoicing scheme. The Court of Appeal affirmed the application judges ruling.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tThe application judge did not misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent. A court may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA even if the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. There is therefore no basis to interfere with the application judges conclusion that A intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor under the false invoicing scheme. Furthermore, As fraudulent intent should be attributed to the debtor companies because he was their directing mind and acted in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. The corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of its directing mind. In the context of a claim under s. 96 of the BIA, the fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution should not apply because these exceptions would undermine the purpose of this provision; accordingly, the test for corporate attribution under s. 96 is simply whether the person was the directing mind and whether their actions were performed within the sector or corporate responsibility assigned to them.\n\tSection 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA requires the party seeking to reverse a transfer at undervalue to prove, among other things, the debtors intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. This is a question of fact to be decided based on all the circumstances that existed at the time of the transfer. Because it is often difficult to adduce evidence of a debtors subjective intent, the intent requirement is often proved through the evidentiary shortcut of badges of fraud, which are suspicious circumstances from which a court may infer the debtors intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. Badges of fraud might include: (a) the debtor had few remaining assets after the transfer; (b) the transfer was made to a non-arms length party; (c) the debtor was facing actual or potential liabilities, was insolvent, or was about to enter a risky undertaking; (d) the consideration for the transaction was grossly inadequate; (e) the debtor remained in possession of the property for their own use after the transfer; (f) the deed or transfer had a self-serving and unusual provision; (g) the transfer was secret; (h) the transfer was made with unusual haste; and (i) the transaction was made despite an outstanding judgment against the debtor. The presence of a particular badge of fraud does not require a court to infer an intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, nor does the absence of a particular badge of fraud require the court to refrain from inferring that intent.\n\tThe BIA is clear that insolvency is not a prerequisite to finding a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. Section 96(1)(b)(ii) is disjunctive: the debtor must either be insolvent at the time of the transfer (s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(A)) or intend to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor (s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B)). It is therefore no answer to an application under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA to say that a corporate debtor was not insolvent and was paying its creditors in full and on time at the time of the transfers. Although the debtors financial condition at the time of the transfer is one badge of fraud that may be relevant in inferring an intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, whether that intent exists must be determined based on all the circumstances.\n\tIn the instant case, A intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under the false invoicing scheme. The transfers were made between non-arms length parties; the debtor companies received no value; the truth about the transfers was hidden behind false invoices describing services that were never provided; the transfers were made with unusual haste; and at the time of the transfers the companies had significant long-term and off-balance sheet liabilities and potential liabilities as guarantors for other companies. However, to satisfy s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B), the monitor and trustee in bankruptcy must show that the debtor companies intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. This requires showing why it is appropriate to attribute As fraudulent intent to the debtor companies.\n\tThe common law doctrine of corporate attribution provides guiding principles for when the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind of a corporation may be attributed or imputed to the corporation. Although a corporation is a separate legal person, it has no mind or will of its own. A directing mind must be identified because a corporation can only act through a human agent. The guiding principles for the common law doctrine of corporate attribution provide that as a general rule, a persons fraudulent acts may be attributed to a corporation if two conditions are met: the wrongdoer was the directing mind of the corporation at the relevant times; and the wrongful actions of the directing mind were performed within the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to them. Attribution will generally be inappropriate when the directing mind acted totally in fraud of the corporation or the directing minds actions were not by design or result partly for the benefit of the corporation  known as the fraud or no benefit exceptions. In addition to these exceptions, courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when this would be in the public interest, in the sense that it would promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought. In all cases, courts must apply the common law corporate attribution doctrine purposively, contextually, and pragmatically. The corporate attribution doctrine is not a standalone principle; there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The court must always determine whether the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of a person should be treated as those of the corporation for the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought. This may require the court to tailor the general rule of attribution or its exceptions to the particular legal context. Attribution may be appropriate for one purpose in one context but inappropriate for another purpose in another context.\n\tThe fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution do not apply in the context of a transfer at undervalue under s. 96 of the BIA. These exceptions would undermine rather than promote the purpose of this statutory provision. The purpose of s. 96 is to protect creditors from harmful actions by a debtor that would diminish the assets available for recovery. That purpose is served by attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the corporations directing mind to the corporation, so long as those actions were performed within the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to them. This is so even if the directing mind acted in fraud of the corporation, and even if the corporation did not benefit from the actions of the directing mind. By contrast, applying the fraud and no benefit exceptions would render the transfer at undervalue remedy meaningless and would deny third-party creditors a statutory remedy that Parliament intended would be available to protect them.\n\tIn the instant case, the fraud and no benefit exceptions are inappropriate and inapplicable and as a result As intent should be attributed or imputed to the debtor companies. Attributing As fraudulent intent to the debtor companies would advance the public policy underlying s. 96 of the BIA as attribution would allow creditors to recover fraudulently transferred assets that unlawfully reduced the value of the estate available for distribution to creditors.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v.

This Court applied the corporate attribution doctrine in the criminal context in Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 662, and in the civil context in Deloitte & Touche v. Livent Inc. (Receiver of), 2017 SCC 63, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 855, and Christine DeJong Medicine Professional Corp. v. DBDC Spadina Ltd., 2019 SCC 30, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 530. This appeal requires the Court to apply the corporate attribution doctrine in the bankruptcy and insolvency contexts.\nThe appellants stole tens of millions of dollars from two construction companies through a false invoicing scheme. One of the appellants, John Aquino, was the companies directing mind. The respondents, in their capacities as trustee in bankruptcy and monitor of the companies, applied to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to recover some of this money on the basis that the false invoice transactions were transfers at undervalue under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (BIA).\nA transfer at undervalue is a transaction in which a debtor transfers property or provides services to another person for no consideration or conspicuously less than fair market value (BIA, s. 2). Section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA provides that a trustee in bankruptcy may apply to a court to impugn and recover from a non-arms length party to a transaction some or all of the amount of the transfer at undervalue, if the trustee can show that the debtor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor. Section 96 of the BIA applies in a corporate restructuring through s. 36.1 of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (CCAA).\nThe application judge and Court of Appeal for Ontario accepted that the false invoice payments were transfers at undervalue. They applied the doctrine of corporate attribution to attribute Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent to the debtor companies and ordered the appellants to pay the trustee and monitor the monies they received under the false invoicing scheme.\nThe appellants now revive before this Court two arguments that were rejected by the courts below. First, the appellants argue that the application judge had no basis to conclude that the debtor companies, through the actions of Mr. Aquino, intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. They say that the companies were paying their creditors in full and on time when the false invoicing scheme was underway and that the companies financial condition at those times could not be determined on the record before the court. I do not accept this submission. A court may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) even if the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfers at undervalue. I also see no basis to interfere with the findings of the application judge, affirmed by the Court of Appeal, that the record contains many indicia or badges of fraud showing that Mr. Aquino misled stakeholders as to the companies true financial condition, reduced the funds available to pay long-term creditors, and increased the companies debts.\nSecond, the appellants argue that Mr. Aquinos fraudulent state of mind cannot be attributed to the debtor companies under the corporate attribution doctrine. They invoke the so-called fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution previously recognized by this Court (Canadian Dredge, at pp. 681-82 and 712-13; Livent, at para. 100). They claim that there can be no attribution in this case because Mr. Aquino acted in fraud of the debtor companies and his actions did not benefit the companies. I do not accept this submission either. As the trustee notes, this position amounts to saying that the common law doctrine of corporate attribution allows a fraudulent directing mind and his accomplices to avoid liability because they defrauded the company they ran (R.F., at para. 1 (emphasis in original)). The corporate attribution doctrine does not countenance  much less require  such a perverse result.\nThis Court has established that the corporate attribution doctrine is not a standalone principle (Livent, at para. 97); there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of its directing mind. Rules of attribution that may be appropriate in one context for one purpose may be inappropriate in another context for another purpose. When the rules of attribution undermine the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought, the court should adapt the attribution rules to promote the purpose of the relevant law. \nIn my view, the fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution do not apply in the context of a transfer at undervalue under s. 96 of the BIA. These exceptions would undermine rather than promote the purpose of this statutory provision. The purpose of s. 96 is to protect creditors from harmful actions by a debtor that would diminish the assets available for recovery. That purpose is served by attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the corporations directing mind to the corporation, even if the directing mind acted in fraud of the corporation, and even if the corporation did not benefit from the actions of the directing mind. By contrast, applying the fraud and no benefit exceptions would deny third-party creditors a statutory remedy that Parliament intended would be available to protect them.\nApplying these principles to this appeal, Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent should be attributed to the debtor companies because he was their directing mind and acted in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. I would dismiss the appeal.\nBackground\nBondfield Construction Company Limited (Bondfield) and its affiliate, 1033803 Ontario Inc., known as Forma-Con Construction (Forma-Con), were family-owned construction companies that worked on large-scale construction projects in Ontario. At all relevant times, Mr. Aquino was the president and directing mind of Bondfield and Forma-Con.\nBy 2018, Bondfield and Forma-Con were experiencing serious financial difficulties. The respondent Ernst & Young Inc. was retained to review their financial situation, which led to the commencement of restructuring proceedings regarding Bondfield in April 2019 and bankruptcy proceedings regarding Forma-Con in December 2019. The court appointed Ernst & Young Inc. as the monitor of Bondfield, and the respondent KSV Restructuring Inc. as the trustee in bankruptcy of Forma-Con.\nThe monitor and trustees investigations revealed that, for years, Mr. Aquino and several other appellants had been fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from Bondfield and Forma-Con through a false invoicing scheme. The scheme was simple. Mr. Aquino and his accomplices made up false invoices from certain suppliers  including Mr. Aquinos holding company  for services that were never provided. Bondfield and Forma-Con then paid the false invoices promptly, often within a few days, at the direction of Mr. Aquino or other appellants. Bondfield paid more than $21.8 million and Forma-Con paid more than $11.3 million towards false invoices in the five years before the commencement of insolvency proceedings, the period within which alleged transfers at undervalue to non-arms length parties are reviewable.\nThe trustee and monitor each commenced proceedings before the Ontario Superior Court to challenge the false invoice transactions as transfers at undervalue. Section 96 of the BIA provides a trustee and, through s. 36.1 of the CCAA, a monitor, with a remedy to unwind or claim reimbursement of some or all the value of the assets transferred from a debtor in circumstances that qualify as a transfer at undervalue.\nIn this case, the applications of the trustee and monitor were brought under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA, which required them to show that: (a) the false invoice transactions were transfers at undervalue; (b) the transfers occurred in the five-year period preceding the initial bankruptcy event; (c) the recipients of the transfers were not dealing at arms length with the debtor companies; and (d) the debtor companies intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor.\nJudicial History\nOntario Superior Court of Justice, 2021 ONSC 527, 88 C.B.R. (6th) 60 (Dietrich J.)\nThe application judge held that the false invoice payments made by Bondfield and Forma-Con were transfers at undervalue under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA and could be recovered by the monitor and trustee. The transfers were at undervalue because Bondfield and Forma-Con had paid tens of millions of dollars to certain suppliers who provided nothing in return. In a separate costs endorsement, the application judge found the payments involved serious corporate malfeasance and corporate looting and reprehensible and scandalous behaviour (2021 ONSC 7514, at paras. 29 and 33, reproduced in A.R., at pp. 66-67). She also found the appellants were not dealing at arms length with Bondfield or Forma-Con because they collaborated with them in orchestrating the false invoicing scheme.\nThe application judge ruled that Bondfield and Forma-Con made these payments with the intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. She rejected the appellants argument that Bondfield and Forma-Con could not have had this intent because the payments were made at a time when they were not insolvent or at risk of insolvency. When evaluating a corporate debtors intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, the corporate debtors financial health at the time of the transfer is a relevant but not determinative consideration.\nIn the application judges view, the record revealed several badges of fraud establishing that Mr. Aquino, as the directing mind of Bondfield and Forma-Con, had a fraudulent intent at the time of the false invoice payments. Bondfield and Forma-Con made the payments secretly, in haste, to non-arms length persons, for no consideration, based on phony invoices for services that were never delivered (para. 157). Bondfield and Forma-Con also had several actual or potential long-term and off-balance sheet liabilities and were expanding their activities, even though they knew their lender was not willing to lend them more. In addition, Mr. Aquino was injecting capital into Bondfield to disguise its true financial condition from stakeholders, and unusual accounting practices made it impossible to determine the companies financial condition. Based on all the circumstances, the application judge found that the false invoice payments reduced the funds available to pay the companies long-term creditors.\nFinally, the application judge held that Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent could be attributed to Bondfield and Forma-Con. The application judge ruled that, as a matter of statutory interpretation and public policy, the corporate attribution doctrine set out in Canadian Dredge does not apply under s. 96 of the BIA. In her view, because a purpose of the BIA is to provide proper redress to creditors, the intention of the debtor in s. 96 should be interpreted liberally to include the intention of individuals in control of the corporation, regardless of whether those individuals had an intent to defraud the corporation itself (para. 229).\nThe application judge determined that when Mr. Aquino authorized the false invoice payments, he was acting within his area of responsibility of engaging with suppliers and overseeing the provision of services and materials. The appellants, either as bogus suppliers or facilitators of the false invoicing scheme, were all parties or privies to the transfers at undervalue. They were therefore jointly and severally liable to repay the amounts transferred from Bondfield and Forma-Con.\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario, 2022 ONCA 202, 160 O.R. (3d) 284 (Lauwers J.A., Coroza and Sossin JJ.A. concurring)\nThe Court of Appeal affirmed the application judges ruling that Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat, or delay Bondfield and Forma-Cons creditors, and attributed Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA. Accordingly, the court dismissed the appeal.\nThe court rejected the appellants attempt to relitigate their position that Mr. Aquino did not intend to defraud, defeat, or delay Bondfield and Forma-Cons creditors because the fraudulent payments were made at times when the companies were financially stable. The court noted that the application judge mustered a phalanx of facts in support of her conclusions and took a pragmatic view on the totality of the evidence (paras. 38 and 46). The Court of Appeal affirmed that the interests of creditors were imperilled by the transfers because Bondfield and Forma-Con were already experiencing mounting financial difficulties, and concluded that it would have been entirely unreasonable for Mr. Aquino to believe that, during that time, the interests of the companies creditors would not be endangered by this fraudulent scheme (para. 45). The Court of Appeal deferred to the application judges findings that Mr. Aquino intended to defeat the companies creditors. At a minimum, Mr. Aquino was reckless as to whether the scheme would have this effect, which also established his fraudulent intent under s. 96.\nThe court attributed Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con under the common law corporate attribution doctrine. It distilled three principles from Canadian Dredge, Livent, and DeJong: (1) courts must be sensitive to the legal context in which a directing minds intent is sought to be imputed to a corporation; (2) corporate attribution is an exercise grounded in public policy, and policy factors that favour imputing a directing minds wrongdoing to a corporation are based on the social purpose of holding the corporation responsible; and (3) courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the directing minds intent to the corporation when this would be in the public interest.\nThe court observed that the criminal and civil contexts in which the corporate attribution doctrine has traditionally been applied differ from the bankruptcy context. In the criminal and civil contexts, attributing the directing minds intent to the corporation might be justified if the corporation benefits from the improper activities of the directing mind, but would be unjustified if the corporation does not benefit. In the bankruptcy context, the court noted, the policy currents flow rather differently. . . . [A]ttributing the intent of a companys directing mind to the company itself can hardly be said to unjustly prejudice the company . . ., when the company is no longer anything more than a bundle of assets to be liquidated with the proceeds distributed to creditors (para. 77). The court found that it would make little sense to adopt an approach that would favour fraudsters over legitimate creditors.\nBased on these considerations, the Court of Appeal reframed the test for corporate attribution in the bankruptcy context as turning on the following question: [W]ho should bear responsibility for the fraudulent acts of a companys directing mind that are done within the scope of his or her authority  the fraudsters or the creditors? (para. 78). The court held that it would be perverse and counter to the purpose of s. 96 of the BIA to allow the appellants to benefit at the expense of Bondfield and Forma-Cons creditors. It therefore found that Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent must be imputed to Bondfield and Forma-Con, even though both companies were also victims of Mr. Aquinos fraud.\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nSection 2 of the BIA defines a transfer at undervalue:\ntransfer at undervalue means a disposition of property or provision of services for which no consideration is received by the debtor or for which the consideration received by the debtor is conspicuously less than the fair market value of the consideration given by the debtor;\nSection 96 of the BIA governs transfers at undervalue:\n96 (1) On application by the trustee, a court may declare that a transfer at undervalue is void as against, or, in Quebec, may not be set up against, the trustee  or order that a party to the transfer or any other person who is privy to the transfer, or all of those persons, pay to the estate the difference between the value of the consideration received by the debtor and the value of the consideration given by the debtor  if\n\n(a) the party was dealing at arms length with the debtor and\n\n(i) the transfer occurred during the period that begins on the day that is one year before the date of the initial bankruptcy event and that ends on the date of the bankruptcy,\n\n(ii) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by it, and\n\n(iii) the debtor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor; or\n\n(b) the party was not dealing at arms length with the debtor and\n\n(i) the transfer occurred during the period that begins on the day that is one year before the date of the initial bankruptcy event and ends on the date of the bankruptcy, or\n\n(ii) the transfer occurred during the period that begins on the day that is five years before the date of the initial bankruptcy event and ends on the day before the day on which the period referred to in subparagraph (i) begins and\n\n(A) the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by it, or\n\n(B) the debtor intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor.\n\n(2) In making the application referred to in this section, the trustee shall state what, in the trustees opinion, was the fair market value of the property or services and what, in the trustees opinion, was the value of the actual consideration given or received by the debtor, and the values on which the court makes any finding under this section are, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the values stated by the trustee.\n\n(3) In this section, a person who is privy means a person who is not dealing at arms length with a party to a transfer and, by reason of the transfer, directly or indirectly, receives a benefit or causes a benefit to be received by another person.\nSection 36.1 of the CCAA applies the BIAs provisions on transfers at undervalue to the CCAA with any modifications that the circumstances require:\n36.1 (1) Sections 38 and 95 to 101 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act apply, with any modifications that the circumstances require, in respect of a compromise or arrangement unless the compromise or arrangement provides otherwise.\n\n(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a reference in sections 38 and 95 to 101 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act\n\n(a) to date of the bankruptcy is to be read as a reference to day on which proceedings commence under this Act;\n\n(b) to trustee is to be read as a reference to monitor; and\n\n(c) to bankrupt, insolvent person or debtor is to be read as a reference to debtor company.\nIssues\nThis appeal raises two issues: \n(1)\tIs a debtors financial condition relevant or determinative in establishing the debtors intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA?\n\n(2)\tWhen can the intent of the directing mind of a corporation to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor be attributed to the corporate debtor under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA?\nAnalysis\nThe key question in this appeal is whether the trustee and monitor established Bondfield and Forma-Cons intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B). When the debtor is a corporation, the court must determine whether the corporate debtors directing mind intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor having regard to the transactions completed by the corporation, and then consider whether the directing minds intent can be attributed to the corporation. Thus, the Court must first determine whether the evidence established Mr. Aquinos intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, and then determine whether his intent should have been attributed to Bondfield and Forma-Con. The appellants claim that the courts below erred on both points.\nIs a Debtors Financial Condition Relevant or Determinative in Establishing the Debtors Intent to Defraud, Defeat, or Delay a Creditor Under Section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA?\nThe appellants assert that the application judge made an extricable error of law by concluding that Bondfield and Forma-Con intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA because the companies were paying their creditors in full and on time and because the court found that it could not determine the companies financial condition at the time of the transfers at undervalue. The appellants say that the application judge could not make an order under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA without first determining the companies financial condition at the time of the impugned transactions.\nI do not accept this submission. I will first review the legal framework for transfers at undervalue under s. 96 of the BIA and address how a debtors intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor can be proved through the evidentiary shortcut of badges of fraud. I will then explain why I see no reviewable error in the application judges conclusion that the requisite intent under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) was established.\nTransfers at Undervalue Under the BIA\nGeneral Principles\nA transfer at undervalue is defined under s. 2 of the BIA as a disposition of property or provision of services for which no consideration is received by the debtor or for which the consideration received by the debtor is conspicuously less than the fair market value of the consideration given by the debtor. Transfers at undervalue reduce the value of the debtors estate and diminish the value of the creditors realizable claims (A. Duggan and T. G. W. Telfer, Gifts and Transfers at Undervalue, in S. Ben-Ishai and A. Duggan, eds., Canadian Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law: Bill C-55, Statute c. 47 and Beyond (2007), 175, at p. 191).\nSection 96 has been described as a tool to address asset stripping by a debtor (Urbancorp Toronto Management Inc. (Re), 2019 ONCA 757, 74 C.B.R. (6th) 23, at para. 40; see also Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise, 2004 SCC 68, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 461, at para. 91, on the predecessor provision, s. 100 of the BIA). Section 96 of the BIA provides a remedy to reverse transfers at undervalue that occurred within a specified period of time before the date of bankruptcy (Urbancorp, at para. 48; Estate of Gavin v. Gavin, 2023 PECA 8, 10 C.B.R. (7th) 30, at paras. 14 and 142; Pitblado LLP v. Houde, 2015 MBQB 85, 318 Man. R. (2d) 39, at para. 35). \nSection 96 of the BIA allows a trustee in bankruptcy to ask a court to review a suspected transfer at undervalue. When the conditions of s. 96 are met, the court may declare the transfer void as against the trustee or grant judgment against the parties or privies to the transfer for the amount of the difference between the consideration given by the debtor and the consideration received. Section 36.1 of the CCAA incorporates s. 96 of the BIA by reference and allows a monitor to impugn a transfer at undervalue in a corporate restructuring.\nBecause the purpose of s. 96 is to protect creditors rather than to punish debtors, the remedy is directed against the person who received the transfer of property from the debtor and others who were privy to the transfer (R. J. Wood, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law (2nd ed. 2015), at p. 191). A person who is privy to the transfer is defined under the BIA as a person who is not dealing at arms length with a party to a transfer and, by reason of the transfer, directly or indirectly, receives a benefit or causes a benefit to be received by another person (s. 96(3)).\nTransfers at Undervalue Undermine the Integrity of the Bankruptcy Process\nThe two main purposes of the BIA are the equitable distribution of the bankrupts assets among his or her creditors and the bankrupts financial rehabilitation (Orphan Well Association v. Grant Thornton Ltd., 2019 SCC 5, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 150, at para. 67, quoting Alberta (Attorney General) v. Moloney, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para. 32, citing Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453, at para. 7; see also Poonian v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2024 SCC 28, at para. 1). A bankrupts financial rehabilitation involves allowing honest but unfortunate debtors to obtain a discharge of their debts and have a fresh start, free of debt (F. Bennett, Bennett on Bankruptcy (26th ed. 2024), at p. 37). Other objectives of the bankruptcy system include preserving and maximizing the value of a debtors assets and protecting the public interest (9354-9186 Quebec inc. v. Callidus Capital Corp., 2020 SCC 10, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 521, at para. 40). \nTransfers at undervalue frustrate the purposes of the BIA. They prejudice creditors by diminishing the value of a debtors estate and reducing the funds available for distribution. They can also involve fraudulent debtors abusing the bankruptcy process by seeking a fresh start after trying to place assets beyond the reach of creditors, thereby undermining the integrity of the bankruptcy process (see, generally, Wood (2015), at pp. 188 and 190-91; L. W. Houlden, G. B. Morawetz and J. Sarra, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada (4th ed. rev. (loose-leaf)), vol. 2, at p. 5-959; J. D. Honsberger and V. W. DaRe, Honsbergers Bankruptcy in Canada (5th ed. 2017), at pp. 8-9).\nSection 96 of the BIA Establishes Three Classes of Impeachable Transactions\nSection 96 of the BIA establishes three classes of impeachable transactions (R. J. Wood, Transfers at Undervalue: New Wine in Old Wineskins?, in J. P. Sarra and B. Romaine, eds., Annual Review of Insolvency Law 2017 (2018), 1, at p. 4).\nThe first class of impeachable transaction involves arms length dealing between the debtor and a party or privy to the transfer (s. 96(1)(a)). This class of transaction has the most stringent requirements to reverse a transfer. The trustee must show that the transfer at undervalue occurred within one year of the bankruptcy, the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by it, and the debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor.\nThe second class of impeachable transaction involves a transfer at undervalue to a party who was not dealing at arms length with the debtor and which occurred within one year of the bankruptcy (s. 96(1)(b)(i)). In this context, the concept of a non-arms length relationship is one in which there is no incentive for the transferor to maximize the consideration for the property being transferred in negotiations with the transferee (Houlden, Morawetz and Sarra, at p. 5-966; see also Wood (2015), at p. 204; BIA, s. 4). The trustee need not show that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or that the debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor.\nThe third class of impeachable transaction involves a transfer at undervalue to a party who was not dealing at arms length with the debtor, which occurred more than one year but less than five years before the bankruptcy (s. 96(1)(b)(ii)). In this class, the trustee may obtain a remedy by proving that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer or was rendered insolvent by it (s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(A)), or by proving that the debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor (s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B)).\nThis appeal involves the third class of transaction, under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA.\nThe Debtors Intent to Defraud, Defeat, or Delay a Creditor Can Be Proved Through Badges of Fraud\nSection 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA requires the party seeking to reverse a transfer at undervalue to prove the debtors intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. This is a question of fact to be decided based on all the circumstances that existed at the time of the transfer (Urbancorp, at para. 53; Montor Business Corp. (Trustee of) v. Goldfinger, 2016 ONCA 406, 36 C.B.R. (6th) 169 (Montor CA), at para. 72).\nBecause it is often difficult to adduce evidence of a debtors subjective intent, the intent requirement is often proved through the evidentiary shortcut of badges of fraud. Badges of fraud are suspicious circumstances from which a court may infer the debtors intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor (Urbancorp, at para. 52; Montor CA, at para. 72; Wood (2018), at p. 24). The badges of fraud approach to inferring a debtors intent to defraud creditors is of ancient vintage, dating back to Twynes Case in 1601 (Wood (2018), at p. 24; Twynes Case (1601), 3 Co. Rep. 80b, 76 E.R. 809).\nCase law has recognized the following non-exhaustive examples of badges of fraud: (a) the debtor had few remaining assets after the transfer; (b) the transfer was made to a non-arms length party; (c) the debtor was facing actual or potential liabilities, was insolvent, or was about to enter a risky undertaking; (d) the consideration for the transaction was grossly inadequate; (e) the debtor remained in possession of the property for their own use after the transfer; (f) the deed of transfer had a self-serving and unusual provision; (g) the transfer was secret; (h) the transfer was made with unusual haste; and (i) the transaction was made despite an outstanding judgment against the debtor (Montor CA, at para. 73; see also Wood (2018), at p. 24; Wood (2015), at pp. 223-25 (in the fraudulent conveyance context)).\nA badge of fraud must be considered in the context of the surrounding circumstances and in relation to the question of the debtors intention at the time of the transfer (Urbancorp, at para. 65). A court must avoid analyzing the debtors actions with the benefit of hindsight; it must resist the temptation to inject back into the circumstances surrounding the impugned transaction knowledge about how events unfolded after that time (Montor Business Corp. (Trustee of) v. Goldfinger, 2013 ONSC 6635, 8 C.B.R. (6th) 200, at para. 272, affd 2016 ONCA 406, 36 C.B.R. (6th) 169). The presence of one or more badges of fraud does not require the court to infer an intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, nor does the absence of a particular badge of fraud prevent the court from inferring this intent (Urbancorp, at paras. 53 and 55; Montor CA, at para. 72; see also Wood (2018), at pp. 24-25). \nApplication to This Case\nThe application judge found that Bondfield and Forma-Cons payments under the false invoicing scheme involved several badges of fraud: the transfers were made between non-arms length parties; Bondfield and Forma-Con received no value; the truth about the transfers was hidden behind phony invoices describing services that were never provided; the transfers were made with unusual haste when compared to Bondfield and Forma-Cons usual billing cycle; and at the time of the transfers the companies had significant long-term and off-balance sheet liabilities and potential liabilities as guarantors for other companies (paras. 157-58). \nBased on these badges of fraud, the application judge found that the evidence as a whole provided a firm basis for finding that John Aquino, as principal and directing mind of [Bondfield] and Forma-Con, had fraudulent intent  an intent to defraud, defeat or delay creditors (para. 160). She found that [i]t was in no way reasonable for him to believe that, throughout the period of the impugned transactions, [Bondfield] and Forma-Con did not have long-term creditors, like lenders, . . . who would not be defeated or delayed by the draining of tens of millions of dollars from [Bondfield] and Forma-Con through the false invoicing schemes (para. 160).\nFaced with these findings, the appellants contend that the application judge made an extricable error of law by concluding that Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat, or delay Bondfield and Forma-Cons creditors when the record before the court did not allow it to determine the companies true financial condition at the time of the transfers. They argue that a corporations financial condition can be determinative on the question of intent, even in the presence of other badges of fraud, if there were enough assets remaining to pay creditors after the transfers at undervalue. The appellants note that Bondfield and Forma-Con were paying their creditors in full and on time for most of the applicable review periods (A.F., at para. 77). They ask this Court to remit the case to the application judge with instructions to determine the companies financial condition at the time of the transfers.\nI would not give effect to this submission. The application judge did not misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent. It is no answer to an application under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA to say that the debtor was not insolvent and was paying its creditors in full and on time at the time of the transfers. The BIA is clear that insolvency is not a prerequisite to finding a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. Section 96(1)(b)(ii) is disjunctive: the debtor must either be insolvent at the time of the transfer (s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(A)) or intend to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor (s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B)). The appellants argument would effectively introduce an insolvency requirement into the latter provision, contrary to Parliaments decision not to do so.\nThe appellants argument would also give a potentially determinative role to one factor, namely, the debtors financial condition at the time of the transfer. Although the debtors financial condition at the time of the transfer is one badge of fraud that may be relevant in inferring an intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor (Urbancorp, at para. 64), whether that intent exists must be determined based on all the circumstances. Again, the presence of a particular badge of fraud does not require a court to infer an intent to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, nor does the absence of a particular badge of fraud require the court to refrain from inferring that intent (Urbancorp, at paras. 53 and 55; Montor CA, at para. 72). A court may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) even if the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue.\nThe application judge considered the financial condition of the debtor companies and rejected the appellants argument that Mr. Aquino did not intend to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor just because the transfers were made when Bondfield and Forma-Con could meet their liabilities as they became due. She found that Bondfield was already in a precarious financial position at the time of the transfers and noted Mr. Aquinos admission that he and another stakeholder routinely injected capital into Bondfield to mislead stakeholders about the companys financial condition (paras. 191-93). The application judge could not determine the companies true financial condition because the companies financial records contained deceptive accounting and were unreliable (para. 193). Ultimately, after considering the companies financial condition and numerous other badges of fraud, the application judge saw no innocent explanation for a false invoicing scheme (para. 162). In these circumstances, the appellants cannot now reproach the court for being unable to draw precise conclusions about the companies financial condition. \nI therefore see no basis to interfere with the application judges conclusion that Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under the false invoicing scheme.\nHere, however, the debtors are Bondfield and Forma-Con, not Mr. Aquino. To satisfy s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B), the trustee and monitor must show that Bondfield and Forma-Con intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor. This requires showing that it is appropriate to attribute Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con. I address that issue next.\nWhen Can the Intent of the Directing Mind of a Corporation to Defraud, Defeat, or Delay a Creditor Be Attributed to the Corporate Debtor Under Section 96 of the BIA?\nThe appellants contend that even if Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor, his intent cannot be attributed to Bondfield and Forma-Con under the corporate attribution doctrine. They invoke the fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution recognized in this Courts decisions in Canadian Dredge, Livent, and DeJong, and they note that the application judge found that Mr. Aquino intended to defraud both companies and the companies did not benefit from his fraud. The appellants say that this Courts jurisprudence imposes minimal criteria for corporate attribution that must be met in every case, regardless of the context, and that the courts below erred by reframing the corporate attribution doctrine to allow for attribution in this case.\nI do not accept this submission. As I will explain, the corporate attribution doctrine does not prescribe rigid rules to be applied regardless of the legal context. Instead, this Court has directed that the doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically to promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought. The fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution should not apply to a transfer at undervalue claim under s. 96 of the BIA because these exceptions would undermine the purpose of this provision. Consequently, Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent should be attributed to Bondfield and Forma-Con.\nThe Need for Rules of Corporate Attribution\nA corporation is a separate legal person distinct from its founders, shareholders, and directors. The separate legal personality of a corporation has been a bedrock principle of law since the House of Lords seminal decision in Salomon v. Salomon & Co., [1897] A.C. 22 (Chevron Corp. v. Yaiguaje, 2015 SCC 42, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 69, at para. 80; see also S. Rappos, A Reframing of the Corporate Attribution Doctrine in the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Context, in J. Corraini and D. B. Nixon, eds., Annual Review of Insolvency Law 2022 (2023), 1, at p. 1). \nThe separate legal personality of a corporation is recognized by business corporation statutes across Canada, which provide that a corporation has the capacity, rights, powers, and privileges of a natural person (see Canada Business Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44, s. 15; Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, s. 15; Business Corporations Act, CQLR, c. S-31.1, s. 10; Business Corporations Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. B-9, s. 16(1); Business Corporations Act, S.B.C. 2002, c. 57, s. 30; The Business Corporations Act, 2021, S.S. 2021, c. 6, s. 3-1(1); The Corporations Act, C.C.S.M., c. C225, s. 15(1); Business Corporations Act, S.N.B. 1981, c. B-9.1, s. 13(1); Companies Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 81, s. 26(8); Business Corporations Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. B-6.01, s. 22(1); Corporations Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. C-36, s. 27(1); Business Corporations Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 20, s. 18(1); Business Corporations Act, S.N.W.T. 1996, c. 19, s. 15(1)).\nAlthough a corporation is a separate legal person, it has no mind or will of its own. As explained by Kevin P. McGuinness and Maurice Coombs, [e]very single act that involves a corporation, and every decision not to act, is the action or inaction of human beings and only human beings (Canadian Business Corporations Law (4th ed. 2023), vol. 1, at 9-11). This has long been recognized by the jurisprudence. In Canadian Dredge, for example, this Court said that a corporation may only act through agents (p. 675). The Court cited Viscount Haldane L.C.s speech in Lennards Carrying Co. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co., [1915] A.C. 705 (H.L.), at pp. 713-14, which explained the need to identify a directing mind because a corporation can only act through a human agent:\n. . . a corporation is an abstraction. It has no mind of its own any more than it has a body of its own; its active and directing will may consequently be sought in the person of somebody who for some purposes may be called an agent, but who is really the directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the personality of the corporation. [pp. 678-79]\nProfessor Darcy L. MacPherson notes that [t]he attribution of personhood to a corporation in turn necessitates a mechanism to give that person a mental state. . . . Since so many areas of our law depend on mental states, the law must therefore attribute a mental state to the corporation (The Civil and Criminal Applications of the Identification Doctrine: Arguments for Harmonization (2007), 45 Alta. L. Rev. 171, at p. 186; see also E. Ferran, Corporate Attribution and the Directing Mind and Will (2011), 127 Law Q. Rev. 239, at p. 241).\nIn Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd. v. Securities Commission, [1995] 2 A.C. 500 (P.C.), widely considered to be the leading United Kingdom decision on corporate attribution, Lord Hoffman discussed the need for rules of attribution this way:\nAny proposition about a company necessarily involves reference to a set of rules. A company exists because there is a rule (usually in a statute) which says that a persona ficta shall be deemed to exist and to have certain of the powers, rights and duties of a natural person. But there would be little sense in deeming such a persona ficta to exist unless there were also rules to tell one what acts were to count as acts of the company. It is therefore a necessary part of corporate personality that there should be rules by which acts are attributed to the company. These may be called the rules of attribution. [p. 506]\nThe rules of attribution, Lord Hoffman elaborated, can arise from three sources: (1) primary rules of attribution, contained in a corporations statutes or constitution, or general company law, stipulating when decisions taken by shareholders or the board of directors are to be treated as decisions of the corporation; (2) general rules of attribution, such as under the law of agency or vicarious liability, which also apply to natural persons; and (3) the common law of corporate attribution, which requires the court to fashion and apply a special rule of attribution for the particular context in which the question arises (Meridian, at p. 507; see also Bilta (UK) Ltd. v. Nazir, [2015] UKSC 23, [2016] A.C. 1, at para. 190, per Lords Toulson and Hodge; Singularis Holdings Ltd. v. Daiwa Capital Markets Ltd., [2019] UKSC 50, [2020] A.C. 1189, at para. 28, per Lady Hale). The last of these three sources, the common law of corporate attribution, is sometimes known as the identification doctrine because it supplies rules for when a corporation may be identified with the actions or intent of its directing mind (see Canadian Dredge, at pp. 670, 673, 682-83 and 692-93; MacPherson, at p. 172).\nThis Courts Corporate Attribution Jurisprudence\nThis Court has addressed the corporate attribution doctrine in three decisions over the last 40 years: Canadian Dredge in 1985, in the context of corporate criminal liability for wrongdoing by directing minds; Livent in 2017, in the context of an auditors civil liability to a companys creditors for failing to detect fraud by the companys directing minds; and DeJong in 2019, in the context of a civil claim for knowing assistance and knowing receipt in relation to a breach of fiduciary duty.\nThis Courts jurisprudence, like the jurisprudence in the United Kingdom, highlights that there is no uniform rule of corporate attribution. Because the attribution doctrine is rooted in public policy, courts must take a purposive, contextual, and pragmatic approach to questions of attribution consistent with the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought.\nCanadian Dredge (1985)\nIn Canadian Dredge, this Court applied the corporate attribution doctrine in the criminal context. Four corporations were found criminally liable for the mens rea offence of bid-rigging under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. Each corporation had a manager or directing mind who conducted the corporations business. The corporations denied criminal liability because the managers had acted in fraud of the corporations, for their own benefit, and outside the scope of their employment. Justice Estey rejected these arguments. He found the corporations guilty because the directing minds had not acted wholly for their own benefit and the corporations had received some benefits. He formulated a common law rule for corporate attribution (at pp. 681-82 and 712-13), which this Court later distilled in Livent, at para. 100:\nTo attribute the fraudulent acts of an employee to its corporate employer, two conditions must be met: (1) the wrongdoer must be the directing mind of the corporation; and (2) the wrongful actions of the directing mind must have been done within the scope of his or her authority; that is, his or her actions must be performed within the sector of corporate operation assigned to him. For the purposes of this analysis, an individual will cease to be a directing mind unless the action (1) was not totally in fraud of the corporation; and (2) was by design or result partly for the benefit of the corporation. [Citation omitted.]\nJustice Estey highlighted that the corporate attribution doctrine was developed in order to find some pragmatic, acceptable middle ground which would see a corporation under the umbrella of the criminal law of the community but which would not saddle the corporation with the criminal wrongs of all of its employees and agents (Canadian Dredge, at p. 701). He rejected a test for criminal liability based on total vicarious liability for the conduct of any corporate agents, whatever their level of employment and responsibility, because this would impose criminal liability when there is neither moral turpitude nor negligence (p. 691). This, in turn, would not serve the public policy goal of protecting the interests of the community and advancing law and order (pp. 691 and 707-8). Justice Estey also rejected a test for criminal liability that would find a corporation liable only when it commits a criminal act on the express instructions of its board of directors, because this would allow corporations to absolve themselves from criminal consequences by the simple device of adopting and communicating to its staff a general instruction prohibiting illegal conduct and directing conformity at all times with the law (p. 699).\nTo respond to these policy concerns, Estey J. formulated the fraud and no benefit exceptions as public policy-based exceptions to the general principle that a directing minds knowledge should be attributed to a corporation to establish corporate criminal liability. The exceptions were justified, Estey J. stated, because in both situations no social purpose is served by convicting a corporation (Canadian Dredge, at p. 704; see also pp. 707-8). Imposing criminal liability would be unjust if the corporation is totally defrauded by, or does not benefit from, the wrongdoing of its directing mind. As Estey J. explained:\nThe identification theory . . . loses its basis in rationality when it is applied to condemn a corporation under the criminal law for the conduct of its manager when that manager is acting not in any real sense as its directing mind but rather as its arch enemy. . . . In my view, the very pragmatic origins of the identification rule militate against its extension to the situation which would have existed here had one or more of the directing minds acted entirely for his own benefit and directed his principal efforts to defrauding the company. Where the corporation benefited or was intended to be benefited from the fraudulent and criminal activities of the directing mind, the rationale of the identification rule holds. Where the delegate of the corporation has turned against his principal, the rationale fades away. [Emphasis in original; p. 719.]\nLivent (2017)\nIn Livent, this Court adapted the principles enunciated in Canadian Dredge to the civil context. An auditor had invoked the corporate attribution doctrine to defend against a claim brought by a corporations receiver for the auditors negligence in failing to uncover fraud by the corporations directing minds. The auditor argued that the fraud of the directing minds should be attributed to the corporation to give the auditor a defence of illegality to avoid civil liability to the corporation.\nWriting for the majority of the Court, Gascon and Brown JJ. noted that although the criteria in Canadian Dredge seemed [a]t first glance to be satisfied because the fraud was intended to benefit the corporation by giving it an artificial extension of its life (para. 101), they declined to attribute the directing minds wrongdoing to the corporation. They highlighted that the Canadian Dredge test was not . . . a standalone principle, but rather a means by which acts may be attributed to a corporation for the particular purpose or defence at issue (para. 97 (emphasis added)). They emphasized that corporate identification must be analyzed independently for each defence (para. 97). Continuing the purposive, contextual, and pragmatic approach developed in Canadian Dredge, Gascon and Brown JJ. noted that the public policy and judicial necessity principles that justify attributing the actions of the directing mind to the corporation in the criminal context do not apply in the context of an auditors negligent preparation of a statutory audit:\n. . . the very purpose of a statutory audit is to provide a means by which fraud and wrongdoing may be discovered. It follows that denying liability on the basis that an individual within the corporation has engaged in the very action that the auditor was enlisted to protect against would render the statutory audit meaningless . . . . [I]t would be perverse to deny auditors liability for negligently failing to detect fraud where the harm [to the corporation] is likely to occur and likely to be most serious . . . . [Citations omitted; para. 103.]\nThis Court in Livent added an important qualification to the authoritative test for corporate attribution set out in Canadian Dredge (para. 104). The Court recognized a judicial discretion not to attribute a directing minds actions or intent to a corporation when, in the circumstances of the case, declining attribution would be in the public interest (para. 104). The discretion reflects the rationale of the fraud and no benefit exceptions, that attribution should promote the policy of the law under which attribution is sought. Justices Gascon and Brown stated that when attribution would render meaningless the very purpose for which a duty of care was recognized, such application [of the corporate attribution doctrine] will rarely be in the public interest (para. 104).\nDeJong (2019)\nDeJong involved a large and complex multimillion-dollar real estate fraud involving two groups of companies that were victims of the fraud. The first group of companies sued the second group, claiming that the latter had knowingly assisted the fraudsters to commit the fraud and seeking to attribute the fraudsters conduct to them. A majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario accepted the argument for attribution, reasoning that the corporate attribution doctrine may be approached in a less demanding fashion in the civil context than in the criminal context of a mens rea offence (DBDC Spadina Ltd. v. Walton, 2018 ONCA 60, 78 B.L.R. (5th) 183, at para. 70). In dissent, van Rensburg J.A. would have declined to relax the approach to corporate attribution, saying that she saw no justification in the circumstances of this case to lessen the requirement for knowledge before one victim of a fraud is tagged with the conduct of a fraudster (para. 237). \nSpeaking for this Court, Brown J. allowed the appeal in brief oral reasons that adopted the dissenting reasons of van Rensburg J.A. Justice Brown observed that while the presence of public interest concerns may heighten the burden on the party seeking to have the actions of a directing mind attributed to a corporation, Canadian Dredge states minimal criteria that must always be met (DeJong, at para. 2 (emphasis in original)).\nThe appellants interpret Brown J.s statement that Canadian Dredge states minimal criteria that must always be met as effectively endorsing a mechanical rather than a purposive, contextual, and pragmatic application of the corporate attribution doctrine. They submit that a court cannot attribute the intent or acts of a fraudulent directing mind to a corporation when either the fraud or no benefit exception applies, regardless of the legal context. \nI would clarify the seemingly inflexible statement in this Courts brief oral reasons in DeJong. I respectfully disagree with any suggestion that the criteria in Canadian Dredge should be applied mechanically in every case, even if they would be inconsistent with the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought. The Courts principal concern in DeJong was to reject the suggestion that courts have an unfettered judicial discretion to relax the approach to corporate attribution based on the factual circumstances of a case. In my view, DeJong should not be read as departing from the longstanding purposive, contextual, and pragmatic approach to corporate attribution recognized in Canadian Dredge and Livent.\nGuidance From United Kingdom Jurisprudence\nIn recent years, courts in the United Kingdom have similarly applied the corporate attribution doctrine in a purposive, contextual, and pragmatic manner. \nThe modern history of the corporate attribution doctrine in the United Kingdom must begin with Meridian. There, Lord Hoffman explained on behalf of the Privy Council that rules of corporate attribution must be tailored for the particular substantive rule under which attribution is sought (p. 507). Lord Hoffman wrote:\nThis is always a matter of interpretation: given that it was intended to apply to a company, how was it intended to apply? Whose act (or knowledge, or state of mind) was for this purpose intended to count as the act etc. of the company? One finds the answer to this question by applying the usual canons of interpretation, taking into account the language of the rule (if it is a statute) and its content and policy. [Emphasis in original; p. 507.]\nLord Hoffman added that [o]nce it is appreciated that the question is one of construction rather than metaphysics (p. 511), questions of corporate attribution become straightforward. The courts must always apply an attribution rule for a particular purpose, tailored as it always must be to the terms and policies of the substantive rule under which attribution is sought (p. 512). \nLord Hoffman applied these principles in Meridian to conclude that a publicly traded corporation breached disclosure obligations under New Zealand securities legislation. He attributed to the corporation the knowledge of a lower level executive who had been responsible for obtaining a substantial interest in publicly traded securities on the corporations behalf. Otherwise, Lord Hoffman said, the policy of the Act would be defeated:\nCompanies would be able to allow employees to acquire interests on their behalf which made them substantial security holders but would not have to report them until the board or someone else in senior management got to know about it. This would put a premium on the board paying as little attention as possible to what its investment managers were doing. [p. 511]\nProfessor Jennifer Payne highlights two important lessons from Meridian. The first lesson is that the special rules of attribution under the common law doctrine do not mean that a company itself has done something or had a particular state of mind (Corporate Attribution and the Lessons of Meridian, in P. S. Davies and J. Pila, The Jurisprudence of Lord Hoffman: A Festschrift in Honour of Lord Leonard Hoffman (2015), 357, at p. 375). She observes that Meridian helpfully moved away from the anthropomorphic metaphysical approach to company attribution towards a more context-driven approach (p. 363). The second and related lesson is that the issue of attribution depends on the context. It is always necessary to ask whether an act or state of mind of a particular individual should be attributed to the company for this particular purpose (p. 375 (emphasis in original)). Professor Eilis Ferran agrees that contextualization, rather than anthropomorphic inquiry into corporate personality, is the key to answering these questions of corporate attribution (p. 239).\nRecent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom have affirmed the approach in Meridian by applying the corporate attribution doctrine based on the context and purpose of the relevant law under which attribution is sought (see Bilta, at para. 9, per Lord Neuberger, at paras. 41-42, per Lord Mance, at para. 92, per Lord Sumption, and at para. 181, per Lords Toulson and Hodge). As Lady Hale stated succinctly in Singularis, the key to any question of attribution [is] always to be found in considerations of the context and the purpose for which the attribution [is] relevant (para. 30). \nThe Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has also highlighted that because the corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively and contextually, a company or the court can rely on attribution for one purpose, but disclaim attribution for another (Bilta, at para. 43, per Lord Mance). As a result, attribution may be inappropriate in a claim by a corporation against its directors for breach of their duties to the corporation, but may be appropriate when determining the corporations liability to a third party or for breach of a statutory provision (see Bilta, at para. 7, per Lord Neuberger, at para. 43, per Lord Mance, at paras. 67 and 92, per Lord Sumption, and at paras. 208-9, per Lords Toulson and Hodge; Payne, at p. 376).\nSummary\nThe guiding principles for the common law doctrine of corporate attribution under Canadian law can be summarized as follows:\nAs a general rule, a persons fraudulent acts may be attributed to a corporation if two conditions are met: (1) the wrongdoer was the directing mind of the corporation at the relevant times; and (2) the wrongful actions of the directing mind were performed within the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to them (Canadian Dredge, at pp. 681-82; Livent, at para. 100). \nAttribution will generally be inappropriate when: (1) the directing mind acted totally in fraud of the corporation (the fraud exception); or (2) the directing minds actions were not by design or result partly for the benefit of the corporation (the no benefit exception) (Canadian Dredge, at pp. 712-13; Livent, at para. 100).\nIn addition to the fraud and no benefit exceptions, courts have discretion to refrain from attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation when this would be in the public interest, in the sense that it would promote the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought (Livent, at para. 104; DeJong, at para. 2). \nIn all cases, courts must apply the common law corporate attribution doctrine purposively, contextually, and pragmatically. The corporate attribution doctrine is not a standalone principle (Livent, at para. 97); there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The court must always determine whether the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of a person should be treated as those of the corporation for the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought (Livent, at paras. 102-3). This may require the court to tailor the general rule of attribution or its exceptions to the particular legal context. Attribution may be appropriate for one purpose in one context but may be inappropriate for another purpose in another context.\nWith these guiding principles in mind, I now consider how the corporate attribution doctrine should be applied to transfers at undervalue under s. 96 of the BIA.\nApplying the Corporate Attribution Doctrine in the Context of Section 96 of the BIA\nThe respondents urge this Court to apply the corporate attribution doctrine in the context of s. 96 of the BIA purposively, contextually, and pragmatically, consistent with this Courts precedents and the persuasive authority from the United Kingdom. They argue that the fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution should not apply in the context of a claim under s. 96 of the BIA for a transfer at undervalue because applying either exception would flout the purpose of s. 96. \nI agree. Recall that s. 96 of the BIA is a tool to remedy asset stripping by a debtor by clawing back assets that were improperly transferred to others before bankruptcy in order to protect the pool of assets available for creditors. The issue is whether and when attributing the actions or intent of the corporations directing mind to a corporate debtor would promote the purpose of this provision.\nThe remedial purpose of s. 96 of the BIA is served by attributing the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind to the corporation, even if the directing mind acted in fraud of the corporation, and even if the corporation did not benefit from the actions of the directing mind. Professor Roderick J. Wood has explained that the reason for this conclusion relates to the highly distinctive nature of the rights at stake (Ernst & Young Inc. v. Aquino: Attributing Fraudulent Intent to a Defrauded Corporation (2022), 66 Can. Bus. L.J. 250, at p. 259). As he notes, [t]he underlying goal [of s. 96] is not to punish or deter the debtor or to award damages against the debtor, but rather to protect the interests of creditors (p. 259). The social purpose of the legislation . . . is served whether or not the directing mind is acting in fraud of the corporation (p. 259).\nOn the other hand, applying the fraud and no benefit exceptions under s. 96 would deny third-party creditors the benefit of a statutory remedy intended to protect them from asset stripping and would diminish the pool of assets available for their claims. This would undermine the purpose of s. 96.\nAs in Livent, where this Court said that denying liability on the basis that an individual within the corporation has engaged in the very action that the auditor was enlisted to protect against would render the statutory audit meaningless (para. 103), applying the fraud and no benefit exceptions mechanically under s. 96 of the BIA would render the transfer at undervalue remedy meaningless. The purpose of this statutory remedy is to protect creditors from the debtor transferring assets to others for little to no benefit. Applying the exceptions would undermine this purpose. It would result in denying liability on the basis that the corporations directing mind engaged in the very action that the provision targets. Such an approach would be perverse.\nConsequently, the test for corporate attribution under s. 96 of the BIA is simply whether the person was the directing mind and whether their actions were performed within the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to them. If these criteria are met, the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or intent of the directing mind should be attributed to the corporation, regardless of whether the fraud and no benefit exceptions are engaged (see Wood (2022), at pp. 260-61). \nIt follows that I do not accept the appellants submission that the principles of statutory interpretation require courts to apply the fraud and no benefit exceptions in this context. The appellants argue that because s. 96 of the BIA does not clearly and unambiguously derogate from the common law of corporate attribution, the rules in Canadian Dredge, Livent, and DeJong must be applied without modification, including the fraud and no benefit exceptions. The appellants submission presupposes that the common law rules of corporate attribution should be applied regardless of the context or purpose of the law under which attribution is sought, unless the legislature expressly derogates from those rules. But that is a false premise. The corporate attribution doctrine must always be applied having regard to the context and the purpose of the law under which attribution is sought. This approach has been integral to the Canadian common law of corporate attribution since Canadian Dredge.\nI therefore agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that attributing Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con would advance the public policy underlying s. 96 of the BIA. Attribution would allow creditors to recover fraudulently transferred assets that unlawfully reduced the value of the estate available for distribution to creditors. I respectfully disagree, however, with two aspects of the Court of Appeals reasoning on this issue.\nFirst, the Court of Appeal stated that attributing the directing minds knowledge or intent to the company itself can hardly be said to unjustly prejudice the company in the bankruptcy context, when the company is no longer anything more than a bundle of assets to be liquidated with the proceeds distributed to creditors (para. 77). The court added that [a]n approach that would favour the interests of fraudsters over those of creditors seems counterintuitive and should not be quickly adopted (para. 77). \nWith respect, however, the Court of Appeals rationale for attribution does not apply to transfers at undervalue in the restructuring context under the CCAA. As the appellants correctly explain, [i]n a CCAA monitorship, unlike a traditional bankruptcy, the possibility remains for the debtor company to be rehabilitated and to resume its normal operations at some future date (A.F., at para. 47). As a result, in the restructuring context, it cannot be said that the company is no longer anything more than a bundle of assets to be liquidated with the proceeds distributed to creditors (para. 47).\nSecond, the Court of Appeal reframed the test for corporate attribution in the bankruptcy context by stating that [t]he underlying question here is who should bear responsibility for the fraudulent acts of a companys directing mind that are done within the scope of his or her authority  the fraudsters or the creditors? (para. 78). Not surprisingly, the court answered this question in favour of the creditors and attributed Mr. Aquinos fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con. The court said that [p]ermitting the fraudsters to get a benefit at the expense of creditors would be perverse (para. 79).\nThe Court of Appeals framing of the question poses a contest between fraudsters and creditors. But as Professor Wood notes, this question is misconceived because transfers at undervalue can involve not just fraudsters, but also innocent recipients (Wood (2022), at p. 257). As he explains, the Court of Appeals question misdirects the focus of analysis because in such cases the contest is between the corporations creditors and the recipients of the transfer, who might be just as innocent (p. 257). Professor Wood gives the helpful example of the sale of a house at undervalue to an innocent purchaser, who would be prejudiced if the sale were to be successfully challenged under s. 96 of the BIA:\nConsider the case where a house is sold to an innocent buyer in an arms length dealing for a price that is conspicuously less than its market value. If the debtor intended to defeat creditors and was insolvent at the time of the transfer, the trustee will be able to set aside the sale or require the buyer to pay the difference in value under section 96(1)(a) of the BIA. This holds true even though the buyer may have incurred considerable expense in moving into the house and may also not have the funds to pay the difference in value. Despite searching in the land registration system and finding nothing, the innocent buyer is placed in a precarious position. If fraud is involved it lies with the seller, but the buyer is the party who stands to lose to the sellers creditors. This is not a contest between fraudsters and creditors so an allocation of responsibility on the basis suggested by the [c]ourt is misconceived. [Emphasis added; footnote omitted; p. 257.]\nAs a result, I agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that the fraud and no benefit exceptions to corporate attribution do not apply under s. 96 of the BIA, but I respectfully disagree with some of the courts reasoning. \nIn sum, the fraud and no benefit exceptions are inappropriate and inapplicable in the context of transfers at undervalue under s. 96 because these exceptions would undermine the creditor protection purpose of this provision.\nApplication to This Case\nMr. Aquino, as the directing mind of Bondfield and Forma-Con, intended to defraud, defeat, or delay creditors of Bondfield and Forma-Con through the false invoicing scheme. In conducting the false invoicing scheme, he acted in his assigned sector of corporate responsibility of engaging with suppliers and overseeing the provision of services and materials. His intent should therefore be attributed or imputed to Bondfield and Forma-Con under s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA.\nConsequently, I would affirm the application judges order regarding the appellants liability for the transfers at undervalue.\nDisposition\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Law Office of Terry Corsianos, Richmond Hill, Ont.; Corsianos Lee, Vaughan, Ont.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent Ernst & Young Inc., in its capacity as court-appointed monitor of Bondfield Construction Company Limited: Cassels Brock & Blackwell, Toronto; Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent KSV Kofman Inc., in its capacity as Trustee in Bankruptcy of 1033803 Ontario Inc. and 1087507 Ontario Limited: Torys, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General  Crown Law Office  Civil, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Insolvency Institute of Canada: Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg, Toronto.

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court Upholds Corporate Attribution in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law\n\nThis appeal raises the central question of whether the directing mind's fraudulent intent can be attributed to a corporate debtor under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA).\n\nBondfield Construction Company Limited (Bondfield) and 1033803 Ontario Inc. (Forma-Con) were two family-owned construction companies experiencing financial difficulties. The companies' president, John Aquino, and other individuals engaged in a false invoicing scheme, fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from the companies. The scheme involved creating false invoices from suppliers for services that were never provided, which were then paid by the companies at the direction of Mr. Aquino or other accomplices. The monitor and trustee in bankruptcy discovered the scheme during their investigations and challenged the transactions as transfers at undervalue under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA.\n\nThe application judge held that the false invoice payments were transfers at undervalue and could be recovered by the monitor and trustee in bankruptcy under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA. The judge also attributed Mr. Aquino's fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con using the corporate attribution doctrine. The Court of Appeal for Ontario affirmed this decision, rejecting arguments that Mr. Aquino did not intend to defraud or delay creditors because the companies were financially stable when the transactions occurred. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal with costs, upholding both lower courts' decisions.\n\nThe corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and pragmatically in bankruptcy and insolvency law; attributing actions or intent serves policy goals when it protects creditors' interests.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Jamal held that the application judge did not misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent and that the directing mind's fraudulent intent should be attributed to the corporate debtor under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the BIA. The majority opinion emphasized that a court may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under section 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) even if the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. Furthermore, Jamal J. reasoned that attributing Mr. Aquino's fraudulent intent to Bondfield and Forma-Con would advance the public policy underlying section 96 of the BIA by allowing creditors to recover fraudulently transferred assets.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  concludes that the fraudulent intent of the president of two construction  companies can be attributed to the companies in bankruptcy proceedings.</strong>This  appeal addressed when a court can attribute the intent of a senior officer or  employee, known as a \u201cdirecting mind\u201d, to the corporation. John  Aquino was the president of two family-owned construction companies that worked  on large-sale construction projects. When the companies began experiencing  serious financial difficulties, investigations revealed that Mr. Aquino and  several others had been fraudulently taking tens of millions of dollars from  the companies through a false invoicing scheme. For years, they created fake  invoices from fake suppliers for services that were never provided, and then  directed the construction companies to pay the invoices. In bankruptcy  proceedings against the companies, these payments were challenged under s.  96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>Bankruptcy and  Insolvency Act</em> (\u201c<em>BIA</em>\u201d). This  provision allows for the recovery of money if a transaction is a \u201ctransfer at  undervalue\u201d and the debtor intended to \u201cdefraud, defeat or delay a creditor\u201d. A  transfer at undervalue is a transaction where property or services are provided  to another person for nothing in exchange or for much less than fair market  value. The  application judge concluded that the false invoice payments were transfers at  undervalue. She found that the payments involved several \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d,  which are suspicious circumstances that may help prove fraudulent intent. She  rejected the argument that the construction companies could not have had fraudulent  intent because they were paying their creditors in full and on time at the time  of the payments. She considered the purpose of bankruptcy legislation, which is  to provide a remedy to creditors, and concluded that Mr. Aquino\u2019s intent should  be attributed to the companies. She ordered Mr. Aquino and others to pay the  money they received under the scheme. Mr. Aquino and the others involved in the  scheme appealed the application judge\u2019s ruling. Both before the Court of Appeal  and the Supreme Court, they repeated the arguments made before the application  judge. The Court of Appeal upheld the application judge\u2019s ruling. <strong>The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal.</strong>Writing  for the Court, Justice Jamal concluded that the application judge did not  misapply the badges of fraud approach to inferring fraudulent intent. A court  may find that a debtor intended to defraud, defeat, or delay a creditor under  s. 96(1)(b)(ii)(B) of the <em>BIA </em>even if  the debtor was not insolvent at the time of the transfer at undervalue. There  is therefore no basis to interfere with the application judge\u2019s conclusion that  Mr. Aquino intended to defraud, defeat or delay a creditor under the false  invoicing scheme. Furthermore, Mr. Aquino\u2019s fraudulent intent should be  attributed to the debtor companies because he was their directing mind and  acted in the sector of corporate responsibility assigned to him. The  corporate attribution doctrine must be applied purposively, contextually, and  pragmatically to give effect to the policy goals of the law under which a party  seeks to attribute to a corporation the actions, knowledge, state of mind, or  intent of its directing mind. In the context of a claim under s. 96 of the <em>BIA</em>, the \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cno benefit\u201d exceptions  to corporate attribution should not apply because these exceptions would  undermine the purpose of this provision. The test for corporate attribution  under s. 96 is simply whether the person was the directing mind and whether  their actions were performed within the sector or corporate responsibility  assigned to them."

The Agency thereafter adopted the Air Passenger Protection Regulations (Regulations), which came into force in 2019. The Regulations include provisions dealing with standardized amounts of compensation for international flight delays, cancellations and denial of boarding when the disruption occurs for reasons within a carriers control and is not required for safety purposes (ss. 12(2)(d), (3)(d) and (4)(d), 19 and 20), and refunds of baggage fees paid by passengers when the carrier has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights (s. 23).\n\tIn a statutory appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, the International Air Transport Association, the Air Transportation Association of America, and several air carriers serving Canadian and international airports (collectively, airlines) challenged those provisions. The airlines alleged that the Regulations conflict with the exclusivity principle of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air (Montreal Convention) and are ultra vires the Agencys regulation-making authority under the CTA. Canada signed the Montreal Convention in 2001, and it was implemented into Canadian law by amendments to the Carriage by Air Act (CAA). Article 29 of the Montreal Convention codifies its exclusivity, by stating that any action for damages is subject to the conditions and limits of liability that it sets out. \n\tThe Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the challenge brought by the airlines, with the exception of the provisions relating to the temporary loss of baggage. The court considered the compatibility of the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, and held that the compensation provided for under the Regulations is not an action for damages, and that cancellation, denial of boarding, and delay are factual and legal concepts that do not fall within the scope of the exclusivity principle. The court also addressed the admissibility of expert affidavits on questions of international law.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tThe Montreal Convention is exclusive within the scope of the matters that it addresses, but does not deal comprehensively with all aspects of international carriage by air. Pursuant to the text of its Article 29, there must be an action that leads to damages for the exclusivity principle to apply. The Regulations do not provide for an action for damages because they do not provide for individualized compensation; rather, they create a consumer protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without trenching on its liability limitation provisions. Accordingly, they do not fall within the scope of the Montreal Conventions exclusivity principle. Since the Regulations do not give rise to liability that is pre-empted by Article 29, they do not conflict with the Montreal Convention as implemented by the CAA and there is no basis to conclude that they exceed the jurisdiction of the Agency, as conferred by the CTA.\n\tThe Vienna Convention is the starting point for determining the scope of the Montreal Convention and the exclusivity principle. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention directs that the Montreal Convention, like all treaties, should be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose. Therefore, the analysis begins with the words chosen by the state parties to the Montreal Convention. Article 29, in explaining the exclusivity principle, states that it applies to any action for damages, however founded. The ordinary meaning of an action for damages points towards an action that shares the characteristics of a judicial proceeding and that seeks individualized compensation that is tied to an injury caused by another. Damages awards are individualized in that they seek to compensate the plaintiff for the loss suffered as a result of an injury caused by another. An action for damages is distinct from standardized compensation, which may be owed identically to all claimants irrespective of the harm (if any) they have suffered. The broader context of the Montreal Convention supports an understanding of the words action and damages consonant with their ordinary meaning in Canadian law: the relevant articles of the Montreal Convention are framed in a way that plainly envisages actions which share the characteristics of judicial proceedings in a court of law. The object and purpose of the Montreal Convention, including the history of its development, support this conclusion, as does foreign jurisprudence and state practice. Article 29 should therefore be understood as precluding actions for damages that share the characteristics of judicial proceedings in courts of law, and that seek individualized compensation for death or bodily injury, damage or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay in international carriage.\n\tThe Regulations are best understood as providing for statutory entitlements under a consumer protection scheme. Passengers claiming under the Regulations need not show what harm, if any, they have suffered in order to claim compensation. The Regulations do not tie compensation to harm or inconvenience: they mandate compensation for delay, cancellation or denial of boarding based on the time by which a passengers arrival at their ultimate destination is delayed, and compensation owed for lost or damaged baggage is tied to the baggage fees charged by the carrier, not to the harm. Unlike the Montreal Convention, the Regulations do not enable a carrier to avoid having to pay compensation otherwise due to a passenger by invoking a due diligence defence or pointing to contributory negligence. As long as the disruption in question occurred for a reason within the carriers control and was not required for safety purposes, the compensation is fixed. Moreover, the Agency is empowered to extend a finding that compensation is owed to one passenger to other passengers similarly situated.\n\tTo find a conflict between the Montreal Convention and the impugned Regulations, the latter must be so inconsistent with the former that they are incapable of standing together. As the Montreal Convention has been implemented in Canadian law, the established test for statutory conflicts applies and there is no need to have regard to the presumption that Parliament legislates in conformity with international law. Because the Regulations do not provide for an action for damages, but instead create an entitlement to standardized compensation that does not seek to measure a passengers actual loss, they fall outside the scope of Article 29 and do not conflict with the Montreal Convention. The two forms of passenger compensation envisaged by the Regulations and the Montreal Convention are capable of standing together. The bargain at the centre of the Montreal Convention remains undisturbed: passengers continue to enjoy certain evidentiary presumptions on proof of damage, while carriers remain shielded from unlimited liability arising from actions for damages related to claims for death or bodily injury, damage or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay. In signing on to the Montreal Convention, there is no indication that Canada or any other state party agreed to forego its ability to provide for minimum standards of treatment for passengers within its jurisdiction.\n\tFinally, clarification is needed as to the treatment of expert evidence on questions of international law. The test from R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, should be applied in the context of international law as it is in other circumstances where expert evidence is sought to be admitted. The appropriate framework is the following: where expert evidence satisfies Mohans criteria, it may be considered. Otherwise, judges should proceed as they would for any other question of law  that is, on the basis of the submissions of the parties before the court and authorities on which they rely. In applying Mohan, the admissibility of expert evidence is within the courts discretion so long as the threshold requirements of admissibility are satisfied. Given the variety of contexts in which expert evidence is sought to be adduced on questions of international law, the admissibility of such evidence is best left as a matter of judicial discretion rather than being subject to a fixed and invariable rule.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: R. v.

In light of this purported conflict, and because the Montreal Convention has been implemented by way of the Carriage by Air Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-26 (CAA), the appellants assert that the Regulations are ultra vires the regulation-making authority given to the Canadian Transportation Agency (Agency) by the Canada Transportation Act, S.C. 1996, c. 10 (CTA). I will hereafter refer to the issue of whether the Regulations are within the jurisdiction of the Agency, as conferred by the CTA, as the Regulations being ultra vires the CTA or intra vires the CTA.\nThe parties also disagree concerning the admissibility of expert affidavits on questions of international law; such affidavits were introduced in the proceedings below regarding state practice. The law relating to the admissibility of expert evidence, as I explain below, has been settled since this Courts decision in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9.\nThis Court examined the scope of the exclusivity principle under the Montreal Convention in Thibodeau v. Air Canada, 2014 SCC 67, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 340 (Thibodeau), and in that case affirmed that the Montreal Convention is exclusive within the scope of the matters that it addresses, but that the Montreal Convention does not deal comprehensively with all aspects of international carriage by air (para. 47). The same conclusion guides the result in this case. The exclusivity principle in Article 29 of the Montreal Convention applies to any action for damages. However, the Regulations do not provide for an action for damages because they do not provide for individualized compensation. The entitlements provided for are not tied to harm suffered by the claimant as a result of injury caused by another. Rather, the Regulations create statutory entitlements as part of a consumer protection scheme that operates irrespective of the harm (if any) suffered by the claimant. Thus, the Regulations do not give rise to liability that is pre-empted by Article 29 and so do not conflict with the Montreal Convention as implemented by the CAA. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\nFacts\nThe Parties\nThe appellant International Air Transport Association (IATA) is a trade association whose members include 290 airlines from 120 countries, which carry approximately 82 percent of the worlds air traffic. The appellant Air Transportation Association of America (doing business as Airlines for America) is a trade association which brings together passenger and cargo airlines based in the United States. The remaining 16 appellants are air carriers serving Canadian and international airports. \nThe respondent Agency is a quasi-judicial tribunal and an economic regulator with a mandate to deal with transportation matters under Parliaments legislative authority, including aviation. The Agency performs two functions. First, it applies rules that establish rights and responsibilities of transportation service providers and users and that level the playing field among competitors. As part of its regulatory function, the Agency makes determinations as to the issuance of licences and permits. It is empowered to enforce, through administrative monetary penalties, the CTA and regulations made thereunder. Second, it adjudicates commercial and consumer transportation-related disputes and accessibility issues.\nThis Court in Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. VIA Rail Canada Inc., 2007 SCC 15, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 650, described the CTA as highly specialized regulatory legislation with a strong policy focus (para. 98) and the Agency as responsible for interpreting its own legislation, including what that statutory responsibility includes (para. 100). \nThe Montreal Convention Under Canadian Law\nAs this Court explained in Thibodeau (at para. 47), the Montreal Convention, like its predecessor, the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, 137 L.N.T.S. 11 (Warsaw Convention), was designed to achieve a number of objectives, including but not limited to the following:\n. . . achieve a uniform set of rules governing damages liability of international air carriers and to provide limitation of carrier liability. These purposes can only be achieved by the Montreal Convention if it provides the exclusive set of rules in relation to the matters that it covers. The Montreal Convention of course does not deal with all aspects of international carriage by air: it is not comprehensive. But within the scope of the matters which it does address, it is exclusive in that it bars resort to other bases for liability in those areas: M. Clarke, Contracts of Carriage by Air (2nd ed. 2010), at pp. 8 and 160-62; G. N. Tompkins, Jr., The Continuing Development of Montreal Convention 1999 Jurisprudence (2010), 35 Air & Space L. 433, at pp. 433-36.\nI return to the purpose of the Montreal Convention and the role of the exclusivity principle referenced in Thibodeau later in these reasons. For now, it suffices to note that this Court has recognized three central objectives of the Montreal Convention: first, it limits carrier liability related to claims for damages for death or bodily injury, damage to or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay; second, it protects the interests of passengers and shippers by creating presumptive liability for carriers with respect to those claims; and third, it seeks to create uniform rules governing claims arising from international air transportation (paras. 41-42 and 44-46).\nCanada signed the Montreal Convention on October 1, 2001, and deposited its instrument of ratification on November 19, 2002. The Montreal Convention was implemented into Canadian law by amendments to the CAA (An Act to amend the Carriage by Air Act, S.C. 2001, c. 31); these incorporated the Montreal Convention in its entirety by reference (CAA, Sch. VI; Library of Parliament, Canadas Approach to the Treaty-Making Process, Hill Studies 2008-45-E, April 1, 2021, at pp. 2-5).\nThe Development and Content of the Regulations\nIn 2014, the Minister of Transport (Minister) launched a review of the CTA. Following this review, Parliament enacted the Transportation Modernization Act, S.C. 2018, c. 10, in 2018; this amended the CTA to add s. 86.11, which stated that [t]he Agency shall, after consulting with the Minister, make regulations in relation to flights to, from and within Canada, including connecting flights with respect to a number of areas, notably including carriers obligations in case of flight delay, flight cancellation or denial of boarding, and lost and damaged baggage. The Agency published draft regulations thereafter; these came into force in 2019. \nAs mandated by the addition of s. 86.11 to the CTA, the Regulations establish minimum air carrier obligations towards passengers when flights are delayed, cancelled, when a passenger is denied boarding, or when baggage is lost or damaged. This appeal concerns the provisions of the Regulations dealing with:\nstandardized amounts of compensation for international flight delays, cancellations and denial of boarding when the disruption occurs for reasons within a carriers control and is not required for safety purposes (ss. 12(2)(d), (3)(d) and (4)(d), 19 and 20); and \nrefunds of baggage fees paid by passengers when the carrier has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights (s. 23).\nThe Regulations also establish air carrier obligations to passengers with respect to other topics not at issue in this appeal including: tarmac delays, seating assignment of children, and the transportation of musical instruments.\nFederal Court of Appeal, 2022 FCA 211 (de Montigny J.A., Pelletier and Locke JJ.A. Concurring)\nThe appellants brought their challenge to the Regulations in a statutory appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, which hears appeals from decisions of the Canadian Transportation Agency on questions of law or jurisdiction, per s. 41 of the CTA.\nPreliminary motions addressed the admissibility of expert evidence. First, the Attorney General of Canada sought leave to present expert evidence on the state practice with respect to air passenger rights under the Montreal Convention. Justice Rennie granted the motion and both parties submitted affidavits by experts (No. A-311-19, January 27, 2020, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 139). \nSecond, the Attorney General moved to strike the appellants expert affidavits, to the extent that they purported to opine on the interpretation of the Montreal Convention and the compatibility of foreign regimes with the Convention (R.F., at para. 18). In an interim order by Justice Mactavish, the motion was dismissed to allow the panel hearing the appeal on the merits to determine the admissibility of the evidence (2020 FCA 172).\nIn the merits hearing, Justice de Montigny (as he then was), for a unanimous court, dismissed the challenge brought by the airlines, with the exception of the provisions relating to the temporary loss of baggage. In arriving at this conclusion, he identified three principal issues: \nIs the minimum compensation to passengers required by the Regulations in the case of delay, cancellation, denial of boarding and lost or damaged baggage, when applied to international carriage by air, authorized by s. 86.11(1)(b)(i) of the CTA and compatible with the Montreal Convention?\nAre any of ss. 5 to 8, 10(3), 11(3) to (5), 12(2) to (4), 13 to 18, 23 or 24 of the Regulations ultra vires the CTA insofar as they apply to international service because of an impermissible extraterritorial application?\nIs the Direction Respecting Tarmac Delays of Three Hours or Less, SOR/2019-110, issued by the Minister in April 2019 intra vires of the authority of the Minister under s. 86.11(2) of the CTA?\nIn reaching that decision, Justice de Montigny agreed that portions of the expert affidavits adduced by the appellants should be struck.  \nTurning to the substance of the arguments advanced by the appellants, the court considered the compatibility of the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, and held that the compensation provided for under the Regulations is not an action for damages, and that cancellation, denial of boarding, and delay are factual and legal concepts that do not fall within the scope of the exclusivity principle. \nAlthough the Court of Appeal held that the baggage fee provisions of the Regulations did not contravene the Montreal Convention, it concluded that s. 23(2) of the Regulations was ultra vires the CTA under s. 86.11. It held that s. 86.11 did not provide authority to the Agency to make regulations with respect to the temporary loss of baggage. The Agency and Attorney General have not appealed this aspect of the ruling. \nThe Court of Appeal also rejected the appellants submission that the Regulations were ultra vires the CTA because they had impermissible extraterritorial application insofar as they apply to flights operating outside of Canada and connecting two foreign states. The appellants have not appealed this aspect of the ruling. \nIssues\nThe principal issue on appeal is whether the provisions of the Regulations that mandate minimum compensation to passengers on international flights in the case of delay, cancellation, denial of boarding and lost or damaged baggage are ultra vires the CTA. \nThe appellants submit that the Regulations are ultra vires because the impugned provisions run afoul of the exclusivity principle codified in Article 29 of the Montreal Convention, and incorporated in the CAA. They submit that the Federal Court of Appeal erred by circumventing the exclusivity principle in the Montreal Convention, and rely on this Courts decision in Thibodeau for the proposition that Articles 17 to 19 of the Montreal Convention exhaustively set out the types of air carrier liability that are available in international carriage. The appellants also seek to overturn the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal with respect to the admissibility of portions of the expert affidavits that they rely on to support their arguments with respect to state practice.\nThe Attorney General and the Agency respond that the Regulations are not ultra vires the CTA, because the Regulations do not provide for actions for damages; rather, they address matters outside the scope of the Montreal Convention, including circumstances relating to non-performance of the contract of carriage. They point to foreign jurisprudence, notably from the European Union and the United States, that has interpreted the exclusivity principle in a manner that does not prohibit standardized compensation under passenger protection schemes. They further submit that state practice confirms that the Regulations are compatible with the Montreal Convention as a majority of the state parties to the Montreal Convention have established passenger compensation schemes comparable to Canadas. \nThe Attorney General argues in the alternative that, even if the Regulations are inconsistent with the Montreal Convention, they are not ultra vires the CTA as s. 86.11 of the CTA overrides any conflicting provisions of the Montreal Convention. \nStandard of Review\nSection 41(1) of the CTA provides for a statutory appeal from the Agency to the Federal Court of Appeal, with leave of that court, on questions of law or a question of jurisdiction (Canadian National Railway Company v. Emerson Milling Inc., 2017 FCA 79, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 573, at paras. 7 and 11). A statutory right of appeal indicates Parliaments intention for appellate standards of review to apply. As the challenge to the Regulations is on a question of law, the correctness standard applies (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 8).\nThat said, findings of fact by the Court of Appeal, including those related to questions of foreign law, are reviewable on the standard of palpable and overriding error (Housen, at paras. 10, 19 and 26-37). \nAnalysis\nAs I will explain, the disposition of this appeal turns on the vires question, which I answer in the negative. Because the Regulations do not provide for an action for damages, they do not fall within the scope of the Montreal Conventions exclusivity principle. Instead, the Regulations are better understood as creating a consumer protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without trenching on its liability limitation provisions. Because the Regulations do not conflict with the Montreal Convention as implemented by the CAA, there is no basis to conclude that they are ultra vires the CTA. For that reason, it is not necessary to consider the alternative arguments by the Attorney General and the Agency regarding: first, whether denial of boarding and cancellation qualify as delays for the purposes of Article 19; and, second, whether Parliament has directed the Agency to regulate in a manner that is inconsistent with Canadas obligations under the Montreal Convention. \nMy analysis proceeds in three parts. \nFirst, I consider the scope of the Montreal Convention and the exclusivity principle. In this, I am guided by this Courts consideration of the Montreal Convention in Thibodeau. \nAs I explain below, while state practice is not dispositive in giving meaning to the Montreal Convention and resolving this appeal, it still plays a role under the approach to treaty interpretation set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Can. T.S. 1980 No. 37 (Vienna Convention). Thus, I also address the evidentiary issue raised by the appellants, and deal with the circumstances in which expert evidence concerning state practice, and international law more broadly, is and is not admissible. \nSecond, I consider the scope of the Regulations, and explain how they function as a consumer protection scheme that provides for statutory entitlements that are not contingent on showing harm to the claimants suffered as a result of an injury caused by another. \nThird, I examine what constitutes a legislative conflict and conclude that, because the Regulations fall outside the scope of Article 29, no conflict exists between the Regulations and the Montreal Convention (as implemented by the CAA). As a result, I conclude that the Regulations are not ultra vires the CTA.\nWhat Is the Scope of the Montreal Convention and the Exclusivity Principle? \nThe Montreal Convention applies to all international carriage of persons, baggage or cargo performed by aircraft for reward (Article 1). Article 17 deals with death and bodily injury that occurs between embarkation and disembarkation and destruction, loss, and damage to baggage while the baggage was on board the aircraft or in the charge of the carrier. Carriers are presumptively liable for damage sustained in relation to these sorts of incidents. Similarly, Article 18 provides that a carrier is presumptively liable for damage sustained in the event of the destruction or loss of, or damage to, cargo upon condition only that the event which caused the damage so sustained took place during the carriage by air. Article 19 states that a carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. A carrier can exonerate itself from presumptive liability under Article 19 if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures. Article 20 additionally enables carriers to obtain whole or partial exoneration from liability if the carrier is able to prove that the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the person claiming compensation. \nThe Montreal Convention also regulates the amount of compensation owed in relation to claims for death or bodily injury, damage or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay (Articles 21 and 22). Article 26 prevents a carrier from entering into a contract which relieves it of liability or fixes a lower limit for compensation than that set out in the Montreal Convention. Article 27 expressly permits carriers to contractually waive defences available under the Montreal Convention. Finally, Article 29 codifies the exclusivity principle which reads: \nIn the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo, any action for damages, however founded, whether under this Convention or in contract or in tort or otherwise, can only be brought subject to the conditions and such limits of liability as are set out in this Convention without prejudice to the question as to who are the persons who have the right to bring suit and what are their respective rights. In any such action, punitive, exemplary or any other non-compensatory damages shall not be recoverable.\nThis appeal requires the Court to resolve what falls within the scope of an action for damages. In so doing, I am guided by Thibodeaus instruction that the terms action and damages must be understood in a broad sense (para. 60) and cannot be modeled on national definitions of damages (para. 77). \nThibodeau Does Not Resolve the Question \nThe scope of the exclusivity principle codified at Article 29 was left open in Thibodeau. In that case, passengers on an international flight operated by Air Canada brought claims for damages pursuant to the Official Languages Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.), on the basis that Air Canada failed to provide services in both official languages as required by the Official Languages Act. The Federal Court awarded damages to compensate the Thibodeaus for breach of their language rights, which caused them a moral prejudice, pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of their vacation (Thibodeau v. Air Canada, 2011 FC 876, [2013] 2 F.C.R. 83, at para. 88). \nThis Courts reasons in Thibodeau focused on whether the Official Languages Act claims fall outside the type of actions covered by the Montreal Convention in light of the underlying source of the claim (paras. 73 and 75). The Court concluded that the claim was for individualized damages and came within the scope of the Montreal Conventions exclusivity principle. However, the Court expressly declined to consider the significance of the distinction between individualized damages and standardized damages when it comes to applying the exclusivity principle (para. 81). \nThis appeal, by contrast, requires the Court to address that which was left open by Thibodeau, namely whether the Montreal Convention precludes standardized compensation of the kind provided for by the Regulations. \nThe Ordinary Meaning of the Words Chosen by the State Parties When Read in Their Context \nThe Vienna Convention is the starting point for determining the scope of the Montreal Convention (see Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, at paras. 51-52; Thomson v. Thomson, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 551, at pp. 577-78). Article 31 of the Vienna Convention directs that the Montreal Convention, like all treaties, should be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Or, as this Court has put it, [t]he point of departure for interpreting a provision of a treaty is the plain meaning of the text (Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, at para. 16). The English text of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention refers to ordinary meaning and this Court in Febles referred to plain meaning, in the English version of its reasons. In French, both the text of the Vienna Convention and the Courts reasons in Febles use the expression sens ordinaire. I take these expressions to mean the same thing, that being that the analysis begins with the words chosen by the state parties to the Montreal Convention. \nArticle 29, in explaining the exclusivity principle, states that the Montreal Convention applies to any action for damages, however founded (Thibodeau, at para. 37 (emphasis in original)). The text of Article 29 thus discloses two criteria that guide the application of the exclusivity principle: there must be an action that leads to damages. The term action has a meaning well known to the law: Blacks Law Dictionary defines an action as any judicial proceeding, which, if conducted to a determination, will result in a judgment or decree ((11th ed. 2019), at p. 37). Similarly, Barrons Canadian Law Dictionary defines an action at law as [a] judicial proceeding whereby one party . . . prosecutes another for a wrong or injury done [or] for damage caused or [a] proceeding by which one party seeks in a court of justice to enforce some right ((7th ed. 2013), at p. 9). Recalling that the term action must be understood in a broad sense, I would add that it should be read in light of the growing prominence of non-judicial tribunals and quasi-judicial adjudicators in Canada and elsewhere (see Thibodeau, at para. 60). Thus, I do not foreclose the possibility that a proceeding that occurs outside a court of law may, if it shares the characteristics of a judicial proceeding, also fall within the ambit of an action for the purposes of Article 29. \nBlacks Law Dictionary defines damages as [m]oney claimed by, or ordered to be paid to, a person as compensation for loss or injury or as the sum of money which a person wronged is entitled to receive from the wrongdoer as compensation for the wrong (p. 488, citing F. Gahan, The Law of Damages (1936), at p. 1). Barrons defines damages as [m]onetary compensation the law awards to one who has suffered damage, loss, or injury by the wrong of another (p. 89). In the aviation context, tort actions provide for damages so as to compensate the plaintiff for his injury by giving the plaintiff the equivalent in money for the actual loss caused by the wrong of another and in so doing attempt to make the plaintiff whole (P. S. Dempsey, Aviation Liability Law (2nd ed. 2013), at p. 705, quoting Sullivan v. Old Colony St. Ry. Co., 83 N.E. 1091 (Mass. 1908), at p. 1092).  \nThe ordinary meaning of an action for damages thus points towards an action that shares the characteristics of a judicial proceeding and that seeks individualized compensation that is tied to an injury caused by another. Damages awards are individualized in that they seek to compensate the plaintiff for the loss suffered as a result of an injury caused by another. An action for damages is distinct from standardized compensation which, as I explain below, may be owed identically to all claimants irrespective of the harm (if any) they have suffered. However, Article 29 cannot be understood in isolation from the broader context of the Montreal Convention. \nArticle 19 focuses on liability for damage occasioned by delay, indicating a causal relationship between the carriers actions and the resulting loss or injury to a passenger for which compensation is sought. It also enables carriers to avoid liability by showing that they took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage, suggesting that the Montreal Convention envisages defences related to due diligence akin to those that can be invoked in a court of law. Article 20 similarly enables a carrier to avoid liability by showing contributory negligence by the person claiming compensation. \nArticle 22(6) addresses the compensation limits prescribed in Article 21 in a manner that assumes the existence of an action with the characteristics of a judicial proceeding, noting that the limit shall not prevent the court from awarding . . . the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of the litigation incurred by the plaintiff. Article 29 refers to individuals who have the right to bring suit. In framing the exclusivity principle, Article 29 also refers to claims in tort and contract, and the concept of punitive damages, underscoring the link between the limitation of liability and causes of action that can be pursued in courts of law. Article 33(1) states that [a]n action for damages must be brought . . . before the court of the domicile of the carrier . . . or before the court at the place of destination. Article 35(2), which addresses limitation periods, refers to the law of the court seised of the case. \nThe context in which Article 29 must be read thus supports an understanding of the words action and damages consonant with their ordinary meaning under Canadian law. The relevant articles are framed in a way that plainly envisages actions which share the characteristics of judicial proceedings in a court of law. These elements of the Montreal Convention take aim at individualized damages that a passenger must show were sustained or occasioned as a result of the conduct of a carrier, and the defences a carrier can invoke to exonerate itself. \nThe Object and Purpose of the Montreal Convention\nThe object and purpose of the Montreal Convention, including the history of its development, support the above conclusion. This Court in Thibodeau considered the history of the Montreal Convention, and how that history informs our understanding of its purpose: \nThe Warsaw Convention (and therefore its successor the Montreal Convention) had three main purposes: to create uniform rules governing claims arising from international air transportation; to protect the international air carriage industry by limiting carrier liability; and to balance that protective goal with the interests of passengers and others seeking recovery. [para. 41]\nLimitations on carrier liability were balanced against a reversal of the burden of proof in [passengers and shippers] favour such that, on proof of damage, fault on the part of the carrier would be presumed (Thibodeau, at para. 42 (emphasis added)). \nIn Thibodeau, Justice Abella, dissenting on another point, expanded in her reasons on the history and purpose of the Montreal Convention, as received from its predecessor:\n\tThe predecessor Warsaw Convention came into being in 1929 to assist the fledgling airline industry take flight. At that time, aviation technology was in its initial stages. Accidents were common, and many pilots and passengers were injured or died as a result. . . .\n\n\tAirlines responded by requiring passengers to sign waivers relieving carriers of any and all liability in the event of an injury. When accidents happened, those passengers were left with no remedy for their injuries or losses.\n\n\tThe Warsaw Convention attempted a protective reconciliation for both airlines and passengers. Airlines would benefit from the introduction of a uniform scheme of limited liability to protect against the financial risks and uncertainty posed by accidents, passengers would benefit from access to predetermined amounts of limited compensation for death or injury  about US$8,300 per passenger  and a prohibition on airlines requiring passengers to waive all liability . . . . [paras. 151-53]\nAs Justice Abella explained, growing recognition that liability limitations set by the Warsaw Convention were too low and a broader shift in the attention of governments towards a more passenger-friendly legal regime resulted in patchwork efforts to expand carrier liability. This led to efforts to update the Warsaw Convention, culminating in the Montreal Convention of 1999. In comparison to the earlier agreement, \nthe state parties to the Montreal Convention were more focused on the importance of ensuring protection of the interests of consumers in international carriage by air and the need for equitable compensation based on the principle of restitution (Montreal Convention, preamble; Ehrlich v. American Airlines, Inc., 360 F.3d 366 (2d Cir. 2004), at p. 371 (fn. 4)).\n\n(Thibodeau, at para. 159)\nFrom the foregoing, I draw two conclusions relevant to understanding the scope of Article 29. First, the textual focus of the Montreal Convention on actions with the characteristics of judicial proceedings that seek to vindicate individualized claims for damages related to death or bodily injury, damage or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay is consonant with the history of the Montreal Convention and predecessor agreements. Efforts over time to find a balance between limitations on carrier liability and the interests of passengers led the state parties and airline industry stakeholders to the approach set out in the Montreal Convention. Second, the state parties to the Montreal Convention framed the exclusivity principle so as to ensure that such claims could proceed only within the framework provided for therein. This ensured that the compromise struck in the Montreal Convention could not be undercut by recourse to actions for damages under local law. \nForeign Jurisprudence \nIn light of the Montreal Conventions objective of achieving international uniformity, we should pay close attention to the international jurisprudence and be especially reluctant to depart from any strong international consensus that has developed in relation to its interpretation (Thibodeau, at para. 50). Having considered the text and context of the Montreal Convention along with its history and purpose, I turn now to the manner in which courts of other state parties have considered the Montreal Convention. \nAs noted in the reasons of the Federal Court of Appeal, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has considered the scope of Articles 19 and 29 in decisions addressing (and rejecting) challenges to the European Unions standardized passenger compensation scheme on the basis that it conflicts with the Montreal Convention. \nIn the first such decision, the ECJ characterized Article 19 as governing individual damage resulting from delay that is inherent in the reason for travelling and which requires a case-by-case assessment of the extent of the damage caused so as to provide compensation granted subsequently on an individual basis (International Air Transport Association v. Department for Transport, C-344/04, [2006] E.C.R. I-403 (Grand Chamber), at paras. 43-44). The ECJ further noted that Article 19 and the other provisions in Chapter III lay down the conditions under which any actions for damages against air carriers may be brought by passengers who invoke damage sustained because of delay (para. 42 (emphasis added)). Determining the nature of the damage sustained by a given passenger as a result of a flight delay implicates a case-by-case analysis. This is distinct from a standardized approach: \nAny delay in the carriage of passengers by air . . . may, generally speaking, cause two types of damage. First, excessive delay will cause damage that is almost identical for every passenger. . . . Second, passengers are liable to suffer individual damage, inherent in the reason for travelling, redress for which requires a case-by-case assessment of the extent of the damage caused and can consequently only be the subject of compensation granted subsequently on an individual basis. \n\nIt is clear from Articles 19, 22 and 29 of the Montreal Convention that they merely govern the conditions under which, after a flight has been delayed, the passengers concerned may bring actions for damages by way of redress on an individual basis, that is to say for compensation, from the carriers liable for damage resulting from that delay. \n\nIt does not follow from these provisions, or from any other provision of the Montreal Convention, that the authors of the Convention intended to shield those carriers from any other form of intervention, in particular action which could be envisaged by the public authorities to redress, in a standardised and immediate manner, the damage that is constituted by the inconvenience that delay in the carriage of passengers by air causes, without the passengers having to suffer the inconvenience inherent in the bringing of actions for damages before the courts. [paras. 43-45]\nThe ECJ built on this decision in noting that compensation for the loss of time inherent in a delay that is suffered identically by all passengers falls outside the scope of Article 19 and is not subject to the exclusivity principle (Nelson v. Deutsche Lufthansa AG, C-581/10 and C-629/10, [2013] 1 C.M.L.R. 42 (p. 1191), at paras. 49-56).  \nCourts in the United States have also considered the scope of the Montreal Convention and its predecessors. The United States Supreme Court, in an appeal addressing what was covered by the liability cap associated with damage sustained in international carriage, linked damages recoverable under the Warsaw Convention to compensation for harm incurred as determined by the domestic law of contracting parties (Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co., 516 U.S. 217 (1996), at p. 227). Three years later, in El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U.S. 155 (1999), at p. 175, the United States Supreme Court described the Warsaw Conventions pre-emptive effect (as amended by Montreal Protocol No. 4 to amend the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air signed at Warsaw on 12 October 1929 as amended by the Protocol done at The Hague on 28 September 1955, 2145 U.N.T.S. 31) as preclud[ing] passengers from bringing actions under local law when they cannot establish air carrier liability under the treaty (emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court concluded that the [Warsaw] Conventions preemptive effect on local law extends no further than the Conventions own substantive scope (p. 172).\nAnd, in an appeal before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals considering whether a private suit for discrimination was precluded by the Warsaw Convention, Circuit Judge Sotomayor (as she then was) described the remedial system it created as one that is designed to protect air carriers against catastrophic, crippling liability by establishing monetary caps on awards and restricting the types of claims that may be brought against carriers (King v. American Airlines, Inc., 284 F.3d 352 (2002), at p. 357). She further noted that, while the discrimination claim was barred by the Warsaw Convention, the plaintiffs could avail themselves of other remedies, including filing a complaint with the Secretary [of Transportation] who, under United States law, has the authority to address violations of [Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C.  41310(a)] provisions, including the power to file civil actions to enforce federal law (p. 362). \nThe appellants submit that the ECJ decisions addressed are highly controversial and wrong and irreconcilable with Thibodeau (A.F., heading of para. 60). They refer to academic articles criticizing the decisions, and submit that this Court should consider International Air Transport Association v. Department for Transport and its progeny as having no persuasive effect. While academic articles can provide useful insights and perspectives, they can only be persuasive, not binding (R. v. McGregor, 2023 SCC 4, at para. 102; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 274, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., concurring; see also R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 247).\nMore importantly, there is no basis on which to disavow the reasoning in the ECJ or the American decisions. Rather, they help to illustrate the meaning of an action for damages and the scope of the Montreal Convention, and suggest a meaning that is consonant with the text, context and purpose considered above. These cases establish that an action for damages seeks to address individualized harm on a case-by-case basis. The term, within the context of the Montreal Convention, does not include standardized compensation that is owed identically to all passengers impacted by a given set of circumstances irrespective of the harm suffered.  \nConsideration of State Practice\nBefore concluding my review of the scope of the Montreal Convention and Article 29, I would address the question of state practice, which both parties rely on. \nPer Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention, [t]here shall be taken into account together with the context . . . any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation (see also Yugraneft Corp. v. Rexx Management Corp., 2010 SCC 19, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 649, at para. 21). The Attorney General notes that the practice of parties to a treaty is of utmost importance in its interpretation because it constitutes objective evidence of the understanding of the parties as to the meaning of the treaty (R.F., at para. 80, quoting Kasikili/Sedudu Island (Botswana/Namibia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1999, p. 1045, at para. 49). Thus, I cannot agree with the appellants when they submit that state practice should be considered only when the text of the treaty is obscure or ambiguous (A.F., at para. 100).  \nThe Federal Court of Appeal found that 73 state parties to the Montreal Convention have adopted schemes providing for minimum standardized compensation in case of cancellation, denied boarding and/or delay. The adoption of these schemes, without objection from other state parties, reveals common acceptance by state parties that they are compatible with the Montreal Convention and can operate in parallel to it (paras. 167-68). The Federal Court of Appeal stated:\n. . . state practice confirms that standardized compensation for the inconvenience resulting from flight cancellation, denial of boarding and/or delay is compatible with and can operate alongside the individual damages prescribed by the Montreal Convention. The jurisprudence of the ECJ and Regulation 261/2004 constitute the law in Europe, and the criticism of scholars (including those of the two professors who have filed expert reports on behalf of the appellants) does not supersede state practice when it comes to interpreting an international treaty. [para. 170]\nThe appellants argue that this finding was in error, and that state practice that is driven by considerations other than the member States obligations pursuant to the [Montreal] Convention cannot constitute state practice for the purposes of Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention (para. 133). The Attorney General responds that state practice means any practice that shows that the parties have taken a position regarding the interpretation of the treaty (R.F., at para. 84). \nFor present purposes, I will take the appellants argument at its highest and assume that the practice of the 73 state parties who have adopted schemes providing for minimum standardized compensation in case of cancellation, denied boarding and/or delay does not constitute state practice. Even assuming, without deciding, that there is no state practice supporting the view that an action for damages does not include a scheme for standardized compensation, I nonetheless conclude that an action for damages does not include a scheme for standardized compensation. This conclusion is supported by the ordinary meaning of action for damages, the history, object and purpose of the Montreal Convention, and foreign jurisprudence interpreting the Montreal Convention.\nThe Exclusivity Principle Precludes Actions for Individualized Damages\nBased on all the foregoing, Article 29 should be understood as precluding actions for damages that share the characteristics of judicial proceedings in courts of law, and that seek individualized compensation for death or bodily injury, damage or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay in international carriage. The text, object, and purpose reflect the compromise that lies at the heart of the Montreal Convention. Passengers benefit from an evidentiary presumption under Articles 17 to 19 that allows them to pursue damages without showing fault by a carrier. Articles 21 and 22 shield carriers from unlimited liability in these matters. Foreign jurisprudence has given the Montreal Convention a meaning consistent with that which I have set out above. \nIn light of this, I need not have recourse to the supplementary means of interpretation provided for under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, though I note that the Attorney General points to the preparatory work of the treaty (one of the supplementary means provided for under Article 32) as further reinforcing my conclusion above.\nThe Test for Expert Evidence on Questions of International Law \nIn the course of dealing with state practice, the Federal Court of Appeal and the parties addressed the admissibility of expert evidence regarding international law. Before I address this, I would note an important distinction between foreign law and international law. Foreign law is the domestic law of other states (Hunt v. T&N plc, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289, at pp. 308-9). International law is the law among states, but it is also a body of law enunciating certain rights and obligations that states have vis-a-vis non-state actors (such as individuals, international organizations, and other entities) and, to a more limited extent, imposing certain obligations on non-state actors in areas of concern to the international community (J. H. Currie et al., International Law: Doctrine, Practice, and Theory (3rd ed. 2022), at p. 14). Foreign law is treated as a question of fact that has to be pleaded and proved, generally by way of expert evidence (Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya, 2020 SCC 5, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 166, at para. 97). International law is treated as a question of law. As I explain below, the admissibility of expert evidence concerning international law depends on the same legal criteria as the admissibility of expert evidence in any other area of Canadian law. \nIn the proceedings before the Federal Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, under r. 369 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106, sought an order striking out portions of expert affidavits filed by the appellants. \nIn the merits proceedings, Justice de Montigny ruled that [t]he normative content of international law falls within the bailiwick of the courts exclusive jurisdiction and therefore the offending paragraphs of the affidavits should be struck (C.A. reasons, at para. 66). \nJustice de Montigny noted that the case law has not been consistent in its treatment of expert evidence regarding international law. Some appellate courts have taken judicial notice of international law (see Turp v. Canada (Foreign Affairs), 2018 FCA 133, [2019] 1 F.C.R. 198) or have otherwise considered questions of customary and conventional international law without recourse to expert evidence (e.g., Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3 (considering peremptory norms of international law); Yugraneft Corp., at paras. 19 and 21 (considering the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, Can. T.S. 1986 No. 43)). However, on at least two occasions, courts have admitted expert evidence on questions of international law (Holding Tusculum B.V. v. S.A. Louis Dreyfus & Cie, 2006 QCCS 2827, at para. 16 (CanLII); Federation des travailleurs du Quebec (FTQ - Construction) v. Procureure generale du Quebec, 2018 QCCS 4548, at para. 20 (CanLII)). \nThe appellants, the Attorney General and the Federal Court of Appeal have sought clarification on this issue. I agree that such clarification is timely. \nMohan Governs Expert Evidence on Questions of International Law \nThe appellants and the Attorney General are, for the most part, ad idem that the Mohan framework be used to determine the admissibility of the expert evidence. The appellants submit that [e]xpert evidence is necessary when it is likely to provide information outside the judges experience and knowledge (A.F., at para. 107). The appellants submit that it may be necessary for a court to receive expert evidence where the normative content of international law is unsettled, controversial or emerging (para. 111). They further argue that Canadian judges may find it difficult to ascertain the content of international law because it implicates practice in foreign states, making expert evidence important in this context. The Attorney General agrees that Mohan governs, but argues that expert evidence on a legal issue before the court is inadmissible as such expert evidence would usurp the courts role. Justice de Montigny, in weighing these arguments, noted that whether international law [should] be treated as a question of fact is a vexed question (C.A. reasons, at para. 46). \nWhile some courts of first instance deal infrequently with international law, others do so with more regularity. For example, the Federal Court often encounters international legal issues due to the nature of its jurisdiction. The approach of some courts of first instance to expert evidence has been described as inconsistent, and often under-reasoned (G. van Ert, Recent Federal Courts decisions on expert evidence of international law, December 31, 2018 (online); see also G. van Ert, The Admissibility of International Legal Evidence (2005), 84 Can. Bar Rev. 31). As a result, clarification of how to determine the admissibility of expert evidence, when such is necessary, may be beneficial. \nThe test from Mohan should be applied in the context of international law as it is in other circumstances where expert evidence is sought to be admitted. Under the Mohan test, expert evidence is admissible when it is necessary in the sense that it provides information which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge . . . (p. 23, quoting R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 24). The test is as follows: At the first stage, judges must consider the threshold requirements of admissibility set out in Mohan. There are four threshold requirements: . . . (1) relevance; (2) necessity in assisting the trier of fact; (3) absence of an exclusionary rule; and (4) a properly qualified expert . . . (White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 SCC 23, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 182, at para. 19, citing Mohan, at pp. 20-25). At the second stage  the discretionary gatekeeping stage  judges must balance the potential risks and benefits of admitting the evidence and determine whether the benefits outweigh the risks. Mohans basic structure for the law relating to the admissibility of expert opinion evidence is applicable in a wide range of contexts outside the experience of judges (White Burgess, at para. 19). See, for example, Masterpiece Inc. v. Alavida Lifestyles Inc., 2011 SCC 27, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 387, at para. 75 (intellectual property); Clayson-Martin v. Martin, 2015 ONCA 596, 127 O.R. (3d) 1 (medical reports); and R. v. Abdullahi, 2021 ONCA 82, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at para. 34 (linguistics and translation).\nAs with areas of the law such as those noted above, from time to time difficult and contentious questions of international law will arise where judges will be assisted in carrying out their functions by appropriate expert evidence. Questions of conventional international law may require judges to have regard to questions of fact that are susceptible to expert evidence including, inter alia, foreign law (in applying a treaty, for example), state practice in a treatys application, or the authentic text of a treaty in a foreign language (see G. van Ert, Using International Law in Canadian Courts (2nd ed. 2008), at pp. 57 and 63). Similarly, in the context of customary international law, alleged customs may be contested and require proof (p. 67). Mohan is sufficiently flexible to enable courts to admit expert evidence on such questions, where it is needed for a court to carry out its functions. \nTo summarize, then, the appropriate framework is the following. Where expert evidence satisfies Mohans criteria, it may be considered. Otherwise, judges should proceed as they would for any other question of law  that is, on the basis of the submissions of the parties before the court and authorities on which they rely.\nThis Court on various occasions has considered the meaning of treaties without recourse to expert evidence, including in Thibodeau and Yugraneft Corp. Looking to the principles of treaty interpretation codified in the Vienna Convention, and undertaking an examination of the text, object, and purpose of a treaty, is within the capacity of Canadian courts.\nIn Suresh, this Court considered the peremptory norm of international law regarding the prohibition of torture; this required the Court to have regard to international conventions which Canada has ratified and to jus cogens norms of international law. The Court had recourse to academic texts, foreign jurisprudence, as well as the submissions of parties and interveners. These sources sufficed for the Court to consider the status of the prohibition against torture as a matter of international law. \nThough the Court did not rely on Mohan in these cases, its approach to dealing with questions of international law without recourse to expert evidence is consistent with Mohans suggestion that [i]f on the proven facts a judge or jury can form their own conclusions without help, then the opinion of an expert is unnecessary (p. 24).  \nFinally, I note that evidence law jurisprudence establishes a number of cautionary rules that apply with equal force in the context of expert evidence sought to be admitted regarding international law. First, as noted in Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada, 2008 FC 713, 359 F.T.R. 1, affd 2009 FCA 361, 400 N.R. 323, affd 2011 SCC 11, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 368, the role of an expert is only to assist the court in assessing complex and technical facts. It must never be forgotten that, ultimately, it is the court that must decide questions of law (para. 161). Furthermore, [e]xpert opinions will be rendered inadmissible when they are nothing more than the reworking of the argument of counsel participating in the case (Surrey Credit Union v. Willson (1990), 45 B.C.L.R. (2d) 310 (S.C.), at p. 315).  \nIn applying Mohan, the admissibility of expert evidence is within the courts discretion so long as the threshold requirements of admissibility are satisfied. Given the variety of contexts in which expert evidence is sought to be adduced on questions of international law, the admissibility of such evidence is best left as a matter of judicial discretion rather than being subject to a fixed and invariable rule.\nWhat Is the Scope of the Regulations? \nI now turn to the Regulations, the manner in which they are enforced and the compensation that they provide for passengers who are affected by a delay, cancellation, denial of boarding, or damage or loss of baggage.\nCompensation \nUnder the Regulations, a carrier must pay compensation to a passenger when the carrier cancels or delays a flight for reasons within its control and notifies the passenger 14 days or less before the flight, except if the cancellation or delay is required for safety purposes (ss. 11 and 12(2)(d) and (3)(d)). Compensation must also be paid when a passenger is denied boarding for reasons within the carriers control, unless required for safety (s. 12(4)(d)). \nSections 19 and 20 of the Regulations set out the amount of compensation payable in the event of delay, cancellation or denial of boarding. The amount of compensation is calculated, in the case of delay or cancellation, by reference to the size of the carrier and the time by which the passengers arrival at the intended destination is delayed (s. 19(1)). For denial of boarding, compensation is calculated by reference to the time by which the passengers arrival at the intended destination is delayed. \nPassengers are also entitled to compensation for lost or damaged baggage. In those instances, the Regulations stipulate that the passenger is to be paid the compensation they would be owed under the Montreal Convention, in addition to a refund of their baggage fees (s. 23(1)). \nSo, although the Regulations purport to address compensation for inconvenience (see ss. 12(2)(d), (3)(d) and (4)(d) and 21), the compensation is not contingent on inconvenience per se, as ss. 19 and 20 do not have regard to individualized harm or inconvenience. For example, a passenger whose flight is delayed and who uses the opportunity to visit a relative during the layover enjoys the same entitlement to compensation under the Regulations as does a fellow passenger for whom the delay occasioned considerable inconvenience.\nThe Regulations do not provide for compensation that is individualized in the manner of a damage award. The compensation for delay, cancellation, denial of boarding or loss or damage to baggage is not contingent on proof of damage, is not linked to a showing of damage sustained or occasioned by delay to the claimant, and does not vary depending on the extent of the harm (if any) that results from wrongdoing by the carrier. The fact that the compensation owed under the Regulations may vary depending on whether it relates to a cancellation, delay, or denial of boarding, the amount of time that a passenger was delayed, and the size of the carrier does not change the standardized nature of the compensation, which addresses conditions experienced identically by all passengers (Nelson, at para. 52).  \nEnforcement \nThe obligations imposed on carriers by the Regulations are deemed to form part of the terms and conditions set out in the carriers tariffs in so far as the carriers tariffs do not provide more advantageous terms and conditions of carriage than those obligations (CTA, s. 86.11(4)). When the Regulations were promulgated, the Air Transportation Regulations, SOR/88-58 (ATR), were also amended to require carriers to incorporate the Regulations into tariffs applicable to international carriage (s. 122(c)(xxi)). In this manner, the obligations with respect to compensation set out in the Regulations become part of the carriers conditions of carriage. \nIf a carrier fails to compensate a passenger in accordance with the Regulations, the passenger can file a complaint with the Agency (CTA, ss. 85.04(1)(a) and (c) and 86.11(4)). A complaint resolution officer first attempts to resolve the complaint through mediation (s. 85.05(1)). If unsuccessful, the officer will adjudicate the matter (s. 85.06). If the officer finds that a carrier has not applied the terms and conditions of carriage set out in its tariff (including the Regulations), that officer can order the carrier to apply the relevant terms and conditions, including by paying the amount set out in the Regulations (ATR, s. 113.1; CTA, s. 85.07(1) and (3)). Complaint resolution officers can also consider prior decisions regarding whether a flight delay, cancellation or denial of boarding was within a carriers control (CTA, ss. 85.08 and 85.14). The CTA (s. 86(1)(h)(iii.1)) further enables the Agency to make applicable to some or all passengers on the same flight a decision respecting a complaint in the case of flight delay, cancellation, or denial of boarding. In addition to addressing passenger complaints, the Agency can also enforce the Regulations by imposing administrative monetary penalties not exceeding $5,000 (in the case of an individual) or $250,000 (in the case of a corporation) (s. 177(1)).\nRead together, these provisions of the CTA and the Regulations enable the Agency to enforce carrier compliance with the compensation provided for in the Regulations, and to extend compensation owed to one passenger to others who are impacted by the same disruption. \nThe Regulations Operate as a Consumer Protection Scheme \nThe Attorney General and the Agency submit that the Regulations mark an evolution in the governments approach away from a piecemeal system that relied on carrier-led tariff development towards one that ensures predictable payments to passengers who are inconvenienced during carriage by air to, from or within Canada. The Regulations were put in place, following a review of the CTA, with a view to correcting an acute imbalance in market power between air passengers and air carriers, and the unusual situation where Canadian air passengers had to rely on foreign customer protection measures when traveling abroad (R.F., Attorney General, at para. 11). Parliament responded to this situation by directing the Agency to put in place a system of standardized compensation.\nThe Regulations are, thus, best understood as providing for statutory entitlements under a consumer protection scheme. Passengers claiming under the Regulations need not show what harm, if any, they have suffered in order to claim compensation. The Regulations do not tie compensation to harm and inconvenience; rather they mandate compensation for delay, cancellation or denial of boarding based on the time by which a passengers arrival at their ultimate destination is delayed. Unlike the Montreal Convention, the Regulations do not enable a carrier to avoid having to pay compensation otherwise due to a passenger by invoking a due diligence defence or pointing to contributory negligence. As long as the disruption in question occurred for a reason within the carriers control and was not required for safety purposes, the compensation is fixed. Moreover, the Agency is empowered to extend a finding that compensation is owed to one passenger to other passengers similarly situated. Compensation owed under the Regulations for lost or damaged baggage is tied to the baggage fees charged by the carrier, not to the harm. The Regulations are enforced by Agency-designated complaint resolution officers whose primary adjudicative duty consists of ensuring that carriers adhere to terms set in their tariffs. \nThe Regulations Do Not Conflict With the Montreal Convention and Thus Are Not Ultra Vires the CTA \nI now turn to the central issue in this appeal: are the Regulations ultra vires the CTA? As I shall explain, they are not. The Regulations fall outside the scope of Article 29 of the Montreal Convention and therefore there is no conflict between the CTA and the Montreal Convention, as implemented by the CAA. \nWhat Constitutes a Conflict? \nIn Thibodeau, this Court explained that \n[c]ourts presume that legislation passed by Parliament does not contain contradictions or inconsistencies and only find that they exist when provisions are so inconsistent that they are incapable of standing together. Even where provisions overlap in the sense that they address aspects of the same subject, they are interpreted so as to avoid conflict wherever this is possible. [para. 89]\nThus, to find a conflict between the Montreal Convention and the impugned Regulations, the latter must be so inconsistent with the former that they are incapable of standing together (Daniels v. White, [1968] S.C.R. 517, at p. 526). \nThe inquiry into whether one statute conflicts with another is distinct from the presumption that Parliament legislates in conformity with international law and the rule of judicial policy that, as a matter of law, courts will strive to avoid constructions of domestic law pursuant to which the state would be in violation of its international obligations (R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, at para. 53). Where, as here, the treaty in question has been implemented in Canadian law, the test for statutory conflicts applies and there is no need to have regard to the presumption of conformity.  \nThe Regulations Do Not Provide for an Action for Damages and, as a Consequence, There Is No Conflict \nBecause the Regulations do not provide for an action for damages, but instead create an entitlement to standardized compensation that does not seek to measure a passengers loss, they fall outside the scope of Article 29 and do not conflict with the Montreal Convention. The two forms of passenger compensation envisaged by the Regulations and the Montreal Convention are capable of standing together. The bargain at the centre of the Montreal Convention remains undisturbed. In actions for damages, passengers continue to enjoy certain evidentiary presumptions on proof of damage (Thibodeau, at para. 42) which address the need for equitable compensation based on the principle of restitution (Montreal Convention, preamble). Carriers remain shielded from unlimited liability arising from actions for damages related to claims for death or bodily injury, damage or loss of baggage and cargo, and for delay. \nIt is helpful to look beyond the context of the Montreal Convention to other instances in which courts have considered whether a statutory entitlement is an award of damages. In Brake v. PJ-M2R Restaurant Inc., 2017 ONCA 402, 135 O.R. (3d) 561, the Court of Appeal dealt with whether a plaintiff was entitled to statutory entitlements (termination and severance pay) under the Employment Standards Act, 2000, S.O. 2000, c. 41, in addition to damages, or whether this would result in double recovery. In concluding that the compensation owed under the Employment Standards Act was not an award of damages and there was no double recovery, the court characterized the compensation payable under the Employment Standards Act as minimum entitlements that are not linked to any actual loss suffered by the employee, but are payable in any event (para. 116, quoting Boland v. APV Canada Inc. (2005), 250 D.L.R. (4th) 376 (Ont. Div. Ct.), at para. 22). The entitlements could be contrasted with damages in the employment context, which seek to correct the loss suffered by a plaintiff through monetary compensation, having regard to factors such as the age of the employee, the likely length of time to find another position, the actual finding of another position etc. (para. 117, quoting Boland, at para. 23). Concluding that no conflict exists between the statutory entitlements provided for under the Regulations and the damages limitations under the Montreal Convention is consistent with the approach in Brake and a correct interpretation of the Regulations. \nThe appellants raise two further arguments with respect to the purported incompatibility of the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, neither of which changes the outcome. First, they submit that the compensation provided for under the Regulations amounts to non-compensatory damages under the meaning of Article 29. This argument does not get off the ground. The meaning of damages examined above also applies to preclude a finding that the compensation provided for by the Regulations amounts to non-compensatory damages. Furthermore, the text of Article 29 places non-compensatory damages alongside punitive and exemplary damages deriving from any such action, i.e., any such action for damages. This construction establishes that the non-compensatory damages in question are a subset of the damages precluded by Article 29s exclusivity principle and not a standalone category. I therefore do not accept that this wording in Article 29 serves to broaden the exclusivity principle. \nSecond, the appellants submit that, because claims for compensation under the Regulations can be vindicated in court, the Regulations do in fact give rise to actions for damages despite the primacy of the administrative enforcement mechanism under the CTA. But the fact that claims payable pursuant to the Regulations can be vindicated by way of an action in court does not change the nature of the compensation or the Regulations themselves. The Regulations make no provision for claims to be filed in court. And even assuming, without deciding, that judicial proceedings that seek to vindicate a claim under the Regulations amount to an action for the purposes of the Montreal Convention, the claim would not be for damages. Where such claims are filed in courts of law, the claim is not in the nature of one for damages, because the claim is not tied to any harm suffered by the claimant and does not require any case-by-case assessment or relate to compensation for harm incurred (International Air Transport Association v. Department for Transport, at para. 43; Zicherman, at p. 227). Instead, the claim is for payment of an amount that is already owed as a matter of standardized entitlements provided for under a consumer protection scheme. \nThe Regulations impose additional costs on carriers by incorporating certain terms in their tariffs, but these costs are simply a condition of licensure for domestic and international carriers to access the Canadian air carriage market. In signing on to the Convention and the protective reconciliation between the interests of passengers and carriers that it engendered (Thibodeau, at para. 153, per Abella J., dissenting), there is no indication that Canada (or any other state party) agreed to forego its ability to provide for minimum standards of treatment for passengers within its jurisdiction. \nThis conclusion is consistent with this Courts holding, in Thibodeau, that the Convention is not comprehensive but is exclusive in relation to the matters that it covers, those being rules governing damages liability of international air carriers (para. 47). In the absence of any conflict between the Montreal Convention (as implemented by the CAA) and the Regulations, there is no basis to find that the Regulations are ultra vires the CTA.  \nIt Is Unnecessary To Deal With Alternative Arguments in Favour of Validity of the Regulations \nThe respondents raise two alternative arguments in favour of the validity of the Regulations. First, they argue that the Regulations are intra vires the CTA because the Montreal Convention does not address cancellation and denial of boarding and therefore does not preclude compensation relating to these sorts of travel disruptions. \nSecond, the respondents submit that, even if the Regulations are inconsistent with the Montreal Convention, they reflect Parliaments clear intent and, as such, s. 86.11 of the CTA overrides any conflicting provision of the Montreal Convention. \nIn light of my conclusion above that none of the impugned Regulations provisions provide for an action for damages, it is unnecessary to address these alternative arguments.\nConclusion and Disposition \nThe appellants urge this Court to conclude that the exclusivity principle codified in Article 29 prevents Canada from putting in place an air passenger protection scheme through statutory entitlements. For the reasons outlined above, I disagree. \nThe appeal is dismissed. Costs will go to the Attorney General of Canada. The Agency did not seek costs and, accordingly, no costs are awarded to the Agency.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants: IMK, Montreal; Paterson MacDougall, Toronto; Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent the Canadian Transportation Agency: Canadian Transportation Agency  Legal Services Directorate, Gatineau.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent the Attorney General of Canada: Department of Justice Canada, Quebec Regional Office, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener Gabor Lukacs: Gabor Lukacs, Halifax.\n\tSolicitor for the interveners the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, the National Pensioners Federation and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre: Public Interest Law Centre, Winnipeg; University of Ottawa, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener Societe quebecoise de droit international: Societe quebecoise de droit international, Montreal.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court Upholds the Validity of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations.\n\nThis appeal involves a challenge by several airlines to the validity of certain provisions in the Air Passenger Protection Regulations, which provide for minimum compensation to passengers on flights to and from Canada in case of delay, cancellation, denial of boarding, and lost or damaged baggage.\n\nThe appellants, several air carriers serving Canadian and international airports, challenged the validity of certain provisions of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations, adopted by the Canadian Transportation Agency in 2019. The Regulations were enacted to provide minimum compensation to passengers on flights to and from Canada in case of delay, cancellation, denial of boarding, and lost or damaged baggage. The airlines alleged that these provisions conflicted with the exclusivity principle codified in Article 29 of the Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, which was implemented into Canadian law by amendments to the Carriage by Air Act. The Montreal Convention is an international treaty that governs damages liability of international air carriers.\n\nThe appellants initially brought a statutory appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, challenging the provisions of the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed most parts of the challenge but allowed one aspect related to temporary loss of baggage. The appellants then appealed this decision to the Supreme Court. In response to these allegations, expert evidence was introduced regarding state practice under international law. However, the admissibility of such evidence has been inconsistent in various courts.\n\nThe key issue in this case is whether standardized compensation under a consumer protection scheme falls within or outside Article 29's scope as an \"action for damages.\" In determining whether a statutory entitlement constitutes an \"action for damages,\" it must be considered if it shares characteristics with judicial proceedings seeking individualized compensation tied to harm caused by another party.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the Air Passenger Protection Regulations do not conflict with the Montreal Convention and are therefore intra vires the Canada Transportation Act. Writing for the majority, Justice Rowe emphasized that the Montreal Convention's exclusivity principle applies only to actions for damages that share characteristics of judicial proceedings in courts of law and seek individualized compensation. The Regulations, on the other hand, create a consumer protection scheme providing for standardized compensation without regard to individual harm or inconvenience.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that airlines can be required to compensate passengers for certain  international flight disruptions.</strong>This is an appeal about whether a federal agency  can require airlines to pay compensation to passengers for certain  international flight disruptions. It addresses whether that compensation is  consistent with a treaty dealing with some aspects of international air travel. In 2018, Parliament amended the <em>Canada Transportation Act</em> (\u201cCTA\u201d) to  require that the Canadian Transportation Agency make regulations establishing  what it described as a \u201cnew air passenger rights regime\u201d. In 2019, the Agency  made the <em>Air Passenger Protection  Regulations</em>. The Regulations say what airlines have to do for passengers in  the case of international flight delays, cancellations and denial of boarding,  which in some cases includes paying a set minimum amount of compensation. They  also require airlines to refund baggage fees paid by passengers when an airline  has lost or damaged their baggage on international flights.The International Air Transport Association, the  Air Transportation Association of America, and several airlines (collectively,  \u201cairlines\u201d) challenged certain provisions of the Regulations before the Federal  Court of Appeal. The airlines said that the provisions were not consistent with  the <em>Convention for the Unification of  Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air</em> (\u201cMontreal Convention\u201d) and  fell outside the Agency\u2019s regulation-making authority under the CTA. The Montreal Convention is an international  agreement that Canada signed in 2001 and that has been implemented into  Canadian law. It sets out certain conditions and limits on what airlines can be  required to pay passengers to compensate for international flight disruptions. Article  29 of the Montreal Convention says that any \u201caction for damages\u201d within the  scope of the agreement is subject to those conditions and limits. This is  called the \u201cexclusivity principle\u201d, because it prevents a person from bringing  an \u201caction for damages\u201d not subject to the conditions and limits even if there  is another basis in law to do so.The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the  challenge brought by the airlines, with the exception of the provisions  relating to the temporary loss of baggage. It considered the compatibility of  the Regulations with the Montreal Convention, and concluded that the  compensation provided for under the Regulations is not an \u201caction for damages\u201d.The Airlines appealed to the Supreme Court  seeking an order setting aside certain provisions of the Regulations as they  relate to international air travel. The Supreme Court has dismissed the Airlines\u2019  appeal.<strong>The  compensation payable to passengers is not individualized and is not therefore an  \u201caction for damages\u201d limited by the Montreal Convention.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Rowe explained  that the Montreal Convention is exclusive within the scope of the matters that  it addresses but does not deal comprehensively with all aspects of  international carriage by air. Under Article 29, there must be an \u201caction\u201d that  leads to \u201cdamages\u201d for the exclusivity principle to apply. However, the  Regulations do not provide for an \u201caction for damages\u201d because they do not  provide for individualized compensation. Rather, they create a consumer  protection scheme that operates in parallel with the Montreal Convention, without  trenching on its liability limitation provisions. Thus, they do not fall within  the scope of the Montreal Convention\u2019s exclusivity principle. Since the  Regulations do not give rise to liability that is pre-empted by Article 29,  they do not conflict with the Montreal Convention and there is no basis to  conclude that they are outside the jurisdiction of the Agency."

Charles\n2024 SCC 29\nFile No.: 40319.\n2024: January 18; 2024: September 25.\nPresent: Karakatsanis, Cote, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and Moreau JJ.\non appeal from the court of appeal for quebec\n\tCriminal law  Evidence  Admissibility  Hearsay  Principled exception to hearsay rule  Trial judge admitting witnesss out-of-court statement into evidence  Whether statement could be admitted into evidence under principled exception to rule against hearsay.\n\tFollowing an incident involving the accused and the complainant at the school they attended, the accused was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm in the commission of an assault, and uttering threats. At trial, the complainant testified that he had entered a washroom at the school and had felt something on his hip while washing his hands. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol being held by the accused, used to threaten him. Two other students were present at the time. One of them, whom the Crown called as a witness at the accuseds trial, claimed on being questioned that he had no recollection of the events. The Crown therefore requested a voir dire, seeking to admit into evidence an out-of-court statement that had been given by that witness to the police investigators the day after the events. Accompanied at the time by his mother, the witness, who had been arrested and taken into custody in connection with the same incident, was questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and provided a statement in writing. Among other things, the witness admitted in his statement that he was in possession of two pellet pistols. The police conducted a search and recovered the pistols at the witnesss residence, in the location indicated in his statement.\n\tThe trial judge admitted the witnesss out-of-court statement into evidence. He found that the only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its material aspects, given the circumstances in which the statement was made and the seizure of pistols, which the trial judge considered to be corroborative evidence. Following the trial, the accused was found guilty of the three counts. The trial judge accepted the complainants version of events, which was supported for the most part by a surveillance video and the witnesss statement. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judges decision to admit the statement into evidence and dismissed the accuseds appeal from his convictions. In addition to being of the view that the trial judges conclusion was justified, the majority pointed out the striking similarity between the complainants testimony and the witnesss statement, which, according to the majority, tended to confirm that the statement was sufficiently reliable.\n\tHeld (Cote, Rowe and Kasirer JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered.\n\tPer Karakatsanis, Martin, Jamal and Moreau JJ.: The trial judge erred in finding that the witnesss out-of-court statement had the required indicia of reliability and in admitting the statement into evidence at trial. The results of the search subsequently conducted at the witnesss residence do not meet the criteria for corroborative evidence set out in R. v. Bradshaw, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the statement do not support a finding that threshold reliability is established. Finally, the majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainants testimony, tendered outside of the voir dire, to establish the threshold reliability of the witnesss statement.\n\tHearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible. Under the principled exception, hearsay can exceptionally be admitted into evidence when the party tendering it demonstrates that the twin criteria of necessity and threshold reliability are met on a balance of probabilities. At the threshold reliability stage, one can only rely on corroborative evidence if it shows, when considered as a whole and in the circumstances of the case, that the only likely explanation for the hearsay statement is the declarants truthfulness about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement. In the absence of a connection between the corroborative evidence and the aspect sought to be proved, the evidence is quite simply of no assistance in determining whether that specific aspect is true or accurate; it merely corroborates the declarants credibility, the accuseds guilt or one partys theory of the case, which is not sufficient. The combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances of the case, not the evidence taken in isolation, must rule out plausible alternative explanations for the material aspects of the statement. The absence of leading questions, inconsistent statements, promises of benefit or a criminal lifestyle simply points to an absence of factors that, if present, would detract from an otherwise trustworthy statement. \n\tIn this case, the Crown was required to show that the search results confirmed the accuseds role in the events if it was seeking to use the witnesss statement to establish the accuseds degree of involvement as well as the use of the weapon. There is no connection between the discovery of the pistols and the accuseds degree of involvement. The location of the pistols therefore cannot serve to show that threshold reliability is established through that aspect of the statement alone. Aside from establishing the truth of that aspect of the statement, that evidence is not capable of ruling out plausible alternative explanations for the events.\n\tIn addition, the witnesss statement raises particular reliability concerns. Because the witness is an accomplice, there is a very real danger that he tried to shift his responsibility onto the accused in his statement. It was to the witnesss advantage to provide an account that limited his participation to possession of the weapons, avoiding the charges that involved a greater degree of participation. In the absence of external evidence confirming that the accused played the primary role in the washroom, the circumstantial guarantees cannot overcome the dangers presented by the witnesss statement. Indeed, the absence of a criminal lifestyle is not at all clear. Moreover, the presence of the witnesss mother is not actually an indicium of reliability, because it is possible that the witness did not want his mother to know his degree of involvement, which could have motivated him to lie. The temporal proximity between the statement and the events is also not a useful factor in assessing the specific danger raised by the statement, namely, that the witness lied. Lastly, the witnesss consultation with counsel does not make it possible to exclude the risk that he tried to minimize his responsibility. Nor are the indicia of procedural reliability reassuring, because the usual substitutes for the traditional safeguards are absent: there was no recording of the statement or the interview that preceded it, the witness was not under oath and was not given a warning by the investigators concerning the need to tell them the truth and the consequences associated with lying, and the defence was deprived of any opportunity to cross-examine the witness. In short, the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances does not overcome the specific hearsay dangers raised by the out-of-court statement.\n\tAs for the complainants testimony, that evidence cannot be considered in analyzing the threshold reliability of the witnesss statement. Despite the fact that the complainant testified before the trial judge rendered his decision on the voir dire, his testimony was not part of the voir dire. On appeal, the appropriate mechanism for considering the complainants testimony that was not formally tendered in the voir dire is the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, which cannot be applied in this case because the trial judges admission of the statement is not a harmless or trivial error and it is not clear that the evidence pointing to the accuseds guilt is so overwhelming that any other verdict but a conviction would be impossible.\n\tPer Cote, Rowe and Kasirer (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. There is no reviewable error in the trial judges decision to admit the witnesss out-of-court statement into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay. However, there is agreement with the majority that, on appeal, the appropriate mechanism for considering the complainants testimony is the curative proviso.\n\tThe trial judge made no reviewable error in taking the discovery of the weapons into account as corroborative evidence in the assessment of threshold reliability. Given the charges laid and the burden they entailed for the prosecution, there is indeed a logical connection between the aspect of the statement pertaining to the presence of the weapon in the washroom, corroborated by the discovery of the weapon at the witnesss residence, and the aspect of the statement pertaining to the handling of that same weapon by the accused at the same time and in the same location. Such a logical connection makes it possible, in the assessment of threshold reliability, to consider corroborative evidence that does not relate to all of the material aspects of a statement. Threshold reliability can be established through the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances that constitute indicia of reliability, as those circumstances make remedying the insufficiency of the corroborative evidence possible.\n\tIn the absence of an error in principle that tainted the analysis at first instance during the consideration of certain circumstances in the assessment of threshold reliability, the trial judges decision was owed deference by the Court of Appeal. The relevance of the circumstances depends on the specific dangers associated with the hearsay in question and thus on the facts of the case. It would be wrong to categorize, objectively and independently of the facts of the case, the circumstances that are neutral or secondary and those that are more important. It is true that circumstances that in essence simply point to an absence of factors that, if present, would detract from an otherwise trustworthy statement do not provide a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. However, those circumstances are relevant. While such circumstances are not sufficient on their own to establish threshold reliability, such circumstances considered in conjunction with others (for example, corroboration even insufficient on its own), may lead to the conclusion that the statement has all the attributes required for acceptable threshold reliability. The fact that the witness spoke with counsel, the fact that his mother accompanied him when he made his statement and the fact that his mother was made aware of the tenor of the witnesss rights are indicia of reliability that the trial judge could validly consider.\nCases Cited\nBy Moreau J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in determining that the out-of-court statement had the indicia of reliability required by R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, and R. v. Bradshaw, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865, for admission into evidence. A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the trial judges decision to admit the statement into evidence. The dissenting judge would have excluded the statement and ordered a new trial.\nThe central issue to be determined is whether the trial judge erred in finding that the witnesss out-of-court statement had the indicia of reliability required according to the principles set out in our jurisprudence. This determination affords us an opportunity to reaffirm the principles laid down in Bradshaw.\nI agree with the dissenting Court of Appeal judge that the trial judge erred in admitting the witnesss statement in writing into evidence at trial. The results of the search subsequently conducted at the witnesss residence do not meet the Bradshaw criteria for corroborative evidence. Because the Crown sought to use the witnesss statement to establish the appellants role in the events, it was required to show that the search results confirmed that aspect of the statement. As for the circumstances surrounding the statement, they do not support a finding that threshold reliability is established.\nMoreover, the majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainants testimony, tendered outside of the voir dire, to establish the threshold reliability of K.A.s statement. On appeal, the appropriate mechanism for considering the complainants testimony is the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. However, that provision cannot be applied in this case. It is therefore unnecessary to decide the discrete question of the self-contained nature of the voir dire at the trial stage, especially since the trial judge expressly declined to consider evidence not tendered in the voir dire, by agreement of the parties.\nI would accordingly allow the appeal, quash the convictions and order a new trial.\nFacts\nThe appellant was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm in the commission of an assault, and uttering threats.\nThe circumstances at the heart of this case unfolded on February 24, 2016, at the school attended at the time by the appellant, K.A. and the complainant. At the appellants trial before a judge alone, the Crown called K.A., the complainant, a police officer and a rehabilitation counsellor who worked at the school. The appellant testified in his own defence.\nThe complainant testified that he had asked the appellant to stop bothering his girlfriend. The appellant initially became angry but subsequently calmed down. Later, the complainant entered a washroom at the school and, while washing his hands, he felt something on his hip. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol being held by the appellant. Two other students, K.A. and a person named Fares, were also present. When asked by the complainant whether the pistol [translation] was a real one, the appellant replied: Do you want to see if its a real one? I think I have a bullet left in it (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 305-6). K.A. and Fares later caught up with the complainant and told him that the firearm was a fake.\nThe day after the events, K.A. was arrested and taken into custody for possession of a firearm for a dangerous purpose, possession of an imitation firearm, carrying a concealed firearm, uttering death threats and assault with a weapon. K.A. was informed of his rights and consulted counsel.\nAccompanied by his mother, K.A. was questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and provided a statement in writing. In his testimony at the voir dire on the admissibility of K.A.s statement, the police investigator who had taken notes during the interview could not guarantee that he had taken down all of the questions asked or, for that matter, everything said during the interview. No recording (video or audio) of the interview was made, nor was the statement made under oath. The police investigators did not warn K.A. of the possible consequences of giving a false statement.\nIn his written statement, K.A. admitted that he was in possession of two pellet pistols belonging to Fares. According to K.A., while he was with Fares and the appellant in the washroom, he was asked to give one of the pistols to the appellant. K.A. was not aware of the issues between the appellant and the complainant. The appellant pointed the weapon at the complainant while uttering threats against him, then tried to wipe his prints off the weapon before returning it to K.A. A short time later, K.A. and Fares found the complainant and told him that the appellant was not serious and was only joking.\nK.A.s statement also described the pistols and where they were located in his residence, namely, in a drawer of his dresser. The police then conducted a search and recovered the pistols in the location indicated by K.A. K.A. subsequently pleaded guilty to a charge of carrying a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.\nWhen called by the Crown as a witness at the appellants trial, K.A. claimed to have no recollection of the events. The Crown then requested a voir dire, seeking to admit into evidence the recording of K.A.s guilty plea before the Youth Division of the Court of Quebec. Since the complainant had already lost part of a work day, the trial judge decided to adjourn the voir dire in order to allow him to testify. When the voir dire resumed, the Crown advised the trial judge of its intention to adduce into evidence as well the out-of-court statement given by K.A. to the police investigators on February 25, 2016.\nThe trial judge inquired as to whether all of the trial evidence would be tendered in the voir dire. The parties agreed that the trial judge could consider K.A.s demeanour while testifying but that the other trial evidence would not be tendered in the voir dire.\nThe trial judge admitted K.A.s out-of-court statement into evidence at the trial, but not his guilty plea.\nThe appellant testified during the trial that on February 24, 2016, K.A.  a person unknown to him  offered to show him an iPad electronic tablet. The appellant later saw K.A. and another person in the washroom. K.A. showed him the iPad and said that he also had something else to show him. K.A. then took out a firearm. The appellant held it for a few seconds before returning it to K.A. The complainant, who was also in the washroom, asked whether the pistol was a real one. The appellant answered that it was not; however, the individual with K.A. said that there was still a bullet in it.\nFollowing the trial, the appellant was found guilty of the three counts.\nDecisions of the Courts Below\nCourt of Quebec (Judge Dupras)\nVoir Dire Ruling\nAt the outset of his reasons, the trial judge noted that the evidence adduced at the trial had not been tendered in the voir dire, except for the evidence concerning K.A.s demeanour at the trial. The trial judge relied on the Ontario Court of Appeals decision in R. v. Conway (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 579, as well as similar remarks made in Bradshaw, in determining that he had to confine himself to the evidence tendered during the voir dire.\nThe trial judge had no difficulty in finding that necessity  the first criterion for the admissibility of hearsay  was met given that K.A. claimed during the trial to have no recollection of the events.\nHe also found that the criterion of reliability was met, highlighting the following circumstances:\nK.A. was read his rights from a form used specifically for minors.\nK.A.s mother was present at all times while he was being questioned and while the statement was being written, and her sons rights were explained to her.\nK.A. consulted counsel before giving his statement.\nK.A. admitted, without hesitation, his responsibility in relation to the events.\nThe police investigators questions were not leading.\nThere was no evidence of inconsistent statements.\nK.A. did not have a criminal record and there was no evidence as to moral character, criminal lifestyle, past dishonesty or interest in the outcome of the trial.\nK.A. provided his statement the day after the events occurred.\nK.A. did not attempt to diminish his criminal responsibility, as he even made assertions that lessened the appellants responsibility. This distinguished the situation at hand from those in which an accomplice attempts to evade responsibility by blaming someone else.\nThere was an intrinsic structure to what was said, and K.A. seemed to adhere to an inherent logic, particularly in minimizing the intent that might be inferred from the appellants conduct.\nThe trial judge also considered the seizure of pistols at K.A.s residence to be corroborative evidence. He noted that those items had been seized by consent, which demonstrated K.A.s willingness to cooperate fully with the authorities, at the risk of incriminating himself.\nThe trial judge identified the honesty of the declarant as the specific hearsay danger raised. However, given the circumstances and the corroborative evidence, he found that the only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its material aspects.\nDecision as to Guilt\nThe trial judge began his analysis by assessing the probative value of K.A.s statement. He pointed out that there were certain discrepancies between that statement and a surveillance video (Exhibit P-6) which showed the individuals concerned in a hallway beside the washroom. Noting that he had not yet viewed Exhibit P-6 at the time he assessed threshold reliability, the trial judge found [translation] that once it is placed in the general context of the evidence as a whole, there are elements of [the statement] whose probative value must be adjusted downward (para. 45, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 49).\nThe trial judge concluded that he did not believe the appellants version and that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.\nRelying on Exhibit P-6 and the complainants testimony, as well as the portions of the appellants testimony that confirmed the complainants testimony, the trial judge found that the Crown had established the appellants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The probative value of certain passages of K.A.s statement was compromised, but other passages remained useful. In particular, the statement had been proven truthful with respect to the location of the weapon or weapons. With regard to the [translation] crux of this case, the criminal use of the weapon by the accused, the trial judge noted that K.A.s statement generally supported the complainants account (para. 68). When K.A.s comments were properly situated in the context of the evidence as a whole, they [translation] compel[led] the recognition of [their] definite probative value (para. 69). The trial judge accepted the complainants version of events, which he considered to be supported for the most part by Exhibit P-6 and K.A.s statement.\nThe trial judge therefore convicted the appellant of the three counts and entered a conditional stay of proceedings on the second count.\nQuebec Court of Appeal, 2022 QCCA 1013, 82 C.R. (7th) 373\nBefore the Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the trial judge had erred in considering the location of the pistols as corroborative evidence and in finding that the circumstances surrounding the statement were sufficient to establish threshold reliability. While the dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal on the basis of those arguments, the majority rejected them. The Court of Appeal unanimously rejected a second argument concerning s. 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, which the appellant did not pursue before this Court.\nBachand J.A., Dissenting\nBachand J.A. found that the search results were not relevant in determining whether the statement was admissible to establish the appellants role in the incident. Corroborative evidence may be used in the analysis of threshold reliability only when that evidence, considered as a whole and in the circumstances of the case, shows that the only likely explanation for the statement is the statements truthfulness or accuracy regarding its material aspects. In particular, Bachand J.A. cited Karakatsanis J.s majority reasons in Bradshaw stating that the function of corroborative evidence is to mitigate the need for cross-examination on the point that the statement is tendered to prove.\nHowever, there was no connection between the search results and the issue of whether the appellant had handled the weapon and used it to threaten the complainant. Therefore, if the Crown adduced the statement to prove that fact, the search results could not be used to establish the statements admissibility. This remained true even if the Crown also wished to adduce the statement to show that a weapon had been used. The search results could then be used to establish the reliability of the statement in relation to this second aspect, but not in relation to the first.\nAs for the circumstances surrounding the statement, Bachand J.A. determined that they did not provide sufficient guarantees. The trial judge relied on certain circumstances that, in light of the case law, had to be regarded as having very limited weight. K.A. had reasons to lie, since he was suspected of having committed offences in connection with the events of February 24, 2016. The statement [translation] certainly had the effect of diminishing his own role while attributing responsibility for the offences mainly to the appellant (para. 45). The trial judge gave little weight to K.A.s interest in not being identified as the person who had used the pistol and threatened the complainant. It could not reasonably be said that the circumstances of the statement [translation] compel[led] the conclusion that cross-examining K.A. would have added nothing to the process (para. 48).\nWith regard to the complainants testimony, Bachand J.A. pointed out (in a footnote) that it was not part of the evidence relied upon for the purposes of the voir dire.\nFinally, Bachand J.A. found that the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) could not apply.\nDoyon and Cournoyer JJ.A.\nThe majority dismissed the appeal, finding that the dissenting judge was [translation] unduly pars[ing] the evidence and the jurisprudence, which resulted in the negation of the key principle that favours a flexible approach, an assessment made on a case-by-case basis, in light of all the circumstances (para. 53). That assessment [translation] is first and foremost a matter for the trial judge because the trial judge is in the best position to determine the extent to which the dangers of hearsay evidence are present (para. 53).\nThe situation differed from that in Bradshaw. Here, K.A. had not made prior inconsistent statements and had participated in a police interview within hours of the incident. His credibility was not damaged at the time of his statement, and the evidence corroborated one of the two material aspects of the statement. The evidence could not be split up to limit corroboration to one aspect: [translation] At that stage of the trial, the scope of the statement was much broader than that described by [the dissenting judge], and the discovery of a weapon, according to the [trial] judge, corroborated the entire statement (para. 59), which was not an error. In addition, the trial judge did not rely primarily or exclusively on corroboration to admit the evidence. Even though each factor was insufficient in itself, it was open to the trial judge to consider the factors as a whole in order to find that threshold reliability had been established.\nThe majority summarized the evidence concerning the circumstances as follows, at para. 64 of its reasons:\n\t[translation] A young person, who had consulted counsel and who understood the gravity of the situation and his duty to tell the truth because of the caution and the presence of a parent, gave a short, very coherent statement shortly after the events. He was accompanied by his mother (in accordance with the Youth Criminal Justice Act to ensure the integrity of the statement and even its reliability: R. v. L.T.H., 2008 SCC 49, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 739, at para. 38) and made a written statement, which he gave and signed without coercion or even any leading questions. In the statement, he completely incriminated himself. In addition, he consented to the police going to his residence to seize the weapons, which demonstrated a genuine desire to cooperate with the police by telling the truth.\nConsidered as a whole, these factors could justify the trial judges conclusion.\nThe majority was also of the view that K.A. had not shifted his responsibility onto the appellants shoulders. There was nothing to suggest that K.A. had an interest in making a statement that would prevent him from being identified as the person who had used the pistol and uttered threats.\nFinally, the majority pointed out the striking similarity between the complainants testimony and K.A.s statement. The majority noted that K.A. had not discussed the content of his statement with the complainant, which tended to confirm that the statement was sufficiently reliable.\nIssues\nThe appellant raises only one issue: Did the Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in upholding the decision to admit K.A.s statement into evidence on the basis of the principled exception to the hearsay rule?\nThe reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal raise a second issue: Did the majority of the Court of Appeal err in relying on the complainants testimony to find that the threshold reliability of K.A.s statement had been established?\nAnalysis\nStandard of Review\nBoth issues are subject to a correctness standard. The admissibility of hearsay evidence is a question of law. However, as my colleagues in dissent have correctly noted, an appellate court must accord deference to the findings of fact underlying an admissibility ruling. It must also be borne in mind that a trial judge is well placed to assess the hearsay dangers in a particular case and the effectiveness of any safeguards to assist in overcoming them (R. v. Youvarajah, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at para. 31). Thus, absent an error in principle, the trial judges determination of threshold reliability is entitled to deference (para. 31).\nThe question of whether it was open to the majority of the Court of Appeal to rely on the complainants testimony to find that the threshold reliability of K.A.s statement was established is also a question of law. The correctness standard therefore applies to this question as well.\nGeneral Principles Concerning the Admissibility of Hearsay Evidence\nHearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible (see, e.g., Bradshaw, at paras. 1 and 21). Its presumptive inadmissibility is due to the fact that it is often difficult to assess the truth of a statement made outside the courtroom. In Bradshaw, Karakatsanis J. explained that, generally, hearsay is not taken under oath, the trier of fact cannot observe the declarants demeanor as she makes the statement, and hearsay is not tested through cross-examination (para. 20). However, [t]he truth-seeking process of a trial is predicated on the presentation of evidence in court (Bradshaw, at para. 19), and our adversary system is based on the assumption that sources of untrustworthiness or inaccuracy can best be brought to light under the test of cross-examination (Khelawon, at para. 48). It is mainly because of the inability to put hearsay evidence to that test that such evidence is presumptively inadmissible (Khelawon, at para. 48; see also Bradshaw, at para. 1).\nThe admission of hearsay may therefore compromise trial fairness and the trials truth-seeking process (Bradshaw, at para. 20). It is possible that the statement has been inaccurately recorded, and the trier of fact cannot easily investigate the declarants perception, memory, narration, or sincerity (Bradshaw, at para. 20, citing Khelawon, at para. 2). There is thus a risk that such evidence may be afforded more weight than it deserves (Bradshaw, at para. 21, quoting Khelawon, at para. 35).\nThat being said, in some circumstances, hearsay evidence presents minimal dangers and its exclusion, rather than its admission, would impede accurate fact finding (Khelawon, at para. 2 (emphasis in original), quoted in Bradshaw, at para. 22). Over time, the case law therefore developed categorical exceptions to the exclusionary rule and, ultimately, a more flexible approach. Under the principled exception, hearsay can exceptionally be admitted into evidence when the party tendering it demonstrates that the twin criteria of necessity and threshold reliability are met on a balance of probabilities (Bradshaw, at para. 23, citing Khelawon, at para. 47). To establish the threshold reliability of a statement, a party may demonstrate its procedural or substantive reliability.\nProcedural reliability is established when there are adequate substitutes for testing the truth and accuracy of the statement given that the declarant has not state[d] the evidence in court, under oath, and under the scrutiny of contemporaneous cross-examination (Bradshaw, at para. 28, quoting Khelawon, at para. 63). Triers of fact must have a satisfactory basis . . . to rationally evaluate the truth and accuracy of the hearsay statement (Bradshaw, at para. 28). Substitutes for the traditional safeguards include a video recording of the statement, the presence of an oath, and a warning about the consequences of lying (Bradshaw, at para. 28, citing R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, at pp. 795-96). Some form of cross-examination of the declarant, such as preliminary inquiry testimony, is usually required (Bradshaw, at para. 28).\nSubstantive reliability is established when the statement is inherently trustworthy. To determine whether this is the case, trial judges may consider the circumstances in which the statement was made as well as the evidence that corroborates or conflicts with it. The standard is a high one (Bradshaw, at para. 31). That being said, it is not necessary for reliability to be established with absolute certainty. Rather, judges must be satisfied that the statement is so reliable that contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant would add little if anything to the process (Khelawon, at para. 49, quoted in Bradshaw, at para. 31). In other words, the evidence must be sufficiently reliable to overcome the dangers arising from the difficulty of testing it (Bradshaw, at para. 26, quoting Khelawon, at para. 49). As Karakatsanis J. explained in Bradshaw, at para. 31:\n\tSubstantive reliability is established when the statement is made under circumstances which substantially negate the possibility that the declarant was untruthful or mistaken ([R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915], at p. 933); under such circumstances that even a sceptical caution would look upon it as trustworthy (Khelawon, at para. 62, citing [J. H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law (2nd ed. 1923), vol. III], at p. 154); when the statement is so reliable that it is unlikely to change under cross-examination (Khelawon, at para. 107; Smith, at p. 937); when there is no real concern about whether the statement is true or not because of the circumstances in which it came about (Khelawon, at para. 62); when the only likely explanation is that the statement is true ([R. v. U. (F.J.), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764], at para. 40).\nIn the criminal context, the threshold reliability analysis has a constitutional dimension because the difficulties of testing hearsay evidence can threaten the accuseds right to a fair trial (Bradshaw, at para. 24). By ensuring that only hearsay that is necessary and reliable is admitted, the trial judge acts as an evidentiary gatekeeper. She protects trial fairness and the integrity of the truth-seeking process (para. 24).\nUse of the Search Results in the Threshold Reliability Analysis\nRecall that, to determine whether corroborative evidence is of assistance in the substantive reliability inquiry, a trial judge should\nidentify the material aspects of the hearsay statement that are tendered for their truth;\nidentify the specific hearsay dangers raised by those aspects of the statement in the particular circumstances of the case;\nbased on the circumstances and these dangers, consider alternative, even speculative, explanations for the statement; and\ndetermine whether, given the circumstances of the case, the corroborative evidence led at the voir dire rules out these alternative explanations such that the only remaining likely explanation for the statement is the declarants truthfulness about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement.\n\t(Bradshaw, at para. 57)\nThe Crown argues that the seizure of the pistols at the location specified in the statement constitutes extrinsic corroborative evidence that is relevant to establishing the statements substantive reliability. It submits that K.A.s statement serves to establish two material aspects: (1) the use of the weapon and (2) the appellants degree of involvement. For the purposes of analysis, let us assume that this is indeed the case. The Crown urges us to find that, since the search results corroborate the first aspect, they can serve to corroborate the statement in its entirety. According to the Crown, this is because it is not necessary for evidence to corroborate all material aspects of a statement: it is sufficient for it to corroborate just one aspect.\nAs for the appellant, he argues that there is no connection between the discovery of the pistols during the search and the aspect of the statement pertaining to his role in the events and that, as a result, this evidence cannot be used to establish the reliability of the statement.\nWith respect for the contrary view expressed by my colleagues in dissent, there is no connection between the discovery of K.A.s pistols and the appellants degree of involvement. In no way can this evidence confirm that it was the appellant who handled a pistol in the washroom, and not K.A. (despite the fact that it was K.A. who was in possession of the weapons the next day). That aspect of the statement puts in issue not merely the handling of a weapon, but rather the handling of a weapon by the appellant. Consequently, it is necessary to determine how the principles set out in Bradshaw apply where several material aspects of a statement are not connected with each other.\nI reject the Crowns arguments on this point, as they conflict with the logic underlying the analytical framework established in Bradshaw. In my view, evidence cannot serve to corroborate the aspects of a statement with which it is not connected, even when the evidence confirms another material aspect of the statement in question.\nAt the threshold reliability stage, not all evidence that corroborates the declarants credibility, the accuseds guilt, or one partys theory of the case, is of assistance (Bradshaw, at para. 44). Accordingly, one can only rely on corroborative evidence . . . if it shows, when considered as a whole and in the circumstances of the case, that the only likely explanation for the hearsay statement is the declarants truthfulness about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement (para. 44). The function of corroborative evidence is thus to mitigate the need for cross-examination, not generally, but on the point that the hearsay is tendered to prove (para. 45 (emphasis in original)).\nIt is true that it is the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances of the case, and not the evidence taken in isolation, that must rule out plausible alternative explanations for the material aspects of the statement (see Bradshaw, at para. 47). However, this does not mitigate the need for a connection between the evidence and the aspect sought to be proved. In the absence of such a connection, the evidence is quite simply of no assistance in determining whether that specific aspect is true or accurate; it merely corroborates the declarants credibility, the accuseds guilt or one partys theory of the case, which is not sufficient (see Bradshaw, at para. 44; see also paras. 45-46 and 72). Evidence that is not connected with the material aspects of the statement is therefore not capable, even in combination with the circumstances of the case, of ruling out plausible alternative explanations for those aspects.\nIt follows that evidence that confirms one material aspect of a statement is not necessarily admissible to establish the statements reliability with respect to its other material aspects. When evidence merely confirms one material aspect of a statement and no more, the support it provides for other material aspects derives entirely from the fact that it boosts the declarants credibility. This holds true regardless of the materiality of the aspect of the statement that is confirmed by the evidence. As established in Bradshaw, it is not sufficient for evidence to support the declarants credibility generally, and such evidence cannot be used to assess the admissibility of other aspects of the statement.\nOn the other hand, there may conceivably be situations in which several aspects of a statement are connected, such that evidence that demonstrates the truth or accuracy of one aspect is also capable of ruling out the possible explanations for the others. In such a case, the evidence is sufficiently  albeit indirectly  connected with those other aspects. Such evidence may then be of assistance in analyzing the statements admissibility with respect to all of those aspects.\nContrary to what my colleagues suggest, it is not a matter of adding a step that involves splitting up the evidence to the approach established in Bradshaw. Rather, that approach and its underlying logic are what require a connection between the evidence and each aspect of the statement that it is supposed to confirm. The Bradshaw framework serves to ensure that corroborative evidence is used only in cases where it bears on the aspect sought to be proved by adducing the statement. The requirement for a connection between the corroborative evidence and the aspect in question flows from the role that such evidence must play. Corroborative evidence must make it possible, given the circumstances of the case, to rule out plausible explanations other than the truth or accuracy of the material aspects of the statement (para. 57, point 4).\nWhile at first glance it may seem pedantic to deal with each material aspect separately, it is important to note that the Bradshaw criteria are designed to overcome the dangers posed by corroborative evidence. Where a statement does not have indicia of reliability of its own, then it can add nothing to a case, but it may appear to do so if it is consistent with other evidence. Admitting a hearsay statement only because it is consistent with other evidence treats it as a makeweight: the statement would be added to the other evidence even though its own weight actually depends entirely on that other evidence (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 167). Moreover, it can be difficult to control the length and complexity of the admissibility voir dire if the reliability of the hearsay statement derives from other evidence. Where the search for consistency is taken too far, the admissibility voir dire can easily become a time-consuming shadow trial (p. 167).\nKarakatsanis J. addressed these issues in developing the Bradshaw analytical framework. She explained that in order to preserve the distinction between threshold and ultimate reliability and to prevent the voir dire from overtaking the trial, it must be possible to distinguish between evidence that is admissible to establish threshold reliability and evidence that is admissible in the main trial (para. 42). Furthermore, [l]imiting the use of corroborative evidence as a basis for admitting hearsay also mitigates the risk that inculpatory hearsay will be admitted simply because evidence of the accuseds guilt is strong (para. 42). Indeed, [t]he stronger the case against the accused, the easier it would be to admit flawed and unreliable hearsay against him (para. 42). The particular role of corroborative evidence in the analysis of threshold reliability informs the limitations on its use:\n\tThe limited inquiry into corroborative evidence flows from the fact that, at the threshold reliability stage, corroborative evidence is used in a manner that is qualitatively distinct from the manner in which the trier of fact uses it to assess the statements ultimate reliability. As Lederman, Bryant and Fuerst explain, at the threshold reliability stage,\n\t[t]he use of corroborative evidence should be directed to the reliability of the hearsay. Certain items of evidence can take on a corroborative character and be supportive of the Crowns theory when considered in the context of the evidence as a whole. Such evidence relates to the merits of the case rather than to the limited focus of the voir dire in assessing the trustworthiness of the statement and is properly left to the ultimate trier of fact.\n\t(S. N. Lederman, A. W. Bryant and M. K. Fuerst, The Law of Evidence in Canada (4th ed. 2014), at 6.140)\n\t(Bradshaw, at para. 42)\nThe standard articulated in Bradshaw is the product of a line of jurisprudence that fluctuated between various ways of dealing with corroborative evidence at the threshold reliability stage. At one point, this Court had even banned the use of such evidence (see R. v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at paras. 215 and 217), before holding in 2006 that it can be part of the analysis in appropriate cases (see Khelawon, at para. 4). Care must therefore be taken to preserve the balance struck by Bradshaw between the flexibility required by the principled exception and protection against the risks posed by corroborative evidence. The Crowns position would undermine this balance; it would weaken a foundation of the Bradshaw approach, namely, the need to demonstrate a connection between the corroborative evidence and the material aspects of the statement.\nIn this case, the trial judge erred in finding that the statements truth as regards the location of the pistols corroborated the statement in its entirety. There is no connection, even an indirect one, between that evidence and the appellants degree of participation. The location of the pistols therefore cannot serve to show that threshold reliability is established through that aspect of the statement alone. Aside from establishing the truth of that aspect of the statement, that evidence is not capable of ruling out plausible alternative explanations for the events. For example, it cannot confirm that it was indeed the appellant and not K.A. who uttered threats against the complainant. As will be seen in the following section, such possible explanations are quite plausible given that it was in K.A.s interest to exaggerate the appellants responsibility.\nThe remaining issue is whether, given the limited role played by the evidence of the location of the pistols, the threshold reliability of the statement has been established.\nThreshold Reliability\nThe trial judge erred in principle by considering the location of the pistols to be evidence that corroborated the entire statement. As a result, there is no deference owed to his finding on threshold reliability (see Youvarajah, at para. 31; see also R. v. Mohamed, 2023 ONCA 104, 423 C.C.C. (3d) 308, at para. 37). The Court can therefore conduct its own analysis of this issue.\nThe Crown argues that the trial judge properly considered K.A.s interest in not being identified as the person who had used the weapon and uttered threats against the complainant. The combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances overcomes the specific dangers raised by the statement. It was a statement against K.A.s interest in more than one respect, and he even consented to a search at his residence.\nI disagree. In my opinion, the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the threshold reliability of the statement had been established. Like Bachand J.A., I am of the view that the trial judge should not have admitted the statement.\nK.A.s statement presents significant dangers. The majority of the Court of Appeal erred in ruling out the possibility that K.A. had an interest in minimizing his role in the events. At the time he made his statement, it was to K.A.s advantage to provide an account that limited his participation to possession of the weapons. Such an account allowed him to explain the presence of the weapons at his residence while avoiding the charges that involved a greater degree of participation.\nThe appellant correctly points out that because K.A. is an accomplice, his statement raises particular reliability concerns. In Youvarajah, Karakatsanis J. explained that [c]riminal law is generally and rightfully suspicious of allegations made by a person against an accomplice. It has long been recognized that evidence of one accomplice against another may be motivated by self-interest and that it is dangerous to rely on such evidence absent other evidence which tends to confirm it (para. 62). Indeed, the underlying rationale for the admissibility of admissions as against the party making them falls away when they are sought to be used against a third party (para. 59). This is especially true when the party making the admissions assumes less responsibility than they attribute to the third party, thus potentially facing less severe consequences than the third party (see Youvarajah, at para. 60; see also Bradshaw, at para. 92).\nThe risk referred to by Karakatsanis J. in Youvarajah is clearly present in this case. Although K.A. incriminated himself to some extent, he portrayed his own conduct as being much less serious than that of the appellant. As the Crown points out, it is true that K.A. described the incident as an immature joke, which tended to minimize the extent of the appellants responsibility. However, in doing so, K.A. did not assume any greater responsibility himself; instead, he played down the seriousness of the incident as such. The specific risk in this case is not that K.A. wanted to exaggerate the appellants involvement in the abstract, but rather that he did so with the aim of evading his own responsibility. In short, there is a very real danger that K.A. tried to shift his responsibility onto the appellant in his statement. Indeed, as the appellant notes, K.A.s statement places much of the responsibility on Fares and the appellant.\nIn the absence of external evidence confirming that the appellant played the primary role in the washroom, the circumstantial guarantees cannot overcome the dangers presented by K.A.s statement.\nAs is the case for the absence of leading questions (see R. v. Couture, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at paras. 100-101), the absence of inconsistent statements, promises of benefit or a criminal lifestyle simply points to an absence of factors that, if present, would have detracted from an otherwise trustworthy statement. Nothing in the factual context of this case suggests that these circumstances have a higher degree of trustworthiness in relation to the specific dangers arising from K.A.s statement.\nMoreover, some clarifications are required regarding the usefulness of the factors considered by the trial judge in the factual context of the case. The absence of a criminal lifestyle is not at all clear. On the contrary, K.A. indicated that he intended to sell the pistols on the black market with Fares. As for the presence of K.A.s mother, that circumstance is not actually an indicium of reliability, because it is possible that K.A. did not want his mother to know his degree of involvement, which could have motivated him to lie. Accordingly, it is instead a neutral factor. The temporal proximity between the statement and the events serves to mitigate the risk that K.A. did not have an accurate recollection of the events. However, this factor is not useful in assessing the specific danger raised by the statement, namely, that K.A. had incentive to lie.\nMy colleagues in dissent, citing para. 38 of R. v. L.T.H., 2008 SCC 49, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 739, refer to the fact that K.A. consulted counsel before making his statement. However, since one cannot speculate on the content of the discussions between K.A. and counsel, that consultation does not make it possible to exclude the risk that K.A. tried to minimize his responsibility. This risk is quite different from the reliability issues discussed by this Court at para. 38 of L.T.H., namely, false confessions by young people inclined to make a statement in order to end the pressure of interrogation or to please an authority figure and the need to ensur[e] that any statement given manifests the exercise of free will. Moreover, in L.T.H., the Court was dealing with s. 146(2)(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, a provision whose scope extends beyond simply consulting with counsel.\nNor are the indicia of procedural reliability reassuring. The usual substitutes for the traditional safeguards are absent. There was no recording of the statement or the interview that preceded it (of which the police investigator had only a limited recollection at the voir dire). K.A. was not under oath, and although he was read his rights, he was not given a warning by the investigators concerning the need to tell them the truth and the consequences associated with lying (see B. (K.G.), at pp. 795-96). In addition, since K.A. claimed to have no recollection of the events, the defence was deprived of any opportunity to cross-examine him. Yet some form of cross-examination is usually required to establish procedural reliability (Bradshaw, at para. 28).\nIn short, the indicia of reliability  whether substantive reliability, procedural reliability or both  do not support the admissibility of K.A.s out-of-court statement. It cannot be said that cross-examining K.A. at the time he made his statement to the police would have added little if anything to the process. There are many aspects of the statement that, without cross-examination, remain impossible to verify. For example, there is no way to verify that K.A. was not aware of the issues between the appellant and the complainant or that the pistols belonged to Fares. There remains a real concern regarding the truthfulness of the statement given the opportunity that K.A. had to minimize his responsibility and to exaggerate the appellants. The indicia of reliability do not rule out this possibility. Thus, the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances does not overcome the specific hearsay dangers raised by the . . . statement given by K.A., such that its only likely explanation . . . is [K.A.s] truthfulness about, or the accuracy of, the material aspects of the statement (Bradshaw, at para. 47 (emphasis in original)).\nUse of the Complainants Testimony in the Threshold Reliability Analysis\nThe Crown also argues that the complainants testimony corroborates K.A.s statement insofar as the appellants role is concerned, with the result that threshold reliability is established for that aspect of the statement. As discussed above, despite the fact that the complainant testified before the trial judge rendered his decision on the voir dire, his testimony was not part of the voir dire. In fact, the trial judge specifically asked the parties if all of the trial evidence would be tendered in the voir dire, and the defence refused to consent. The parties agreed that only K.A.s demeanour during his testimony would be considered. It was therefore clear that the complainants testimony would not form part of the threshold reliability analysis. Nevertheless, at the end of its analysis, the majority of the Court of Appeal wrote that the [translation] striking similarity between the complainants testimony and K.A.s statement tended to confirm that the statement was sufficiently reliable to be admissible (para. 71). According to the Crown, this Court should also consider that evidence in analyzing threshold reliability, despite the fact that it was not formally tendered in the voir dire.\nThis position must be rejected.\nOn appeal, the only possible avenue for considering the complainants testimony is the curative proviso. However, the Crown chose not to invoke that provision before this Court. In any event, as the dissenting judge noted, the trial judge expressly referred to K.A.s statement in his findings concerning the appellants guilt. It therefore cannot be concluded that the trial judges admission of the statement was a harmless or trivial error. Nor is it clear that the evidence pointing to the guilt of the accused is so overwhelming that any other verdict but a conviction would be impossible (see R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 31).\nAs a result, the Court of Appeal could not consider the complainants testimony in deciding the appeal, except in the context of the curative proviso. Furthermore, it is not necessary to decide the issue raised by the Crown regarding the self-contained nature of the voir dire at the trial stage. This issue raises concerns related to the particular function of the voir dire, notably the principle that the voir dire must not overtak[e] the trial (see Bradshaw, at para. 42) as well as procedural fairness. Given that the Court of Appeal dealt only in passing with the complainants testimony and that the appellant has not really addressed the self-contained nature of the voir dire in his factum, I will leave consideration of this issue for another day.\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and order a new trial.\n\tEnglish version of the reasons of Cote, Rowe and Kasirer JJ. delivered by\n\tCote and Kasirer JJ.  \nOverview\nWe have had the benefit of reading the reasons of our colleague Moreau J. With respect for our colleagues views, and substantially for the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal, Doyon and Cournoyer JJ.A., we are of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed (2022 QCCA 1013, 82 C.R. (7th) 373). We agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that there is no reviewable error in the trial judges decision to admit K.A.s out-of-court statement into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay.\nIn support of his appeal to this Court, the appellant invites us to adopt the position of the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal on this issue. The dissenting judge found that the trial judge erred in relying on evidence that only partially corroborated the material aspects of K.A.s statement to assess the admissibility of the statement as a whole. The dissenting judge also held that the trial judge committed an error in principle in considering circumstances which had only very relative weight.\nThe respondent adopts the explanations provided by the majority of the Court of Appeal on these two points. The respondent also notes the following comment made by the majority in the second last paragraph of its reasons: [translation] Finally, it is difficult to ignore the striking similarity between the victims testimony and the statement by K.A., who obviously did not discuss the content of his statement with the victim, which tends to confirm that the hearsay evidence was sufficiently reliable to be admissible (para. 71). According to the respondent, the Court of Appeal could validly consider the complainants testimony at trial, which was given before the closing of the voir dire but was not produced on it.\nWe agree with the respondent that the two grounds raised by the appellant are without merit. However, on the question of the self-contained nature of the voir dire, we agree with the conclusion of our colleague Moreau J. First, the curative proviso is the appropriate mechanism for considering, on appeal, evidence admitted at trial that was not produced on the voir dire, like the complainants testimony in this case (para. 4). Second, it is not necessary for this Court to address, in the context of this appeal, the distinct question of the self-contained nature of the voir dire at the trial stage (at para. 79), especially since the appellant himself rightly recognizes that the majoritys comment was an obiter dictum, made as a passing remark, regarding a question that was not raised at first instance.\nAnalysis\nBefore we begin the analysis, it is appropriate to identify the applicable standard of review, a point on which the parties agree. In itself, the question of whether a statement may be introduced into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay is a question of law, which is reviewable on a standard of correctness on appeal (see R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 23; R. v. Youvarajah, 2013 SCC 41, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 720, at para. 31). However, the findings of fact made by the trial judge are entitled to deference. Similarly, absent an error in principle, the trial judges determination of threshold reliability is entitled to deference (Youvarajah, at para. 31; see also R. v. Couture, 2007 SCC 28, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 517, at para. 81).\nHaving articulated the applicable standard of review, we must now examine the parties respective arguments.\nConsideration of the Search Results in the Assessment of Threshold Reliability\nRelying in particular on R. v. Bradshaw, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865, the appellant argues that the search results cannot, in this case, constitute evidence which is relevant to the substantive reliability inquiry. He agrees with the dissenting judge that the trial judge erred in considering the search results in the assessment of threshold reliability because that evidence [translation] was irrelevant to the threshold reliability analysis with respect to K.A.s assertion as to the appellants conduct and comments during the incident in the washroom (C.A. reasons, at para. 35).\nWe disagree.\nThe appellant was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm in the commission of an assault and uttering threats. Doyon and Cournoyer JJ.A. rightly pointed out that at the time of the voir dire on the admissibility of K.A.s statement, the appellant had not yet testified on the merits and nothing had been admitted. The Crown therefore had to prove all of the essential elements of each offence beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal was thus correct to point out that it [translation] was . . . necessary to demonstrate both the appellants participation and the use of a weapon and that, [b]y demonstrating the presence of a weapon at the witnesss residence, the evidence confirmed its existence and corroborated the witnesss account of the appellants use of a weapon, a weapon that he himself had given him (para. 58). In other words, since the handling of a weapon necessarily implies the presence of a weapon, it follows that proof of the handling of the weapon by the appellant requires proof of the presence of the weapon. Given the charges laid and the burden they entailed for the prosecution, there is indeed a logical connection between the aspect of the statement pertaining to the presence of the weapon in the washroom, corroborated by the discovery of the weapon at K.A.s residence, and the aspect of the statement pertaining to the handling of that same weapon by the appellant at the same time and in the same location. While K.A.s statement does evince the aforementioned material yet distinct aspects, they are logically intertwined.\nSuch a logical connection makes it possible, in the assessment of threshold reliability, to consider corroborative evidence that does not relate to all of the material aspects of a statement. Evidence of this nature generally cannot suffice, on its own, to establish threshold reliability. Our Court has previously held that this threshold can then be met through the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances that constitute indicia of reliability (see Bradshaw, at paras. 44, 47 and 57).\nThe Manitoba Court of Appeal was therefore correct in concluding in R. v. Hall, 2018 MBCA 122, [2019] 1 W.W.R. 612, that the . . . submission that substantive reliability requires the existence of corroborative evidence on all material aspects of the hearsay statement must be rejected (para. 85). In such a case, threshold substantive reliability may be established by the combined effect of the corroborative evidence and the circumstances that constitute indicia of reliability, as those circumstances make remedying the insufficiency of the corroborative evidence possible (see Hall, at paras. 82-85; R. v. Burns, 2016 SKCA 67, 337 C.C.C. (3d) 523, at para. 30; R. v. Allary, 2021 SKCA 110). As the majority of the Court of Appeal in our case pointed out (at para. 53), this approach reflects the inherent flexibility of the principled exception (see, in particular, R. v. U. (F.J.), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764, at para. 35; R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 45).\nIn this context, and with respect for the opinion of the dissenting judge, we agree with the majority that the dissenting judge erred in limiting the value of the corroborative evidence to only one of the two material aspects of the statement, despite the fact that they were nevertheless logically intertwined. The majority stated the following on this issue:\n\t[translation] We disagree with our colleague, who is of the opinion that this corroboration can confirm only the second aspect of the statement, and not the first aspect, which concerns the appellants participation. Evidence cannot be split up in this manner to limit its corroboration to one material aspect at the expense of the other. At that stage of the trial, the scope of the statement was much broader than that described by our colleague, and the discovery of a weapon, according to the judge, corroborated the entire statement. We see no error in that reasoning. [para. 59]\nSince the corroborative evidence at issue is logically connected to the two aspects of the statement, it is not necessary to address the distinct question of whether, when a statement has several material aspects that are not interconnected, the trial judge must carry out a global analysis of the statement or examine each of its material aspects separately (see C.A. reasons, at paras. 30-34, 56-57 and 59).\nAs we need not decide this question, we will only comment briefly on this point.\nFirst, even though this Court, when it rendered its decision in Bradshaw, was mindful of the fact that a statement may have several material aspects, it did not see fit to include the splitting up of the statement in the steps of the approach that the trial judge must take when assessing the admissibility of an out-of-court statement under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay (see para. 57). This strongly suggests that it is not for the trial judge to split up the evidence.\nSecond, we are of the view that it is for the trier of fact to give credit to certain aspects of a statement and not to others. This seems to be the best way to respect the separation between the role of trial judge  responsible for questions of law  and the role of trier of fact  responsible for factual determinations  which rests on the essential distinction between threshold reliability and ultimate reliability (see Bradshaw, at para. 39; Khelawon, at para. 50). It is solely for the trial judge to decide whether a hearsay statement is sufficiently reliable to justify its admissibility. If so, the trial judge must leave it to the trier of fact to assess its probative value in light of the evidence as a whole (S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at 6.147).\nIn view of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial judge made no reviewable error in taking the discovery of the weapons into account as corroborative evidence. Respectfully, it is rather the analysis of the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal that is tainted by the error that led him to exclude the search results.\nConsideration of Certain Circumstances in the Assessment of Threshold Reliability\nThe appellant argues that the trial judge committed an error in principle which tainted his finding that threshold reliability was established in this case. The appellant claims that this error was committed in weighing the circumstances relating to threshold reliability. In that weighing exercise, the trial judge allegedly failed to distinguish the circumstances that provided a true circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness from those that had only relative weight, contrary to the teachings of Bradshaw and Couture. In the appellants opinion, the dissenting judge correctly stated that the trial judge [translation] relied mainly on circumstances identical or similar to those that the Supreme Court considered as having very relative weight in [Couture and Bradshaw], without ever mentioning that they could play at the most a secondary role in the threshold reliability analysis (C.A. reasons, at para. 42 (footnote omitted)). The dissenting judge found that [translation] [t]he possibility that [the trial judge] gave them too much weight is therefore real (para. 42).\nThe appellant is mistaken.\nIt appears from the passages of the Court of Appeals decision quoted above that the dissenting judge did not identify any error in principle, but instead used the presence of factors of relative weight as a basis for conducting his own examination of the circumstances. With respect, this is not permitted by the standard of review applicable to the assessment of threshold reliability, which, as noted, is entitled to deference on appeal (Youvarajah, at para. 31; Couture, at para. 81).\nIt is well established that the relevance of the circumstances depends on the specific dangers associated with the hearsay in question and thus on the facts of the case (see Khelawon, at paras. 45 and 55; Youvarajah, at para. 21). That being so, it would be wrong to categorize, objectively and independently of the facts of the case, the circumstances that are neutral or secondary and those that are more important. This is therefore not a process that the trial judge is required to undertake.\nIt is true that, in Bradshaw, this Court stated that circumstances that . . . in essence simply point to an absence of factors that, if present, would detract from an otherwise trustworthy statement . . . do not provide a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness (Bradshaw, at para. 92, quoting Couture, at para. 101). It must not be forgotten, however, that, in the same paragraph, this Court acknowledged that those circumstances are relevant. In the words of the majority of the Court of Appeal in the present case, while such circumstances are not sufficient on their own to establish threshold reliability, [translation] the fact remains that such circumstances, considered in conjunction with others (for example, corroboration even insufficient on its own), may lead to the conclusion that the statement has all the attributes required for acceptable threshold reliability (para. 62). This reading of Bradshaw is also consistent with R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, where this Court found that the absence of any reason to expect fabrication in the statement was relevant to the analysis (p. 547).\nIn the absence of an error in principle that tainted the analysis at first instance, the majority was correct in finding that the trial judges decision was owed deference by the Court of Appeal. It is thus neither necessary nor appropriate for us to repeat the analysis of the circumstances.\nOn this point, and with all due respect, we note only that the dissenting judge seems to have committed two errors in his analysis of the circumstances. First, contrary to what his reasons suggested at para. 38, Bradshaw does not impose a rigid rule that substantive reliability is always subject to a high threshold; it merely recognizes that the greater the risk posed by the statement in light of the facts of the case, the greater the guarantees of trustworthiness required to rule out that risk (see R. v. Larue, 2018 YKCA 9, 434 D.L.R. (4th) 155, at paras. 99-101, affd 2019 SCC 25, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 398; R. v. Bernard, 2018 ABCA 396, 80 Alta. L.R. (6th) 258, at para. 24). Second, [translation] the fact that the declarant received advice from a relative or counsel before making their statement is not a circumstance that simply point[s] to an absence of factors that, if present, would detract from an otherwise trustworthy statement (C.A. reasons, at para. 39, citing Bradshaw, at para. 92). In R. v. L.T.H., 2008 SCC 49, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 739, at para. 38, this Court expressly recognized that s. 146(2)(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, which deals with, among other things, the right of a young person to consult counsel and certain adults whom the young person trusts, [is] indeed meant to ensure the reliability of a statement. In our opinion, the involvement of the relative or counsel achieves this objective in particular by ensuring that the declarant understood the gravity of the situation and their obligation to tell the truth (see C.A. reasons, at para. 64, citing L.T.H., at para. 38). The fact that K.A. spoke with counsel, the fact that his mother accompanied him when he made his statement and the fact that his mother was made aware of the tenor of K.A.s rights are therefore indicia of reliability that the trial judge could validly consider.\nConsideration of the Complainants Testimony at Trial, Which Was Not Produced on the Voir Dire\nThe respondent argues that the majority of the Court of Appeal could validly consider the complainants testimony at trial, which was given before the closing of the voir dire but which was not produced on it (see C.A. reasons, at para. 71). Our colleague Moreau J. is of the view that [o]n appeal, the appropriate mechanism for considering the complainants testimony is the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (para. 4). We agree.\nGiven the state of this Courts jurisprudence, we recognize that the distinct question of the self-contained nature of the voir dire at the trial stage is an open one. We also take due note, however, that this question was not raised by the appellant in support of his appeal and that, according to him, it was not raised before the trial judge. The appellant is of the view  and rightly so  that the majoritys comment is an obiter. The question is moot in the present appeal given that neither party challenges before us the trial judges decision to not consider the complainants testimony, a decision that was, we might add, made in accordance with the parties wishes.\nIn the circumstances, we agree with our colleague Moreau J. that caution must be exercised: this appeal is not an appropriate one for dealing with the issue of the limits of the self-contained nature of the voir dire at the trial stage.\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.\n\tAppeal allowed, Cote, Rowe and Kasirer JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Emmanuelle Rheault, Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, Montreal.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Sets Aside Convictions in R. v. Charles Due to Erroneous Admission of Hearsay Evidence.\n\nThis appeal concerns the admissibility of an out-of-court statement by a Crown witness, K.A., during the trial of the appellant, Yves Caleb Jr. Charles, and whether it meets the twin criteria of necessity and threshold reliability under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay.\n\nThe complainant testified that he had been threatened by the appellant in a school washroom using a fake pistol. Two other students, including K.A., were present at the time. The next day, K.A. was arrested and questioned by police investigators in the presence of his mother and after consulting with counsel. He provided a written statement admitting possession of two pellet pistols belonging to another student, Fares. However, at trial, K.A. claimed to have no recollection of the events, leading the Crown to seek the introduction of his out-of-court statement into evidence through a voir dire.\n\nThe trial judge admitted K.A.'s statement into evidence under the principled exception to the rule against hearsay. The appellant was found guilty on all counts. On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal (QCCA), a majority upheld the trial judge's decision to admit K.A.'s statement into evidence. However, upon further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), the Court allowed the appellant's appeal, quashing his convictions and ordering a new trial.\n\nA critical legal principle established in this case is that corroborative evidence must have a logical connection with each material aspect it seeks to confirm, rather than merely supporting general credibility or guilt. In determining whether corroborative evidence can be used under principle exceptions when it does not relate directly to all material aspects within said statement, one must assess if other related elements provide sufficient connections between them so as to establish trustworthiness via indirect means.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Moreau held that the trial judge erred in admitting the witness's out-of-court statement into evidence under the principled exception to the hearsay rule. The majority found that the search results did not meet the criteria for corroborative evidence set out in R. v. Bradshaw, and that the circumstances surrounding the statement did not support a finding of threshold reliability. Furthermore, they held that relying on the complainant's testimony outside of the voir dire was improper. The decision emphasizes the importance of critically evaluating the reliability of out-of-court statements and ensuring that corroborative evidence is relevant to the specific material facts being proved.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial because of the erroneous admission of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement at trial.</strong>This appeal concerns  the admissibility in evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court statement made by a trial witness.Following an incident  involving the accused and the complainant at the school they attended, the  accused was charged with assault with a weapon, using an imitation firearm and  uttering threats. At trial, the complainant testified that he had entered a  washroom at the school and had felt something on his hip while washing his  hands. When he turned around, he saw that it was a pistol held by the accused,  being used to threaten him. Two other students were present at the time. One of  them, who testified at the accused\u2019s trial, claimed to have no recollection of  the events. The prosecution therefore requested a <em>voir dire</em>, seeking the admission into evidence of an out\u2011of\u2011court  statement given by that witness to the police investigators the day after the  events. A <em>voir dire</em> is a proceeding  held in the absence of the jury during a criminal trial to allow the judge to consider,  for example, the admissibility of evidence that a party wishes to present. The witness had  been questioned by the police investigators for about an hour and had provided  a written statement. Among other things, the witness admitted in his statement  that he was in possession of two pellet pistols. The police conducted a search  and recovered the pistols at the witness\u2019s residence. The trial judge admitted  the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement into evidence. The judge found that the  only likely explanation for the statement was its truthfulness as to its  material aspects, given the circumstances in which the statement was made and  the seizure of pistols, which the judge considered to be corroborative  evidence. Corroborative evidence is evidence that reinforces other evidence. Following the trial, the  accused was found guilty of the three charges. The judge accepted the  complainant\u2019s version of events, which was supported by a surveillance video  and the witness\u2019s statement. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the trial  judge\u2019s decision to admit the statement into evidence and dismissed the  accused\u2019s appeal. The Supreme  Court of Canada has allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Court  has also ordered a new trial. <strong>The out\u2011of\u2011court statement did not have the  indicia of reliability required to be admitted at trial.</strong>Writing for  the majority of the Court, Justice\u00a0Moreau\u00a0determined that the trial judge had erred  in finding that the witness\u2019s out\u2011of\u2011court statement had the required indicia  of reliability and in admitting the statement into evidence at trial. The  results of the search subsequently conducted at the witness\u2019s residence do not  meet the criteria for corroborative evidence laid down by the Supreme Court in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16702/index.do\">R.  v. Bradshaw</a></em>. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the statement do  not support a finding that threshold reliability is established. Finally, the  majority of the Court of Appeal should not have relied on the complainant\u2019s  testimony, given outside of the <em>voir dire</em>,  to hold that the threshold reliability of the witness\u2019s statement was  established.

B-3, s. 178(1)(a), (e).\n\tBetween 2007 and 2009, the bankrupts engaged in market manipulation that caused vulnerable investors to lose millions of dollars. The British Columbia Securities Commission found that the bankrupts had contravened the provinces Securities Act. It ordered the bankrupts to pay $13.5 million in administrative penalties; it also ordered them to disgorge approximately $5.6 million, which represented the amounts they obtained as a result of the market manipulation scheme. These sanctions were registered with the Supreme Court of British Columbia pursuant to the Securities Act, which provides that, on being filed in a registry of that court, a decision of the Commission has the same force and effect, and all proceedings may be taken on it, as if it were a judgment of that court.\n\tSection 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act sets out a specific list of debts that are not released by an order of discharge and that therefore survive bankruptcy. Relying on some of these exceptions, the Commission applied for a declaration that the amounts owed to it by the bankrupts, who remain undischarged, not be released by any order of discharge. The chambers judge allowed the application, finding that the exceptions in s. 178(1)(a)  any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine, penalty or restitution order, imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail  and in s. 178(1)(e)  any debt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation  both applied and that the bankrupts debts were exempt from and would survive any discharge. The bankrupts appealed. According to the Court of Appeal, the debts were not exempt from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a) because the Commissions decisions could not be said to have been imposed by a court as required by the provision. However, the court upheld the chambers judges conclusion that both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders were exempt under s. 178(1)(e). Given that the debts were still exempt, the appeal was dismissed.\n\tHeld (Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Cote, Rowe, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: Neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders are exempt from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a). The words imposed by a court in s. 178(1)(a) do not capture orders made by administrative tribunals or regulatory agencies, such as the Commission, that are subsequently registered as judgments of a court. In addition, the administrative penalties do not come within the exception in s. 178(1)(e), as they did not result directly from the fraudulent scheme; rather, they arose indirectly as a result of the Commissions decision to sanction the bankrupts. The disgorgement orders, however, are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception because there is a direct link between them and the bankrupts fraudulent conduct. Therefore, they will not be released by any possible future order of discharge.\n\tFor a debt to survive bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(a), the creditor must establish that the debt is (1) a fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature, (2) imposed by a court, and (3) imposed in respect of an offence. This provision is not restricted to penalties associated with criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. However, the word court does not capture administrative tribunals or regulatory bodies. If Parliament had wanted fines, penalties, restitution orders or other orders similar in nature imposed by regulatory bodies, administrative tribunals or other administrative decision makers to be exempt from discharge under this section, it could have said so expressly. Moreover, this provision cannot be read so broadly as to include fines imposed by tribunals that are registered in a court. The registration of a decision with a court does not change the fact that it was made and imposed by an administrative decision maker, nor does it overcome the requirement that the exempt debt be imposed by a court. When a decision is registered with a court, the courts involvement is passive, whereas the act of imposing a fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature requires that the court be actively involved in making the decision. In the instant case, the administrative penalties and disgorgement orders were imposed by the Commission, not by a court, and therefore are not captured by s. 178(1)(a).\n\tFor a debt or liability to survive bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(e), the creditor must establish three elements: (1) false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation; (2) a passing of property or provision of services; and (3) a link between the debt or liability and the fraud. To establish the first requirement, the onus is on the creditor to prove that the debts or liabilities were obtained as a result of the debtors false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation. A court cannot take judicial notice of fraud, nor can it infer fraud in a cursory manner. When a party relies on the findings and conclusions of an administrative decision maker to establish that the debtor made a fraudulent statement, the court must still make its own determination based on a review of the record, even where the administrative findings of fraud are express. The evidence tendered to prove fraud or dishonesty must be clear and cogent and courts must be consistent and rigorous in assessing the evidence presented to them in this regard. Even where all of the required findings for false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation have been expressly made by an administrative decision maker, a determination of whether the claim falls within one of the categories of non dischargeable claims must be made by a court. \n\tTo establish the second requirement, there must be a loss in the form of a transfer of property or delivery of services, as well as a debt or liability corresponding to that loss. Section 178(1)(e) does not require that the bankrupt be the recipient of the property of which a person was deprived. The property need not have been obtained, or retained, by the bankrupt and may have passed directly or indirectly from the person to a third party at the bankrupts direction or on his or her behalf. What is required is that the fraudulent misrepresentation induced a person to give the property to the bankrupt or someone associated with the bankrupt.\n\tTo establish the third requirement, the debt or liability must have been created as a result of false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation. This requires a direct link whereby only the debt or liability that represents the value of the property or services obtained by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation qualifies as non dischargeable. While in most cases, the claiming creditor will be the party directly victimized by the false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation, the wording of s. 178(1)(e) does not import a direct victim requirement. A creditor who is not a direct victim is thus not barred from bringing a claim under this section provided that the claim is the result of a person being deprived of property or services after having detrimentally relied on the debtors false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation.\n\tIn the instant case, the first s. 178(1)(e) requirement is met. The market manipulation was characterized as fraudulent by both the Commission and the chambers judge, because the bankrupts falsely and knowingly misrepresented the price of shares in order to turn a profit. The second requirement is also met, as the bankrupts obtained property or services as a result of their fraudulent misrepresentation. While some of the amounts obtained as a result of the market manipulation scheme were obtained indirectly, it is not necessary that the bankrupt directly obtain or retain the property for the s. 178(1)(e) exception to apply. The property may pass from a person or group of people (the deceived investors) to a third party (another participant) at the direction of the bankrupt.\n\tWith respect to the third requirement, it is not met in the case of the administrative penalties, which therefore do not survive a discharge from bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(e). A direct link between the debt or liability and the fraudulent conduct is required and it is only the value of the property or services obtained as a result of that conduct that is not released by an order of discharge. The debt represented by the Commissions administrative penalties did not result directly from the bankrupts fraudulent misrepresentation, but arose indirectly as a result of the Commissions decision to sanction them for having obtained property through deceitful statements to investors. If the exempt debt or liability is not restricted to the value of the property or services obtained by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation, then s. 178(1)(e) has the potential to capture debts or liabilities that are not the direct result of deceit.\n\tHowever, the Commissions disgorgement orders are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception and will not be released by any order of discharge. Where a person has not complied with a provision of the Securities Act, the Commission may order that person to pay to it any amount obtained as a result of the failure to comply. The disgorgement orders were made under the Securities Act and represent the value of the bankrupts fraud  the funds that they gained as a result of their market manipulation. There is therefore a direct link between the fraudulent conduct of the bankrupts and the Commissions disgorgement orders.\n\tPer Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. (dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed. Although there is agreement with the majority that the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders imposed by the Commission do not survive bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(a), both the disgorgement orders and the administrative penalties properly fall within the narrow scope of s. 178(1)(e) and should not be released by any order of discharge. They are both debts that originate from the bankrupts having obtained property by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentations. Both are monetary sanctions imposed because of, and thus resulting from, deceitful conduct that Parliament specifically sought to address.\n\tThere is disagreement with the majority regarding the scope of the causation requirement contemplated by the words resulting from in s. 178(1)(e) and the degree of link required between the debt and the deceitful behaviour. Just as s. 178(1)(e) does not require that there be an exact correlation between the person claiming the exemption and the victims of that deceitful conduct, it does not require that the quantum of the debt or liability be limited by the quantum of the property obtained as a result of that deceitful conduct. Such a requirement is unsupported by the jurisprudence, is not found in the text of the provision, and is inconsistent with the provisions central focus. The central focus is the deceitful conduct at the source of the debt or liability, not the exact gain derived thereby. \n\tA direct causation requirement does not mean that the debt or liability must be limited to the value of the property obtained; rather it means that where only part of a liability can be traced to deceitful conduct, but not the balance, only the part induced by fraudulent conduct will be exempt from discharge. Where a debt or liability is entirely caused by fraudulent conduct, such as punitive damages imposed to sanction the conduct, there is no reason to limit the application of s. 178(1)(e) only to the gain ultimately obtained by the bankrupt. The jurisprudence in fact overwhelmingly shows that punitive damages exceeding the value of the property obtained qualify for the exception as long as they directly result from the deceitful conduct targeted by s. 178(1)(e).\n\tIn the instant case, the amounts the Commission submits should survive discharge have as their only source or origin the bankrupts deceitful conduct. Both the disgorgement orders and the administrative penalties under the Securities Act are monetary sanctions for the unlawful conduct. Like punitive damages imposed at private law, the administrative penalties arise directly from the type of conduct that they sanction. To exclude administrative penalties on the basis that they have an element of general deterrence amounts to reading in an additional limitation that is found nowhere in the text of the provision, and is inconsistent with the purpose of the exception. \n\tParliament has determined that some bankrupts simply do not deserve to be free of particular debts, based on the nature of the conduct giving rise to those debts. It provided for many exceptions to the fresh start principle, in s. 178(1), that are focused not on the person claiming the exemption but on categories of specific wrongful conduct that give rise to debts that are not released. Section 178(1)(e) should ultimately be interpreted purposively so as to ensure that dishonest debtors do not benefit from their dishonesty. This purpose would surely extend to a decision of a securities commission, charged with enforcing securities laws in order to protect the interests of the public and promoting the integrity of the capital markets.\nCases Cited\nBy Cote J.\n\tApplied: Montreal (City) v.

B-3 (BIA), furthers two important purposes: the equitable distribution of a bankrupts assets among creditors and the bankrupts financial rehabilitation. Financial rehabilitation means that a debtor will be afforded a fresh start when appropriate. The fresh start principle is codified in s. 178(2) of the BIA; it allows a bankrupt to be released from outstanding debts at the end of the bankruptcy process. Thus, subject to reasonable conditions, the BIA permits an honest but unfortunate debtor to be freed from the burdens of indebtedness and to reintegrate into economic life.\nFinancial rehabilitation operates as the general rule, such that every provable claim is presumptively swept into the bankruptcy. However, it has its limits. Through s. 178(1) of the BIA, Parliament has enacted specific exceptions to this general rule. An order of discharge does not release the bankrupt from a claim captured by a s. 178(1) exception. Indeed, where an exception applies, the fresh start principle yields to certain overriding policy objectives which demand that such a claim survive a discharge from bankruptcy.\nThis appeal requires our Court to interpret two of these exceptions, codified in s. 178(1)(a) and (e) of the BIA. It arises in the context of the application of the British Columbia Securities Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418. Our Court must determine whether the administrative financial penalties and/or the disgorgement orders imposed by the respondent, the British Columbia Securities Commission (Commission), survive a discharge from bankruptcy under one of these exceptions.\nThe appellants, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian, are undischarged bankrupts. Between 2007 and 2009, the Poonians engaged in market manipulation that caused vulnerable investors to lose millions of dollars. The Commission found that the Poonians had contravened s. 57(a) (now s. 57(1)(a)) of the Securities Act. It ordered the payment of administrative penalties by both Mr. Poonian ($10 million) and Ms. Poonian ($3.5 million). The Commission also issued orders pursuant to s. 161(1)(g) of the Securities Act requiring Mr. Poonian to disgorge $1,319,167 as well as $1,126,260 jointly and severally with another participant, and requiring Ms. Poonian to disgorge $3,149,935. The disgorgement orders represent the amounts the Poonians obtained as a result of the market manipulation scheme.\nRelying on the exceptions set out in s. 178(1) of the BIA, the Commission applied for a declaration that the amounts owed to it by the Poonians not be released by any order of discharge. The question before our Court is whether the administrative penalties and/or the disgorgement orders imposed by the Commission can be characterized as either any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine, penalty or restitution order, imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail (s. 178(1)(a)) or any debt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation, other than a debt or liability that arises from an equity claim (s. 178(1)(e)). If so, they will not be released by any order of discharge and will survive bankruptcy.\nFor the reasons I explain below, I conclude that the administrative penalties imposed by the Commission do not fall within the exceptions set out in either s. 178(1)(a) or (e) and therefore do not survive a discharge from bankruptcy on those bases. I also conclude that the disgorgement orders imposed by the Commission do not fall within the s. 178(1)(a) exception and do not survive a discharge from bankruptcy on that basis. However, they are captured by s. 178(1)(e) and therefore will not be released by any possible future order of discharge.\nFacts\nOn August 29, 2014, the Commission found that the Poonians, together with a number of relatives, friends and acquaintances, had engaged in market manipulation, contrary to s. 57(a) of the Securities Act. The Poonians had acquired a majority position in a public oil and gas company called OSE Corp. (OSE) and had then increased the price of OSEs shares by various manipulations, including trades between themselves. Using pseudonyms and multiple nominee accounts, they had artificially inflated the share price from $0.10 to $0.17 per share to a high of near $2.00.\nThe Commission found that the Poonians, and those working with them in this scheme, had sold the overpriced OSE shares to investors with the assistance of an entity called the Phoenix Group. The Poonians had paid commissions to the Phoenix Group, which had in turn encouraged its clients, generally unsophisticated investors seeking to escape personal debt through investment in higher-yield vehicles, to purchase OSE shares at the artificially inflated prices.\nThe Commission described the scheme as serious misconduct and as elaborate, involving layers of deception to conceal the . . . participation [of the Poonians and their associates] in the manipulation (2015 BCSECCOM 96 (Sanctions Decision), at para. 17 (CanLII)). The Commission ordered the payment of administrative penalties by Mr. Poonian ($10 million) and Ms. Poonian ($3.5 million) (para. 96). The Commission later issued orders pursuant to s. 161(1)(g) of the Securities Act, which are commonly referred to as disgorgement orders. Mr. Poonian was ordered to disgorge $1,319,167 to the Commission and an additional $1,126,260 on a joint and several basis with another participant in the scheme, and Ms. Poonian was ordered to disgorge $3,149,935 (2018 BCSECCOM 160 (Reassessment Decision), at para. 85 (CanLII)). As a result, the Poonians together owe $19,095,362 (plus interest) to the Commission. These sanctions were registered with the Supreme Court of British Columbia pursuant to s. 163 of the Securities Act, which provides that, on being filed in a registry of that court, a decision of the Commission has the same force and effect, and all proceedings may be taken on it, as if it were a judgment of that court. The Poonians owe $4,335,252.60 to their next largest creditor, the Canada Revenue Agency.\nOn April 20, 2018, the Poonians made a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy. On February 13, 2020, they applied for discharge from bankruptcy, which the Commission and the Canada Revenue Agency opposed. The Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed the Poonians application on April 8, 2020, and they remain undischarged bankrupts.\nJudicial History\nSupreme Court of British Columbia, 2021 BCSC 555 (Crerar J.)\nThe Commission applied to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for a declaration that the debts represented by the administrative penalties and disgorgement orders not be released by any order of discharge, pursuant to s. 178(1)(a), (d) and (e) of the BIA. The chambers judge allowed the Commissions application, finding that the debts were exempt from and would survive any discharge. While only one exception had to apply for the debts not to be released, the chambers judge found that the exceptions in s. 178(1)(a) and (e) both applied.\nWith respect to s. 178(1)(a), the chambers judge rejected the Poonians argument that it applies only to fines, penalties or restitution orders imposed in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. He noted that the inclusion of the words restitution order in s. 178(1)(a) implies that the scope of this provision extends beyond monetary orders imposed in a criminal or quasi-criminal context. The chambers judge also rejected the Poonians argument that an order of the Commission that is subsequently registered with a court is not an order imposed by a court, as required by s. 178(1)(a). According to the chambers judge, both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders could be characterized as fines, penalties, restitution orders or other orders similar in nature that had been imposed by a court in respect of an offence. On this basis, he ordered that they not be released on discharge from bankruptcy.\nAs for s. 178(1)(e), the chambers judge agreed with the Commission that the Poonians market manipulation, particularly the multi-party elaborate scheme they had orchestrated, was at its core a fraudulent misrepresentation and false pretence. He held that, through that scheme, the Poonians had obtained property in the form of millions of dollars and that, in doing so, they had engaged in deceitful conduct, which he deemed the essence of s 178(1)(e) (para. 105 (CanLII)). The chambers judge concluded that the Poonians market manipulation and knowing exploitation of vulnerable investors, which corrodes public confidence in securities markets, were evidence of the deceit lying at the heart of s. 178(1)(e). As a result, the administrative penalties and disgorgement orders were also exempt from discharge under s. 178(1)(e).\nThe Commission argued in the alternative that the disgorgement orders (but not the administrative penalties) should be exempt under s. 178(1)(d). However, in light of his conclusion that both the disgorgement orders and the administrative penalties were exempt under s. 178(1)(a) and (e), the chambers judge declined to consider this alternative ground. No further arguments were made in respect of s. 178(1)(d), either before the British Columbia Court of Appeal or before our Court.\nBritish Columbia Court of Appeal, 2022 BCCA 274, 65 B.C.L.R. (6th) 213 (Harris, Willcock and Fenlon JJ.A.)\nThe Poonians appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, challenging the chambers judges interpretation of the BIA. They also argued that the chambers judge had erred in adopting and following the rationale in Alberta Securities Commission v. Hennig, 2020 ABQB 48, 8 Alta. L.R. (7th) 177, a decision later reversed by the Alberta Court of Appeal (2021 ABCA 411, 34 Alta. L.R. (7th) 219). Justice Willcock, writing for the British Columbia Court of Appeal, held that the chambers judge had erred in concluding that the debts were exempt from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a) of the BIA. However, he upheld the chambers judges conclusion that the debts were exempt under s. 178(1)(e). Given that the debts were exempt, albeit only under s. 178(1)(e), the appeal was dismissed.\nJustice Willcock agreed with the chambers judge that s. 178(1)(a) is not limited to monetary orders imposed in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. However, he disagreed that a decision of the Commission that is merely registered with the Supreme Court of British Columbia can be considered an order imposed by a court. Once the Commissions decisions are registered with the court, they can be enforced as if they were judgments of the court, but they cannot be said to be imposed by the court. The Commissions penalties and disgorgement orders therefore did not fall within the s. 178(1)(a) exception.\nJustice Willcock upheld the chambers judges conclusion that the Commissions administrative penalties and disgorgement orders came within the s. 178(1)(e) exception. He held that the Poonians debts had arisen from obtaining property, in the form of millions of dollars, by fraudulent misrepresentation, that is, through their market manipulation.\nIn Hennig, the Alberta Court of Appeal held that [t]he required link between the fraudulent statement and the debt is established only if the debtor makes the fraudulent statement to the creditor relying on s 178(1)(e) (para. 78). Under this approach, the Poonians would have had to make their fraudulent misrepresentation to the Commission itself. The s. 178(1)(e) exception would not be applicable, because the Poonians fraudulent misrepresentation was made not to the Commission but rather to the victim investors.\nJustice Willcock rejected the narrow approach adopted by the Alberta Court of Appeal in Hennig. Instead, he concluded that s. 178(1)(e) is not restricted to cases in which the bankrupt made a fraudulent statement to the specific creditor relying on this provision. The Commission was therefore permitted to invoke s. 178(1)(e). Justice Willcock concluded that both the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders imposed by the Commission were non-dischargeable debts under s. 178(1)(e), because they had arisen from the Poonians having obtained property by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation.\nIssues\nThis appeal raises two issues:\nDo the Commissions administrative penalties and disgorgement orders against the Poonians constitute debts falling within s. 178(1)(a) of the BIA, such that they are not released by an order of discharge and therefore survive bankruptcy?\nDo the Commissions administrative penalties and disgorgement orders against the Poonians constitute debts or liabilities falling within s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA, such that they are not released by an order of discharge and therefore survive bankruptcy?\nAnalysis \nGeneral Principles Governing the Discharge of a Bankrupt\nThe proper interpretation of the BIA requires the acceptance of the principle that every claim is swept into the bankruptcy and that the bankrupt is released from all of them upon being discharged unless the law sets out a clear exclusion or exemption (Schreyer v. Schreyer, 2011 SCC 35, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 605, at para. 20). This general rule is codified in s. 178(2), which states that [s]ubject to subsection (1), an order of discharge releases the bankrupt from all claims provable in bankruptcy. The purpose of s. 178(2) is to give effect to one of the goals underlying the BIA regime  the financial rehabilitation of the debtor  by releasing the bankrupt from all claims provable in bankruptcy (Alberta (Attorney General) v. Moloney, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para. 77). Through discharge, the honest but unfortunate debtor is given a fresh start and is provided with relief from the weight of oppressive indebtedness (Moloney, at para. 77, citing L. W. Houlden, G. B. Morawetz and J. Sarra, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada (4th ed. rev. (loose-leaf), at p. 1-2.1; J. D. Honsberger and V. W. DaRe, Honsbergers Bankruptcy in Canada (5th ed. 2017), at p. 478). This process also allows the discharged bankrupt to reintegrate into economic life so he or she can become a productive member of society (Moloney, at para. 36).\nWhile financial rehabilitation is an important goal of the BIA, it has its limits. These limits are set out in both ss. 172 and 178(1) of the BIA (Moloney, at para. 37). Section 172 provides that an order of discharge may be granted, refused, its operation may be suspended, or it may be granted subject to conditions. Section 178(1) lists specific debts that are not released by discharge and that survive bankruptcy. These provisions demonstrate Parliaments attempt to balance financial rehabilitation with other policy objectives, such as confidence in the credit system, that require certain debts to survive bankruptcy (Moloney, at para. 37, citing R. J. Wood, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law (2009), at pp. 273 and 289). Both of these sections play a distinct and crucial role in the discharge process. I address each of them in turn.\nSection 172: Court May Grant or Refuse Discharge\nSection 172 of the BIA addresses the discharge of a bankrupt. It establishes that, on the hearing of a bankrupts application for discharge, a bankruptcy court retains broad discretion to grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge, to suspend the operation of such an order for a specified time or to grant a conditional order of discharge. The BIA provides no guidance for the exercise of this discretion, aside from stating that a court must refuse an absolute discharge if any fact referred to in s. 173 is proven against the debtor (J. Sarra, G. B. Morawetz and L. W. Houlden, The 2024 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (2024), at  7:69). If a court finds that any fact referred to in s. 173 is proven, the bankrupts discharge must be refused, suspended or granted conditionally (s. 172(2)). Many of those facts bear directly on the bankrupts conduct and culpability, while others reflect standards of commercial morality (s. 173(1)(a) to (o); R. J. Wood, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law (2nd ed. 2015), at pp. 297-98). For example, ss. 172(2) and 173(1)(k) establish that a bankrupt who is guilty of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust is not entitled to an absolute discharge.\nA court has broad discretion under s. 172(1). In exercising that discretion, the court considers three factors: the interests of the creditors in obtaining payment of their claims, the interests of the bankrupt in obtaining relief from his or her financial obligations, and the integrity of the bankruptcy process (F. Bennett, Bennett on Bankruptcy (26th ed. 2024), at p. 737, citing Shakell, Re (1988), 70 C.B.R. (N.S.) 270 (Ont. S.C.J.); Phenix, Re (1989), 76 C.B.R. (N.S.) 82 (Sask. Q.B.)).\nSection 178(1): Debts Not Released by Order of Discharge\nSection 178(1) sets out a specific list of debts that are not released by an order of discharge and that therefore survive bankruptcy (Moloney, at para. 37). These debts are non-discretionary exceptions to the general rule and represent the kind of claims that society, through Parliament, considers to be of a quality that outweighs any possible benefit in the bankrupt being relieved of them (Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  7:185, citing Jerrard v. Peacock (1985), 37 Alta. L.R. (2d) 197 (Q.B.)).\nThe exceptions in s. 178(1)(a) through (h) must be interpreted narrowly and applied only in clear cases (Montreal (City) v. Deloitte Restructuring Inc., 2021 SCC 53, at para. 25; Korea Data Systems (USA), Inc. v. Aamazing Technologies Inc., 2015 ONCA 465, 126 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 63). A narrow interpretation is required partly because courts have no discretion respecting their application: . . . the policy objective protected by the exception must, in all circumstances, trump the discharge of the bankrupt (H. Murray and H. Fisher, Youre Hot and Youre Cold, Youre Yes and Youre No: Conflicting Appellate Decisions Regarding Whether Regulators Fines, Penalties or Restitution Orders Survive Bankruptcy, in J. Corraini and D. B. Nixon, eds., Annual Review of Insolvency Law 2022 (2023), 569, at p. 618; J. Girgis and T. G. W. Telfer, Do Securities Commission Debts Survive a Bankruptcy Discharge? An Analysis of Poonian v. British Columbia (Securities Commission) (BCCA) (2023), 67 Can. Bus. L.J. 438 (Girgis and Telfer (2023)), at pp. 453-54). Section 178(1) is not a catchall of debts arising from morally objectionable conduct, but rather sets out categories of specific wrongful conduct that give rise to debts that are not released, and specifies the criteria to be applied (Shaver-Kudell Manufacturing Inc. v. Knight Manufacturing Inc., 2021 ONCA 925, 160 O.R. (3d) 205, at para. 39; see also A. Nocilla, Comment on Shaver-Kudell Manufacturing Inc. v Knight Manufacturing Inc. (2022), 45:2 Man. L.J. 177, at p. 187).\nThe s. 178(1) exceptions must also be interpreted narrowly because of the fact that the more claims that survive bankruptcy, the more difficult it becomes for a debtor to rehabilitate (Moloney, at para. 79; see also Schreyer, at para. 19; Martin v. Martin, 2005 NBCA 32, 282 N.B.R. (2d) 61, at para. 11). As a result, [w]here there is doubt as to whether a creditor falls within an exemption, the benefit should go to the bankrupt (Murray and Fisher, at p. 576, citing Jerrard, at p. 206).\nThe Poonians Application for Discharge Was Refused Under Section 172\nIn 2020, the Poonians applied for discharge under s. 172 (2020 BCSC 547, 78 C.B.R. (6th) 135 (Discharge Application reasons), affd 2021 BCSC 222, 86 C.B.R. (6th) 263, affd 2021 BCCA 417, 58 B.C.L.R. (6th) 276). Their application was opposed by the Commission and the Minister of National Revenue primarily on the basis that the fact referred to in s. 173(1)(a) was proven: the Poonians assets were not of a value equal to $0.50 on the dollar of the amount of their unsecured liabilities. The Commission and the Minister alleged that the Poonians precarious financial situation had arisen from circumstances for which the Poonians could justly be held responsible (para. 29).\nThe Supreme Court of British Columbia refused the Poonians application for an absolute discharge and held that it was impossible to conclude on these facts that the vast disparity between the Poonians assets and liabilities arose from circumstances for which they cannot justly be held responsible (Discharge Application reasons, at para. 53). The court also refused the Poonians application for a suspended discharge on the basis that granting such a discharge would be contrary to the public interest (para. 60). The court concluded that the circumstances of this case are extreme and that the pre-bankruptcy conduct of the Poonians requires the court to distance itself from their efforts to use the bankruptcy process to absolve themselves of the financial consequences of their actions (para. 69). As of the date of the hearing before our Court, the Poonians remained undischarged bankrupts. As demonstrated by their unsuccessful application for discharge, even if a claim does not fall within a s. 178(1) exception, a bankruptcy court still retains the discretion to refuse an order of discharge under s. 172.\nThe question before our Court is whether the Commissions administrative penalties and disgorgement orders can be characterized as debts not released by an order of discharge under one of the exceptions in s. 178(1). As the creditor, the Commission bears the onus of proving that its claims fall within one of the listed exceptions (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. v. Gray, 2014 ONCA 236, 119 O.R. (3d) 710, at para. 24). While the Poonians application for discharge under s. 172 failed, if the Commission succeeds in proving that its claims come under a s. 178(1) exception, this will mean that those claims cannot be released notwithstanding any future order of discharge the Poonians may seek.\nDo the Commissions Claims Fall Within the Section 178(1) Exceptions?\nSection 178(1)(a)\nFor a debt to survive bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(a), the creditor must establish that the debt is (1) a fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature, (2) imposed by a court, and (3) imposed in respect of an offence:\n178 (1) An order of discharge does not release the bankrupt from\n\n(a) any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine, penalty or restitution order, imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail;\nThis appeal raises two questions with respect to the proper interpretation of s. 178(1)(a). First, must the fines, penalties and orders referred to in this section be imposed in either a criminal or quasi-criminal context? Second, do the words imposed by a court capture orders that are initially imposed by an administrative tribunal but that are subsequently registered as judgments of a superior court?\nSection 178(1)(a) Is Not Limited to Orders Imposed in a Criminal or Quasi-Criminal Context\nIt is clear that the terms fine and penalty in s. 178(1)(a) include at least monetary penalties imposed as punishment for offences in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings (see Hennig (C.A.), at paras. 46-51; Air Canada, Re (2006), 28 C.B.R. (5th) 317 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 42; Chaytor, Re, 2006 BCSC 1742, 26 C.B.R. (5th) 574, at para. 38; Belair v. Gottschlich, 2008 ABQB 47, 89 Alta. L.R. (4th) 268, at para. 25; R. v. Manzioros, 2004 MBQB 121, 183 Man. R. (2d) 279, at para. 40; Chambre des notaires du Quebec v. Dugas, [2003] R.J.Q. 1, at para. 22; Simone v. Daley (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 511, at p. 522; Buland Empire Development Inc. v. Quinto Shoes Imports Ltd. (1999), 123 O.A.C. 288, at para. 19; D. Brochu, Precis de la faillite et de linsolvabilite (6th ed. 2022), at 31-5).\nThe chambers judge and Willcock J.A. both agreed that penalties imposed in a criminal or quasi-criminal context are clearly captured by s. 178(1)(a), but they found that this section is not limited to fines, penalties and restitution orders imposed in such a context. The chambers judge held that the inclusion of restitution orders, which do not seek to punish but rather to compensate and restore, implies a broader scope to s 178(1)(a) than criminal or quasi-criminal offences (para. 85). Justice Willcock agreed, holding that s. 178(1)(a) has occasionally been interpreted too narrowly in that respect (para. 39).\nLike the chambers judge and Willcock J.A., I am of the view that s. 178(1)(a) is not restricted to penalties associated with criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. The plain and ordinary meaning of s. 178(1)(a), a comparative reading of the English and French versions of this section, and the legislative history of the section all support this interpretation. While I have explained that the s. 178(1) exceptions must be interpreted narrowly, this interpretive principle does not have primacy over other principles of statutory interpretation that clearly support a particular meaning.\nAs a first remark, I note that the plain and ordinary meaning of s. 178(1)(a) quite simply does not limit this section to penalties imposed in a criminal or quasi-criminal context (see Vancouver (City) v. Alliston, 2003 BCPC 105, 47 C.B.R. (4th) 142, at paras. 19-20 and 22). In fact, this section employs very broad language. The English version of s. 178(1)(a) merely requires that the fine, penalty, restitution order or other order be in respect of an offence. The words in respect of are of the widest possible scope in conveying a link between related subject matters (Nowegijick v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29, at p. 39; Markevich v. Canada, 2003 SCC 9, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 94, at para. 26).\nThe English and French versions of s. 178(1)(a) are slightly different. Importantly, the words in respect of an offence in the English version are absent from the French version. The shared meaning rule for the interpretation of bilingual legislation dictates that the common meaning between the English and French legislative texts should be accepted (Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. v. Canada (Health), 2012 SCC 3, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 23, at para. 203, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 99 et seq., and M. Bastarache et al., The Law of Bilingual Interpretation (2008), at pp. 32 et seq.). The shared meaning rule points to a broader reading of s. 178(1)(a) that encompasses any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order that is imposed by a court. Under this interpretation, there is no indication that such an order needs to be imposed in a criminal or quasi-criminal context.\nNotwithstanding this difference between the English and French versions of s. 178(1)(a), I note that, in any event, the unqualified term offence is not necessarily restricted to a criminal or quasi-criminal context. Offences can also exist in a regulatory context; statutes outside of the criminal or quasi-criminal context frequently deem certain contraventions of their provisions to be offences (J. Swaigen and S. McRory, Regulatory Offences In Canada: Liability and Defences (2nd ed. 2018), at p. 9). Indeed, in this case, a contravention of s. 57 of the Securities Act is deemed to be an offence under s. 155(1)(b) of that Act.\nFurthermore, the legislative history of s. 178(1)(a) demonstrates that Parliaments intention has been to expand the scope of this section, not to restrict it. A previous version of this section, as it appeared from 1985 until 1992, read as follows:\n178 (1) An order of discharge does not release the bankrupt from\n\n(a) any fine or penalty imposed by a court or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail bond;\nIn 1992, An Act to amend the Bankruptcy Act and to amend the Income Tax Act in consequence thereof, S.C. 1992, c. 27, s. 64, widened the scope of s. 178(1)(a):\n64. (1) Paragraph 178(1)(a) of the said Act is repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n\n(a) any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine, penalty or restitution order, imposed by a court in respect of an offence, or any debt arising out of a recognizance or bail;\nParliament intentionally added this more expansive language to s. 178(1)(a). Interpreting this broad language as capturing only penalties imposed in a criminal or quasi-criminal context would run counter to Parliaments intent and would also render the words or other order similar in nature surplusage (C.A. reasons, at para. 41). It is a well-accepted principle that such an interpretation is to be avoided (R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 28; see further, R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  8.03).\nUltimately, if Parliament had intended to limit the application of this section to criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings, it could have done so more clearly. The fines, penalties, restitution orders and other orders that it exempts are not restricted to those imposed in a criminal or quasi-criminal context.\nThe Words Imposed by a Court Do Not Capture Orders Made by Administrative Tribunals That Are Subsequently Registered as Judgments of a Court\nFor a debt to survive bankruptcy pursuant to s. 178(1)(a), the creditor must establish that the debt is a fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature that was imposed by a court. There is some uncertainty about what constitutes a court for the purposes of s. 178(1)(a) and about what is meant by the term imposed.\nThe word court as it appears in s. 178(1)(a) is undefined. While this word is defined in s. 2 of the BIA, the definition specifically excludes s. 178(1)(a):\n2 In this Act, \n\n. . .\n\ncourt, except in paragraphs 178(1)(a) and (a.1) and sections 204.1 to 204.3, means a court referred to in subsection 183(1) or (1.1) or a judge of that court, and includes a registrar when exercising the powers of the court conferred on a registrar under this Act;\nSubsections 183(1) and (1.1) of the BIA refer to the superior courts of each province and territory. The exclusion of s. 178(1)(a) from the definition in s. 2 suggests that Parliament did not intend to limit the application of s. 178(1)(a) to fines, penalties or restitution orders made by superior courts (C.A. reasons, at para. 42). In this way, the s. 2 definition draws a distinction between a court administering the BIA process and other courts that may impose fines, penalties or restitution orders for the purposes of s. 178(1)(a) (J.R.B. v. Jimenez, 2018 ABQB 847, at para. 23 (CanLII)). Provincial courts, federal courts, appellate courts and this Court all fall within the meaning of court for the purposes of s. 178(1)(a) (see Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  1:26).\nHowever, the word court in s. 178(1)(a) does not capture administrative tribunals or regulatory bodies. The term court implies that a dispute will be adjudicated by a judge or judges (Blacks Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), at p. 444). By comparison, an administrative tribunal is [a] court-like decision-making authority that resolves disputes [or] an administrative agency exercising a quasi-judicial function (p. 1814). A regulatory agency can be defined as [a]n official body, esp. within the government, with the authority to implement and administer particular legislation (pp. 77-78 and 1538). Court refers to the judiciary, whereas administrative bodies are hybrid entities falling between the judiciary and government departments created to perform as separate bodies functions transferred from both (L. Sossin, Practice and Procedure Before Administrative Tribunals (loose-leaf), at  2:1).\nMoreover, for the purposes of s. 69.6 of the BIA, Parliament saw it fit to define the term regulatory body. While the definition is limited to that section and does not apply to s. 178(1)(a), the decision to set out a specific definition of regulatory body further confirms that Parliament intended these different terms  court and regulatory body  to be understood as having different meanings (Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 81; Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v. University of Calgary, 2016 SCC 53, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 555, at para. 53). Thus, the word court in s. 178(1)(a) does not include administrative bodies. If Parliament had wanted fines, penalties, restitution orders or other orders similar in nature imposed by regulatory bodies, administrative tribunals or other administrative decision makers to be exempt from discharge under s. 178(1)(a), it could have said so expressly.\nHaving defined the term court, I now consider what it means for a fine, penalty or order to be imposed by a court. The Commission argues that this language captures orders that are imposed by an administrative tribunal and that, once registered with a court, are deemed by statute to be enforceable as orders of that court (R.F., at para. 93). It argues that its disgorgement orders and administrative penalties fall within the ambit of s. 178(1)(a) of the BIA because, under s. 163(2) of the Securities Act, once a decision it has made is filed with the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the decision has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment of that court:\n163 (1)\tIf the commission has made a decision under section 161 or 162, or if the executive director has made a decision under section 161, the commission or the executive director, as applicable, may file the decision at any time in a Supreme Court registry by filing a certified copy of the decision.\n\n. . .\n\n(2)\tUpon filing, a decision referred to in subsection (1), (1.1) or (1.2) or a notice, order or decision referred to in subsection (1.01) has the same force and effect, and all proceedings may be taken on it, as if it were a judgment of the Supreme Court.\nThe effect of an administrative decision being registered with a court is that the creditor is able to use civil methods to enforce the decision as if it were a judgment of that court. The registration of the decision does not change the fact that it was made and imposed by an administrative decision maker, nor does it overcome the BIAs requirement that the exempt debt be imposed by a court (C.A. reasons, at para. 48; Hennig (C.A.), at para. 52). When a decision is registered with a court, the courts involvement is passive, whereas the act of imposing a fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature requires that the court be actively involved in making the decision (see Hennig (C.A.), at para. 52).\nJustice Willcock correctly concluded in this case that s. 178(1)(a) is broad enough to include at least fines, penalties and restitution orders imposed by courts other than the superior courts of the provinces, but cannot be read so broadly as to include fines imposed by tribunals that are registered in a court (para. 44).\nApplication of Section 178(1)(a) to the Commissions Orders\nThe Commissions Administrative Penalties Are Not Exempt From Discharge Under Section 178(1)(a)\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commissions argument that the administrative penalties it imposed on the Poonians are captured by the s. 178(1)(a) exception must fail. While the administrative penalties were imposed in respect of a statutory offence (Securities Act, ss. 57(a) and 155(1)(b)), they were not imposed by a court. They were imposed by the Commission  a regulatory agency.\nThe Commissions Disgorgement Orders Are Not Exempt From Discharge Under Section 178(1)(a)\nIn the same way, the Commissions disgorgement orders are not captured by s. 178(1)(a). The disgorgement orders were imposed by the Commission, not by a court.\nSection 178(1)(e)\nThe Commission also relies on the s. 178(1)(e) exception: \n178 (1) An order of discharge does not release the bankrupt from\n\n. . .\n\n(e) any debt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation, other than a debt or liability that arises from an equity claim;\nFor a debt or liability to survive bankruptcy pursuant to s. 178(1)(e), the creditor must establish three elements: (1) false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation; (2) a passing of property or provision of services; and (3) a link between the debt or liability and the fraud (Hennig (C.A.), at para. 57, citing McAteer v. Billes, 2007 ABCA 137, 409 A.R. 143, at para. 16).\nMy colleague Karakatsanis J. and certain courts have held that s. 178(1)(e) embodies a morality concep[t] which ensures that a deceitful wrongdoer will not be able to use the court system and the states bankruptcy provisions as a mechanism for avoiding the consequence of his or her actions (Cruise Connections Canada v. Szeto, 2015 BCCA 363, 78 B.C.L.R. (5th) 82, at para. 15; see also Jerrard, at p. 206; Bryant v. Benjamin, 2023 QCCA 1021, at para. 42 (CanLII); see Karakatsanis J.s reasons, at paras. 138-39). While I essentially agree that s. 178(1)(e) targets morally blameworthy conduct, I share the view stated by Professors Girgis and Telfer:\n. . . the common feature that underlies most cases interpreting section 178(1)(e), though sometimes imperfectly expressed, is the protection of creditors who have been victimized by deceitful statements. The case law in this area interprets this provision to target morally blameworthy conduct that gave rise to debt, not simply morally blameworthy conduct. [Emphasis added.]\n\n((2023), at p. 452; see also Shaver-Kudell, at para. 23.)\nThe Superintendent of Bankruptcy takes a similar view. Intervening on appeal, the Superintendent explains that s. 178(1)(e) is aimed at making fraud victims whole, rather than at preserving penalties imposed for deterrence purposes (I.F., at para. 18). By not releasing debts or liabilities that resulted directly from deceit, s. 178(1)(e) prevents debtors from profiting as a result of their wrongdoing (H.Y. Louie Co. v. Bowick, 2015 BCCA 256, 386 D.L.R. (4th) 117, at para. 47, per Newbury J.A., dissenting, but not on this point). I therefore disagree with my colleague that the central focus of s. 178(1)(e) is deceitful conduct, not the gain derived from that conduct (para. 126 (emphasis deleted)). I am of the view that in the interpretation of s. 178(1)(e), deceitful conduct and gain derived are two inextricably linked concepts.\nFurthermore, it is through s. 172 of the BIA that Parliament has entrusted bankruptcy courts with broad discretion to decide whether morally reprehensible conduct should prevent a bankrupt from being discharged. Bankrupts who are not honest but unfortunate are not discharged or only discharged if certain conditions are met. In contrast, the s. 178(1) exceptions are focused on excluding specific debts from being released by the order of discharge (Moloney, at para. 85). I therefore do not agree with my colleague that s. 178(1)(e)s intention [is] to preclude dishonest debtors from benefitting from their dishonesty (para. 139 (emphasis added)). As I have explained above, the intention behind this provision is more nuanced.\nIn Deloitte Restructuring, our Court interpreted s. 19(2)(d) of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, which is analogous in every respect to s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA (para. 24; 9354-9186 Quebec inc. v. Callidus Capital Corp., 2020 SCC 10, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 521, at para. 74; Century Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 SCC 60, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 379, at para. 78). Articulating the sections elements in a four-part test, our Court held as follows:\nTo discharge its burden of proving that its claim relates to a debt resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation, a creditor must establish on a balance of probabilities, the following four elements: (i) the debtor made a representation to the creditor; (ii) the representation was false; (iii) the debtor knew that the representation was false; (iv) the false representation was made to obtain property or a service . . . .\n\n(Deloitte Restructuring, at para. 25)\nThis test applies in determining whether the administrative penalties and disgorgement orders are exempt from discharge under s. 178(1)(e). Prior to applying this test to the Commissions administrative penalties and disgorgement orders, I provide some guidance on each of s. 178(1)(e)s three elements, which are reflected in, and form the basis of, the four-part Deloitte Restructuring test.\nAt the outset, I note that the first step of the Deloitte Restructuring test may appear to stand for the proposition that only the creditor who was directly victimized by the false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation may bring a claim under s. 178(1)(e). As I explain below, that is not the case.\nFalse Pretences or Fraudulent Misrepresentation\nThe terms false pretences and fraudulent misrepresentation are not defined in the BIA, but the case law has been unanimous in finding that deceitful statements are at the core of both (Shaver-Kudell, at paras. 5 and 42; see also C.A. reasons, at paras. 55 and 58-60; Hennig (C.A.), at para. 58; Cruise Connections, at para. 13; The Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Merenick, 2007 BCSC 1261, at para. 29 (CanLII); Buland Empire, at para. 14). For both concepts, the essential test . . . is that the property was obtained by deceit, whether by positive act or failure to disclose material facts (Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  7:199; see also Hennig (C.A.), at para. 112, per Pentelechuck J.A., concurring; Iroquois Falls Community Credit Union Ltd. (Liquidator of) v. Miljours (2009), 52 C.B.R (5th) 231 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 18).\nTo establish fraudulent misrepresentation for the purposes of s. 178(1)(e), courts have relied on the classic elements from the House of Lords decision in Derry v. Peek (1889), 14 App. Cas. 337, at p. 374 (Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  7:203; Wood, at p. 317; J. Girgis and T. G. W. Telfer, The Fraudulent Misrepresentation and False Pretences Exception to the Bankruptcy Discharge: Balancing the Debtors Fresh Start with Confidence in the Credit System, in Corraini and Nixon, eds., Annual Review of Insolvency Law 2022, 143 (Girgis and Telfer (2022)), at p. 154; Hennig (C.A.), at para. 58; Ste. Rose & District Cattle Feeders Co-op v. Geisel, 2010 MBCA 52, 255 Man. R. (2d) 45; Morris Bureau v. Darde, 2013 NSCA 121, 335 N.S.R. (2d) 378; Woolf v. Harrop (2003), 50 C.B.R. (4th) 309 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 71). These elements are as follows: (i) a representation was made; (ii) the representation was false; (iii) the representation was made knowingly, without belief in its truth (including with willful blindness or recklessness); and (iv) the creditor relied on the representation and turned over property to the debtor.\nAs for false pretences in s. 178(1)(e), courts have relied on s. 361(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, for a definition of this term (Shaver-Kudell, at paras. 26-28; Water Matrix Inc. v. Carnevale, 2018 ONSC 6436, 65 C.B.R. (6th) 109, at para. 63, affd 2016 ONCA 875). Section 361(1) states:\n361 (1) A false pretence is a representation of a matter of fact either present or past, made by words or otherwise, that is known by the person who makes it to be false and that is made with a fraudulent intent to induce the person to whom it is made to act on it.\nTherefore, it appears that the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation and false pretences are substantively the same, except that the definition of false pretence in s. 361(1) of the Criminal Code does not require detrimental reliance. However, given that s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA requires that property or services be obtained as a result of the fraudulent misrepresentation or false pretences, that difference is immaterial in this context (Girgis and Telfer (2022), at p. 154, citing Hennig (C.A.), at para. 58).\nJustice van Rensburg came to this same conclusion in Gray, noting that [i]rrespective of whether one considers fraudulent misrepresentation or false pretences, s. 178(1)(e) requires a finding that the bankrupt obtained property by such conduct (para. 31; see also Shaver-Kudell, at paras. 30 and 35; Hennig (C.A.), at para. 58). Most cases, when discussing s. 178(1)(e), treat fraudulent misrepresentation and false pretences as closely connected terms with the same requirements (Shaver-Kudell, at para. 35). As a result, the Deloitte Restructuring test does not distinguish between the terms false pretences and fraudulent misrepresentation. The overlap between the two terms ensures that debts or liabilities obtained by deceit that otherwise fulfill the s. 178(1)(e) elements are not discharged.\nThe onus is on the creditor to prove that the debts or liabilities were obtained as a result of the debtors false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation. A court cannot take judicial notice of fraud (B. Durnford, Recent Developments under Section 178(1)(a) and (e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act: A Case Study of Poonian v. British Columbia (Securities Commission) (2023), 12 J.I.I.C. 107, at p. 128; see also p. 123, citing Hennig (C.A.), at para. 70, citing Canada (Attorney General) v. Bourassa (Trustee of), 2002 ABCA 205, 6 Alta. L.R. (4th) 223), nor can a court infer fraud in a cursory manner (Deloitte Restructuring, at para. 21). A party cannot simply presume or assume that a claim resulted from a deceitful statement without proving the required elements (Deloitte Restructuring, at para. 26).\nThere are a number of ways in which a claimant can establish false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation for the purposes of s. 178(1)(e). The most straightforward is via a prior judgment that contains findings of fact to the effect that a debt resulted from false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation (Wood, at p. 313; Hennig (C.A.), at para. 62). Where a claimant has obtained a judgment that contains sufficient findings of fact, nothing else need be done (Wood, at p. 313; see also Bryant, at para. 69). If a judgment does not make express findings as to the necessary elements, it is open to the bankruptcy court to consider the pleadings that were available to the court that rendered a prior judgment, as well as the proceedings before that other court, in order to determine whether the elements can be established on the basis of those documents. A bankruptcy court can therefore look to the entire context of the proceedings in a previous action to determine whether the judgment debt can be characterized as one falling within the ambit of s. 178(1)(e) (Cruise Connections, at para. 29, citing H.Y. Louie, at paras. 87-88; see also Lawyers Professional Indemnity Co. v. Rodriguez, 2018 ONCA 171, 139 O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 33; Hennig (C.A.), at para. 62).\nHowever, even where findings possibly linked to fraud have been made in a previous trial or where a default judgment or a consent to judgment might have contained such findings, a court must generally make its own findings of fact in applying s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA (Deloitte Restructuring, at para. 29). Courts must be consistent and rigorous in assessing the evidence presented to them in this regard (para. 29; see also Pelletier v. CAE Rive-Nord, 2019 QCCA 2164, at paras. 13-19 (CanLII)). It follows that the evidence tendered to prove fraud or dishonesty must be clear and cogent (Sharma v. Sandhu, 2019 MBQB 160, at para. 26 (CanLII)).\nIn the case of a debt or liability resulting from a finding by an administrative tribunal, an application judge must make his or her own determination, based on a review of the record, as to whether the debt or liability falls within a s. 178(1) exception (Hennig (C.A.), at para. 63). Thus, even where all of the required findings for false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation have been expressly made by an administrative decision maker, [a] determination of whether the claim falls within one of the categories of non-dischargeable claims must be made by a court (Wood, at p. 314). In sum, for a creditor to be able to pursue its claim against a bankrupt under s. 178(1)(e), a court order declaring fraud must be obtained, whether before, during or after a discharge from bankruptcy (Bourassa, at para. 5).\nPassing of Property or Provision of Services\nThe second requirement for a debt or liability to survive bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(e) is that there must have been a passing of property or provision of services. This requirement is reflected in the final element of the Deloitte Restructuring test, which is that the false representation was made to obtain property or a service (para. 25). There must be a loss in the form of a transfer of property or delivery of services, as well as a debt or liability corresponding to that loss.\nThe Poonians argue that s. 178(1)(e) should apply only when the debtor, and not a third party, obtains the property or services (A.F., at paras. 72-75). I disagree.\nThis argument was also made and rejected in McAteer v. Billes, 2006 ABCA 312, 397 A.R. 365. The bankrupt argued that property must pass to the bankrupt in order for s. 178(1)(e) to apply (para. 8). The Alberta Court of Appeal held that s. 178(1)(e) does not require property to pass to the tortfeasor in cases of fraudulent misrepresentation (para. 7, citing Morgan v. Demers (1986), 71 A.R. 244 (C.A.)). I agree. The section does not specify that the person perpetrating the fraud must be the person who obtained the property (Varvis (Bankrupt), Re, 1999 ABQB 853, 254 A.R. 197, at para. 8).\nSection 178(1)(e) does not require that the bankrupt be the recipient of the property of which a person was deprived. The property need not have been obtained, or retained, by the bankrupt. It may have passed directly or indirectly from the person to a third party at the bankrupts direction or on his or her behalf (Merenick, at para. 18). What is required is that the fraudulent misrepresentation induced a person to give the property to some other person (see Wood, at p. 317, citing McAteer (2006), and Merenick). That other person may be the bankrupt or someone associated with the bankrupt.\nLink Required Between the Debt or Liability and the Fraud\nSection 178(1)(e), in using the expression resulting from, requires a causal link between the creation of the debt or liability and the debtors deceit. In other words, to come within s. 178(1)(e), the debt or liability must have been created as a result of false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation (Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  7:198). Section 178(1)(e) therefore requires detrimental reliance by a person (Shaver-Kudell, at para. 30). However, as I explain in the next section, that person need not be the creditor.\nThe words resulting from in s. 178(1)(e) connote a strict causation requirement. This is especially so given that the s. 178(1) exceptions must be interpreted narrowly. It is not sufficient that the debt or liability arose out of a fraudulent scheme (Gray, at para. 31). Nor is it sufficient for a debt or liability to be in respect of, in connection with or in relation to a fraudulent scheme. Indeed, Parliaments intention to impose a strict causation requirement by choosing the words resulting from becomes clear when s. 178(1)(e) is compared with s. 178(1)(a), which employs the term in respect of. As noted by Dickson J. (as he then was), [t]he phrase in respect of is probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject matters (Nowegijick, at p. 39; Markevich, at para. 26; see also Sullivan (7th ed.), at  4.05). The same cannot be said of the phrase resulting from, which requires a causal link: a debt or liability was caused by the debtor (or someone associated with the debtor) having obtained property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation.\nSection 178(1)(e) thus requires a direct link. The direct link approach holds that only the debt or liability that represents the value of the property [or services] obtained by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation qualifies as non-dischargeable (Molloy v. Janes & Noseworthy Ltd. (1998), 164 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 176 (Nfld. C.A.), at para. 8; see also Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  7:202). This approach is more consistent with the fresh start policy underlying bankruptcy law, since it limits the exception to the value obtained by the debtor as a result of her dishonesty (Wood, at p. 318).\nThe direct link requirement has been recognized and applied by several courts across Canada. In Gray, van Rensburg J.A. held that [a] causal connection between the bankrupts wrongdoing and the creation of the debt or liability is required (para. 31). In Shaver-Kudell, Zarnett J.A. held that a deceitful statement by the debtor must be the source of the debt or liability to the creditor (para. 35). In The Workers Compensation Board v. Petkau, 2018 SKCA 85, 429 D.L.R. (4th) 92, Schwann J.A. held that there has to be evidence of a causal connection between the alleged fraud and the debt or liability said to have resulted from it (para. 45). In Pietrzak, Re (2016), 39 C.B.R. (6th) 145 (Ont. S.C.J.), Master Mills concluded that [i]t is not sufficient to show that a fraudulent misrepresentation or false pretence was made unless it is also shown that the property or service was obtained directly as a result thereof (para. 9). In McAteer (2007), the Alberta Court of Appeal held that s. 178(1)(e) requires a finding of fraud, misrepresentation, or other reprehensible conduct that is clearly linked to the bankrupts debt (para. 28; see also Groupe Unigesco inc. v. Michaud, 2021 QCCQ 10330, at paras. 18-20 (CanLII); Water Matrix Inc., at para. 61; Dead End Survival, LLC v. Marhasin, 2020 ONSC 766, 77 C.B.R. (6th) 299, at para. 22).\nWhile the direct link requirement is rooted in ample authority, some courts have applied a less stringent standard. For example, the standard has been described as a but-for test: But for the fraudulent misrepresentation by the [debtor], [the] Corporation would not have loaned him [the money] (Woolf, at para. 72). The requisite link has also been described as a material connection: The false statement made by the defendant need only be materially connected to the actions of the plaintiff that resulted in damage (Morris Bureau, at para. 18). Respectfully, I am not convinced that a debt or liability that is not directly linked to a deceitful statement by the debtor, or someone associated with the debtor, can survive a discharge from bankruptcy on the basis of the s. 178(1)(e) exception. The proper scope of s. 178(1)(e) requires a deceitful statement by which the debtor obtained property or services, causing the debt or liability of the creditor to arise (Shaver-Kudell, at para. 44).\nGoldstein, Re, 2011 ONSC 561, 74 C.B.R. (5th) 296, provides an illustration of the direct link requirement. In that case, a hearing panel of the Law Society of Upper Canada ruled that Mr. Goldstein had participated in dishonest or fraudulent conduct to obtain mortgage funds under false pretences, and it disbarred him. Mr. Goldstein was ordered to pay the Law Society $60,000 in costs in relation to the disbarment hearing. Mr. Goldstein subsequently made an assignment in bankruptcy. The Law Society sought a declaration under s. 178(1) of the BIA that the costs award would not be released by any discharge. Justice Morawetz concluded that the costs award resulted not from the fraud but rather from the Law Society disbarment hearing (para. 10). The costs award was therefore not directly linked to the fraud committed by Mr. Goldstein.\nMy colleague would apply a less stringent causal link, one that does not limit the non-dischargeable debt or liability under s. 178(1)(e) to the value of the property or services obtained by deceit (paras. 118 and 125). She cites cases where courts have deemed punitive damages to be non-dischargeable debts under s. 178(1)(e) even though they exceed the value of the property or services obtained by deceit (para. 128). Punitive damages do not represent the value of property or services obtained by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation and therefore do not come within the s. 178(1)(e) exception. This does not mean, however, that such a debt will be released by an order of discharge. Punitive damages may be captured by another applicable s. 178(1) exception or by s. 172 of the BIA.\nI reiterate that s. 178(1) is not a catchall of debts arising from morally objectionable conduct (Shaver-Kudell, at para. 39). With respect, I disagree with my colleague that s. 178(1)(e) should ultimately be interpreted purposively (para. 138). My colleagues use of the word purposively is simply inconsistent with our Courts jurisprudence, which clearly establishes that s. 178(1)(e) must be interpreted narrowly (Deloitte Restructuring, at paras. 24-25). Through s. 178(1), Parliament identifies categories of specific wrongful conduct that give rise to debts that are not released, and specifies the criteria to be applied (Shaver-Kudell, at para. 39). [E]ven though other forms of morally objectionable conduct giving rise to debts can easily be imagined, s. 178(1)(e) must be interpreted narrowly on the basis of the specific terms identified (ibid.). A narrow interpretation favours a direct link that limits the non-dischargeable debt or liability to the value of the property or services obtained by deceit.\nThus, for a s. 178(1)(e) claim to succeed, there must be a direct link between the fraudulent statement in issue and the debt or liability the creditor is claiming.\nThere Is No Direct Victim Requirement\nThere is a final point I wish to address before determining whether the Commissions administrative penalties or disgorgement orders survive a discharge from bankruptcy under the s. 178(1)(e) exception. As I previously mentioned, the first step of the Deloitte Restructuring test may appear to stand for the proposition that only the creditor who was the victim of the false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation may bring a claim under s. 178(1)(e). That is not the case.\nIn Hennig, Khullar J.A. (as she then was) held that [a] creditor should only fall within s 178(1)(e) if he or she has been directly victimized by the fraudulent behaviour of the debtor (para. 81 (emphasis in original)). Under this approach, [t]he required link between the fraudulent statement and the debt is established only if the debtor makes the fraudulent statement to the creditor relying on s 178(1)(e) (para. 78). She held that this is because creditors deserve the preferential treatment given by s 178(1)(e) only if they are the victims of the debtors fraudulent behaviour (para. 92; see also Durnford, at p. 125).\nIn the Court of Appeal below, Willcock J.A. expressly rejected this direct victim requirement and held that the plain language of s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA does not restrict this exception to only those claims where the bankrupt made a deceitful statement to the creditor (para. 70).\nLike Willcock J.A., I am not convinced that s. 178(1)(e) requires that the claiming creditor be the direct recipient of the deceitful statement. That being said, since s. 178(1)(e) requires detrimental reliance, there will always be a person who has been deprived of property or services as a result of a deceitful statement made by the debtor or someone associated with the debtor. More often than not, the person to whom the deceitful statement was made will be the claiming creditor. However, the jurisprudence reveals circumstances in which, even though the claiming creditor was not the direct recipient of the deceitful statement, all of the s. 178(1)(e) elements were met and the debt or liability properly survived bankruptcy.\nFor example, in Woolf, the creditor bank sought a declaration that its judgment debt against the bankrupt, Mr. Harrop, had not been released by the order of discharge granted. The bank was the assignee of a mortgage that Mr. Harrop had originally executed in favour of another company. When Mr. Harrop took out the mortgage, he provided a statutory declaration to the original mortgagee indicating that he did not owe any income tax arrears. That declaration was false, and Mr. Harrop knew it was false. After the original mortgagee assigned the mortgage to the bank, Mr. Harrop defaulted and the bank obtained a judgment against him for the outstanding amount. Mr. Harrop made an assignment in bankruptcy, and following his discharge the bank sought a declaration that its default judgment survived under s. 178(1)(e) because Mr. Harrop had made a fraudulent misrepresentation to the original mortgagee. Mr. Harrop argued that the bank could not rely on s. 178(1)(e) because the fraudulent misrepresentation had been made not to it but rather to the original mortgagee. He also argued that the bank had not relied on his fraudulent misrepresentation.\nJustice Trafford rejected Mr. Harrops arguments. He found that the bank had acquired all the legal rights and entitlements of the original mortgagee, including the right to sue Mr. Harrop. Further, he inferred that, had the bank known of the fraudulent misrepresentation, it would not have acquired the original mortgagees legal interest. The banks entitlement to relief under s. 178(1)(e) was no different than what the original mortgagees entitlement would have been.\nEven though the bank was not the direct victim of Mr. Harrops fraudulent misrepresentation, the outstanding debt on the mortgage was the direct result of Mr. Harrop having obtained property by fraudulent misrepresentation. I agree with Trafford J.s conclusion that the banks entitlement to relief under s. 178(1)(e) was no different than that of the original mortgagee (para. 75). The bank was entitled to a declaration that its judgment debt had not been released by the order of discharge, and Mr. Harrop could not protect himself against the legal consequences of his fraudulent misrepresentation on the basis that the bank was not the direct victim (para. 75; Girgis and Telfer (2023), at p. 452; see also Shaver-Kudell, at para. 5).\nIn Ste. Rose, the Manitoba Court of Appeal found that a liability had not been released on discharge because it fell within s. 178(1)(e), even though the creditor was not the direct victim of the false pretences. The Ste. Rose & District Cattle Feeders Co-op and the debtor had entered into an agreement providing that Co-op would authorize funding so that the debtor could purchase cattle. The agreement also required the debtor to notify Co-op when the cattle were to be sold and to ensure that the proceeds of that sale were paid directly to Co-op. The debtor and his son devised a plan whereby the son sold the cattle in his own name. The son deceitfully held out to a transport driver and an auctioneer that he owned the cattle. The proceeds of sale were deposited in the sons credit union account, in accordance with the plan. However, the son was indebted to the credit union. When the funds were deposited in the sons account, the credit union seized the amount and applied it to his debt. The debtor defaulted on repaying Co-ops loan, and Co-op suffered a corresponding loss. The debtor and his son consented to judgment in favour of Co-op. Both the debtor and his son then made assignments in bankruptcy and were later discharged. Co-op filed an application seeking a declaration under s. 178(1)(e) that the liability of the debtor and his son arising from the judgment had not been released by the discharge.\nJustice Freedman held that the debtor and his son had obtained property, in the form of the proceeds of sale, by false pretences. This had created a liability toward Co-op, which had resulted in the judgment. The debtor had withheld relevant information from Co-op by not telling it that the proceeds of sale would be kept by his son. Co-op had relied on the debtors fraudulent misrepresentation to its detriment. Further, by participating in the fraudulent sale of the cattle, the debtor had kept up the false pretence that his son was entitled to the proceeds. On this basis, the debtors liability to Co-op survived the discharge from bankruptcy.\nWith respect to the sons liability to Co-op, his false statements had been made to the auction house and the truck driver, not to the creditor, Co-op. However, this third-party involvement did not change the fact that Co-op had been deprived of its property because of the sons false statements. For this reason, the court found under s. 178(1)(e) that the debt had not been discharged.\nIn most cases, the claiming creditor will be the party directly victimized by the false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation. This is especially so given that the creditor bears the onus of proving that a debt or liability falls within one of the listed exceptions.\nIn fact, it is on this basis that the Deloitte Restructuring test appears to endorse the direct victim requirement: To discharge its burden of proving that its claim relates to a debt resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation, a creditor must establish [that] the debtor made a representation to the creditor . . . (para. 25 (emphasis added)). Deloitte Restructuring was a typical case in the sense that the City of Montreal was both the victim of the alleged fraud and the creditor invoking s. 19(2)(d) of the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act. However, the wording of s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA does not import a direct victim requirement. A creditor who is not a direct victim is thus not barred from bringing a claim under s. 178(1)(e) provided that the claim is the result of a person being deprived of property or services after having detrimentally relied on the debtors false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation.\nI reject a direct victim requirement on the basis that it would read an additional requirement into s. 178(1)(e): that the statements that resulted in a person being deprived of property or services must have been made directly to the creditor, not to a third party (Girgis and Telfer (2022), at p. 183). However, the absence of a direct victim requirement does not change the fact that s. 178(1)(e) is limited to the value of the property or services obtained by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation.\nApplication of Section 178(1)(e) to the Commissions Orders\nTo discharge its burden of proving that its claims relate to a debt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation, the Commission must establish that the Poonians knowingly made a false representation in order to obtain property or services (Deloitte Restructuring, at para. 25). The debt or liability being claimed must be directly linked to the Poonians false representation.\nIn assessing whether the Poonians knowingly made false statements, the chambers judge considered the Commissions decisions. As noted above, when a party relies on the findings and conclusions of an administrative decision maker to establish that the debtor made a fraudulent statement, the court must still make its own determination based on a review of the record, even where the administrative findings of fraud are express.\nOn review of the Commissions Reassessment Decision, the chambers judge concluded that because the Poonians deceitful scheme had deliberately misled the public and investors as to the true value of the OSE shares, it was at its core a fraudulent misrepresentation and false pretense (para. 103). In the Reassessment Decision, the Commission held that the Poonians had breached s. 57(a) of the Securities Act by engaging in, or participating in, conduct that they knew, or reasonably should have known, would result in, or contribute to, a misleading appearance of trading activity in, or an artificial price for, shares of OSE Corp. (para. 6). The Poonians market manipulation was thus characterized as fraudulent by both the Commission and the chambers judge.\nLike Willcock J.A., I see no error in the chambers judges conclusion that the Poonians scheme to mislead and exploit investors amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation (para. 56). The Poonians falsely and knowingly misrepresented the price of the OSE shares in order to turn a profit. The first s. 178(1)(e) requirement is therefore met.\nThe Poonians obtained property or services as a result of their fraudulent misrepresentation. As the chambers judge noted, [t]hrough that scheme the Poonians obtained property, in the form of millions of dollars (para. 103). Mr. Poonian obtained $746,676 directly and $572,491 indirectly through the accounts of secondary participants in the scheme. In addition, he obtained $1,126,260 through the account of another participant and was ordered to pay that amount on a joint and several basis. Ms. Poonian obtained $3,149,935 (Reassessment Decision, at paras. 77-79). While Mr. Poonian obtained some amounts indirectly through the accounts of other participants in the scheme, I have concluded that it is not necessary that the bankrupt directly obtain or retain the property for the s. 178(1)(e) exception to apply. As is the case here, the property may pass from a person or group of people (the deceived investors) to a third party (another participant) at the direction of the bankrupt (Mr. Poonian). The second s. 178(1)(e) requirement is therefore met.\nThe Commission claims that both its administrative penalties and its disgorgement orders will survive any discharge from bankruptcy by operation of the exception in s. 178(1)(e) because they are debts resulting from the Poonians having obtained millions of dollars because of their fraudulent misrepresentation. To determine whether this is the case, I must consider separately whether the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders meet the third s. 178(1)(e) requirement.\nThe Commissions Administrative Penalties Did Not Result From the Fraudulent Scheme\nAs noted above, a claim under s. 178(1)(e) must result from the debtor (or someone associated with the debtor) having obtained property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation. A direct link between the debt or liability and the fraudulent conduct is required. It is only the value of the property or services obtained as a result of that conduct that is not released by an order of discharge (Molloy, at para. 8). On this basis, the Commissions administrative penalties do not come within the purview of s. 178(1)(e).\nThe debt represented by the Commissions administrative penalties did not result directly from the Poonians fraudulent misrepresentation. Rather, it arose indirectly as a result of the Commissions decision to sanction the Poonians for having obtained property through deceitful statements to investors (Girgis and Telfer (2023), at p. 448; Nocilla, at p. 186).\nAs I explained above, Goldstein helps to illustrate the direct link requirement. In that case, Morawetz J. concluded that the costs award at issue resulted not from the bankrupts fraud but rather from a Law Society disbarment hearing. Even though the Law Society found that Mr. Goldstein had knowingly assisted or participated in dishonest or fraudulent conduct to obtain mortgage funds under false pretenses, the costs award itself did not result directly from the fraud committed by Mr. Goldstein and therefore did not fall within s. 178(1)(e) (Goldstein, at paras. 3 and 10-11). My colleague acknowledges that the costs award was a step removed from and thus not directly caused by the fraudulent conduct and that the source of the liability was the disbarment hearing, not the deceit (para. 133 (emphasis in original)). However, she distinguishes Goldstein on the basis that, in the instant case, the Commission does not claim that the costs of its proceeding against the Poonians are non-dischargeable and that the purpose of the Commissions hearing was to create such a debt or liability resulting directly from the false pretences (para. 134). With respect, this distinction is untenable.\nBoth a costs award and a penalty imposed by a regulator arise indirectly from deceitful conduct. Without the occurrence and sanctioning of that conduct, neither a penalty nor a costs award would exist. Fundamentally, however, both a costs award and an administrative penalty result from the regulators choice to sanction the impugned conduct. Neither is the direct result of the deceit. In other words, but for Mr. Goldsteins fraud, there would have been no costs award. Similarly, but for the Poonians fraud, there would be no administrative penalty. However, as I have explained, and as my colleague acknowledges at para. 124 of her reasons, a but-for connection is not the appropriate link under s. 178(1)(e). A direct causal link is required. I therefore respectfully disagree with my colleague that the Commissions administrative penalties have as their only source or origin the Poonians deceitful conduct (para. 134 (emphasis in original)). Rather, their only source is the Sanctions Decision: Considering it to be in the public interest, and pursuant to sections 161 and 162 of the Act, we order that . . . a) [Thalbinder] Poonian pay to the Commission an administrative penalty of $10 million; b) [Shailu] Poonian pay to the Commission an administrative penalty of $3.5 million (para. 96).\nIf the exempt debt or liability is not restricted to the value of the property or services obtained by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation  regardless of whether the claimant is the direct victim or a party like the Commission  then s. 178(1)(e) has the potential to capture debts or liabilities that are not the direct result of deceit. My colleague relies on Justice Romaines interpretation of s. 178(1)(e) in Hennig (Q.B.) to find that the Commissions administrative penalties are captured by this section (para. 139). That decision was reversed on appeal. Justice Khullar (as she then was) held that Romaine J. had incorrectly identified the purpose of s 178(1) and engaged in a bit of reverse engineering, and that her purposive and remedial approach . . . resulted in shifting the delicate balance achieved by Parliament (Hennig (C.A.), para. 26). I agree. As professors Girgis and Telfer note, if such other debts or liabilities, including administrative penalties, are to survive bankruptcy discharge, it should be through a clear and intentional exemption provided by Parliament, not because of a courts overly broad interpretation of an exception to the discharge ((2023), at p. 454; see also Nocilla, at p. 187; Hennig (C.A.), at para. 102).\nThe administrative penalties are not the direct result of the Poonians fraudulent misrepresentation. They do not survive a discharge from bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(e).\nThe Commissions Disgorgement Orders Did Result From the Fraudulent Scheme\nWhile the administrative penalties did not result from the Poonians having obtained property by fraudulent misrepresentation, the situation is different for the disgorgement orders.\nThe disgorgement orders were made under s. 161(1)(g) of the Securities Act and represent the value of the Poonians fraud  the funds that the Poonians gained as a result of their market manipulation. Section 161(1)(g) states:\n161 (1)\tIf the commission or the executive director considers it to be in the public interest, the commission or the executive director, after a hearing, may order one or more of the following:\n\n. . .\n\n(g)\tif a person has not complied with this Act, the regulations or a decision of the commission or the executive director, that the person pay to the commission any amount obtained, or payment or loss avoided, directly or indirectly, as a result of the failure to comply or the contravention;\nThus, where a person has not complied with a provision of the Securities Act, the Commission may order that person to pay to the Commission any amount obtained as a result of the failure to comply.\nThe purpose of this section is to compel a wrongdoer to give up any ill-gotten amounts (2017 BCCA 207, 95 B.C.L.R. (5th) 319 (Poonian (2017)), at para. 81). By taking away the amounts obtained as a result of a contravention of the Securities Act, the section deprives a person who fails to comply of any benefit (para. 82; see also para. 100).\nSections 15 and 15.1 of the Securities Act address what the Commission must do with the funds received from s. 161(1)(g) disgorgement orders. Section 15.1 and the Securities Regulation, B.C. Reg. 196/97, set out a notice and claims procedure for persons who have suffered a pecuniary loss as a direct result of misconduct that resulted in an order under s. 161(1)(g). The Commission must publish a notice if it receives money from an order under s. 161(1)(g) (s. 15.1(1)). A person may make a claim to the money by submitting an application (s. 15.1(2)). If the Commission receives such an application, it will administer the claim in accordance with the regulations, and pay to the applicant all or part of the amount claimed (s. 15.1(3)).\nAs noted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, s. 161(1)(g) deters persons from contravening the Securities Act by removing the incentive to contravene, because it strips them of the benefit of their wrongdoing (Poonian (2017), at para. 88). When issuing an order under s. 161(1)(g), the Commission may deduct any amounts already returned to the victim or victims (para. 143). The amounts owed under disgorgement orders thus represent the amounts the debtor obtained as a result of his or her wrongful conduct. Furthermore, though compensation is not the purpose of this section, compensation is a possible effect of a s. 161(1)(g) order, because restitution may occur via the s. 15.1 claims procedure (paras. 75-76).\nThe amounts that the Poonians have been ordered to pay under s. 161(1)(g) represent the amounts they obtained as a result of their fraudulent market manipulation. There is therefore a direct link between their fraudulent conduct and the Commissions disgorgement orders. While I have concluded that the Commission need not have been directly victimized by the Poonians conduct in order to claim that the disgorgement orders are non-dischargeable under s. 178(1)(e), the victim investors may very well be the ultimate recipients of the sums of which they were deprived, provided that they submit appropriate claims in accordance with the s. 15.1 procedure.\nThe Commissions disgorgement orders are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception and will not be released by any order of discharge.\nConclusion\nI would overturn the Court of Appeals conclusion that the Commissions administrative penalties are debts not released by any order of discharge because they fall within s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA. I would affirm the Court of Appeals conclusion that the Commissions disgorgement orders come within the purview of s. 178(1)(e). The disgorgement orders thus remain enforceable against the Poonians and survive any order of discharge under the BIA. I would also uphold the Court of Appeals conclusion that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders are exempt from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a).\nTherefore, the appeal is allowed in part and the chambers judges order is set aside in part. The Commissions application for a declaration that the amounts the Poonians owe to the Commission pursuant to the Sanctions Decision (i.e. the administrative penalties) shall not be released by any order of discharge is dismissed. For clarity, the chambers judges order that the amounts the Poonians owe to the Commission pursuant to the Reassessment Decision (i.e. the disgorgement orders) shall not be released by any order of discharge is upheld. In the particular circumstance of this appeal, I would not award costs.\n\tThe reasons of Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. were delivered by\n\tKarakatsanis J. \nI agree with Justice Cote, for the reasons she gives, that the administrative penalties and the disgorgement orders imposed by the British Columbia Securities Commission do not survive bankruptcy under s. 178(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (BIA). \nWe part company, however, on interpreting the scope of the causation requirement contemplated by the words resulting from in s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA. I do not accept that any debt or liability is limited to the value of the property obtained by deceit (s. 178(1)(e)). I conclude, as did the British Columbia Court of Appeal (2022 BCCA 274, 65 B.C.L.R. (6th) 213), that both the disgorgement orders and the administrative penalties fall within s. 178(1)(e) as any debt or liability resulting from obtaining property or services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation. Thus, both orders survive bankruptcy. I would dismiss the appeal.\nThe bankrupts, Thalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian, engaged in a complex, predatory and highly deceptive . . . scheme that targeted unsophisticated investors facing financial distress (2021 BCSC 555, at para. 31 (CanLII); see also 2015 BCSECCOM 96 (Sanctions Decision), at para. 18 (CanLII)). The Commission found that the bankrupts manipulated the market, contravening s. 57(a) (now s. 57(1)(a)) of the British Columbia Securities Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418, a deemed offence under that Act. Based on this, the Commission sanctioned the Poonians in the public interest, with disgorgement orders under s. 161(1)(g) of the Securities Act of about $5.6 million; and administrative penalties under s. 162(1) totalling $13.5 million. \nThe Poonians market manipulation scheme satisfied the condition of s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA that property be obtained as a result of their false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentations. They obtained about $5.6 million through their scheme (Cote J.s reasons, at paras. 99-100; see also 2018 BCSECCOM 160, at paras. 77-79 (CanLII)).\nThus, the only remaining question is whether the debts or liabilities at issue result from the Poonians deceitful conduct. Are the different monetary sanctions the Commission imposed resulting from the fact that property was obtained by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation? \nIn answering this question, I share a number of Cote J.s conclusions, for the reasons she gives. The property need not directly pass to the bankrupt; the person perpetrating the fraud need not be the person who obtained the property (para. 72, citing Varvis (Bankrupt), Re, 1999 ABQB 853, 254 A.R. 197, at para. 8). It is enough if someone associated with the bankrupt benefits (Cote J.s reasons, at paras. 71-73). Further, s. 178(1)(e) does not require that the person claiming the exemption be the person who has directly sustained the loss as a result of the false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation (paras. 83-95). \nRather, what is required is simply that the deceitful conduct be that of the bankrupt, as long as someone associated with them has obtained property or services by pretences that the bankrupt knew to be false. The passing of property or services ensures that abstract fraudulent statements do not trigger the application of the exception when they have not resulted in detrimental reliance (see Cote J.s reasons, at para. 74, citing Shaver-Kudell Manufacturing Inc. v. Knight Manufacturing Inc., 2021 ONCA 925, 160 O.R. (3d) 205, at para. 30).  \nThe more difficult issue, however, is the degree of link required between the debt and the deceitful behaviour. Given the scheme of the BIA and its broader purpose of financial rehabilitation, the non-discretionary exception in s. 178(1)(e) must be interpreted narrowly. It is common ground that there must be a direct link between the debt or liability claimed and the fraudulent statement (Cote J.s reasons, at para. 77, citing Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. v. Gray, 2014 ONCA 236, 119 O.R. (3d) 710, at para. 31; Shaver-Kudell, at para. 35; The Workers Compensation Board v. Petkau, 2018 SKCA 85, 429 D.L.R. (4th) 92, at para. 45; Pietrzak, Re (2016), 39 C.B.R. (6th) 145 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 9; McAteer v. Billes, 2007 ABCA 137, 409 A.R. 143, at para. 28; Groupe Unigesco inc. v. Michaud, 2021 QCCQ 10330, at paras. 18-20 (CanLII); Water Matrix Inc. v. Carnevale, 2018 ONSC 6436, 65 C.B.R. (6th) 109, at para. 61; Dead End Survival, LLC v. Marhasin, 2020 ONSC 766, 77 C.B.R. (6th) 299, at para. 22). I too would reject a weak link such as in respect of, in connection with, in relation to or but for (Cote J.s reasons, at paras. 75 and 78). A direct causal link between the creation of the debt or liability and the debtors deceit is required by the language resulting from, in an exception that must be narrowly construed (paras. 74-75).\nBut I would not go further and require that there must be a direct correspondence between the value of the debt or liability and the gain made by the bankrupt or the person associated with the bankrupt. My colleague reasons that because there must be detrimental reliance in the form of a transfer of property or service, the quantum of the non-dischargeable debt or liability must be limited to only the value obtained as a result of the deceit (para. 102; see also para. 76). I disagree. While the exception must be interpreted narrowly, it must be tethered to the provision fashioned by Parliament.\nJust as s. 178(1)(e) does not require that there be an exact correlation between the person claiming the exemption and the victims of that deceitful conduct, it does not require that the quantum of the debt or liability be limited by the quantum of the property obtained as a result of that deceitful conduct. Such a requirement is unsupported by the jurisprudence, is not found in the text of the provision, and is inconsistent with the provisions central focus. The central focus is the deceitful conduct at the source of the debt or liability, not the exact gain derived thereby.\nSection 178(1)(e) has been applied by courts to permit the exemption of debts or liabilities that exceed the value of the bankrupts gain. If the quantum of the debt or liability under s. 178(1)(e) was limited to the value of property obtained, neither compensatory damages exceeding the value of the gain nor punitive damages awarded at private law would ever be exempt from discharge under s. 178(1)(e). \nUnsurprisingly, it is hard to find a single instance when courts have limited the recovery of punitive damages against a bankrupt, under s. 178(1)(e), on the basis that it would exceed the value of the property obtained by the bankrupt. On the contrary, the jurisprudence overwhelmingly shows that if punitive damages directly result from the deceitful conduct targeted by s. 178(1)(e), they qualify for the exception (see, e.g., Grewal v. Brar, 2015 MBQB 3, 313 Man. R. (2d) 94, at para. 30; Bank of Montreal v. 1886758 Ontario Inc., 2022 ONSC 4642, 1 C.B.R. (7th) 213, at paras. 38 and 45; A.J. Lanzarotta Fruits & Vegetables Ltd. v. United Farmers, 2024 ONSC 1780, 12 C.B.R. (7th) 371, at paras. 79 and 82; Celanese Canada Inc. v. Murray Demolition Corp., 2010 CanLII 29089 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 14 and 22; Horth v. Lalonde-Rousseau, 2021 QCCQ 3668, at paras. 102 and 119-21 (CanLII); Maison des jeunes de Contrecur v. Bourdon, 2011 QCCQ 3476, at paras. 103-7 (CanLII); Vivacqua v. Contino, 2009 CanLII 14574 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 18-23; Agriculture Financial Services Corp. v. Zaborski, 2009 ABQB 183, 58 C.B.R. (5th) 301, at paras. 3 and 24; see also Dead End Survival, at paras. 28-30). \nThe cases my colleague relies on, as noted above, help show that a weak link is not enough to satisfy the requirements of s. 178(1)(e). An overly broad causation threshold would stray from a narrow reading of s. 178(1)(e). For the threshold to be met, the conduct must be at the source, or origin, of the debt or liability. The deceitful conduct must have directly created it. But none of those cases stand for the proposition that a strict causation test requires the debt or liability to be limited to the value of the property obtained.\nInstead, as Roderick J. Wood notes, a direct causation requirement means that where only part of a liability can be traced to deceitful conduct, but not the balance, only the part induced by fraudulent conduct will be exempt from discharge (Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law (2nd ed. 2015), at pp. 317-18). Courts can and should undertake an apportionment exercise to determine the part of a debt or liability that can be attributed to fraudulent conduct. This exercise is consistent with the fresh start policy underlying bankruptcy law (p. 318), as it ensures bankrupts can obtain the benefit of a discharge for the part of the total debt that was incurred honestly (Copper Cliff Community Credit Union Ltd. v. Parker (1977), 18 O.R. (2d) 49 (C.A.), at p. 54; see also J. Sarra, G. B. Morawetz and L. W. Houlden, The 2024 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (2024), at  7:202). \nBut where a debt or liability is entirely caused by fraudulent conduct, such as punitive damages imposed to sanction the conduct, there is no reason to limit the application of s. 178(1)(e) only to the gain ultimately obtained by the bankrupt (or someone associated with the bankrupt). \nIn Goldstein, Re, 2011 ONSC 561, 74 C.B.R. (5th) 296, a lawyer, Mr. Goldstein, obtained mortgage funds as a result of false pretences. Given this fraudulent conduct, the Law Society of Upper Canada held a hearing to disbar him. The costs award Mr. Goldstein was ordered to pay in relation to the disbarment hearing was found not to result from the underlying fraud for the purposes of s. 178(1)(e). \nThe circumstances in Goldstein differ from those in this case. The costs award was a step removed from and thus not directly caused by the fraudulent conduct. The source or origin of the liability was the disbarment hearing, not the false pretences (paras. 10-11). It cannot be said that the debt resulted from the fraudulent conduct itself. The purpose of a disbarment hearing is not to impose or recover payment on any debt or liability envisaged by s. 178(1)(e). \nHere, by contrast, the purpose of the Commissions hearing was to create such a debt or liability resulting directly from the false pretences. The amounts the Commission submits should survive discharge (which do not include costs) thus have as their only source or origin the Poonians deceitful conduct. Both the disgorgement orders and the administrative penalties under the Securities Act are monetary sanctions for the unlawful conduct. This is not a step removed. As my colleague notes, the breach of the Securities Act is factually based on obtaining property by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of s. 178(1)(e) of the BIA (paras. 99-100). \nGranted, the administrative penalties include an element of general deterrence for the egregious nature of the conduct and the magnitude of the scale on which it took place (Sanctions Decision, at paras. 18 and 92). Administrative penalties imposed under the Securities Act deter particular conduct and induce compliance (British Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 59; Cartaway Resources Corp. (Re), 2004 SCC 26, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 672, at paras. 58-62). But like punitive damages imposed at private law, the administrative penalties arise directly from the type of conduct that they sanction. Nothing in s. 178(1)(e) excludes a debt or liability that has an element of general deterrence (or compensatory damages that exceed the gain), provided it directly results from obtaining a financial benefit through false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentations. To exclude administrative penalties on that basis amounts to reading in an additional limitation that is found nowhere in the text of the provision.\nLimiting the debt or liability based on the value of the gain derived by the bankrupt is not only absent from the text, it is also inconsistent with the purpose of the exception set out in s. 178(1)(e). As this court has acknowledged, the financial rehabilitation of the bankrupt has its limits (Alberta (Attorney General) v. Moloney, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para. 37). The general availability of a discharge  a fresh start  is limited by the exceptions in s. 178(1), which reflect policy choices that some debts or liabilities should survive bankruptcy. They are the kind of claims that society, through Parliament, considers to be of a quality that outweighs any possible benefit in the bankrupt being relieved of them (Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  7:185; Jerrard v. Peacock (1985), 37 Alta. L.R. (2d) 197 (Q.B.), at p. 206). \nMany exceptions provided for in s. 178(1) ensure that only honest but unfortunate debtors can benefit from a discharge (Sarra, Morawetz and Houlden, at  7:69). They are based on societys view, reflected by Parliament, that a bankrupt should not be free of some types of debts or liabilities where they are the direct consequences of an undesirable conduct. Parliament has determined that some bankrupts simply do not deserve to be free of particular debts, based on the nature of the conduct giving rise to those debts. These exceptions are focused not on the person claiming the exemption but on categories of specific wrongful conduct that give rise to debts that are not released (Shaver-Kudell, at para. 39). For example, the following all survive bankruptcy because the principle of financial rehabilitation gives way to societys denunciation of these kinds of conduct: fines or penalties imposed by a court in respect of an offence (s. 178(1)(a)); damages awarded in respect of intentional infliction of bodily harm or sexual assault (s. 178(1)(a.1)); and debts or liabilities arising out of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity (s. 178(1)(d)). The objective is to prevent abuse of the fresh start principle, and the focus is the nature of the wrongful conduct.\nA similar objective animates s. 178(1)(e). It is a moral sanction aimed at preventing the bankrupt from being rewarded by a release of liability because of their undeserving conduct that has resulted in detrimental reliance (Shaver-Kudell, at para. 40; Simone v. Daley (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 511 (C.A.), at pp. 521-22; Cruise Connections Canada v. Szeto, 2015 BCCA 363, 78 B.C.L.R. (5th) 82, at para. 15; Ste. Rose & District Cattle Feeders Co-op v. Geisel, 2010 MBCA 52, 255 Man. R. (2d) 45, at paras. 109-16). Section 178(1)(e) should ultimately be interpreted purposively so as to ensure that dishonest debtors do not benefit from their dishonesty (McAteer v. Billes, 2006 ABCA 312, 397 A.R. 365, at para. 10; see also Alberta Securities Commission v. Hennig, 2020 ABQB 48, 8 Alta. L.R. (7th) 177, at para. 66, revd 2021 ABCA 411, 34 Alta. L.R. (7th) 219).\nI agree with Romaine J. in Hennig (Q.B.) that an interpretation of s. 178(1)(e) that considers the provisions intention to preclude dishonest debtors from benefitting from their dishonesty would surely extend to a decision of a securities commission, charged with enforcing securities laws in order to protect the [interests of the] public and promoting the integrity of the capital markets (para. 76). The Commission is a regulatory authority representing the interests of those affected by the fraudulent misrepresentations and/or false pretences (para. 76) and as a result, its administrative penalties should not be treated as if they were a debt stemming from an unrelated creditor seeking to unduly invoke s. 178(1)(e). \nFocusing only on the gain derived in the abstract would circumvent the precise mischief s. 178(1)(e) was meant to address, as it would permit bankrupts to benefit from their dishonesty through a release of liability, even when the debt directly results from the specific misconduct targeted by Parliament. Rehabilitation of the bankrupt is not best served if the bankrupt can obtain a discharge for liabilities directly resulting from fraudulent conduct. \nIn conclusion, both the disgorgement orders and the administrative penalties are monetary sanctions imposed because of, and thus resulting from, deceitful conduct that Parliament specifically sought to address. They are both debts that originate from the Poonians having obtained property by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentations. Accordingly, both properly fall within the narrow scope of s. 178(1)(e) and should not be released by any order of discharge.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\n\tAppeal allowed in part without costs, Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. dissenting in part.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants: Reedman Law, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Lawson Lundell, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario, Crown Law Office  Civil, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Ministry of the Attorney General, Legal Services Branch, Victoria.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Attorney General of Saskatchewan  Legal Services Division, Civil Law Branch, Regina.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Professionals: Gowling WLG (Canada), Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Superintendent of Bankruptcy: Attorney General of Canada, Department of Justice Canada  Civil Litigation Section, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Federation of Law Societies of Canada: Hunter Litigation Chambers, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Alberta Securities Commission: Dentons Canada, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Ontario Securities Commission: Ontario Securities Commission, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Osgoode Investor Protection Clinic: Stockwoods, Toronto.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, holding that disgorgement orders, but not administrative penalties, are exempt from discharge under section 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.\n\nThis appeal concerns the question of whether administrative penalties and disgorgement orders imposed by the British Columbia Securities Commission (Commission) for market manipulation are exempt from discharge under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA).\n\nThalbinder Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian (the Poonians) were found by the Commission to have engaged in market manipulation, causing millions of dollars in losses to investors. The Commission imposed administrative penalties ($13.5 million) and disgorgement orders (approximately $5.6 million) under the Securities Act. The Commission applied for a declaration that these debts not be released by any order of discharge. The Supreme Court of British Columbia allowed the application, finding that the debts were exempt from discharge under sections 178(1)(a) and (e) of the BIA. The Poonians appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which upheld the chambers judge's conclusion that the disgorgement orders came within the section 178(1)(e) exception but held that the debts were not exempt from discharge under section 178(1)(a). The Poonians further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part, holding that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders are exempt from discharge under section 178(1)(a). However, the Court found that the disgorgement orders, but not the administrative penalties, are captured by the section 178(1)(e) exception and will not be released by any order of discharge. The Court's decision was based on its interpretation of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the relationship between regulatory penalties, disgorgement orders, and their survivability in bankruptcy.\n\nFor a debt or liability to survive bankruptcy under section 178(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA), the creditor must establish: (1) false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation; (2) a passing of property or provision of services; and (3) a direct link between the debt or liability and the fraud, limiting the non-dischargeable debt or liability to the value of the property or services obtained by deceit.\n\nWriting for the majority, Wagner C.J. and Cote, Rowe, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ. held that the Commission's administrative penalties and disgorgement orders imposed on the bankrupts are not entirely released by an order of discharge under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA). The majority reasoned that while the administrative penalties do not fall within the exceptions set out in sections 178(1)(a) and 178(1)(e) of the BIA, the disgorgement orders do survive bankruptcy under section 178(1)(e). The majority concluded that the words \"imposed by a court\" in section 178(1)(a) do not capture the registration of administrative tribunal or regulatory agency decisions as judgments of a superior court. Additionally, they found that section 178(1)(e) requires a direct link between the creation of the debt or liability and the debtor's deceit, and that the disgorgement orders were made to compel the wrongdoer to give up any ill-gotten amounts obtained as a result of the failure to comply with the Securities Act, thus directly resulting from the debtor's deceitful conduct.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court concludes that bankruptcy does not release people from orders to pay amounts obtained by fraud, but  could release them from administrative penalties.</strong>This appeal is  about whether bankruptcy releases  persons from having to comply with certain orders imposed on them by a regulatory  agency for having broken the law. Bankruptcy is a legal process through which a  person can be released, or discharged, from having to pay certain debts,  subject to conditions.Between 2007 and 2009, Thalbinder  Singh Poonian and Shailu Poonian engaged in a scheme in which they manipulated  the share price of a public oil and gas company called OSE Corp. and then sold  the overpriced shares to investors. The scheme caused vulnerable investors to  lose millions of dollars. In 2014, the British Columbia  Securities Commission found that the Poonians had violated the province\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>. It eventually ordered  them to pay $13.5 million in administrative penalties. Administrative penalties  are consequences for having broken the law that are imposed by administrative  tribunals or regulatory agencies instead of the courts. The Commission also  ordered the Poonians to pay a further $5.6 million, representing the amounts  they had obtained as a result of the scheme. These are called \u201cdisgorgement  orders\u201d. In 2018, the Poonians went into  bankruptcy. Section 178(1) of the federal <em>Bankruptcy  and Insolvency Act</em> lists certain debts from which a person is not released  through bankruptcy (debts that are \u201cexempted from discharge\u201d). The Commission asked  the Supreme Court of British Columbia to decide whether the amounts owed to it  by the Poonians would be exempted from discharge, based on this rule. The Supreme Court of British  Columbia said that the orders would be exempted from discharge. It found that  the exceptions in s. 178(1)(a) \u2014 relating to penalties \u201cimposed by a court\u201d \u2014  and in s. 178(1)(e) \u2014 relating to debt that results from \u201cobtaining property or  services by false pretences or fraudulent misrepresentation\u201d \u2014 both applied. The Poonians\u2019 appeal to the Court  of Appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal concluded that although the s.  178(1)(a) exception did not apply because the Commission\u2019s decisions were not  \u201cimposed by a court\u201d, the exception in s. 178(1)(e) did apply. The Poonians  appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal in part. It has reversed the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the  administrative penalties are exempted from discharge under s. 178(1)(e), while  upholding its conclusion that the disgorgement orders are exempted.<strong>Orders to pay  amounts that were obtained by fraud are directly linked to that fraud in a way  that administrative penalties are not.</strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  C\u00f4t\u00e9 held that neither the administrative penalties nor the disgorgement orders  are exempted from discharge pursuant to s. 178(1)(a). The words \u201cimposed by a  court\u201d in s. 178(1)(a) do not capture orders made by administrative tribunals  or regulatory agencies, such as the Commission, that are subsequently  registered as judgments of a court. In addition, the administrative  penalties do not come within the exception in s. 178(1)(e), as they did not  result directly from the fraudulent scheme; rather, they arose indirectly as a  result of the Commission\u2019s decision to sanction the Poonians. The disgorgement  orders, however, are captured by the s. 178(1)(e) exception as there is a  direct link between them and the Poonians\u2019 fraudulent conduct. Therefore, they  will not be released by any possible future order of discharge."

L.15.\n\tIn 1850, the Anishinaabe of Lake Huron and Lake Superior entered into land cession treaties with the Crown. Under these treaties, known as the Robinson Treaties, the Anishinaabe ceded their territories to the Crown in exchange for, among other things, a perpetual annual payment of 600 under the Robinson-Huron Treaty and 500 under the Robinson-Superior Treaty. At the time the treaties were signed in 1850, the annuity was equivalent to about $1.70 per person under the Robinson-Huron Treaty and $1.60 per person under the Robinson-Superior Treaty. The treaties contained an Augmentation Clause, according to which the annuities were to be increased over time if the ceded lands produced an amount that would allow the Crown to increase the annuity without incurring loss. A condition of the augmentation was that the amount paid to each individual would not exceed 1 (at the time, equal to approximately $4) a year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. The annuities were increased to $4 per person in 1875, but have been frozen at that amount since then. \n\tThe Lake Superior Anishinaabe (Superior plaintiffs) filed a statement of claim in 2001 seeking declaratory and compensatory relief relating to the interpretation, implementation, and alleged breach of the Augmentation Clause. The Lake Huron Anishinaabe (Huron plaintiffs) filed their own claim in 2014. The actions were tried together in three stages: Stage One addressed the interpretation of the treaties, Stage Two considered Ontarios defences of Crown immunity and limitations, and Stage Three concerned the plaintiffs claim for damages and the allocation of liability between Canada and Ontario. \n\tAt Stage One, the trial judge held that the Crown has a mandatory and reviewable obligation under the Augmentation Clause to increase the annuities when the economic circumstances warrant  i.e., if the net Crown resource-based revenues permit the Crown to increase the annuities without incurring a loss. The trial judge also found that the Crown must engage in a consultative process with the treaty beneficiaries and pay an increased annuity reflecting a fair share of the net Crown resource-based revenues. She further held that the reference to 1 (or $4) limits only the amount distributed to individuals, but does not limit or impose a cap on the total collective annuity. The trial judge rejected the argument that the Crown was under a sui generis fiduciary duty to administer the ceded land on behalf of the treaty beneficiaries, but she accepted that the principle of the honour of the Crown and an ad hoc fiduciary duty require the Crown to diligently implement the Augmentation Clause. At Stage Two, the trial judge ruled that Crown immunity and provincial limitations legislation did not bar the plaintiffs claims. Stage Three was argued but has been stayed pending the present appeals. The Huron plaintiffs did not participate in Stage Three as they reached a settlement with Ontario and Canada dealing with claims for compensation in respect of past breaches of the Augmentation Clause. \n\tThe Court of Appeal allowed in part Ontarios appeals from the Stage One judgment and amended the trial judges Stage One orders. It dismissed Ontarios appeals from the Stage Two judgment. The court issued four sets of reasons with a shifting majority on each issue. A majority ruled that treaty interpretation is a question of law reviewable on a correctness standard, even when informed by findings of fact that are reviewable on a deferential standard. A different majority held that the trial judge did not err in her interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, except in concluding that the Robinson Treaties promised the Anishinaabe a fair share of the net Crown revenues. It agreed that there is a mandatory and reviewable obligation on the Crown to increase the annuities when the economic conditions warrant, and that the reference to 1 is a limit only on the part of the total annuity that may be distributed to individuals. It also held that the honour of the Crown obliges the Crown to increase the annuities beyond $4 as part of its duty to diligently implement the treaties. The Court of Appeal unanimously agreed with the trial judge that the Crown does not have unfettered discretion about whether to increase the annuities. As well, it held that, given the Crowns neglect of the treaty promise for almost 150 years, the court had the authority and obligation to impose specific and general duties on the Crown regarding the Augmentation Clause. Further, the Court of Appeal unanimously ruled that the trial judge erred in finding that the Crown is under an ad hoc fiduciary duty regarding the implementation of the Augmentation Clause, but agreed that no sui generis fiduciary duty arises. The court also concluded that no statutory limitation period precluded the claims for breach of the Robinson Treaties, and that it was not necessary to consider Crown immunity. Finally, a majority of the court held that the nature of the revenue sharing required by the Augmentation Clause is to be determined by the parties in negotiations or by the trial judge in Stage Three.\n\tOntario appeals to the Court, raising questions about the appropriate standard of review for the interpretation of the Robinson Treaties, the proper interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crowns obligation to give effect to that clause and the appropriate remedy for its breach, and the relevance of statutory limitation periods to the claims. The Huron and Superior plaintiffs cross-appeal on the question of the Crowns fiduciary duties. Before the Court, neither Canada nor Ontario disputes that they are in longstanding breach of the annuity promises.\n\tHeld: The appeals should be allowed in part, the cross-appeals dismissed, and a declaration issued.\n\tThe interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties is reviewable for correctness. Applying this standard of review to the instant case, along with the relevant treaty interpretation principles, the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time, whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can increase the annuities beyond $4 per person, it must exercise its discretion and decide whether to do so and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not unfettered; it is to be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the Crown. In addition, given the longstanding and egregious nature of the Crowns breach of the Augmentation Clause, the Crown must exercise its discretion and increase the annuities with respect to the past. Having already reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches with the Huron plaintiffs, the Crown is directed to engage in time-bound and honourable negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs about compensation for past breaches. As well, the breach of treaty claims are not statute-barred by Ontarios limitations legislation. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of the augmentation promise, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to diligently fulfill this promise. The Crowns ongoing breach of the Augmentation Clause, in the circumstances, is also a breach of the treaties themselves.\n\tTreaties are sui generis agreements intended to advance reconciliation. The Crowns assertion of sovereignty gave rise to a distinctive legal relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples. That distinctive legal relationship is reflected in treaties, which represent an exchange of solemn promises and are governed by special rules of interpretation. In order to promote reconciliation, treaty rights must be interpreted and implemented in accordance with the honour of the Crown  the principle that servants of the Crown must conduct themselves with honour when acting on behalf of the sovereign.  \n\tAlthough all treaty rights must be interpreted in accordance with the honour of the Crown, there are important differences between historic (pre-1921) and modern (post-1973) treaties. The words in an historic treaty must not be interpreted in their strict technical sense nor subjected to rigid modern rules of interpretation. They should be liberally construed and ambiguities or doubtful expressions should be resolved in favour of the Indigenous signatories. The goal of treaty interpretation is to choose from among the various possible interpretations of common intention the one which best reconciles the interests of both parties at the time the treaty was signed. In searching for the common intention of the parties, the integrity and honour of the Crown is presumed. The court must be sensitive to the unique cultural and linguistic differences between the parties, and the words of the treaty must be given the sense which they would naturally have held for the parties at the time. While construing the language generously, the court cannot alter the terms of the treaty by exceeding what is possible or realistic. Treaty rights must not be interpreted in a static or rigid way; they are not frozen at the date of signature. Because a court must consider both the words of a treaty and the historical and cultural context, it is useful to approach treaty interpretation in two steps: at the first step, the court focuses on the words of the treaty clause at issue and identifies the range of possible interpretations, and at the second step, the court considers those interpretations against the treatys historical and cultural backdrop.\n\tThe standard of review for the interpretation of historic treaties is correctness. The constitutional nature of treaties as nation-to-nation agreements that engage the honour of the Crown and the process of reconciliation itself demands that appellate courts be given wide latitude to correct errors in their interpretation when necessary. The perpetual, multi-generational nature of treaty rights calls for the consistency of interpretation that is the goal of correctness review. A courts interpretation of treaty rights will be binding in perpetuity and has a significant precedential character. In addition, historic Crown-Indigenous treaties are binding not only on their direct signatories; they are binding upon all Canadians who, because of the Crowns assertion of sovereignty, are also effectively implicated. A courts interpretation of an historic treaty thus has extensive normative reach, which further supports correctness review.\n\tAlthough the interpretation of an historic treaty right is reviewable for correctness, the factual findings underpinning that interpretation attract deference and are reviewable only for palpable and overriding error. The policy rationales supporting such deference include the need to limit the number, length, and cost of appeals, to promote the autonomy and integrity of trials, and to recognize the expertise and advantageous position of the trial judge who has reviewed the evidence. The last of these is particularly significant in historic treaty interpretation where the trial judges factual determinations are the product of a robust and highly involved trial process.  \n\tThe wording of the Augmentation Clause in the Robinson Treaties must be considered in the context of the purpose of the treaties as a whole. Under the treaties, the Anishinaabe ceded their interest in identified lands, were granted reserve lands to live on, retained treaty rights to hunt and fish, and were promised a perpetual annuity. The Robinson Treaties departed from the fixed annuity model used in other treaties, as they allowed for the annuities to be increased or decreased, depending on the circumstances. The Augmentation Clause contemplates some general notion of sharing future revenues of the ceded territories. It gives voice to the Crowns goal of acquiring immediate access to the ceded territories and opening them up to settlement and economic development. It is also consistent with the Anishinaabes perspectives on the treaty relationship: it demonstrates respect by acknowledging both the Anishinaabes jurisdiction over the land and their authority to conclude an agreement with the newcomers; it shows reciprocity by making concrete their expectation that a gift would attract a reciprocal gift of commensurate value; it embodies responsibility in affirming the Anishinaabes ongoing duties to their people, at the time the Robinson Treaties were signed and in perpetuity; and it allows for renewal since the treaties would adjust as economic circumstances changed. \n\tAt step one of the two-step framework for treaty interpretation, the wording of the Augmentation Clause must be examined to identify its possible interpretations. It provides that the annuities shall be augmented from time to time if the ceded lands produce an amount that would allow the Crown to increase the annuities without incurring loss. A condition of the augmentation promise is that the amount paid to each individual would not exceed 1 a year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. Although there are various possible interpretations of the Augmentation Clause, the real debate is between an interpretation that involves both a collective and an individual part to the annuity, and an interpretation that involves only one individual part. There is an ambiguity as to what the parties intended, because the annuity is stated in another clause of the treaties to be delivered to the Chiefs and their Tribes, while the Augmentation Clause refers to the amount paid to each individual. \n\t In order to choose the interpretation that comes closest to reflecting the parties common intention, it is necessary to proceed to the second step of the treaty interpretation framework and consider the wording of the Augmentation Clause against its historical and cultural backdrop. It is only at the end of the two-step exercise that a genuinely ambiguous treaty term can be resolved. Both the language of the Augmentation Clause and its historical and cultural context support an interpretation that involves only one component: a perpetual annuity payable to the Chiefs and their Tribes that could be increased if an economic condition was met  i.e., if the economic circumstances permitted the Crown to do so without incurring loss. The reference to the amount paid to each individual not exceeding $4 does not create an obligation to pay an annuity to individuals, separate from an obligation to pay the collective; it merely imposes a condition on the obligation to augment the annuity. It would have been highly unusual for the Crown to have included in the middle of the Augmentation Clause an obligation to pay a part of the annuity to individuals, separate from the obligation to pay the collective, as this would be a fundamental change to the established patterns of treaty making and would have been unprecedented. As well, there is no evidence of an intention to grant an annuity divided between a collective part and an individual part, or that either party believed that the annuity had both collective and individual parts. Finally, the manner in which payments were made tends to refute the suggestion of a bifurcated annuity; neither the Huron nor the Superior annuity has ever been paid contemporaneously to both the collective and to individuals. \n\tThus, the proper interpretation of the Augmentation Clause is that it obliges the Crown to pay a single annuity to the Anishinaabe Chiefs and their Tribes. There is a mandatory obligation to increase the annuity up to $4 when the economic circumstances warrant, as was done in 1875. This increased annuity is a soft cap beyond which further increases are discretionary. If the economic conditions are such that the Crown can increase the annuity beyond $4 per person without incurring a loss, the Crown must exercise its discretion to determine whether to do so and, if so, by how much. This exercise of discretion is not unfettered; it is justiciable and reviewable by the courts. The Crown must exercise its discretion, including as to how often it turns its mind to increasing the annuity, diligently, honourably, liberally, and justly, while engaging in an ongoing relationship with the Anishinaabe based on the values of respect, responsibility, reciprocity and renewal. \n\tThe Huron and Superior plaintiffs breach of treaty claims are not statute-barred by Ontarios 1990 Limitations Act. First, the plaintiffs breach of treaty claims are not actions on the case subject to a limitation period under the Act. An action on the case was a common law action that allowed plaintiffs to bring claims for personal wrongs and injuries that could not be brought in trespass; they were generally limited to actions in the nature of tort, but in some cases were extended to actions in the nature of contract as well. A claim for breach of a treaty right is fundamentally different than an action on the case. Treaty claims are not based in tort or contract: they are based on constitutional rights, engaging issues of public law rather than private law. Moreover, the 1990 Limitations Act applies only to a closed list of enumerated causes of action, and the action on the case cannot be used as a catch-all cause of action or basket clause capturing any claim not expressly mentioned in the Act. In addition, in the 2002 amendments to the Act, Aboriginal and treaty rights were excluded from the limitation periods established in the statute. In making these amendments, the legislature understood that treaty claims are distinct from other causes of action, and dealt with such claims explicitly. \n\tSecond, the plaintiffs claims for equitable compensation are also not actions of account subject to a limitation period under the 1990 Limitations Act. While actions of account can include common law and equitable claims, the origin and scope of this type of action suggest it is ill-suited to the context of Crown-Indigenous treaties. An action of account was typically used at common law against a person who was required to render an account to another because of a fiduciary relationship. While the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples is fiduciary in nature, no specific fiduciary obligation arises in the instant case to potentially bring the plaintiffs claims within the scope of actions of account. In addition, the correct interpretation of the Augmentation Clause reveals that the Crown is not required to account to the treaty beneficiaries for the proceeds of the ceded territories. Rather, increases to the annuities beyond $4 are discretionary. Finally, there appears to be no precedent treating Aboriginal or treaty rights as actions of account.\n\tThe honour of the Crown is a constitutional principle that must guide the interpretation and implementation of the Augmentation Clause and the appropriate remedies for the Crowns breach. Although the honour of the Crown is a powerful constitutional doctrine, it is not a cause of action in itself; rather, it speaks to how obligations that attract it must be fulfilled. It is not a mere incantation, but rather a core precept that finds its application in concrete practices, and gives rise to different duties in different circumstances. \n\tThe honour of the Crown can give rise to a fiduciary duty where the Crown assumes discretionary control over a cognizable Aboriginal interest. The Crown may owe ad hoc and sui generis fiduciary duties to Indigenous peoples in respect of certain interests. An ad hoc fiduciary duty may arise from the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples where the general conditions for such a private law fiduciary relationship are satisfied  that is, where the Crown has undertaken to exercise its discretionary control over a legal or substantial practical interest in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary. In the instant case, this duty does not arise. There is no evidence that the Crown undertook to act in the best interests of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs or with utmost loyalty in discharging its obligations. Moreover, in exercising its discretion about whether to increase the annuities, the Crown must consider the wider public interest; its obligations regarding the Augmentation Clause could not have involved an undertaking to forsake the interests of all others in favour of the Anishinaabe.\n\tA sui generis fiduciary duty is specific to the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples. Its origins lie in protecting the interests of Indigenous peoples in recognition of the degree of economic, social, and proprietary control and discretion asserted by the Crown over them. A sui generis fiduciary duty arises where there is: (1) a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest; and (2) a Crown undertaking of discretionary control over that interest. In the instant case, there is no specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest identified by the Huron and Superior plaintiffs. Their treaty right under the Augmentation Clause is, by definition, not sufficiently independent of the Crowns executive functions, because it arises from the exercise of the Crowns executive treaty-making function. Nor is the Huron and Superior plaintiffs pre-existing interest in their ceded land a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest. Even if it were, the second requirement for a sui generis fiduciary duty  an undertaking by the Crown of discretionary control over the interest  is not met: neither the treaty text nor the context in which the Robinson Treaties were signed provide any evidence that the Crown would administer the land on behalf of the treaties beneficiaries.\n\tWhile the Crown is not subject to a fiduciary duty in respect of the Augmentation Clause, the Crown is subject to a duty to diligently implement or fulfill that promise, and its failure to do so is a breach of the Robinson Treaties. The duty of diligent implementation holds the Crown responsible for making good on its treaty promises. This duty flows directly from the honour of the Crown and requires the Crown to take a broad purposive approach to the interpretation of a promise and to act diligently to fulfill it. This requires that the Crown seek to perform the obligation in a way that pursues the purpose behind the promise. The duty of diligent implementation cannot impose only procedural obligations regarding the implementation of the Augmentation Clause  by which the Crown would simply be required to consider or turn its mind to discretionary increases to the annuities from time to time. While the duty of diligent implementation speaks to how Crown obligations must be fulfilled, rather than specifying a particular result in a given case, courts must guard against divorcing the duty of diligent implementation from the very nature of the treaty promise at issue. Since 1875, the Crown has failed to consider whether it can increase the annuities, and thus has breached its duty to diligently implement the treaties Augmentation Clause. In these circumstances, the Crown is required to pay an amount, which is subject to review by the courts, to compensate the Superior plaintiffs for its past breach of the Augmentation Clause.\n\tBecause the Crown has breached its duty to diligently fulfill the Augmentation Clause under the Robinson Treaties, the Huron and Superior plaintiffs are entitled to a remedy. In principle, the full range of remedies  declaratory and coercive  is available. Courts should take a purposive approach to determining the appropriate remedy. The controlling question is what is required to maintain the honour of the Crown and to effect reconciliation. In the instant case, the Anishinaabe have been left with an empty shell of a treaty promise for almost a century and a half. In this context, a declaration setting out the rights and obligations of the treaty parties, including the Crowns obligations under the Augmentation Clause, will be a helpful and appropriate remedy as it will inform both the future implementation of the Robinson Treaties and clarify the nature of the past breach.  \n\tAt the same time, given the longstanding and egregious nature of the Crowns breach, a declaration alone would be insufficient. Although the Crown was able to increase the annuities beyond $4 per person without incurring loss in the past, and it should have exercised its discretion to do so, well over a century has passed since the Crown has turned its mind to that promise, and to the renewal of the relationship itself. The Crown has severely undermined both the spirit and substance of the Robinson Treaties. In these circumstances, a simple declaration would not adequately repair the treaty relationship or restore the honour of the Crown, sufficiently vindicate the treaty rights, or meaningfully advance reconciliation. A mere declaration would risk forcing the Anishinaabe to continue to rely on a historically dishonourable treaty partner. This would be deeply unsatisfactory and would risk leaving the Anishinaabe with an empty shell of a promise once again.\n\tGiven that the Crown has reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches with the Huron plaintiffs, but not with the Superior plaintiffs, further direction should be provided to the Crown regarding the Superior plaintiffs to ensure that it exercises its discretion under the Augmentation Clause in a timely and honourable manner regarding compensation for past breaches. In respect of the period from 1875 to the present, the Crown must increase the annuity payable to the Superior plaintiffs under the Robinson Treaties beyond $4 per person retrospectively since it would be patently dishonourable not to do so. However, proceeding immediately to a judicially calculated damages award for past breaches would not be appropriate at this time, given the nature of the treaty promise as a discretionary one, the proper role of the courts, and the need to effectively repair the treaty relationship and restore the honour of the Crown. The Augmentation Clause is not a promise on the part of the Crown to pay a certain sum of money. Rather, it is a promise to consider whether the economic conditions allow the Crown to increase the annuities without incurring loss and, if they do, to exercise its discretion and determine whether to do so and, if so, by how much. Until the Crown has exercised that discretion through honourable engagement with its treaty partners and has proposed an amount of compensation, it should generally not be judicially compelled to pay a certain sum. A judicially calculated damages award would remove any Crown discretion and any engagement between treaty partners. \n\tInstead, a narrow, time-bound window for honourable negotiation, after which the Crown would be required, failing a settlement, to exercise its discretion honourably and determine an amount of compensation, has greater potential to fulfill the purposes of the Augmentation Clause and hold the Crown to account for its breach of the treaty to date. Negotiation and agreement outside the courts have better potential to renew the treaty relationship, advance reconciliation, and restore the honour of the Crown. This approach would also respect the proper role of the courts. The amount by which the Crown might increase the annuity is a polycentric and discretionary determination that will inevitably reflect many social, economic, and policy considerations that may change over time, affecting the frequency and nature of net revenue and annuity calculations. Determining the amount of compensation owed for the past will involve similar considerations, including weighing the solemnity of the Crowns obligations to the Anishinaabe against the needs of other Ontarians and Canadians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike. This is well within the expertise of the executive branch, but is much less within that of the courts. While courts are not incompetent or unable to entertain these considerations when necessary, they are generally not well equipped to make such choices or to evaluate the wide-ranging consequences that flow from policy implementation. Accordingly, courts should exercise considerable caution before intervening.\n\tAlthough it is not the business of the courts to force the Crown to exercise its discretion in a particular way, it is very much their business to review exercises of Crown discretion to ensure compliance with treaty obligations and the honour of the Crown. The Crown should be directed to engage meaningfully and honourably with the Superior plaintiffs in an attempt to arrive at a just settlement regarding past breaches. If such a settlement cannot be mutually agreed upon, the Crown will be obliged to exercise its discretion under the Augmentation Clause and set an amount as compensation. That amount, and the process through which it is arrived at, will be subject to review by the courts. The courts should focus on the justification of the Crowns determination and consider factors such as: the nature and severity of the Crowns past breaches; the number of Superior Anishinaabe and their needs; the benefits the Crown has received from the ceded territories; the wider needs of other Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations of Ontario and Canada; and principles and requirements flowing from the honour of the Crown, including its duty to diligently implement its sacred promise under the treaty to share in the wealth of the land. If the Crown has exercised its discretion liberally, justly, and honourably, then the courts should not intervene. If the courts find that the Crowns process or its ultimate determination was not honourable, they may consider the appropriate remedy, including whether to remand the issue to the Crown for redetermination or set the amount to be paid by the Crown.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: R. v.

Under these treaties, the Anishinaabe of the northern shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior ceded their vast territories in exchange for, among other things, an annual payment in perpetuity. The annuities were to be increased over time under certain circumstances. However, for almost 150 years, the annuities have been frozen at a shocking $4 per person, after the first and only increase was made in 1875. Today, in what can only be described as a mockery of the Crowns treaty promise to the Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes, the annuities are distributed to individual treaty beneficiaries by giving them $4 each.\nThis is the second time that issues relating to the annuity payments under the pre-Confederation Robinson Treaties have come before this Court. The last time, shortly after Confederation, involved an exercise of finger-pointing by Canada and the provinces as to who had to pay the annuities (Province of Ontario v. Dominion of Canada (1895), 25 S.C.R. 434, affd Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. Attorney-General for Ontario, [1897] A.C. 199 (J.C.P.C.) (In re Indian Claims)). In the more than 125 years since then, Canada and Ontario have shown a persistent pattern of indifference to the Crowns treaty obligations. Belatedly, before this Court, neither Canada nor Ontario disputes that they are in longstanding breach of the annuity promises under the Robinson Treaties. Although the Anishinaabe have upheld their end of the treaty bargain, the Crown has failed to do the same. Remedying this failure and restoring the honour of the Crown requires returning to the foundations of the treaty relationship between the Anishinaabe and the Crown.\nThe Robinson Treaties built on a close relationship between the British and the Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes that existed long before 1850. That relationship was guided by the Covenant Chain alliance, dating back to the 17th century, which symbolized the close connection between the British Crown and Indigenous peoples, including the Anishinaabe. The British and the Anishinaabe maintained this connection in part through annual gift-giving around sacred council fires as expressions of mutual generosity and goodwill (see H. Bohaker, Doodem and Council Fire: Anishinaabe Governance through Alliance (2020), at pp. xxvi and 17-18). As European settlement increased, the Crown assured the Anishinaabe that their autonomy and title to land would be protected.\nBy the mid-1800s, however, that assurance was jeopardized as the Crown began unilaterally granting mining licences to settlers along the northern shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior. The Anishinaabe demanded a treaty to provide them with compensation for the use of their traditional unceded territories. In September 1850, after significant negotiations between the Anishinaabe and the Crowns representative, William Benjamin Robinson, the Huron and Superior Anishinaabe entered into land cession treaties with the Crown around a council fire at Bawaating or Sault Ste. Marie.\nThe two treaties are substantially the same, each promising a lump-sum payment of 2,000 in addition to an annual payment of 500 under the Robinson-Superior Treaty and 600 under the Robinson-Huron Treaty. These promises are accompanied by a clause in each treaty that provides for the augmentation of the annuities under certain circumstances (Augmentation Clause). The interpretation of that clause and the remedies for its breach are at the heart of these appeals.\nThe trial in this case was divided into three stages. At Stage One, the trial judge, Hennessy J., concluded that the Crown has a mandatory and reviewable obligation to increase the annuities under the Robinson Treaties when the economic circumstances permit it to do so without incurring a loss. She held that, to fulfill this obligation, the Crown must engage in consultation with the treaty beneficiaries and pay an increased annuity reflecting a fair share of net Crown resource-based revenues from the ceded territories. She also concluded that the treaty relationship engaged the honour of the Crown and that the Crown has fiduciary duties as well as a duty to diligently implement its treaty promises. At Stage Two, the trial judge determined that neither Crown immunity nor provincial limitations legislation barred the Anishinaabe plaintiffs breach of treaty claims. Stage Three, addressing remedies, was argued before these appeals were heard but has been stayed pending this Courts decision.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed Ontarios appeals from the Stage One trial judgment in part, and dismissed its appeals from the Stage Two judgment. A five-judge panel, comprised of Strathy C.J.O. and Lauwers, Hourigan, Pardu and Brown JJ.A., released four sets of reasons addressing various issues. The justices of the Court of Appeal agreed on much, including the absence of specific fiduciary duties arising out of the treaty relationship and the inapplicability of the provincial limitations regime to the Anishinaabes claims. The Court of Appeal divided, however, on several key issues, including the appropriate standard of review for historic treaty interpretation, the proper interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, and what the honour of the Crown requires when implementing the treaty promises. \nOntarios appeals before this Court raise questions about the standard of review for historic treaty interpretation, the proper interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crowns obligation to give effect to that clause and the appropriate remedy for a breach of that obligation, as well as limitations issues. The cross-appeals by the Huron and Superior plaintiffs ask this Court to reconsider whether the Crown has fiduciary duties under the Robinson Treaties. \nIn what follows, I conclude that although a trial judges findings of historical fact attract deference, the interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties is reviewable for correctness. Correctness review is mandated for treaty interpretation because of the precedential and constitutionally protected nature of treaty rights and because treaties engage the honour of the Crown. Applying this standard of review, along with the treaty interpretation principles articulated by this Court, the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time, whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can increase the annuities without incurring loss, it must exercise its discretion and decide whether to increase the annuities and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not unfettered; it is to be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the Crown. Although the Augmentation Clause is not in itself a promise to pay the Anishinaabe a certain sum of money, no party doubts that the Crown was able to increase the annuities beyond $4 per person without incurring loss, and that it should have exercised its discretion to do so. Thus, in my view, the Crown must increase the annuity under the Robinson Treaties beyond $4 per person retrospectively, from 1875 to the present. It would be patently dishonourable not to do so. I further conclude, as both courts below did, that the plaintiffs breach of treaty claims are not statute-barred by Ontarios limitations legislation. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of the Augmentation Clause, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to diligently fulfill this promise. The Crowns ongoing breach of its augmentation promise, in the circumstances, is also a breach of the treaties themselves.\nFor almost a century and a half, the Anishinaabe have been left with an empty shell of a treaty promise. In this context, a declaration setting out the rights and obligations of the treaty parties, including the Crowns obligations under the Augmentation Clause, is undoubtedly a helpful remedy. But given the longstanding and egregious nature of the Crowns breach, a declaration alone will not help repair the treaty relationship or restore the Crowns honour. As I have indicated, the Crown must exercise its discretion and increase the annuities with respect to the past. The Crown has reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches with the Huron plaintiffs, but not with the Superior plaintiffs. With a view to respecting the nature of the treaty promise, repairing the treaty relationship, restoring the honour of the Crown, and advancing reconciliation, I would also direct the Crown to engage in time-bound and honourable negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs about compensation for past breaches of the Augmentation Clause. If the Crown and the Superior plaintiffs cannot arrive at a negotiated settlement, the Crown will be required, within six months of the release of these reasons, to exercise its discretion and determine an amount to compensate the Superior plaintiffs for past breaches. \nGiven this direction, Stage Three, if required, must be modified in accordance with these reasons and would function as a review by the courts of the Crowns process in determining the amount of compensation, and of the amount determined, both of which must be just and honourable. If the court finds that the amount determined by the Crown is not honourable, it may require the Crown to redetermine the amount or set the amount to be paid by the Crown, lest the Crown continue to undermine the very object and purpose of the treaty promise.\nAt the end of the oral submissions before this Court, Ontarios counsel stated: . . . I accept I am facing [a] 150 year history where the Crown in the broad sense has failed to engage on this, but we are here and we are listening and you are going to tell us how to approach this (transcript, day 2, at p. 109). In the reasons that follow, it should be clear that Ontario and Canada must act now to respect their treaty promises to the Anishinaabe, and to help restore the honour of the Crown and the nation-to-nation alliance that the treaties represent. Doing so will require each party, but especially the Crown, to recall the purposes behind the treaty promises. The Robinson Treaties are not merely transactional instruments about the exchange of money for a tract of land. They are living agreements embodying a relationship nurtured over many years before 1850 and requiring ongoing renewal into the future. It is time for the parties to return to the council fire and rekindle the perpetual relationship that the Robinson Treaties envision. Nothing less will demonstrate the Crowns commitment to reconciliation.\nFacts\nThe essential historical facts are not materially in dispute before this Court. They were helpfully summarized in the reasons of the Court of Appeal, from which the following summary is drawn. Understanding almost 300 years of evolution in the relevant Crown-Indigenous relationship is a daunting task, but a necessary one. The historical setting provides valuable context for understanding the Robinson Treaties and what the honour of the Crown requires in their implementation. \nThe Anishinaabe of the Upper Great Lakes\nThe Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes are members of several First Nations who historically inhabited and continue to inhabit the northern shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior. The Anishinaabe were organized in bands, each occupying and harvesting discrete territories considered as communal property, and each speaking dialects of their Indigenous language, Anishinaabemowin.\nThe lands subject to the Robinson Treaties exceed 100,000 square kilometres, including the current communities of Thunder Bay, North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, and Sudbury. At the time the treaties were signed in 1850, there were 1,422 individual beneficiaries of the Robinson-Huron Treaty and 1,240 beneficiaries of the Robinson-Superior Treaty. Although the number of current beneficiaries has yet to be determined definitively, evidence at trial suggested that in September 2017 there were 29,926 beneficiaries of the Robinson-Huron Treaty and 13,546 beneficiaries of the Robinson-Superior Treaty, living both on- and off-reserve.\nThe Anishinaabes System of Law and Governance\nThe Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes have a longstanding system of law and governance that informed, and continues to inform, their perspectives on the Robinson Treaties. Two key organizing principles of Anishinaabe law and governance are pimaatiziwin, the principle that everything is alive and sacred, and gizhewaadiziwin, the way of the Creator, which encompasses sacred laws of creation. When the treaties were signed, decision making in Anishinaabe society was deliberative and consensus-based. Anishinaabe Ogimaa (Chiefs or leaders) worked to achieve agreement among their people and were expected to provide generously for their communities. Ogimaa would host council fires where community decisions and agreements were made.\nThe Anishinaabes system of governance and their relationship with the Crown have always been based on the values of respect, responsibility, reciprocity, and renewal. The Anishinaabe sought respect for their jurisdiction and their authority to conclude agreements to share their territory. They acted with a sense of responsibility to ensure their people could continue to depend on the land for sustenance, shelter, medicines, and spiritual well-being. Reciprocity, essential to the formation of alliances, meant that a gift would attract a reciprocal gift of commensurate value, based on the idea of mutual interdependence. This value reflects the notion that people must rely on one another to survive, not simply as an economic necessity, but also as a moral imperative. Renewal invoked the idea that relationships, such as the treaty relationship with the Crown, are ongoing and must be renewed continually.\nThe Historical Context of Anishinaabe-Crown Relations\nThe Covenant Chain Alliance\nAt the end of the Seven Years War (1756-1763) between the British and the French, the British sought to secure the neutrality of various Indigenous nations, including the Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes, who had fought alongside the French. They did so by extending to them an alliance, known as the Covenant Chain, which dated back to the early 17th century and was a symbol of the close connection between British settlers and Indigenous peoples. The alliance was originally between the British and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, and was later extended to others, including the Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes.\nThe Covenant Chain alliance was symbolized by a ship tied to a tree with an iron chain to signal the interdependence of the British settlers and Indigenous nations. As the trial judge noted, [t]he metaphor associated with the chain was that if one party was in need, they only had to tug on the rope to give the signal that something was amiss, and all would be restored (2018 ONSC 7701, 431 D.L.R. (4th) 32 (Stage One reasons), at para. 65 (footnote omitted)). The trial judge described the Covenant Chain alliance as exemplifying the kind of cross-cultural merging of diplomatic protocols and legal orders that was common in the decades leading up to the signing of the Robinson Treaties (para. 89).\nThe Royal Proclamation, 1763\nIn response to an uprising against the British by various Indigenous nations, including Anishinaabe warriors, the British Crown issued the Royal Proclamation, 1763 (G.B.), 3 Geo. 3 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1). This became a defining moment in Canadian history and provided the impetus for the Robinson Treaties. In the Proclamation, the Crown unilaterally asserted sovereignty over what is now Canada, but also affirmed pre-existing Aboriginal title and ownership of unpurchased lands. The Proclamation created special rules for the purchase and sale of Lands of the Indians to prevent fraud and abuse, prohibited private parties from purchasing such lands, and stipulated that they could only be surrendered to the Crown.\nThe Council at Niagara (1764)\nThe year after the Proclamation, at a Council at Niagara attended by over 1,700 Indigenous people, including Anishinaabe leaders, the Crown again assured the Indigenous attendees of their autonomy and stated that the Crown would maintain and protect their title to their lands. Gifts and wampum belts were exchanged, including the Great Covenant Chain Wampum and the 24 Nation Wampum. The trial judge described the Great Covenant Chain Wampum as an embodiment of the merged symbols of diplomacy between the two groups, visually represented on the belt by two figures holding hands as part of two links in a chain (Stage One reasons, at paras. 90 and 412).\nThe War of 1812\nAs part of the Covenant Chain alliance, Anishinaabe warriors fought alongside the British against the Americans and their Indigenous allies in the War of 1812 (1812-1815). One such warrior was Chief Shingwaukonse, who would play a key role at the Robinson Treaty Council. The military alliance between the Crown and the Anishinaabe was an important part of their ongoing relationship.\nThe Annuity Model and Civilization Policy\nAs settlement and resource development in Upper Canada (now Ontario) expanded in the early 19th century and the need for military alliances with Indigenous communities decreased, the Crown changed its Indigenous relations policy in two ways that would shape the content of the Robinson Treaties.\nFirst, increased migration drove the Crown to change its compensation model for land cession treaties. Beginning in 1818, the Crown replaced one-time lump-sum payments with per person annuities of 2.10 or about $10 per person, regardless of the size or value of the land ceded. This allowed the Crown to control its cash flow while continuing to open up more land for settlement. This amount was used in various treaties negotiated until 1850.\nSecond, by 1830, the Crown had begun implementing its so-called civilization policy, which aimed to reclaim Indigenous peoples from barbarism and assimilate them into a Christian, agrarian lifestyle. This led to greater controls on the payment of annuities to prevent the misuse of funds. In 1830, Lieutenant Governor Sir John Colborne instituted the Colborne Policy, which mandated that annuities be held by the Crown and credited to the Indigenous treaty party, rather than distributed to individuals directly. Annuities were paid through a requisition system under which band chiefs could ask for items for their bands that promoted a sedentary, agricultural, European way of life. This policy remained in place in 1850 when the Robinson Treaties were concluded.\nEvents Leading to the Robinson Treaties\nMining in the Upper Great Lakes Region\nMining in the upper Great Lakes region in the 1840s was a key factor leading to the negotiation of the Robinson Treaties. During the 1840s, prospectors had begun exploring the south side of Lake Superior for minerals. In 1845, as the prospectors moved further north, the Crown began issuing mining licences in the upper Great Lakes region, even though the Crown had no treaty with the Anishinaabe. The Anishinaabe objected to the encroachments onto their land. Anishinaabe Chiefs, including Chief Shingwaukonse, reminded the Crown of their claims to their territories, which the Crown had promised to respect, and of their past military support. By now, Anishinaabe Chiefs were concerned about the impact resource development was already having on their ability to subsist on their land. They began demanding a treaty to compensate them for the use of their traditional territories.\nThe Vidal-Anderson Commission (1849)\nAfter pressure by Anishinaabe leaders, in 1849 the provincial government established the Vidal-Anderson Commission to evaluate the Anishinaabes grievances and to prepare the way for a treaty. The Commission was headed by provincial land surveyor Alexander Vidal and Indian Superintendent Thomas G. Anderson, who both travelled to the northern shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior to meet with 16 of the 22 Anishinaabe Chiefs. The Commissions report, delivered on December 5, 1849, affirmed the willingness of the Anishinaabe to treat with the Crown, provided that they could continue to hunt and fish, were given reserves to live on, and were paid a perpetual annuity as compensation. The report also set out possible terms for a treaty, including a surrender of the whole territory, which would allow the Crown to dispose of the land without encumbrance, and a perpetual annuity tied to the discovery of new wealth in the territory. \nNo previous treaty had linked an annuity payment to the potential future value of ceded land. Describing the Anishinaabe lands as a vast but sterile territory (Stage One reasons, at para. 178), the Commission ultimately recommended a lower annuity than the standard $10 per person provided under other treaties, along with the promise of an increased payment upon discovery and development of any new sources of wealth.\nThe Mica Bay Incident (1849)\nOn November 19, 1849, shortly before the Vidal-Anderson Commission delivered its report, Chief Shingwaukonse and Chief Nebenaigoching of the Huron Anishinaabe led a group of about 100 Anishinaabe to protest a mining site at Mica Bay. This intensified the need for a land cession agreement. The Governor General, Lord Elgin, ordered the arrest of the Anishinaabe participants, including the two chiefs, and directed the provincial government to make a treaty with the Anishinaabe of the upper Great Lakes. \nThe Negotiation of the Robinson Treaties (1850)\nIn January 1850, William Benjamin Robinson was appointed as treaty commissioner and tasked with negotiating final land cession agreements with the Huron and Superior Anishinaabe. Robinson, who had met Chiefs Shingwaukonse and Nebenaigoching while they were in jail in Toronto after the Mica Bay incident, had experience in the fur trade, the mining sector, and the treaty-making process. He also had excellent relations with the Anishinaabe and spoke some Anishinaabemowin.\nRobinsons mandate, as set out in two orders in council, was to secure a treaty covering the northern shores of Lake Huron and Lake Superior for the smallest possible initial payment (less than 5,000), with a perpetual annuity no higher than what the Crown believed could be economically generated from an investment of the notional capital sum of 25,000 less the initial payment, and a provision for a reduced annuity if the population fell below 600.\nThe funds available to Robinson for the intended treaty were modest and could not support the $10 per person annuity provided under other contemporaneous treaties. This was likely because the provincial government felt the Anishinaabe were not giving up much, since the economic prospects of the land were viewed as bleak, but also because Upper Canada was in financial crisis.\nThe treaty negotiations were held over three weeks in the late summer of 1850. The only records adduced at trial of the details of the negotiations were Robinsons diary and his official report. The records of speeches made by the Anishinaabe Chiefs at the Treaty Council have been lost. Robinson met first with the Superior delegation, led by Chief Peau de Chat, and afterwards with the Huron delegation, led by Chief Shingwaukonse. The delegations then jointly went to substantive treaty discussions at a Treaty Council in Sault Ste. Marie on September 5, 1850, which was conducted in Anishinaabemowin and English and incorporated ceremonies and protocols typical of Great Lakes diplomacy. These ceremonies indicated that the Crown representatives had at least a functional understanding of Anishinaabe law, diplomacy, and language. \nRobinson began by proposing reserves for the Anishinaabe to live on and hunting rights throughout the ceded territory that were more expansive than the Crowns standard practice. The Anishinaabe accepted these proposals without further discussion.\nRobinson then raised the issue of compensation. The Anishinaabe delegations preferred a perpetual annuity in exchange for the entire territory, rather than a lump-sum payment for just the existing mining locations. Robinson offered the full amount he had available: 4,000 in cash and a perpetual annuity of 1,000, to be divided between the Superior and Huron First Nations. Robinson tried to justify this offer, which was lower than the amount provided under past treaties, by referring to the unique character of the land and the value of the other promises to be included. He explained that the lands were of lower quality than other lands in Upper Canada and would likely remain unsettled, except in a few places by mining companies. Additionally, the Anishinaabe would retain hunting and access rights on the ceded land, and they would benefit from trading opportunities offered by the settlers. Chief Peau de Chat, on behalf of the Superior delegation, and Chief Shingwaukonse, on behalf of the Huron delegation, each asked for time to consult their respective Councils.\nThe next day, September 6, 1850, Chief Peau de Chat advised Robinson that the Superior delegation agreed to the proposed terms. Chief Shingwaukonse, however, told Robinson that the Huron delegation did not, and made a counterproposal for an annuity of $10 per person. Robinson rejected this and told Chief Shingwaukonse that a majority of the chiefs had agreed to his proposal and he would draft treaties as approved by the Superior delegation. The trial judge found that Robinsons first offer had included an augmentation clause under which the Crown would increase the annuity if it received revenues from the territory that would permit it to do so without incurring loss.\nOn September 7, 1850, Robinson read the treaty aloud to the Superior delegation. It included an annuity of 500. Two interpreters provided translation services from English to Anishinaabemowin. Chief Peau de Chat advised Robinson that he understood the treaty and was ready to sign on behalf of the Superior delegation. As Robinson recorded in his diary, [t]hey were all perfectly satisfied & said they were ready to sign it (Appellants Condensed Book, at p. 47).\nLater the same day, Robinson met with the Huron delegation. Chief Shingwaukonse repeated his counterproposal. Robinson rejected this again and stated that those who signed the treaty would receive compensation for their people, but those who did not would receive nothing and would be without a treaty. \nOn September 9, 1850, Chief Shingwaukonse and Chief Nebenaigoching renewed the request for a $10 per person annuity and raised the subject of land grants for the Metis. Mr. Robinson rejected both requests and had the Robinson-Huron Treaty read aloud to the delegation. Once again, translation services were provided. The treaty included a 600 annuity  100 more than under the Robinson-Superior Treaty to reflect the larger Huron population  but was otherwise substantially the same as the Robinson-Superior Treaty. The trial judge found that Robinson would have wanted the delegates to understand the augmentation clause and would therefore have insisted that the clause be carefully explained (Stage One reasons, at para. 235). When Chiefs Shingwaukonse and Nebenaigoching saw that the other Huron Chiefs had accepted the proposed terms, they signed the treaty.\nRobinson then paid the chiefs the initial sum and the treaties were presented to Prime Minister Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine on September 19, 1850. Robinsons final report was delivered to the Indian Superintendent five days later. A month later, an order in council declared the treaties were to be ratified and confirmed.\nKey Provisions of the Robinson Treaties\nThe Robinson Treaties, which are reproduced in full in an appendix to these reasons, have four common features. First, under both treaties, the Anishinaabe released or ceded their interest in the lands north of Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Second, the treaties assured the Anishinaabe that, despite ceding these lands, they would retain treaty rights to hunt and fish. Third, both treaties established reserves from the ceded territory for the Anishinaabe to live on. And fourth, both treaties provided for the payment of a lump sum with a perpetual annuity.\nFor present purposes, three clauses in each treaty are relevant. The first is a Surrender Clause, under which the Anishinaabe surrendered or ceded their interest in the lands. The second is a Consideration Clause, which provided for an initial lump-sum payment of 2,000 under each of the Robinson Treaties, with a perpetual annuity of 600 under the Robinson-Huron Treaty and 500 under the Robinson-Superior Treaty. The third, and most important for these appeals, is an Augmentation Clause, which provides for an increase of the perpetual annuity under certain conditions. These three clauses are reproduced below, with headings for each clause added for convenience.\nRobinson-Huron Treaty\nThe Surrender Clause\n\n. . . [the Anishinaabe of the Lake Huron territory] inhabiting and claiming the eastern and northern shores of Lake Huron from Penetanguishene to Sault Ste. Marie, and thence to Batchewanaung Bay on the northern shore of Lake Superior, together with the islands in the said lakes opposite to the shores thereof, and inland to the height of land which separates the territory covered by the charter of the Honorable Hudsons Bay Company from Canada, as well as all unconceded lands within the limits of Canada West to which they have any just claim . . . fully, freely and voluntarily surrender, cede, grant and convey unto Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors for ever, all their right, title and interest to and in the whole of the territory above described, save and except the reservations set forth in the schedule hereunto annexed . . . .\n\nThe Consideration Clause\n\n. . . for and in consideration of the sum of two thousand pounds of good and lawful money of Upper Canada to them in hand paid, and for the further perpetual annuity of six hundred pounds of like money, the same to be paid and delivered to the said Chiefs and their tribes at a convenient season of each year, of which due notice will be given, at such places as may be appointed for that purpose . . . .\n\nThe Augmentation Clause\n\nThe said William Benjamin Robinson, on behalf of Her Majesty, Who desires to deal liberally and justly with all Her subjects, further promises and agrees that should the territory hereby ceded by the parties of the second part at any future period produce such an amount as will enable the Government of this Province, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then and in that case the same shall be augmented from time to time, provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound Provincial currency in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order; and provided further that the number of Indians entitled to the benefit of this treaty shall amount to two-thirds of their present number, which is fourteen hundred and twenty-two, to entitle them to claim the full benefit thereof; and should they not at any future period amount to two-thirds of fourteen hundred and twenty-two, then the said annuity shall be diminished in proportion to their actual numbers.\nRobinson-Superior Treaty\nThe Surrender Clause\n\n. . . [the Anishinaabe of the Lake Superior territory] from Batchewanaung Bay to Pigeon River, at the western extremity of said lake, and inland throughout that extent to the height of land which separates the territory covered by the charter of the Honorable the Hudsons Bay Company from the said tract. And also the islands in the said lake within the boundaries of the British possessions therein . . . freely, fully and voluntarily surrender, cede, grant and convey unto Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors forever, all their right, title and interest in the whole of the territory above described, save and except the reservations set forth in the schedule hereunto annexed . . . .\n\nThe Consideration Clause\n\n. . . for and in consideration of the sum of two thousand pounds of good and lawful money of Upper Canada to them in hand paid; and for the further perpetual annuity of five hundred pounds, the same to be paid and delivered to the said Chiefs and their Tribes at a convenient season of each summer . . . . \n\nThe Augmentation Clause\n\n. . . The said William Benjamin Robinson, on behalf of Her Majesty, who desires to deal liberally and justly with all Her subjects, further promises and agrees that in case the territory hereby ceded by the parties of the second part shall at any future period produce an amount which will enable the Government of this Province, without incurring loss, to increase the annuity hereby secured to them, then and in that case the same shall be augmented from time to time, provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound Provincial currency in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order; and provided, further, that the number of Indians entitled to the benefit of this Treaty shall amount to two-thirds of their present number (which is twelve hundred and forty), to entitle them to claim the full benefit thereof, and should their numbers at any future period not amount to two-thirds of twelve hundred and forty, the annuity shall be diminished in proportion to their actual numbers. \nPayment of the Annuities After 1850\nBased on the Anishinaabe population of the Huron and Superior territories in 1850, the annuity was about $1.70 and $1.60 per person, respectively. Except for a brief period between 1851 and 1854 when the Huron annuity was paid in goods to each band, the Huron annuity has been paid in cash to individuals from 1855 to the present. The Hudsons Bay Company was responsible for distributing the Superior annuity in cash to the head of each family through the 1850s and until the 1870s. Since 1875, when the annuity was increased to $4, it has been paid in cash to all individual beneficiaries. This was the first and only increase to the annuities ever made.\nAfter years of demands by various chiefs, in 1875 the Government of Canada increased the annuity to $4 per person, which since then has been paid to the beneficiaries of the Robinson Treaties. The chiefs successfully petitioned for the government to pay arrears for 1850 to 1874 to recognize that the economic conditions for increasing the annuity had existed before the 1875 increase. After a dispute between Canada, Ontario, and Quebec over who was constitutionally required to pay arrears after Confederation was appealed to this Court and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (In re Indian Claims), the Crown finally began paying arrears to treaty beneficiaries in 1903.\nThis Litigation\nThe Superior plaintiffs filed a statement of claim in 2001 seeking declaratory and compensatory relief relating to the interpretation, implementation, and alleged breach of the Augmentation Clause of the Robinson-Superior Treaty. The Huron plaintiffs filed their own claim in 2014. The actions were tried together in three stages. Stage One proceeded by way of motions for summary judgment and addressed the interpretation of the treaties. Stage Two, which also proceeded by way of motions for summary judgment, considered Ontarios defences of Crown immunity and limitations. Stage Three concerns the plaintiffs claims for damages and the allocation of liability between Canada and Ontario. Stage Three has been argued based on evidence adduced by the parties and taken under reserve by the trial judge. The appeals to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and this Court concerned only Stages One and Two.\nJudicial History\nFaced with an extensive evidentiary record and many complex legal issues, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal approached their tasks with great sensitivity and care. Both courts provided comprehensive and considered reasons, reflecting the complexity and importance of the issues involved. The following summarizes their decisions, with more detail provided when addressing each issue under appeal.\nOntario Superior Court of Justice (Stage One), 2018 ONSC 7701, 431 D.L.R. (4th) 32 (Hennessy J.)\nIn the Stage One decision, the trial judge held that the Crown has a mandatory and reviewable obligation under the Augmentation Clause to increase the annuities when the economic circumstances warrant (para. 3). She ruled that [t]he economic circumstances will trigger an increase to the annuities if the net Crown resource-based revenues permit the Crown to increase the annuities without incurring a loss (para. 3). The Crown must engage in a consultative process with the treaty beneficiaries and pay an increased annuity reflecting a fair share of the net Crown resource-based revenues (see paras. 535, 559 and 576). In the trial judges view, the reference to 1 (at the time, equal to approximately $4) in the Augmentation Clause limits only the amount distributed to individuals, but does not limit or impose a cap on the total collective annuity. \nThe trial judge rejected the argument that the Crown was under a sui generis fiduciary duty to administer the ceded land on behalf of the treaty beneficiaries, but she accepted that the principle of the honour of the Crown and an ad hoc fiduciary duty require the Crown to diligently implement the augmentation promise. She also articulated several general principles to guide Stage Three of the trial relating to the relevant Crown revenues and expenses. Finally, the trial judge rejected Ontarios argument that a term for indexation of the annuities should be implied to account for inflation, ruling that the Augmentation Clause was meant to deal with such a circumstance.\nOntario Superior Court of Justice (Stage Two), 2020 ONSC 3932, 452 D.L.R. (4th) 604 (Hennessy J.)\nIn the Stage Two decision, the trial judge ruled that Crown immunity and the applicable provincial limitations legislation did not bar the plaintiffs claims. She held that Crown immunity under the Proceedings Against the Crown Act, 1962-63, S.O. 1962-63, c. 109, did not prevent the plaintiffs from recovering for breach of fiduciary duty or breach of treaty before this legislation came into force on September 1, 1963. She also held that the plaintiffs treaty claims were not barred by the former Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (1990 Limitations Act), either as claims under a simple contract, specialty, or action on account (paras. 174 and 179), and ruled that no specific limitation period under that legislation applied to breach of treaty claims.\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario (Stages One and Two), 2021 ONCA 779, 466 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (Strathy C.J.O. and Lauwers, Hourigan, Pardu and Brown JJ.A.)\nA five-judge panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario allowed Ontarios appeals in part from the Stage One judgment and dismissed its appeals from the Stage Two judgment. The court issued four sets of reasons: joint reasons of the court summarizing the facts and decisions below, and three additional sets of reasons addressing various issues, with a shifting majority on each issue.\nStandard of Review\nThe majority (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A., Lauwers J.A. concurring) ruled that treaty interpretation is a question of law reviewable on a correctness standard, even when informed by findings of fact that are reviewable on a deferential standard. The minority (per Hourigan J.A., Pardu J.A. concurring) would have called for a new approach under which treaty interpretation is viewed as a question of mixed fact and law reviewable for palpable and overriding error, absent extricable errors of law, which are reviewable for correctness (paras. 528 and 552). \nInterpretation of the Robinson Treaties\nThe majority (per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., Hourigan J.A. concurring) held that the trial judge did not err in her interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, except in concluding that the Robinson Treaties promised the Anishinaabe a fair share of the net Crown revenues from the ceded territories. They agreed with the trial judge that the Robinson Treaties impose a mandatory and reviewable obligation on the Crown to increase the annuities when the economic conditions warrant. They also agreed that the reference to 1 (or $4) in the Augmentation Clause is a limit only on the amount that may be distributed to individuals and is part of an uncapped aggregate amount that must be increased when the Crown can do so without sustaining a loss. \nThe minority (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A.) held that the trial judge made extricable errors of law in her interpretation of the Robinson Treaties by: (1) failing to consider the plain meaning of the treaties text; (2) finding ambiguity where there was none; (3) going beyond a generous interpretation of the treaties by exceeding what was possible based on the wording used; and (4) failing to consider the only reasonable interpretation of the treaties that reconciled the common intention of both parties. Like the majority, the minority rejected the trial judges conclusion that the treaties promised the Anishinaabe a fair share of the future revenues of the territory. In their view, the annuity did not have two parts, with one part distributed to the collective and the other to individuals. Rather, [t]he only reasonable interpretation is that there was only one annuity under each Treaty, which was to be (and in fact was historically) distributed in its entirety to the members of the First Nations (para. 415). The reference in the treaties to a cap of 1 (or $4) per person was a soft cap on the total value of the annuity, and could be further increased at the Crowns discretion, through the exercise of Her Majestys graciousness (para. 415).\nHonour of the Crown\nThe court was unanimous that the honour of the Crown is engaged, but diverged on what this requires when implementing the Augmentation Clause. The majority (per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., Hourigan J.A. concurring) held that the honour of the Crown obliges the Crown to increase the annuities beyond $4 as part of its duty to diligently implement the treaties. The minority (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A.) concluded that the honour of the Crown requires the Crown, at a minimum, to turn its mind from time to time to consider increasing the annuities beyond $4, and to periodically engage in a process with the treaty partners to determine the amount of the augmentation. However, the court unanimously agreed with the trial judge that the Crown does not have unfettered discretion about whether to increase the annuities, and that given the Crowns neglect of the treaty promise for almost 150 years, the court had the authority and obligation to impose specific and general duties on the Crown regarding the Augmentation Clause.\nFiduciary Duty, Crown Immunity, and Limitations\nJustice Hourigan delivered the unanimous reasons for the court on the issues of breach of fiduciary duty, Crown immunity, and limitations. He ruled that the trial judge erred in finding that the Crown is under an ad hoc fiduciary duty regarding the implementation of the Augmentation Clause. However, he agreed with the trial judge that no sui generis fiduciary duty arises. He further concluded that the 1990 Limitations Act does not preclude the claims for breach of the Robinson Treaties. Finally, Hourigan J.A. ruled that he did not need to consider Crown immunity because Ontario had invoked Crown immunity only regarding the claims for breach of fiduciary duty, which the court had rejected. The Court of Appeals conclusion on Crown immunity has not been appealed to this Court. \nRemedies\nThe majority (per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., Hourigan J.A. concurring) highlighted several features of the remedial context that the trial judge faced: the lack of effort in implementing the Augmentation Clause, other than in 1875, had resulted in a lack of guidance for future implementation; Ontario and Canada had rejected that they had any duties of disclosure or consultation in the implementation process; and the trial judge had no confidence that a simple declaration without more judicial direction would trigger good faith negotiations. In the majoritys view, the trial judge had erred in excluding the costs of infrastructure and institutions built with tax revenues from the calculation of net Crown resource-based revenues. The majority added that the form, level, and aim of the sharing required by the Augmentation Clause is to be determined by the parties in negotiations or by the trial judge in Stage Three.\nThe minority (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A.) would have directed the trial judge to invite further submissions in Stage Three concerning the implementation of the Augmentation Clause, including how often the Crown must turn its mind to the augmentation promise, what factors it should take into account in considering whether to increase the annuities, how a potential increase ought to be calculated, and any damages resulting from the Crowns breach of the augmentation promise.\nSubsequent Developments\nShortly after this Court granted leave to appeal and cross-appeal in June 2022, Ontario applied to this Court for an interim order staying Stage Three of the trial, which was scheduled to begin just weeks later, until this Court rendered its decision. The Huron and Superior plaintiffs opposed the relief sought and argued that Ontarios motion should be brought before the case management judge. Sitting as rota judge, I ordered Ontario to bring its motion to stay the hearing of Stage Three of the trial to the case management judge (Order of Jamal J. dated September 26, 2022). Ontario did so. Ontario moved to adjourn the Stage Three trial, then scheduled to begin in mid-January 2023, pending this Courts decision on the present appeals and cross-appeals. Ontarios motion was dismissed in late November 2022 and was not appealed further (2022 ONSC 7368).\nOn June 17, 2023, Canada, Ontario, and the Huron plaintiffs publicly announced that, as a result of negotiations that had been ongoing since April 2022, they had successfully concluded a proposed settlement for past claims under the Robinson-Huron Treaty for $10 billion, based on equal payments of $5 billion from each of Canada and Ontario. The proposed settlement was described in a joint press release as a major milestone in the ongoing collaborative work to renew the treaty relationship and honour a treaty promise that dates back to 1850 (Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, Robinson Huron Treaty Leadership, Ontario and Canada announce proposed settlement and next steps in Treaty annuities court case, June 17, 2023 (online)).\nAt the hearing before this Court, Ontarios counsel provided the following update. The $10 billion settlement among the Huron plaintiffs, Ontario, and Canada deals only with past claims and is not contingent on the result in these appeals. Because of the settlement, the Huron plaintiffs did not participate in Stage Three of the trial (transcript, day 1, at pp. 11-12; transcript, day 2, at p. 103). The Superior plaintiffs participated in Stage Three, claiming $126.285 billion from Canada and Ontario as at 2020. The Stage Three hearing concluded on September 26, 2023, with judgment reserved and expected to be delivered within six months (transcript, day 1, at pp. 1-12; transcript, day 2, at p. 103).\nAfter the hearing before this Court, the Chief Justice issued an order staying Stage Three of the trial pending this Courts decision (Order of Wagner C.J. dated November 9, 2023).\nOn December 15, 2023, federal legislation to fund Canadas $5 billion share of the settlement amount received royal assent (Bill C-60, An Act for granting to His Majesty certain sums of money for the federal public administration for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, 1st Sess., 44th Parl., 2021-22-23, enacted as Appropriation Act No. 4, 2023-24, S.C. 2023, c. 33, Sch. 1). The supplementary estimates document prepared by the federal government in support of Bill C-60 stated that the settlement relates to past annual payments under the 1850 Robinson-Huron Treaty and that [o]nce the agreement is finalized, funds will be paid to a trust established by the First Nations (Supplementary Estimates (B), 2023-24 (2023), at p. 1-2).\nOn February 26, 2024, the settlement was finalized and approved by the Ontario Superior Court, which applauded the historic agreement and confirmed that the settlement is to take effect regardless of the outcome of the appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada (2024 ONSC 1127, at paras. 10 and 13 (CanLII), per Morawetz C.J.).\nIssues\nOntarios appeals raise questions about the standard of review for the interpretation of historic treaties such as the Robinson Treaties, the proper interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crowns obligations to implement the Augmentation Clause and the appropriate remedy for the Crowns breach of those obligations, as well as limitations issues. The cross-appeals of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs raise whether the Crown has fiduciary duties under the Robinson Treaties.\nTo address these issues, I will consider the following questions:\nWhat are the governing principles for the interpretation of historic Aboriginal treaties such as the Robinson Treaties?\nWhat is the standard of review for the trial judges interpretation of the Robinson Treaties?\nWhat is the proper interpretation of the Augmentation Clause in the Robinson Treaties?\nAre the claims of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs under the Robinson Treaties statute-barred by provincial limitations legislation?\nWhat is the nature and content of the Crowns obligation to implement the Augmentation Clause? Does the Crown have duties flowing from the principle of the honour of the Crown, and is the Crown under a fiduciary duty?\nWhat is the appropriate remedy for the Crowns failure to implement the Augmentation Clause?\nAnalysis\nThe Interpretation of Historic Aboriginal Treaties\nI begin by reviewing the principles for interpreting historic Aboriginal treaties, which were correctly identified by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal. I will focus on four relevant features figuring prominently in the discussion of the standard of review that follows in the next section: the nature of treaties as sui generis agreements intended to promote reconciliation; the importance of interpreting treaty rights in accordance with the honour of the Crown; the differences between historic and modern treaties; and finally, the particular principles governing the interpretation of historic treaties and the two-step approach to interpretation set out in this Courts decision in R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456.\nTreaties Are Sui Generis Agreements Intended To Advance Reconciliation\nTreaties have long been an important means of reconciling the interests of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Reconciliation is aimed at building a mutually respectful long-term relationship (Beckman v. Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation, 2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 10; R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 533, at para. 30). It has been described as both a first principle of Aboriginal law (Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council), 2018 SCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765 (Mikisew Cree 2018), at para. 22) and the grand purpose of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (Little Salmon, at para. 10). \nAs this Court explained in Little Salmon, at para. 8, per Binnie J.:\nHistorically, treaties were the means by which the Crown sought to reconcile the Aboriginal inhabitants of what is now Canada to the assertion of European sovereignty over the territories traditionally occupied by First Nations. The objective was not only to build alliances with First Nations but to keep the peace and to open up the major part of those territories to colonization and settlement.\nThe Crowns assertion of sovereignty over Aboriginal societies gave rise to a distinctive or sui generis legal relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples (Desautel, at para. 25, citing R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, at para. 78). That distinctive legal relationship is reflected in treaties, which represent an exchange of solemn promises and are unique or sui generis agreements governed by special rules of interpretation (Simon v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 387, at pp. 404 and 410; R. v. Sioui, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1025, at pp. 1038 and 1043; Badger, at para. 41). Treaties are sui generis because they are the product of the special relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples that is aimed at achieving reconciliation (P. W. Hogg and L. Dougan, The Honour of the Crown: Reshaping Canadas Constitutional Law (2016), 72 S.C.L.R. (2d) 291, at p. 311).\nTreaty Rights Must Be Interpreted in Accordance With the Honour of the Crown\nThis Court has also affirmed that in order to promote reconciliation, treaty rights must be interpreted in accordance with the honour of the Crown, the principle that servants of the Crown must conduct themselves with honour when acting on behalf of the sovereign (Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para. 65). The honour of the Crown imposes an obligation of honourable dealing with Aboriginal peoples (Little Salmon, at para. 42). \nThe honour of the Crown is an ancient principle of common law dating back to pre-Norman England (Hogg and Dougan, at pp. 293-94, citing D. M. Arnot, The Honour of the Crown (1996), 60 Sask. L. Rev. 339). It was reflected in the Crowns promise in the Royal Proclamation, 1763 that it would protect the Aboriginal peoples inhabiting the British territories of North America from exploitation by non-Aboriginal peoples (Little Salmon, at para. 42). Because of its connection with s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, the honour of the Crown has been called a constitutional principle and is now an important anchor in this area of the law (Little Salmon, at para. 42; see also Manitoba Metis, at para. 69; Mikisew Cree 2018, at para. 24). \nThe honour of the Crown is always at stake in the Crowns dealings with Aboriginal peoples (Badger, at para. 41; Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at para. 16; Mikisew Cree 2018, at para. 23). The making, interpretation, and implementation of treaties must be approached in a way that maintains the honour and integrity of the Crown (Badger, at para. 41; Haida Nation, at paras. 17 and 19; Manitoba Metis, at para. 73). \nI will return to the honour of the Crown later when discussing the Crowns obligation to implement the Augmentation Clause of the Robinson Treaties.\nDifferences Between Historic and Modern Treaties\nAlthough all treaty rights must be interpreted in accordance with the honour of the Crown (Little Salmon, at para. 71; Hogg and Dougan, at pp. 314-16), there are important differences between historic and modern treaties. Historic treaties were negotiated between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples before 1921, while modern treaties were negotiated after 1973, in the wake of this Courts decision in Calder v. Attorney-General of British Columbia, [1973] S.C.R. 313. Calder recognized Aboriginal rights with respect to land and led the Government of Canada to negotiate modern treaties in those parts of Canada where there were no treaties (see P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  28:18; J. Jai, Bargains Made in Bad Times: How Principles from Modern Treaties Can Reinvigorate Historic Treaties, in J. Borrows and M. Coyle, eds., The Right Relationship: Reimagining the Implementation of Historical Treaties (2017), 105, at p. 105; J. Jai, The Interpretation of Modern Treaties and the Honour of the Crown: Why Modern Treaties Deserve Judicial Deference (2010), 26 N.J.C.L. 25, at pp. 27-28; D. Newman, Contractual and Covenantal Conceptions of Modern Treaty Interpretation (2011), 54 S.C.L.R. (2d) 475, at pp. 475-77). \nThe difference between historic and modern treaties is not primarily about the age of the document. As Binnie J. remarked in Little Salmon, at para. 54, [t]odays modern treaty will become tomorrows historic treaty. The distinction lies in the relative precision and sophistication of the modern document. Historic and modern treaties were each negotiated under markedly different circumstances and often resulted in very different treaty texts. Historic treaties were often relatively brief, negotiated quickly, and intended to record oral promises made by the Crown to Indigenous signatories, who usually required translation and did not have the benefit of legal advice (Badger, at paras. 52-53; Quebec (Attorney General) v. Moses, 2010 SCC 17, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 557, at para. 7; Jai (2010), at p. 27). Such treaties were typically expressed in lofty terms of high generality and were often ambiguous (Little Salmon, at para. 12). As a result, courts were obliged to resort to general principles (such as the honour of the Crown) to fill the gaps and achieve a fair outcome (para. 12). \nModern treaties, by contrast, are usually the product of lengthy negotiations between well-resourced and sophisticated parties (Little Salmon, at para. 9; First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun v. Yukon, 2017 SCC 58, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 576, at para. 36). They often consist of minutely detailed instruments, negotiated over the course of years, with the Indigenous signatories represented by lawyers and other experts (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 36; Moses, at para. 7; Hogg and Wright, at  28:38). As a result, because [c]ompared to their historic counterparts, modern treaties are detailed documents[,] deference to their text is warranted (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 36). \nPrinciples Governing the Interpretation of Historic Treaties\nThe legal principles governing the interpretation of historic treaties, such as the Robinson Treaties of 1850, are well established. The words in a treaty must not be interpreted in their strict technical sense nor subjected to rigid modern rules of [interpretation] (Badger, at para. 52, cited in Marshall, at para. 14). At the same time, as Binnie J. cautioned in Marshall, [g]enerous rules of interpretation should not be confused with a vague sense of after-the-fact largesse (para. 14):\nThe special rules are dictated by the special difficulties of ascertaining what in fact was agreed to. The Indian parties did not, for all practical purposes, have the opportunity to create their own written record of the negotiations. Certain assumptions are therefore made about the Crowns approach to treaty making (honourable) which the Court acts upon in its approach to treaty interpretation (flexible) . . . . The bottom line is the Courts obligation is to choose from among the various possible interpretations of the common intention [at the time the treaty was made] the one which best reconciles the [Aboriginal] interests and those of the British Crown (Sioui, per Lamer J., at p. 1069 (emphasis added)). [para. 14]\nIn Marshall, McLachlin J., as she then was, dissenting on other grounds, summarized the principles for interpreting treaties as including the following (at para. 78):\n1. Aboriginal treaties constitute a unique type of agreement and attract special principles of interpretation: R. v. Sundown, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 393, at para. 24; R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, at para. 78; R. v. Sioui, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1025, at p. 1043; Simon v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 387, at p. 404. See also: J. [Sakej] Youngblood Henderson, Interpreting Sui Generis Treaties (1997), 36 Alta. L. Rev. 46; L. I. Rotman, Defining Parameters: Aboriginal Rights, Treaty Rights, and the Sparrow Justificatory Test (1997), 36 Alta. L. Rev. 149. \n\n2. Treaties should be liberally construed and ambiguities or doubtful expressions should be resolved in favour of the [A]boriginal signatories: Simon, supra, at p. 402; Sioui, supra, at p. 1035; Badger, supra, at para. 52.\n\n3. The goal of treaty interpretation is to choose from among the various possible interpretations of common intention the one which best reconciles the interests of both parties at the time the treaty was signed: Sioui, supra, at pp. 1068-69.\n\n4. In searching for the common intention of the parties, the integrity and honour of the Crown is presumed: Badger, supra, at para. 41.\n\n5. In determining the signatories respective understanding and intentions, the court must be sensitive to the unique cultural and linguistic differences between the parties: Badger, supra, at paras. 52-54; R. v. Horseman, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 901, at p. 907.\n\n6. The words of the treaty must be given the sense which they would naturally have held for the parties at the time: Badger, supra, at paras. 53 et seq.; Nowegijick v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29, at p. 36.\n\n7. A technical or contractual interpretation of treaty wording should be avoided: Badger, supra; Horseman, supra; Nowegijick, supra.\n\n8. While construing the language generously, courts cannot alter the terms of the treaty by exceeding what is possible on the language or realistic: Badger, supra, at para. 76; Sioui, supra, at p. 1069; Horseman, supra, at p. 908.\n\n9. Treaty rights of [A]boriginal peoples must not be interpreted in a static or rigid way. They are not frozen at the date of signature. The interpreting court must update treaty rights to provide for their modern exercise. This involves determining what modern practices are reasonably incidental to the core treaty right in its modern context: Sundown, supra, at para. 32; Simon, supra, at p. 402.\nJustice McLachlin noted that because a court must consider both the words of a treaty and the historical and cultural context, it is useful to approach treaty interpretation in two steps. At the first step, the court focuses on the words of the treaty clause at issue and identifies the range of possible interpretations. At the second step, the court considers those interpretations against the treatys historical and cultural backdrop. As McLachlin J. explained (at paras. 82-83):\nFirst, the words of the treaty clause at issue should be examined to determine their facial meaning, in so far as this can be ascertained, noting any patent ambiguities and misunderstandings that may have arisen from linguistic and cultural differences. This exercise will lead to one or more possible interpretations of the clause. As noted in Badger, supra, at para. 76, the scope of treaty rights will be determined by their wording. The objective at this stage is to develop a preliminary, but not necessarily determinative, framework for the historical context inquiry, taking into account the need to avoid an unduly restrictive interpretation and the need to give effect to the principles of interpretation.\n\nAt the second step, the meaning or different meanings which have arisen from the wording of the treaty right must be considered against the treatys historical and cultural backdrop. A consideration of the historical background may suggest latent ambiguities or alternative interpretations not detected at first reading. Faced with a possible range of interpretations, courts must rely on the historical context to determine which comes closest to reflecting the parties common intention. This determination requires choosing from among the various possible interpretations of the common intention the one which best reconciles the parties interests: Sioui, supra, at p. 1069. Finally, if the court identifies a particular right which was intended to pass from generation to generation, the historical context may assist the court in determining the modern counterpart of that right: Simon, supra, at pp. 402-3; Sundown, supra, at paras. 30 and 33.\nJustice McLachlins legal framework in Marshall reflects the current state of the law. It has been cited approvingly by this Court (R. v. Morris, 2006 SCC 59, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 915, at para. 18; Little Salmon, at para. 105, per Deschamps J., concurring) and by appeal courts across Canada (Beattie v. Canada, 2002 FCA 105, 288 N.R. 254, at para. 9; Horseman v. Canada, 2016 FCA 238, at para. 8 (CanLII); Canada v. Jim Shot Both Sides, 2022 FCA 20, 468 D.L.R. (4th) 98, at para. 170, revd in part 2024 SCC 12; West Moberly First Nations v. British Columbia, 2020 BCCA 138, [2021] 3 W.W.R. 561, at paras. 105-6, 149 and 277; Chingee v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2005 BCCA 446, 261 D.L.R. (4th) 54, at para. 15; R. v. Morris, 2004 BCCA 121, 237 D.L.R.

Canada, 2001 SKCA 109, 206 D.L.R. (4th) 638, at paras. 39 and 53; Newfoundland and Labrador v. Nunatsiavut Government, 2022 NLCA 19, at para. 20 (CanLII)). It was also cited and applied in the case under appeal by the trial judge (Stage One reasons, at paras. 324, 327-29 and 398-475) and the Court of Appeal for Ontario (para. 109, per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., and paras. 388 and 421, per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A.).\nWith these principles in mind, I now turn to the standard of appellate review for the interpretation of historic treaties.\nThe Standard of Appellate Review for the Interpretation of Historic Treaties\nIntroduction\nThe question of the appropriate standard of appellate review for the interpretation of historic treaties was the subject of extensive submissions before the Court of Appeal and this Court. Important legal policy considerations militate toward both a more and less deferential standard on certain parts of the interpretive exercise. Greater deference may be justified because a court interpreting an historic treaty must often rely on the trial judges findings of fact based on historical evidence and expert testimony. But less deference may also be owed because treaty interpretation involves the application of constitutional principles such as the honour of the Crown, with lasting implications for the nation-to-nation relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Crown.\nThe majority in the Court of Appeal (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A., Lauwers J.A. concurring) ruled that a trial judges interpretation of historic treaties is reviewable for correctness. Drawing on Marshall and R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507, the majority held that despite the shift towards greater appellate deference to trial courts reflected in decisions of this Court such as Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, and Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, the Marshall standard of review remains in place, including the principle that legal inferences or conclusions regarding the meaning of a historical treaty provision drawn by a trial judge from historical facts are not entitled to deference on appellate review (para. 404). For the majority, the sui generis nature of treaties as agreements that are intended to last indefinitely offered policy support for this view (paras. 406-8).\nThe minority (per Hourigan J.A., Pardu J.A. concurring) would have recognized a new approach to appellate review of historic treaty interpretation by trial judges (para. 552). Under that approach, while extricable errors of law would still be reviewable for correctness (para. 577), treaty interpretation would be viewed as a question of mixed fact and law, reviewable only for palpable and overriding error (paras. 558-59). For the minority, the critical role of historical context and the special process trial courts engage in when interpreting historic Aboriginal treaties support a more deferential standard of review (paras. 563 and 570).\nBefore this Court, Ontario and Canada, supported by the Attorney General of New Brunswick, argue that the interpretation of historic treaties is primarily a question of law attracting correctness review. Findings of fact such as historical findings and credibility determinations continue to attract deference, but a trial judges ultimate conclusion as to the common intention of the treaty signatories does not. Conversely, the Huron and Superior plaintiffs, supported by most if not all of the interveners representing Indigenous organizations, assert that historic treaty interpretation is a mixed fact and law inquiry, similar in some respects to appellate review of contractual interpretation discussed in Sattva. While extricable errors of law would remain reviewable for correctness, a trial judges interpretation of treaty rights must be deferred to absent palpable and overriding error.\nAs I explain below, the question of whether historic treaty interpretation attracts appellate deference asks whether the trial courts interpretation of a treaty right must be correct. In my view, the answer is yes. Findings of historical fact are particularly important in interpreting historic treaties and attract appellate deference absent palpable and overriding error or an extricable error of law. However, the constitutionally protected nature of treaty rights requires that appeal courts be given broad scope to intervene on issues of treaty interpretation. As a result, the standard of review for the interpretation of historic treaties is correctness.\nDiscussion\nThe law on the standard of appellate review seeks to achieve an appropriate division of labour between trial and appellate courts in accordance with their respective roles (Ledcor Construction Ltd. v. Northbridge Indemnity Insurance Co., 2016 SCC 37, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 23, at para. 35). Trial courts primarily resolve factual and legal disputes raised before them, while appellate courts primarily ensure that legal rules are applied consistently, as required by the rule of law, and delineate and refine legal rules when necessary (para. 35; Housen, at para. 9).\nThe division of labour between trial and appellate courts is reflected in the rules governing the standard of appellate review for questions of law, questions of fact, and questions of mixed fact and law. Questions of law, which involve identifying what the correct legal test is (Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, at para. 35; Sattva, at para. 49), attract no appellate deference and are reviewable for correctness (Housen, at paras. 10, 19, 23, 28, 33 and 36; Benhaim v. St-Germain, 2016 SCC 48, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 352, at para. 36). Correctness review for questions of law recognizes the law-making function of appellate courts and ensures that legal rules are applied consistently in similar situations (Housen, at para. 9).\nFindings of fact, inferences of fact, and questions of mixed fact and law (which involve applying a legal standard to the facts) are, absent an extricable error of law, all reviewable for palpable and overriding error (Housen, at para. 26; Southam, at para. 26). The policy reasons for appellate deference to such questions include limiting the number, length and cost of appeals, promoting the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings, and recognizing the expertise of the trial judge and their advantageous position given their first-hand exposure to the evidence (Housen, at paras. 16-18). \nAs noted by former Justice Robert J. Sharpe, [a]t the core of the debate over the appropriate standard of review are the competing principles of deference and legality (Good Judgment: Making Judicial Decisions (2018), at p. 204). Deference entails an appellate court showing respect for a trial judges institutional advantages on factual issues and refraining from retrying the case on appeal (p. 204). Legality involves the appellate courts duty to ensure the overall legal integrity of the decision-making process and intervening when first-instance decisions do not respect the laws general standards (p. 204).\nGuiding Case Law\nOntario and Canadas correctness arguments rely heavily on the standard of review analysis in Van der Peet and Marshall. In Van der Peet, this Court set out distinct standards of review for the factual and legal inquiries involved in addressing Aboriginal rights. Factual findings attract deference, but determinations of the scope of Aboriginal rights do not. As Lamer C.J. explained in an oft-cited passage in Van der Peet (at para. 82):\nIn the case at bar, Scarlett Prov. Ct. J., the trial judge, made findings of fact based on the testimony and evidence before him, and then proceeded to make a determination as to whether those findings of fact supported the appellants claim to the existence of an [A]boriginal right. The second stage of Scarlett Prov. Ct. J.s analysis  his determination of the scope of the appellants [A]boriginal rights on the basis of the facts as he found them  is a determination of a question of law which, as such, mandates no deference from this Court. The first stage of Scarlett Prov. Ct. J.s analysis, however  the findings of fact from which that legal inference was drawn  do mandate such deference and should not be overturned unless made on the basis of a palpable and overriding error. [Emphasis added.]\nVan der Peet was an Aboriginal rights case, not a treaty case. Yet the correctness standard applied in Van der Peet to determine the scope of an Aboriginal right was later applied in Marshall, at para. 18, this Courts leading case on historic treaty interpretation. Writing for the majority in Marshall, Binnie J. cited the above passage from Van der Peet as also bearing on the interpretation of treaty rights. Findings of fact are given deference, while conclusions as to the scope of the relevant rights, based on the facts as found, are determinations of law attracting no deference (para. 18).\nOntario and Canada say that the standard of review applied in Marshall determines the standard in historic treaty interpretation more broadly. I disagree. As the Huron plaintiffs note, both Van der Peet and Marshall were decided based on errors that, after this Courts decision in Housen, are properly characterized as extricable errors of law. In Van der Peet, the trial judge had applied the wrong legal test when determining whether an Aboriginal right existed on the facts as he found them. In Marshall, the trial judge had failed to consider a relevant factor, namely, extrinsic evidence, when determining the existence and scope of the treaty right. Although both cases are relevant to determining the standard of review in these appeals, they are not dispositive.\nThe Huron plaintiffs cite cases outside the Aboriginal law context to urge a deferential standard of review. They suggest that the interpretive exercise in this Courts decision in Sattva, a case that overhauled the standard of review in contractual interpretation, shares parallels with historic treaty interpretation. Before Sattva, a trial judges interpretation of a contract was viewed as a question of law and attracted no deference. This Court in Sattva recharacterized the interpretation of a contract as a question of mixed fact and law and changed the presumptive standard of review from correctness to palpable and overriding error. The Huron plaintiffs acknowledge that treaties and contracts are distinct, but they say that the similarity of the fact-intensive and context-specific nature of treaty and contractual interpretation suggests that appellate deference is also justified in cases of treaty interpretation.\nI will address Sattva in more detail below. For now, it suffices to note that the analogy between treaty and contractual interpretation as both involving a mixed-fact-and-law inquiry is an imperfect one. Historic Aboriginal treaties are not contracts; they are far more than contracts (R. v. Sundown, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 393, at para. 24). This distinction is not merely semantics. It has real consequences for how courts interpret historic treaties, which is a significantly more complicated and nuanced exercise than contract interpretation. Unlike contracts, treaties are exchanges of solemn promises engaging the honour of the Crown and must be interpreted broadly, flexibly, and generously (para. 24; Moses, at para. 107, per LeBel and Deschamps JJ., dissenting on other grounds). As Professor Janna Promislow explains:\nServing the ends of justice in the treaty interpretation context, however, is more complex than the interpretation of contracts, due to the historical nature of the agreements and the constitutional character of the moments of agreement  and because the foundational values behind protecting historic treaty rights are arguably less understood and more contentious than the values behind protecting freedom of contract.\n\n(Treaties in History and Law (2014), 47 U.B.C. L. Rev. 1085, at p. 1172)\nI would make two additional observations about the jurisprudence on this issue. First, Marshall is not the only treaty case that provides guidance on the applicable standard of review. Other cases suggest that this Court has always reviewed treaty interpretation on a correctness standard. For example, in Ontario (Attorney General) v. Bear Island Foundation, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 570, this Court had to decide whether events after the signing of the Robinson-Huron Treaty had the effect of surrendering Aboriginal rights in unceded land. The Court affirmed that factual issues are reviewable for palpable and overriding error, but then immediately added that the legal findings based on those facts do not attract deference (pp. 574-75). Similarly, in Sundown, this Court held that a member of a Cree First Nation could build a hunting cabin as reasonably incidental to the exercise of a treaty right to hunt for food in a traditional expeditionary style. Speaking for the Court, Cory J. accepted the trial judges findings of fact, but then appeared to review the interpretation of the scope of the relevant treaty right for correctness (paras. 26-43). \nSecond, intermediate appellate courts have considered treaty interpretation as a question of law warranting correctness review (see Halfway River First Nation v. British Columbia (Ministry of Forests), 1999 BCCA 470, 178 D.L.R. (4th) 666, at para. 85; Lac La Ronge Indian Band, at para. 148; Fort McKay First Nation v. Prosper Petroleum Ltd., 2019 ABCA 14, at para. 39 (CanLII); and West Moberly First Nations, at paras. 363-64, where the majority (per Bauman C.J., Goepel J.A. concurring) applied correctness review, while the dissent (per Smith J.A.), at para. 130, would have applied the standard of palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law).\nIn these appeals, then, the question is whether there are persuasive grounds for this Court to refashion the presumptive standard of review for treaty interpretation. As the Huron plaintiffs fairly note, the inquiry is not whether Sattva has displaced Marshall, but whether the same policy considerations that were held to justify deference in Sattva, justify a similar approach here (R.F., at para. 44). I am not convinced that they do. Compelling considerations of legal policy suggest that correctness review should continue to apply to historic treaty interpretation.\nLegal Policy Considerations Supporting Correctness Review\nAs has been recognized by this Court and the scholarly literature, the choice of a particular standard of review reflects a legal policy determination about the nature and purpose of the appellate process in a given context  what this Court described as the appropriate division of labour between trial and appellate courts in accordance with their respective roles (Ledcor, at para. 35; see also Sattva, at para. 51; Housen, at paras. 8-36; Sharpe, at pp. 204-5 and 208-16; D. Jutras, The Narrowing Scope of Appellate Review: Has the Pendulum Swung Too Far? (2006), 32:1 Man. L.J. 61, at p. 66; Y.-M. Morissette, Appellate Standards of Review Then and Now (2017), 18 J. App. Prac. & Process 55, at p. 76; R. D. Gibbens, Appellate Review of Findings of Fact (1991-92), 13 Adv. Q. 445, at p. 445; J. Sopinka, M. A. Gelowitz and W. D. Rankin, Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin on the Conduct of an Appeal (5th ed. 2022), at 2.6-2.35).\nThis Courts decision in Sattva is instructive as to how the applicable standard of review is shaped by legal policy considerations. There, this Court explained that the interpretation of a written contract was generally considered a question of law. This rule originated in England at a time when there were frequent civil jury trials and widespread illiteracy (para. 43). The interpretation of written documents such as contracts was characterized as a question of law, not because the core questions were inherently legal, but because only the judge could be assured to be literate and therefore capable of reading the contract (para. 43). Today, that reasoning no longer applies. This led this Court to decide, as a matter of legal policy, that absent an extricable error of law, contractual interpretation should now be treated as a question of mixed fact and law reviewable for palpable and overriding error (para. 50). The principal factors for this change in legal policy were to limit appellate intervention to cases where the results could affect parties beyond the particular dispute and to reflect the role of appeal courts in ensuring the consistency of the law, rather than in providing a new forum for parties to continue . . . private litigation (para. 51). Deference to trial courts also promotes the goals of limiting the number, length, and cost of appeals, and of promoting the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings (para. 52).\nProfessor Daniel Jutras has helpfully explained that the standard of appellate review is not a matter of principle, in the sense that it does not turn on some essential nature of appeals, or on some fundamental right to error correction for disappointed litigants (p. 66). Rather, the standard of appellate review reflects an attempt to make the best and most effective compromise between competing policy considerations, at least some of which may extend beyond the immediate interests of the parties (p. 66; see also p. 71). In treaty interpretation, various aspirations and concerns must be managed, including the potential for delay, cost considerations, and the private interests of parties to the litigation, but also the wider public interest, the constitutional nature of the rights at stake, and the important role of the honour of the Crown in the interpretive task.\nAgainst this backdrop, there are at least two significant reasons why the interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties should be, as a matter of sound legal policy, subject to correctness review. First, treaty rights are constitutionally protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, and relatedly, treaties are nation-to-nation agreements that engage the constitutional principle of the honour of the Crown. And second, treaty interpretation has significant precedential value because it concerns enduring, multi-generational compacts. I will address each point in turn.\nTreaty Rights Are Constitutional Rights and Engage the Honour of the Crown\nAs already noted, historic Crown-Indigenous treaties are sui generis agreements protected under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The constitutional nature of treaty rights demands that appellate courts be given wide latitude to correct errors in their interpretation. Historic treaties establish or reaffirm a fundamental and enduring relationship between the Crown and an [A]boriginal people (B. Slattery, Making Sense of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights (2000), 79:2 Can. Bar Rev. 196, at p. 209). They are an exchange of solemn promises between the Crown and the various Indian nations (Badger, at para. 41). Since 1982, s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 has recognized and affirmed that existing treaty rights have constitutional status and attract related constitutional protections.\nThe special significance of constitutional rights for selecting the appropriate standard of review has been highlighted in various legal contexts. For example, despite lowering the presumptive standard of review for contractual interpretation, this Court in Sattva ruled that, in the commercial arbitration context, correctness would continue to apply where a constitutional questio[n] is at issue (paras. 50 and 106). Similarly, in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, this Court clarified that, in reviewing administrative decisions, the correctness standard applies to certain constitutional questions, including the scope of Aboriginal and treaty rights under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (paras. 17 and 55).\nAll the courts below recognized the constitutional character of treaty interpretation. The trial judge stated that s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 informs the exercise of treaty interpretation, and noted that [b]ecause treaty promises are analogous to constitutional provisions, they must be interpreted in a generous and liberal manner (Stage One reasons, at para. 336). She acknowledged that the Robinson Treaties enumerate rights protected by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (para. 463). She also recognized that [t]reaties are part of the constitutional fabric of this country (Stage Two reasons, at para. 151), a description later echoed by Hourigan J.A. in the Court of Appeal (C.A. reasons, at para. 634). Likewise, Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A. highlighted that, unlike ordinary contracts, treaties have a broader public, political role as foundational documents that establish the bases of relations between Aboriginal peoples and the larger Canadian community (para. 407, citing Newman, at p. 486).\nRelatedly, as noted above, treaties are nation-to-nation agreements that must be interpreted in accordance with the constitutional principle of the honour of the Crown. This transforms the interpretive exercise from a simple determination of the rights and obligations between private parties into an exercise of constitutional interpretation. The goal of this exercise of constitutional interpretation is ultimately to advance a matter of utmost public interest and concern  the process of reconciliation itself.\nIn this case, for example, this Court has to interpret the scope and content of constitutionally protected rights and obligations that embody the very conditions on which pre-existing Indigenous peoples agreed to share their most precious gift  the land itself  with newcomers. An appellate court must be able to correct errors in the interpretation of those rights when necessary, for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians alike.\nI would add that the applicable standard of review cannot turn on whether the Indigenous parties succeeded at trial. In the next case, the situation may be different. An Indigenous appellant will have a pressing interest in ensuring that an appellate court can review whether a trial judge correctly interpreted the relevant treaty rights when ruling against them. A correctness standard thus promotes justice for all parties when interpreting such foundational constitutional rights.\nHistoric Treaty Interpretation Has Significant Precedential Value\nAnother important factor in determining the appropriate standard of review is whether the trial courts decision on a particular issue has precedential value because it is likely to be of interest to judges and lawyers in the future (Ledcor, at paras. 41-43; Southam, at para. 37). Writing extra-judicially, Justice Yves-Marie Morissette has described this as the normative reach of a courts determination (p. 76). A decision involves a question of law if the reasons offered in support rule on not just the dispute of the parties before the court, but also extend to other actual or potential disputes (p. 76).\nIn the Court of Appeal, the majority (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A., Lauwers J.A. concurring) explained that historic treaty interpretation, because of the perpetual, multi-generational nature of treaty rights, calls for the consistency of interpretation that is the goal of correctness review (para. 410). The minority (per Hourigan J.A., Pardu J.A. concurring) was, however, reluctant to find the interpretation of the Augmentation Clause in the Robinson Treaties had significant precedential value because no other known treaty has such an escalating annuity provision (para. 557). \nIn my view, the significant precedential character, or broad normative reach, of a courts interpretation of the Augmentation Clause suggests that the standard of appellate review must be correctness. As the majority of the Court of Appeal suggested, a courts interpretation of these treaty rights will be binding in perpetuity. Treaty texts are evidence of the transgenerational rights and obligations of the treaties and their promises, and are meant to impose obligations on the British sovereign and the delegated colonial governments and subjects into the distant future (J. Y. Henderson, Treaty Rights in the Constitution of Canada (2007), at p. 33). The text of the Augmentation Clause itself requires the parties to revisit the amount of the annuity from time to time. The need for consistency of interpretation in the future strongly militates toward correctness review.\nYet the future-oriented significance of historic treaties is only one element of their precedential character. Historic Crown-Indigenous treaties are binding not only on their direct signatories; they are binding upon all Canadians who, because of the Crowns assertion of sovereignty, are also effectively implicated in these founding agreements. A treaty is a compact not only among the provinces or founding peoples, but also between the non-Aboriginal population and Aboriginal peoples (S. Grammond, Treaties as Constitutional Agreements, in P. Oliver, P. Macklem and N. Des Rosiers, eds., The Oxford Handbook of the Canadian Constitution (2017), 305, at p. 306). Seen from this perspective, a courts interpretation of an historic treaty has extensive normative reach. This further supports correctness review in historic treaty interpretation. A deferential standard of review ultimately allows for the possibility of errors that will remain uncorrected in the interest of finality (Jutras, at p. 67). Such a possibility is in tension with the precedential significance of historic treaty interpretation, not only for their immediate signatories, but for all Canadians, now and in the future.\nFactual Findings Remain Reviewable for Palpable and Overriding Error\nAlthough the interpretation of an historic treaty right is reviewable for correctness, the factual findings underpinning that interpretation, including findings of historical fact, attract deference and are reviewable only for palpable and overriding error (Housen, at para. 10; H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 25, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 53). The same deferential standard applies to inferences of fact (Housen, at para. 25; H.L., at para. 53).\nThe policy rationales supporting deference to such factual determinations include the need to limit the number, length, and cost of appeals, to promote the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings, and to recognize the expertise and advantageous position of the trial judge who has reviewed the evidence (Housen, at paras. 11-18; Gibbens, at pp. 445-48). The last of these is particularly significant in historic treaty interpretation where, as here, the trial judges factual determinations are the product of a robust and highly involved trial process. As the minority (per Hourigan J.A., Pardu J.A. concurring) said of the trial judge (at para. 576):\n\t. . . the trial judge took extensive efforts to involve and hear from the Indigenous Treaty partners. She conducted the proceedings in various Indigenous communities, immersed herself in the teachings of these communities many knowledge keepers, and permitted Anishinaabe ceremony to come into the courtroom and the court process, through witnesses, counsel, and members of the First Nations.\nThe minority said that appellate intervention in such circumstances would undervalu[e] the trial judges process and would suggest that the involvement of the Treaty partners, particularly the Indigenous signatories, did not make the trial judge better situated to decide the case (para. 576).\nThe trial judges sensitive trial process and deep engagement with Indigenous treaty partners undoubtedly made her better situated than an appellate court to decide factual matters, including the historical context in which the Robinson Treaties were signed and the credibility and reliability of witnesses (Van der Peet, at para. 81; Housen, at para. 20).\nHowever, Justice Hourigan at the Court of Appeal took this point further. He stated that findings of historical fact in historic treaty cases will essentially determine the legal consequences of those findings, and that it is artificial to see these as two inquiries each governed by different standards of review (para. 558):\nIn a case where the primary goal of the analysis is to ascertain the signatories intentions for executing a treaty, the determination of the historical facts and the legal consequences of those findings are usually two sides of the same coin. Once the trial judge has determined the parties intention, there is very little work remaining; the legal consequences flow directly from the fact-finding. It is artificial to suggest that there is a two-step process and that different review standards should apply to each step.\nI respectfully disagree with this reasoning. The legal meaning of an Aboriginal treaty is distinct from its factual or historical context. In this case, for example, the Court of Appeal agreed on a set of joint reasons outlining the findings of historical fact (at paras. 10-68), but disagreed on the legal significance of these facts when interpreting the Augmentation Clause of the Robinson Treaties. Although the trial judges findings of historical fact are undoubtedly important, they do not determine the issue of treaty interpretation.\nConclusion\nI conclude that while the trial judges factual findings, including her findings of historical fact, attract deference, her interpretations of the treaty rights do not. Having regard to these standards of review, I now turn to the interpretation of the Augmentation Clause of the Robinson Treaties.\nThe Interpretation of the Augmentation Clause in the Robinson Treaties\nIntroduction\nThe trial judge and the majority and minority of the Court of Appeal each applied the two-step Marshall framework and principles for treaty interpretation, but arrived at different readings of the Augmentation Clause. The key interpretive issues addressed by the courts below were: (1) whether the Augmentation Clause established an annuity with both a collective and an individual part; (2) whether increases to the annuity, or to any of its parts, were mandatory or discretionary; and (3) the manner in which the increases should be calculated. \nThe trial judge ruled that the Crown has a mandatory and reviewable obligation to increase the annuities when the economic circumstances warrant, which will occur if the net Crown resource-based revenues permit the Crown to increase the annuities without incurring a loss (Stage One reasons, at para. 3). In her view, the annuities must reflect a fair share of the net-Crown resource-based revenues of the ceded territory (para. 535). She interpreted the reference to 1 in the Augmentation Clause as limiting only the amount distributed to individuals, which could be increased in the Crowns discretion, but as not limiting or imposing a cap on the amount distributed to the collective (paras. 397 and 463-64).\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judges interpretation, except for her conclusion that the treaties promised the treaty beneficiaries a fair share of the net revenues from ceded territories (paras. 86, 123 and 308-25). The minority of the Court of Appeal also rejected the trial judges fair share conclusion, but identified other errors of law in the trial judges interpretation (paras. 448-86). To the minority, the Robinson Treaties did not promise a two-part annuity, with one part distributed to individual beneficiaries, and the other part to the collective (para. 415). The reference in the treaties to a cap of 1 (or $4) was a soft cap on the total value of the annuity that could be increased at the discretion of the Crown, through the exercise of Her Majestys graciousness (para. 415).\nBefore this Court, Ontario endorses the minoritys interpretation. Canada has not appealed from the Court of Appeal majoritys interpretation, but notes that its position at trial was closer to the minoritys view. The Huron and Superior plaintiffs endorse the majoritys reading.\nAs I explain below, although I agree with the minoritys interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, I respectfully disagree with some of its reasons. I will consider each of the two steps of the Marshall framework.\nStep One: Examining the Wording of the Augmentation Clause To Identify the Possible Interpretations\nThe wording of the Augmentation Clause must be considered in the context of the purpose of the Robinson Treaties as a whole. Under the treaties, the Anishinaabe ceded their interest in identified lands, were granted reserve lands to live on, retained treaty rights to hunt and fish, and were promised a lump sum of money and a perpetual annuity.\nThe Robinson Treaties departed from the fixed annuity model used in some other contemporary treaties. They allowed for the annuities to be increased or decreased, depending on the circumstances, rather than continuing as fixed amounts in perpetuity. The Crown broke with its longstanding practice since 1818 of setting the annuity at $10 per person multiplied by the population at the time the treaties were signed. Instead, the treaties provided for a lower initial annuity, with provision for future increases under certain conditions. In 1850, the annuity under the treaties was between $1.60 and $1.70 per person. In 1875, it was increased to $4 per person. In 1903, arrears were paid for the years between 1850 and 1876, because the Crown accepted that during this time its revenues would have permitted an increase to $4 per person without incurring loss.\nThe starting point in interpreting the Augmentation Clause is to examine the specific words used (Marshall, at para. 5, per Binnie J.) and to determine their facial meaning (para. 82, per McLachlin J.). As this Court has emphasized, the scope of treaty rights is determined by their wording (Badger, at para. 76). In this case, there was no suggestion that the treaties were modified by oral promises or that the Robinson Treaties incompletely recorded the agreement between the Anishinaabe and the Crown. There is also no dispute that, as the trial judge found as fact, the treaties were read aloud and translated from English to Anishinaabemowin and carefully explained to the Anishinaabe before they were signed (Stage One reasons, at paras. 230 and 234-35).\nThis case is unlike Marshall, in which this Court held that the written text of the peace and friendship treaties of 1760-61 between the British and the Mikmaq was incomplete (para. 41). There, the Court invoked the principle of the honour of the Crown to imply a right of access to things to trade as a necessary adjunct of an express right to trade referred to in the treaties (para. 44). Nobody has suggested on appeal to this Court that a term ought to be implied into the Robinson Treaties to give them efficacy. The Court must simply interpret the treaties under the principles in Marshall.\nThe relevant language is in the Consideration Clause and Augmentation Clause of each treaty, both of which are reproduced earlier in these reasons and in the appendix. \nUncontroversial Points About the Consideration and Augmentation Clauses\nSeveral points are uncontroversial about these clauses.\nFirst, as consideration under the Robinson-Huron Treaty, the Crown paid a lump sum of 2,000, plus a perpetual annuity of 600. Under the Robinson-Superior Treaty, the lump-sum payment was 2,000, and the perpetual annuity was 500. The Robinson-Huron beneficiaries received more because they had a larger population. \nSecond, the annuities are to be delivered to the Chiefs and their Tribes at a convenient season of each summer. \nThird, the Crown agreed that the annuity shall be augmented from time to time, if the ceded lands produce an amount that would allow the Crown to increase the annuity without incurring loss.\nFourth, a first condition of the augmentation is that the amount paid to each individual would not exceed 1 a year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. \nFifth, a second condition is that the annuity shall be diminished proportionately if the number of people entitled to claim the full benefit of the treaty falls to two-thirds of the population at the time the treaties were signed (1,422 under the Robinson-Huron Treaty and 1,240 under the Robinson-Superior Treaty).\nAmbiguities Identified by the Trial Judge\nThe trial judge identified two ambiguities in the Augmentation Clause. The first and most confounding ambiguity that she identified is whether the parties intended that the promise of a perpetual annuity would be a collective, as opposed to an individual, entitlement (Stage One reasons, at para. 400). This ambiguity arises, the trial judge said, because the perpetual annuity is stated to be delivered to the Chiefs and their Tribes, while any augmentation of the annuity refers to the amount paid to each individual. She said that there is an obvious missing link between the perpetual annuity paid to the Chiefs and their Tribes and the reference to individual payments (para. 405).\nThe second ambiguity that the trial judge identified was how to calculate the productivity of the territory to determine if and when increases are triggered (para. 410).\nFour Possible Interpretations of the Augmentation Clause\nHaving identified these two ambiguities, the trial judge set out three possible interpretations of the Augmentation Clause, and alluded to a fourth. These four interpretations provide a useful framework for this Courts interpretation of the clause.\nThe First Interpretation\nThe first interpretation is that the Crowns promise was capped at $4 per person; in other words, once the annuity was increased to an amount equivalent to $4 per person, the Crown had no further liability (Stage One reasons, at para. 459). On this interpretation, any increase above $4 per person is within the Crowns complete and unfettered discretion (para. 407). This was Ontarios position at trial and before the Court of Appeal. It was unanimously rejected by both levels of court, and Ontario has since abandoned it.\nThe Second Interpretation\nThe second interpretation is that the Crown was obliged to make orders (as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order) for further payments above $4 per person when the economic circumstances permitted the Crown to do so without incurring loss (Stage One reasons, at para. 460 (underlining added)), which the trial judge called the economic condition (para. 461).\nThe Third Interpretation\nThe third interpretation, which the trial judge said includes the second interpretation, is that the Treaties were a collective promise to share the revenues from the territory with the collective; that is, to increase the lump sum annuity so long as the economic condition was met (Stage One reasons, at para. 461). On this interpretation, [t]he reference to 1 (equivalent of $4) in the augmentation clause is a limit only on the amount that may be distributed to individuals (para. 461). The first condition  provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed the sum of one pound Provincial currency in any one year, or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order  creates a separate payment to individuals out of the total annuity.\nUnder the third interpretation, the treaty promise to an annuity thus involves two parts: a collective part that must be increased without limit and without discretion when the economic condition is met, and an individual part paid or distributed to individuals  what the trial judge described as a distributive amount (para. 464). The distributive amount is capped at 1 (or $4), unless the Crown exercises discretion to increase it (as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order). Crucially, on this view, the discretion contained in the words as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order qualifies only the individual or distributive part of the annuity, but not the collective part or, by extension, the annuity as a whole (see C.A. reasons, at paras. 198 and 203 (majority)). There is no discretion as to whether to increase the collective part of the annuity and, if so, by how much. That is dictated solely by the economic condition.\nThe third interpretation thus involves both a bifurcated and hybrid annuity. The annuity is bifurcated into collective and individual parts. It is also a hybrid annuity, in that the collective part is mandatory, completely without discretion, and without a cap, while the individual part is mandatory below $4 per person, but then discretionary above $4 per person once the $4 cap is reached. The third interpretation also results, as the Court of Appeal minority noted, in the collective [or total] entitlement being greater than the sum of the individual amounts that were to be distributed to members of the Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior Treaty First Nations (para. 413).\nThe third interpretation was advanced by the Huron and Superior plaintiffs at trial and ultimately adopted by the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal (per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., Hourigan J.A. concurring). It has been advanced again by the plaintiffs before this Court.\nThe Fourth Interpretation\nThe fourth interpretation, which the trial judge alluded to but did not explore, is that the annuity involves only one component  a perpetual annuity payable to the Chiefs and their Tribes  that would be increased if the economic condition was met. The annuity is subject to a cap of 1 (or $4) per person, but this is a soft cap and can be increased in the exercise of the Crowns discretion (as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order). This interpretation was explored and ultimately adopted by the minority of the Court of Appeal. The majority of the Court of Appeal never considered this interpretation.\nUnder the fourth interpretation, the reference to 1 (or $4) in the first condition of the Augmentation Clause (provided that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed 1) does not create a separate payment to individuals. Instead, it simply limits the amount by which the annuity can be increased. It recognizes that the population of treaty beneficiaries might grow, and that the total annuity obligation may correspondingly grow, increasing the Crowns overall obligation. The first condition, which allows for an increase in the overall annuity, is mirrored by the second condition, which provides for the annuity to be correspondingly reduced if the population falls below the stated number. Both conditions apply to the total annuity.\nOn this reading, increases up to $4 per person are mandatory, while increases above $4 per person are discretionary. There is no cap on the amount the Crown can provide in the exercise of its discretion. If the population of the treaty beneficiaries were to fall below two-thirds of the population at the time the Robinson Treaties were signed, the annuity would be reduced in proportion to the population (though this has never happened). The promised annuity thus has only one part: the payment to the Chiefs and their Tribes.\nThe fourth interpretation, which the trial judge acknowledged has a certain logic (Stage One reasons, at para. 456), largely reflected the position advanced by Canada at trial (paras. 377-80 and 408; Canadas R.F., at paras. 30 and 34). It was also the alternative position advanced by the Huron and Superior plaintiffs at trial (Stage One reasons, at para. 455; Huron plaintiffs memorandum of argument (Stage One), at paras. 757-60; Superior plaintiffs factum (Stage One), at para. 350).\nBefore this Court, Canada submits there is only a limited difference between the third and fourth interpretations adopted by the majority and minority of the Court of Appeal, respectively (R.F., at para. 31). Both interpretations require the Crown to diligently implement the Robinson Treaties by augmenting the annuities through an exercise of discretion. Both also recognize that the Crowns discretion is justiciable and not unfettered. Under the third interpretation, adopted by the majority, the Crowns obligation to augment the annuities is mandatory. Under the fourth interpretation, adopted by the minority, the Crowns obligation to augment the annuities is discretionary. Canada says that this difference ha[s] little practical effect for the past breaches of the treaties in these appeals (para. 33). This is because both Canada and Ontario have accepted that the annuities should be increased: the annuities have not been increased since they were set at $4 per person in 1875, and there is no debate that the economic condition is met (para. 33). As the Court of Appeal minority stated, in light of the Crowns neglect of the Treaty promise for over a century and a half, the court ha[s] the authority and the obligation to impose specific and general duties on the Crown (para. 503, citing Stage One reasons, at para. 497). Canada thus acknowledges that the Crowns failure to honour the Robinson Treaties for approximately 150 years is subject to the courts review and will be compensable (R.F., at para. 34). Ontario also accepts that the courts can review the Crowns failure to honour the Robinson Treaties, but says that remedies such as damages and compensation are inappropriate (A.F., at para. 111). \nI agree that given Ontario and Canadas concession that the annuities should be increased, there may be little practical difference between the third and fourth interpretations regarding the quantum of the annuities compensating for past breaches of the Robinson Treaties. The issue is far from academic, however, in relation to the remedy this Court should grant in these appeals or the future implementation of the Augmentation Clause. Whether the Augmentation Clause imposes a mandatory or discretionary obligation to augment the annuities, and whether the annuities have both collective and individual components, are issues that must be resolved. I will therefore proceed to the second step of the Marshall framework and consider the possible interpretations of the Augmentation Clause against the historical and cultural backdrop, to choose from among the possible interpretations the one that comes closest to reflecting the parties common intention.\nStep Two: Considering the Wording of the Augmentation Clause Against the Historical and Cultural Backdrop\nThe real debate before this Court, as it was before the Court of Appeal, is between the third and fourth interpretations of the Augmentation Clause. However, in the interest of completeness, I will say a few words about the first two interpretations.\nThe First Interpretation\nThe first interpretation  that the Crown has an unfettered and unreviewable discretion as to whether to increase the annuity above $4 per person  can be rejected summarily for reasons of legal principle. An interpretation based on unfettered discretion does not fit within Canadian notions of legality and cannot reflect the common intention of the parties to the Robinson Treaties. It is a legal impossibility.\nDiscretion refers to those decisions where the law does not dictate a specific outcome, or where the decision-maker is given a choice of options within constraints imposed by law (Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 52). The legal constraints can include, but are not limited to, statute, the principles of the rule of law, the principles of administrative law, the fundamental values of Canadian society, and the principles of the Charter (para. 56; see also Montreal (City) v. Montreal Port Authority, 2010 SCC 14, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 427, at paras. 32-33). In the present context, the relevant legal constraints include the constitutional principle of the honour of the Crown.\nThis Court has long recognized that there is no such thing as absolute and untrammelled discretion (Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121, at p. 140; Vavilov, at para. 108; References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 175, at para. 73). As noted by LeBel J. in Montreal (City), at para. 33, in a country founded on the rule of law and in a society governed by principles of legality, discretion cannot be equated with arbitrariness. Our law requires discretion to be exercised within a specific legal framework, and recognizes that [d]iscretionary acts fall within a normative hierarchy (para. 33). In a similar vein, Sir William Wade and Christopher Forsyth have stated that in a system based on the rule of law, unfettered governmental discretion is a contradiction in terms (Wade & Forsyths Administrative Law (12th ed. 2023), at p. 303). Wade and Forsyth declared that a claim of unfettered discretion by government is constitutional blasphemy. . . . Unfettered discretion cannot exist where the rule of law reigns (p. 16). It is therefore not surprising that Ontario abandoned reliance on the first interpretation, or that it was unanimously rejected by the courts below.\nI note that the Court of Appeal minority characterized the first interpretation as a hard cap, which it rejected as being inconsistent with the Crowns discretion to increase the annuity above $4 per person based on the Her Majestys graciousness clause (paras. 452 and 454). Whether the first interpretation is characterized as being an unfettered discretion or a hard cap with no obligation to exercise discretion yields the same conclusion: the first interpretation is simply not a plausible reading of the treaty promise in the Augmentation Clause.\nThe Second Interpretation\nThe second interpretation  that the Crown is required to increase the annuity above $4 per person when the economic condition is met  forms a component of the third interpretation, which I discuss next.\nChoosing Between the Third and Fourth Interpretations\nRecall that under the third interpretation, which was accepted by the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal (per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., Hourigan J.A. concurring), the annuity involves both a collective and an individual part. Under this interpretation, the Crown must increase the collective part of the annuity when the economic condition is met. There is no discretion as to whether to make those collective increases, and no cap on the total amount of the increase. The individual part of the annuity is a subset of the total annuity. The Crown is required to increase the individual part to $4 per person where the economic condition is met; however, increases above $4 per person are within the Crowns discretion. Under this interpretation, the total entitlement is greater than the sum of the individual entitlements distributed to the individual treaty beneficiaries. \nUnder the fourth interpretation, which was accepted by the Court of Appeal minority, the annuity involves only one part  a perpetual annuity payable to the Chiefs and their Tribes  that is to be increased if the economic condition is met. The annuity is subject to a cap equivalent to the aggregate sum of 1 (or $4) per person, but this is a soft cap and can be increased in the exercise of the Crowns discretion (as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order).\nThe Court of Appeal majority did not meaningfully engage with the fourth interpretation which, in my respectful view, was an error of law. \nI agree with some of the reasons given by the Court of Appeal minority for preferring the fourth to the third interpretation, but disagree with others.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal minority that, on a purely textual basis, the third interpretation is somewhat strained and illogical (para. 454). I do not read the reference to the amount paid to each individual as creating an obligation to pay individuals, separate from an obligation to pay the collective. The obligation to pay is created by the earlier language in the Consideration Clause that expressly provides that the perpetual annuity is to be paid and delivered to the said Chiefs and their Tribes at a convenient season of each summer. The reference to the amount paid to each individual, which follows in the Augmentation Clause, imposes a condition on the obligation to augment the annuity. As the Court of Appeal minority noted (at para. 429), the trial judge herself described the first condition as establishing a condition of the increase of the annuity up to the 1 (or $4) cap (Stage One reasons, at para. 403 (emphasis added)). The condition of the obligation to augment is that the amount paid to each individual shall not exceed 1 a year. After the 1 (or $4) cap is reached, further increases could be made only as an exercise of discretion, as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. The first condition relating to the augmentation (provided that) is then followed by a second condition (provided, further, that) relating, in parallel manner, to a reduction of the annuity if the population of beneficiaries falls below two-thirds of the population at the time the Robinson Treaties were signed. \nI also agree with the Court of Appeal minority that it seems strange for Robinson to have buried in the middle of the Augmentation Clause an obligation to pay an annuity to individuals, separate from the obligation to pay the collective (para. 472). This would have been a highly unusual way to make such a fundamental change to the established patterns of treaty making at the time the Robinson Treaties were signed. Since 1818, no treaty had provided annuities with both collective and individual components.\nI respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal minority, however, that the third interpretation adopted by the trial judge fail[s] to give any effect to the Her Majestys graciousness provision of the augmentation clause (para. 431). As Canada fairly notes, both the third and fourth interpretations confirm that the Crown retains discretion regarding when and how annuity increases will be determined and paid (R.F., at para. 35). The trial judge expressly acknowledged that the Crown does maintain significant discretion under the Treaties, including the implementation process (Stage One reasons, at para. 569). Instead, the difference between the third and fourth interpretations is whether the discretion relates just to an individual distributive share (the third interpretation), or to the whole of the annuity (the fourth interpretation).\nI also respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal minority that the trial judge erred by Finding Ambiguity Where There Was None (heading of para. 436). Although I regard the third interpretation as somewhat strained and illogical, I accept that it is a possible interpretation in order to evaluate it against the historical and cultural backdrop under the second step of the Marshall framework. The first step of the Marshall framework accepts that there may be patent ambiguities from a facial reading of a treaty that are then resolved at the second step, after considering the relevant historical and cultural context. A treaty is only ambiguous in the legal sense if its terms can be interpreted in more than one way at the end of the interpretive process (see, by analogy, the approach taken to statutory interpretation in La Presse inc. v. Quebec, 2023 SCC 22, at para. 24). It is only at the end of the two-step Marshall exercise that a genuinely ambiguous treaty term benefits from the rule that ambiguities or doubtful expressions should be resolved in favour of the [A]boriginal signatories (para. 78(2), citing Simon, at p. 402, Sioui, at p. 1035, and Badger, at para. 52).\nIn what follows, I begin by addressing two points that the Court of Appeal minority found detracted from the third interpretation, which in my view do not do so. The first relates to evidence that the Anishinaabe may not have understood the idea of the Crowns discretion to augment the annuities under the Robinson Treaties. The second concerns the trial judges conclusion that the treaties promised the Huron and Superior beneficiaries a fair share of the revenues derived from the ceded territories, which the Court of Appeal unanimously rejected. Neither point conclusively suggests that the third interpretation should be rejected. I will then consider five points relating to the historical and cultural backdrop. What is striking about the historical and cultural backdrop is how little, if any, of it supports the third interpretation but is consistent with the fourth interpretation.\nTwo Points That Do Not Help Decide Between the Third and Fourth Interpretations\nThe Anishinaabes Understanding of as Her Majesty May Be Graciously Pleased To Order\nI begin with the evidence of the Anishinaabes understanding of the Crowns discretion, and conclude that it does not resolve whether the third or fourth interpretation reflects the parties common intention, as both incorporate a notion of discretion. It was not disputed before this Court that the expression as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order connotes discretion. It was the usual way of referring to the royal prerogative (see Stage One reasons, at paras. 442 and 447; C.A. reasons, at para. 196 (majority) and at para. 463 (minority)). As explained by the plaintiffs expert ethnohistorian, Mr. James Morrison:\n\tAt this period [when the Robinson Treaties were signed], various versions of the phrase Her (or His) Majesty may be graciously pleased were in common use, both in Britain and throughout its colonial possessions. It was, in fact, the normal way of referring to the exercise of the prerogative powers of the Crown. Robinson himself was perfectly familiar with this kind of language. In 1839, for example, the House of Assembly and Legislative Council of Upper Canada prepared a joint address of congratulation to Sir John Colborne upon his appointment as Governor General of British North America. Not only did they thank Colborne for his past services (he had earlier served as Lieutenant Governor), they said that they would rejoice in any further distinction which Her Majesty may be graciously pleased hereafter to confer upon you. W.B. Robinson was one of the Members of the House tasked with presenting the joint address to the new Governor in Chief. [Footnotes omitted.]\n\n(Affidavit of James Morrison, at para. 384)\nAn issue at trial was whether the Anishinaabe understood this notion of Crown discretion under the royal prerogative before they signed the Robinson Treaties. At first blush, the trial judge seemed to find that they did not, and therefore it could not have formed part of the common intention of the parties. She referred to the evidence of Elder Rita Corbiere, who translated the Robinson Treaties into Anishinaabemowin, and explained that there was no way to translate the phrase as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. As the trial judge stated: \n\tElder Corbiere described her challenges in doing the translation. There were a number of words and phrases for which she said there was no direct translation (e.g. cede, surrender). She also said that the number two thousand would have been very hard to translate, perhaps impossible. There is no word for title in the language and, in fact, there was no concept of alienation of land. In her testimony, Elder Corbiere further explained how there is no way to translate, as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. She testified that the Anishinaabe lived with notions of what they expected of their leaders: to be generous, to live in a good way, to do right by the people.\n\n\tThe Robinson Treaties use formal English and legal terminology. I am not at all convinced that the presence of interpreters could or should have given Robinson confidence that the Chiefs understood the concepts of discretion, royal prerogative, or Her Majestys graciousness, if such concepts had been embedded into the Treaties. And, therefore, such concepts could not have informed the common intention of the parties. [Underlining added.]\n\n(Stage One reasons, at paras. 446-47)\nThe minority of the Court of Appeal concluded that this finding of the trial judge involved a misapprehension of the evidence and was inconsistent with her other findings (para. 432). The minority correctly noted that Elder Corbiere had not testified that there was no way to translate as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. Instead, she had testified that it meant that Her Majesty would be generous. As the minority explained:\n\tThe trial judge said that the witness, Elder Corbiere, who translated the Treaties from English to Anishinaabemowin and then back to English, testified that there was no way to translate as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. In fact, Elder Corbiere testified that she translated the phrase to mean and even more will be given to the Anishinaabek if the Gischpin Gchi-Gimaa Kwe [Big Chief Lady] has a good heart and has a mind to do so. Elder Corbiere testified that while she could not translate graciously, the Anishinaabe expected leaders to be generous. The translation that she provided, if [the Queen] has a good heart and has a mind to do so, reasonably conveys the meaning of as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order. \n\n(para. 433, citing Stage One reasons, at para. 446)\nIn my view, the minoritys conclusions are supported by Elder Corbieres evidence. In her translation of the Robinson Treaties into Anishinaabemowin, Elder Corbiere noted that the expression as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order could not be precisely translated into Anishinaabemowin, but the Anishinaabe would have understood that Her Majesty (Gchi Gimaa Kwe, or the Big Chief Lady) would be generous and would decide according to the principles of respect, love, and honesty. Her comments on this important point are worth quoting in full:\n\tWilliam Benjamin Robinson, the one who is standing in for the Gchi Gimaa Kwe, who wishes to deal fairly with the Anish[i]naabek and will be fair and be good to them, also plans that if they make money from the land, the one in charge of the Province (there is no Anishinaabe word for province) will increase the money given out yearly, only if they will not lose money; and the money will be increased from time to time by this much: an amount worth one English money (there is no Anish[i]naabe word for pound), and even more will be given to the Anish[i]naabek if the Gchi Gimaa Kwe has a good heart and has a mind to do so. (The expression as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order is not possible to translate exactly into Anish[i]naabemowin. I am told it is a legal/governance phrase regarding decisions by the Queen. Anishinaabek would understand that Gchi G[i]maa Kwe would be generous (gizhewaadzi) and decide according to the principles of Respect (Mnaadendimowin), Love (Zaagidwin), and Honesty (Gwekwaadziwin).) [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted.]\n\n(Huron plaintiffs Condensed Book, at pp. 53-54)\nElder Corbieres oral testimony during her examination-in-chief confirmed the written translation she had provided to the court:\n\tBY MR. NAHWEGAHBOW:\n\n\tQ. So youve provided the translation, how would that have been understood by the Anishinaabe?\n\n\tA. Well, graciously pleased. Graciously pleased, I could not translate that into  graciously what the word graciously meant. I dont know if its an expression when you address the Queen, be a gracious lady.\n\n\tAnd the way the Anishinaabek lived, with the Seven Teachings, to be generous, to be kind, to be truthful, and all those good teachings, good heart teachings that were given to us, if they lived those, then they would also expect the  then they expect the leader, the Queen, to be living the same way. We have the same beliefs, because she is the main leader of Anishinaabek. \n\n. . .\n\nAnd in the same way, the Anishinaabek expected the Queen to be the same way as their beliefs, that she would show love, according to the principles of respect, Mnaadendimowin; Zaagidwin, love; and honesty, that she would do right by the people. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(Huron plaintiffs Condensed Book, at pp. 62-63)\nPlainly, if Elder Corbieres evidence were taken as suggesting that the Anishinaabe did not understand the idea of discretion, then the trial judge would have made a palpable and overriding error in concluding that the idea of the Crowns discretion could not have formed part of the common intention of the parties. The Court of Appeal majority, however, did not read the trial judges finding that way. The majority accepted that the trial judge was palpably wrong in writing that the Anishinaabe did not understand the idea of discretion, because Robinson successfully conveyed the concept of Crown discretion at the Treaty Council (para. 219). But the majority also found that the trial judge simply misspoke (para. 221), and thus concluded that her error was not overriding. She had meant to say that the Anishinaabe would not have understood the idea of unfettered discretion (para. 221). They would not have understood how a leader could choose to act arbitrarily without regard for the needs, requests, or expectations of others, because this was not consistent with Anishinaabe conceptions of leadership or their expectations of the Crown (para. 227). The majority noted that the trial judge elsewhere made numerous references to ongoing Crown discretion, and therefore she did not intend to exclude all Crown discretion, just unfettered discretion (para. 221).\nI agree with the Court of Appeal majority that the trial judge simply misspoke when she wrote that the Anishinaabe did not understand the idea of discretion. She could not have adopted the third interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, which involves the idea of discretion, had she found that the Anishinaabe did not understand this idea. \nI also agree with the Court of Appeal majority that what the trial judge had meant to say was that the Anishinaabe would not have understood the idea of unfettered discretion. The Anishinaabe understood that the Crown would be generous in exercising the discretion referred to in the Robinson Treaties and would take the Anishinaabes needs and circumstances into account, as well as the needs and circumstances of non-signatories. The opening words of the Augmentation Clause support this understanding of the Crowns discretion: [t]he said William Benjamin Robinson, on behalf of Her Majesty, who desires to deal liberally and justly with all Her subjects. . . . However, the way in which the Anishinaabe understood the idea of Crown discretion does not help choose between the third and fourth interpretations of the Augmentation Clause because both of them involve the idea of discretion. \nThe Trial Judges Comments on Fair Share\nThe trial judges conclusion that the Robinson Treaties promised the Huron and Superior beneficiaries a fair share of the revenues derived from the ceded territories, which the Court of Appeal unanimously rejected, also does not help in choosing between the third and fourth interpretations because both interpretations include some general concept of sharing future revenues from the ceded territories.\nIn summarizing the third interpretation, the trial judge said that [t]he Crown must diligently implement the augmentation promise, so as to achieve the Treaty purpose of reflecting in the annuities a fair share of the value of the resources, including the land and water in the territory (Stage One Partial Judgment for Huron Action, at para. 1(d) (emphasis added), reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 145, and see also para. 3(c); Stage One Partial Judgment for Superior Action, at paras. 1(d) and 3(c), reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at pp. 151-52). In doing so, the trial judge accepted the position of the Huron plaintiffs that the common intention of the parties would be accomplished by renewing the treaty relationship and moving to a fair sharing agreement of the land and its resources (Stage One reasons, at para. 362). She later noted that the treaty implementation issues include [w]hat is a fair share of the net revenues received from the Treaties territories? (para. 535). She observed that the plaintiffs argued that the default position is that the Anishinaabe should receive 100% of net Crown revenues or, in the alternative, two-thirds of the net Crown revenues to increase the annuities (para. 556). The trial judge stated that the question of what is a fair share for the Anishinaabe would be before the court at Stage Three or in a future process, but that it was impossible to gauge fairness to the parties on the record at trial (para. 561).\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously overturned the trial judges conclusion that the treaties granted the Anishinaabe a right to a fair share of the net Crown revenues from the treaty territories for the past 170 years. But, as I will explain, the Court of Appeal also unanimously accepted that, broadly speaking, some notion of sharing was contained in the treaty promise of an augmentation of the annuity if the Crown could do so without incurring loss. \nThe Court of Appeal majority stated that it was possible to deconstruct the [trial] judgments into two possible promises for analytical purposes (para. 288). The majority noted that [t]he first is that the augmentation clause was a promise to share in the value of the land. The second is that a fair share was promised (para. 288). The Court of Appeal unanimously accepted the first interpretation, and rejected the second. In my view, they were correct to do so.\nThe majority accepted that the first view, that the treaties promised a share in the value of the land (para. 289) and a revenue sharing model (para. 307), was well supported and w[as] not effectively challenged by Ontario (para. 307). The majority cited the trial judges statement that, under the third interpretation, the Treaties were a collective promise to share the revenues from the territory with the collective; in other words, to increase the lump sum annuity so long as the economic condition was met (para. 291 (emphasis deleted), citing Stage One reasons, at para. 461). The minority agreed that the purpose of the Augmentation Clause was to provide some form of future revenue sharing, subject to a soft cap (para. 464). They noted that [t]he Her Majestys graciousness clause provided the Crown with discretion to increase the annuities if it could do so without loss and assured the Anishinaabe that a liberal and just Sovereign would share the wealth of the land with them if and when it was possible to do so (para. 464).\nIt is plain that the Augmentation Clause contemplates, broadly speaking, some general notion of sharing future revenues that is consistent with the common intention of the parties. It gives voice to the Crowns goal of acquiring immediate access to the ceded territories and opening them up to settlement and economic development. It is also consistent with the Anishinaabes perspectives reflected in the principles of respect, responsibility, reciprocity, and renewal. It demonstrates respect by acknowledging both the Anishinaabes jurisdiction over the land and their authority to conclude an agreement with the newcomers. It shows reciprocity by making concrete the Anishinaabes expectation that a gift would attract a reciprocal gift of commensurate value (C.A. reasons, at para. 296). It embodies responsibility in affirming the Anishinaabes ongoing duties to their people, at the time the Robinson Treaties were signed and in perpetuity. And it allows for renewal since the Robinson Treaties would adjust as economic circumstances changed (para. 306, citing Stage One reasons, at paras. 469-70). \nEven accepting, however, a general concept of revenue sharing, as did the majority and minority of the Court of Appeal, this does not resolve whether the Robinson Treaties provided for an annuity with both collective and individual parts, or whether the augmentation was obligatory or discretionary. It also does not clarify what form the sharing should take. As the Court of Appeal majority stated, [t]he parties in negotiations, or the trial judge in Stage Three, must determine the form, level, and aim of the sharing that the augmentation clause requires (para. 323). They added that this exercise should be led . . . by the Treaty parties shared goals, expectations, and understandings in 1850, including the Anishinaabe principles of respect, responsibility, reciprocity, and renewal, identified by the trial judge, and the Crowns commitment to being both liberal and just (para. 323). This is the task of reconciliation (para. 324). I agree with these observations, subject to the discussion below regarding the appropriate remedy.\nThe Court of Appeal unanimously rejected the view that the Augmentation Clause promised the Anishinaabe a fair share of the net Crown revenues from the ceded territories (paras. 308-25 (majority); paras. 448-86 (minority)). The majority noted that, although at one level, nobody would quarrel with the idea of a fair share, or that the Robinson Treaties should be fair, ultimately the elusive concept of a fair share is rhetorical gloss (paras. 289 and 313). The Court of Appeal majority found, and counsel for the plaintiffs acknowledged before this Court, that the concept of a fair share originated with counsel (paras. 315-17; transcript, day 1, at p. 85). It is not supported by evidence or any of the historical records and is not reflected in the actual text of the Robinson Treaties. As the Court of Appeal majority observed, the idea of a fair share adds nothing substantive but has the potential to work mischief (C.A. reasons, at para. 313). The potential mischief is that the concept of a fair share tends to focus the mind on the amount or percentage of revenue that ought to be redirected to the Treaty First Nations, rather than on the state of affairs that this promise to share sought to, and ought to, achieve (para. 319 (majority)). As I explain below, the sharing is to be effected by an exercise of Crown discretion that reflects the honour of the Crown and abides by the Crowns promise to the Anishinaabe to deal liberally and justly with all Her subjects, having regard to the relative wealth and needs of all the Crowns subjects, signatories and non-signatories alike.\nConclusion\nI conclude that neither the trial judges comments on the Anishinaabes understanding of the nature of the Crowns discretion or regarding whether the Robinson Treaties promised a fair share of revenues derived from the ceded territories helps decide between the third and fourth interpretations, both of which involve general notions of Crown discretion and the sharing of future revenues from the ceded territories. \nI now turn to address five points that detract from the third interpretation and support the fourth.\nFive Points Detracting From the Third Interpretation and Supporting the Fourth\nAn Annuity With Both Collective and Individual Components, and With a Mandatory Obligation To Increase the Collective Component Without Limit, Would Have Been Unprecedented\nFirst, a treaty annuity with both a collective and an individual part would have been unprecedented. It would also have been unprecedented for a treaty to have an annuity with a collective part, which the Crown was obliged to increase without limit and without Crown discretion, if an economic condition was met. \nI recognize that the fourth interpretation is also unprecedented to some extent, since, as the trial judge noted, there was no precedent for a treaty with either an augmentation provision or one subject to a cap (Stage One reasons, at para. 454). But the notions of an augmentation clause and a cap appear on the face of the Robinson Treaties; by contrast, the notion of a bifurcated annuity subject to a mandatory obligation to increase the collective part without limit can be gleaned only through a somewhat strained exercise of interpretation.\nA Mandatory Obligation To Increase the Annuity Without Limit Is Difficult to Reconcile With the Crowns Dire Economic Circumstances\nSecond, a mandatory obligation to increase an uncapped annuity is difficult to reconcile with the Crowns dire economic circumstances at the time the Robinson Treaties were signed. As the trial judge found, the Province was broke (Stage One reasons, at para. 219). I agree with the Court of Appeal minority that [h]aving regard to the provinces desperate financial circumstances, it would have made no sense for Robinson to promise the Anishinaabe an unlimited collective annuity, while at the same time limiting individual payments (para. 439). I also agree with the minority that it seems highly unlikely that Robinson would have proposed, and Lord Elgin would have approved, a treaty that committed the government to an unlimited, mandatory and perpetual sharing of future revenues (para. 471). In fact, Robinson was instructed to impact on the minds of the [Anishinaabe] that they ought not to expect excessive remuneration (Order in Council No. 31, January 11, 1850, Exhibit 001-0738). \nTo some extent, the provinces dire financial circumstances might be said to cut both ways. If the province was broke, what better way to secure the treaty territory immediately than by paying larger annuities only if the ceded territories generated sufficient revenue? And as the Court of Appeal majority fairly noted, Robinson does not appear to have expected that significant revenues would be generated from the territory (para. 143). Paying more only contingent on, and out of, future resource revenues would have been an innovative solution, especially if those revenues were not expected to be large. But again, I agree with the Court of Appeal minority, that [i]t seems even more unlikely that, had Robinson received those instructions from the Queens representative, he would not have mentioned them in his diary, in his report to the Executive Committee, or in his subsequent communications (para. 471). There is simply no pre- or post-treaty record describing an annuity that was subject to a mandatory obligation to be increased without limit.\nI disagree with Ontario, however, that the notion of an uncapped annuity should be rejected because it would require a form of accounting of the revenues from the ceded territories. As correctly noted by the Court of Appeal majority, some rough form of accounting was required in order to determine whether the augmentation clause was triggered, under any interpretation (para. 141). The reference in the Augmentation Clause to the Crowns discretion being engaged if the Crown could, without incurring loss . . . increase the annuity contemplates evaluating whether the Crown would suffer a loss, even though the Robinson Treaties do not set out specific criteria for that evaluation.\nThere Is No Evidence of an Intention To Grant a Bifurcated Annuity With Collective and Individual Components\nThird, there is no contemporaneous historical evidence of an intention to grant an annuity divided between a collective part paid to the community and an individual part distributed to individuals. The trial judge came to a contrary conclusion, however, inferring that it was likely that Robinson was under some pressure from some Chiefs at the [Treaty] Council to ear mark some funds for individual distribution and in compliance with the Colborne Policy that limited his ability to make cash payments to individuals (Stage One reasons, at para. 454). Because of this pressure to make individual distributions, the trial judge said, Robinson set a low cap on the individual distributive amount (the 1 or $4 cap) (para. 454). But, as the Court of Appeal minority found, this inference of the trial judge involved speculation (para. 442). There is simply no evidence that Robinson was under pressure at the Treaty Council to earmark funds for individual distribution (para. 442). This speculation, the Court of Appeal minority added, also presupposes that there was a recognition at the Treaty Council that the annuity was intended to be a collective amount from which individual distributive shares were to be carved out. There is no evidence of any such discussion (para. 442). I agree.\nThe Annuity Has Been Paid Only to Individuals for Over 170 Years\nFourth, the manner in which payments have been made for over 170 years under the Robinson Treaties, while of limited assistance, tends to refute the suggestion of a bifurcated annuity between collective and individual payments. \nIt is not disputed that post-treaty conduct can be examined to help discern the parties intent at the time a treaty was signed, especially if the conduct closely followed the conclusion of the document (Sioui, at p. 1060; see also R. v. Taylor (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 360 (C.A.), at para. 21, per MacKinnon A.C.J.O.). Such evidence must be examined with care and the weight it is to be given will vary with the context. \nExcept for a brief period between 1851 and 1854 when the Huron annuity was paid in goods to each band, the Huron annuity has been paid in cash to individuals. The Superior annuity was paid in cash to the head of each family through the 1850s and until the 1870s, but since then has been paid in cash to individuals. Neither the Huron nor the Superior annuity has ever been paid to both the collective and to individuals contemporaneously.\nNothing in the Post-Treaty Evidence Supports a Bifurcated Annuity With Collective and Individual Components\nFifth, although the post-treaty record more generally is of limited help  the trial judge found it vague, inconsistent, and conflicting (Stage One reasons, at para. 318)  none of it supports the notion of either a bifurcated annuity between the collective and individuals, or a hybrid annuity with a mandatory collective component coupled with a non-discretionary individual component below $4 and Crown discretion thereafter. As the Court of Appeals majority concluded, the post-treaty evidence simply shows that the Treaties were set aside and largely forgotten for two decades, until 1873 when the Anishinaabe asserted that the circumstances for an augmentation of the annuities had existed for some time (para. 174). I agree with the Court of Appeal minority that there is nothing in the record to indicate that either the Crown or the Anishinaabe believed that the annuity had both a collective component and an individual component (para. 487). \nMoreover, there is evidence dating to 1880 that payments were made in the form of a global annuity calculated on the basis of the aggregate sum owed to each individual, without any bifurcation between separate collective and individual components. The Act for granting to Her Majesty certain sums of money required for defraying certain expenses of the public service, for the financial years ending respectively the 30th June, 1876, and the 30th June, 1877, and for other purposes relating to the public service, S.C. 1876, c. 1, referred to an [a]nnual grant to bring up annuities payable under the Robinson Treaty to the Chippawas of Lakes Huron and Superior, from 96 cents to $4 per head, $14,000 (the Hon. A. Morris, The Treaties of Canada with the Indians of Manitoba and the North-West Territories, Including the Negotiations on Which They Were Based, and Other Information Relating Thereto (1880), at p. 18).\nConclusion\nBoth the language of the Augmentation Clause and the historical and cultural context detract from the third interpretation and support the fourth as best reconciling the intentions of both parties when the Robinson Treaties were signed. A fixed annuity, with discretion for the Crown to increase the annuity beyond a soft cap if economic conditions improved, allowed the Crown to secure the ceded lands for settlement and mineral development at a time when the province lacked resources. At the same time, the Anishinaabe were prepared to trust the Crown to act liberally and justly with all Her Majestys subjects, including the Anishinaabe, and to increase the annuity when circumstances warranted. This was entirely consistent with the Anishinaabes conceptions of a good leader, and reflected the principles of respect, responsibility, reciprocity, and renewal. The Robinson Treaties recognized the Anishinaabes authority to conclude agreements to share their territory and their responsibility to their people, embodied the idea of reciprocity and mutual dependence, and cemented a longstanding nation-to-nation relationship that would be renewed in perpetuity.\nIn summary, I conclude that the Augmentation Clause obliges the Crown to pay an annuity to the Anishinaabe Chiefs and their Tribes. There is a mandatory obligation to increase the annuity up to $4 when the economic circumstances warrant, as was done in 1875. This increased annuity is a soft cap beyond which further increases are discretionary (or such further sum as Her Majesty may be graciously pleased to order). If the economic conditions are such that the Crown can increase the annuity beyond $4 per person without incurring a loss, the Crown must exercise its discretion and determine whether to increase the annuities and, if so, by how much. This exercise of discretion is not unfettered; it is justiciable and reviewable by the courts. \nThe Crown must exercise its discretion, including its discretion as to how often it turns its mind to increasing the annuity, diligently, honourably, liberally, and justly, while engaging in an ongoing relationship with the Anishinaabe based on the values of respect, responsibility, reciprocity and renewal. To do so, the Crown must consider factors such as: the number of treaty beneficiaries and their needs; the benefits the Crown has received from the territory and its expenses during the relevant timeframe; the wider needs of other Indigenous populations and the non-Indigenous populations of Ontario and Canada; and the principles and requirements flowing from the honour of the Crown, including its duty to diligently implement its sacred promise to share in the wealth of the land if it proved profitable. I will discuss several of these points in more detail below when I discuss the appropriate remedy in this case.\nLimitations Issues\nIntroduction\nBefore this Court, Ontario renews its argument that the Huron and Superior plaintiffs claims for breach of treaty are statute-barred by a provincial limitation period. The current Limitations Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B, provides that proceedings based on existing Aboriginal and treaty rights recognized and affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and equitable claims by Aboriginal peoples against the Crown are governed by the law that would have been in force with respect to limitation of actions if this Act had not been passed (ss. 2(1)(e), 2(1)(f) and 2(2)). All parties agree that if any limitations legislation applies in this case, it is Ontarios 1990 Limitations Act. \nThe relevant provisions of the 1990 Limitations Act are as follows:\n45. (1) The following actions shall be commenced within and not after the times respectively hereinafter mentioned,\n(b) an action upon a bond, or other specialty, except upon a covenant contained in an indenture of mortgage made on or after the 1st day of July, 1894;\nwithin twenty years after the cause of action arose,\n(g) an action for trespass to goods or land, simple contract or debt grounded upon any lending or contract without specialty, debt for arrears of rent, detinue, replevin or upon the case other than for slander, \nwithin six years after the cause of action arose, . . . .\n46. Every action of account, or for not accounting, or for such accounts as concerns the trade of merchandise between merchant and merchant, their factors and servants, shall be commenced within six years after the cause of action arose, and no claim in respect of a matter that arose more than six years before the commencement of the action is enforceable by action by reason only of some other matter of claim comprised in the same account having arisen within six years next before the commencement of the action.\nThe trial judge rejected Ontarios argument that the breach of treaty claims should be considered to be actions upon a . . . specialty, subject to a 20-year limitation period (s. 45(1)(b)), or, in the alternative, as actions of account (s. 46) or actions for contract . . . without specialty (s. 45(1)(g)), subject to a 6-year limitation period. She emphasized that Aboriginal treaties are not contracts, whether with or without specialty. Rather, treaties are sui generis agreements that form part of the constitutional fabric of this country (Stage Two reasons, at para. 151; see also paras. 149-50). She added that the claims could not be considered to be actions of account under s. 46, because they pursue equitable compensation rather than a common law accounting, which is the focus of s. 46 (para. 179).\nWriting on behalf of the Court of Appeal, Hourigan J.A. agreed with the trial judge that the breach of treaty claims are not statute-barred. Applying the modern approach to statutory interpretation, he reasoned that the strict textual analysis required when considering specialties is antithetical to the highly contextual nature of Aboriginal treaty analysis (paras. 656-57). In addition, actions of account under s. 46 of the 1990 Limitations Act were intended to be limited to merchants accounts (para. 661). Finally, unlike the 1990 legislation, the Limitations Act, 2002 specifically refers to Aboriginal claims, strongly suggesting that had the legislature intended to capture breach of treaty claims under the 1990 Limitations Act, it would have done so expressly (paras. 646 and 662).\nBefore this Court, and for the first time in this litigation, Ontario asserts the breach of treaty claims are actions on the case within the meaning of s. 45(1)(g) of the 1990 Limitations Act, and are thus subject to a six-year limitation period (A.F., at para. 116). Ontario also disputes the Court of Appeals conclusion that actions of account are limited to common law claims relating to merchants accounts (para. 120). In response, the Huron and Superior plaintiffs urge this Court not to consider Ontarios new argument regarding actions on the case, which was neither pleaded nor argued at any stage of the proceedings (Huron plaintiffs R.F., at para. 124; Superior plaintiffs R.F., at para. 103). In any event, they submit that this cause of action does not apply to the breach of treaty claims (Huron plaintiffs R.F., at paras. 124-30; Superior plaintiffs R.F., at paras. 91-94 and 105). They also agree with the Court of Appeal that s. 46 of the 1990 Limitations Act was intended to be limited to merchants accounts (Huron plaintiffs R.F., at para. 132; Superior plaintiffs R.F., at paras. 110-11). Canada does not rely on a limitations defence and takes no position on these issues (R.F., at para. 51).\nOntario has also suggested that this Court need not address limitations issues if it grants only declaratory relief in relation to the breach of treaty claims (A.F., at para. 121). For its part, Canada notes that limitations statutes cannot prevent courts from issuing a declaration on the constitutionality of Crown conduct (R.F., at para. 54, citing Manitoba Metis). In oral argument before this Court, Ontarios counsel added that he was not strenuously arguing that the plaintiffs claims are statute-barred by a limitation period (transcript, day 1, at p. 51). Even so, I will address Ontarios limitations arguments in order to confirm the parties continuing rights and obligations under the Robinson Treaties. As I will explain, the plaintiffs breach of treaty claims are neither actions on the case nor actions of account. As a result, their claims are not statute-barred by the 1990 Limitations Act.\nThe Breach of Treaty Claim Is Not an Action on the Case\nThis Court has recently affirmed that parties will be permitted to raise new arguments on appeal only in exceptional circumstances, having regard to, among other things, the state of the record, fairness to all parties, the importance of having the issue resolved by th[e] [c]ourt, its suitability for decision and the broader interests of the administration of justice (R. v. J.F., 2022 SCC 17, at para. 41, citing Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 20). \nI have concluded that this is an appropriate case to consider Ontarios argument that the plaintiffs claims are statute-barred under the 1990 Limitations Act as actions on the case. First, the determination of this issue is primarily an exercise of characterizing the nature of the plaintiffs claims and requires consideration of little, if any, evidence. Second, both the Huron and Superior plaintiffs have fully addressed this new submission in their factums on appeal, thereby reducing the potential for unfairness. Finally, a decision on this issue would clarify the ongoing rights of the beneficiaries under the Robinson Treaties and the Crowns concomitant obligations  issues of clear importance given their constitutional dimension.\nThe action on the case is a common law action that derived from the action of trespass (Perry, Farley & Onyschuk v. Outerbridge Management Ltd. (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 131 (C.A.), at para. 22; A. K. Kiralfy, The Action on the Case (1951), at p. 3). It allowed plaintiffs to bring claims for personal wrongs and injuries that could not be brought in trespass, such as claims based on culpable omissions and unintended or consequential harm (Outerbridge, at paras. 22-23 and 25, citing W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1897), Book 3, at p. 122, M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law (7th ed. 1832), vol. I, at p. 86, and G. Mew, The Law of Limitations (1991), at p. 92). Actions on the case were generally limited to actions in the nature of tort, but in some cases have been extended to actions in the nature of contract as well (Ontario Law Reform Commission, Report on Limitation of Actions (1969), at p. 35; Halsburys Laws of England (3rd ed. 1952), vol. 1, at pp. 27-28).\nThere are at least three reasons why a claim for breach of an Aboriginal treaty is not an action on the case.\nFirst, Ontario seeks to use the action on the case as a catch-all cause of action or basket clause capturing any claim not expressly mentioned in the limitations legislation, including breach of treaty. This attempt is misguided. Some provincial limitations statutes have included residual provisions or basket clauses (see, e.g., Limitation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 266, s. 3(5); Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.A. 1980, c. L-15, s. 4(1)(g); Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245, at paras. 127-31; Canada (Attorney General) v. Lameman, 2008 SCC 14, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 372, at paras. 12-14). However, this Court has already held that the 1990 Limitations Act applies only to a closed list of enumerated causes of action (M. (K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, at p. 69). As a result, actions on the case cannot be interpreted so broadly as to capture all personal actions not specifically enumerated in the 1990 Limitations Act (Outerbridge, at paras. 17 and 26). Accepting Ontarios submission on this point would effectively require this Court to read into the legislation a basket clause where one was not provided by the legislature.\nSecond, in the 2002 amendments to the Ontario limitations legislation, the Ontario legislature dealt expressly with Aboriginal and treaty rights, excluding them from the limitation periods established in the statute. Sections 2(1)(e) and 2(1)(f) of the Limitations Act, 2002 provide that the legislation applies to all claims except proceedings based on the existing [A]boriginal and treaty rights . . . recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 and proceedings based on equitable claims by [A]boriginal peoples against the Crown. I agree with the Court of Appeal that, in making these amendments, the legislature understood that Aboriginal treaty claims are distinct from other causes of action, and that when the legislature intended to deal with Aboriginal treaty claims, it did so explicitly (para. 646).\nFinally, a claim for breach of an Aboriginal treaty right is fundamentally different than an action on the case. Treaty claims are not actions in the nature of tort or contract, which seek to vindicate private rights, and which derive from the law of trespass. Rather, Aboriginal treaties are sui generis agreements representing the exchange of solemn promises between the Crown and Indigenous peoples (Simon, at pp. 404 and 410; Sioui, at p. 1038; Badger, at para. 41). The rights at stake are constitutional, engaging issues of public law rather than private law.\nThe Breach of Treaty Claim Is Not an Action of Account\nI would also reject Ontarios submission that the plaintiffs claims for equitable compensation amount to actions of account within the meaning of s. 46 of the 1990 Limitations Act.\nIn rejecting Ontarios argument on this point, the Court of Appeal, at para. 660, referred to the Ontario Law Reform Commissions Report on Limitation of Actions, which explained that actions of account under s. 46 probably are only those which would have been brought at common law and do not include equitable actions of account (p. 18). Ontario provides a contrary viewpoint, citing Jeremy S. Williams, Limitation of Actions in Canada (2nd ed. 1980), at p. 45, who contends that an action of account can be brought incidentally to any claim where there is a legal or equitable duty to account (A.F., at para. 120 (emphasis added)). \nI accept that there is authority for the view that actions of account can include common law and equitable claims. Even so, the origin and scope of this action suggest it is ill-suited to the context of Crown-Indigenous treaties.\nThe writ or action of account arose from the English feudal system in the 13th century. It was a way for land-owning lords who had rented out manors to bailiffs to compel them to account for the rents and profits derived from the property (E. O. Belsheim, The Old Action of Account (1932), 45 Harv. L. Rev. 466, at pp. 467-68). At that time, there was no clear division between equity and the common law, but the action was typically used at common law against a person who was required to render an account to another because of a fiduciary relationship (such as a guardian in socage, bailiff, or receiver) (National Trust Co. v. H & R Block Canada Inc., 2003 SCC 66, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 160, at para. 34, citing Blacks Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990), at p. 19; Halsburys Laws of England, at p. 24; Belsheim, at p. 472). \nAlthough the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples is fiduciary in nature, for the reasons I outline in the next section, no specific fiduciary obligation, whether ad hoc or sui generis, arises to potentially bring the plaintiffs claims within the scope of actions of account. In addition, the correct interpretation of the Augmentation Clause set out above reveals that the Crown is not required to account to the treaty beneficiaries for the proceeds of the ceded territories. Rather, increases to the annuities beyond $4 are discretionary. It also cannot be said that the Crown holds the ceded territories in trust for, or for the benefit of, the Anishinaabe treaty partners.\nFinally, I am not aware of any precedent treating Aboriginal or treaty rights as actions of account. The two cases Ontario cites are unlike the case at bar: they involve private law contracts of purchase and sale for land, and the administration of a constructive trust (Hanemaayer v. Freure (1999), 2 B.L.R. (3d) 269 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 98-108; Tracy v. Instaloans Financial Solutions Centres (B.C.) Ltd., 2010 BCCA 357, 320 D.L.R. (4th) 577, at para 50). Ontario has therefore provided no precedent or any compelling basis for this Court to extend s. 46 of the 1990 Limitations Act to the constitutional context of sui generis Aboriginal treaties.\nConclusion\nI conclude that the Huron and Superior plaintiffs breach of treaty claims are neither actions on the case nor actions of account, and are therefore not statute-barred by the 1990 Limitations Act.\nThe Crowns Obligation To Diligently Implement the Augmentation Clause\nThe parties agree that the honour of the Crown must guide the interpretation and implementation of the Augmentation Clause and the appropriate remedies for the Crowns past breach, but disagree on the details. This section addresses these issues and explains why neither an ad hoc nor sui generis fiduciary duty arises. I also conclude that the Crown owes a duty to diligently implement the augmentation promise under the Robinson Treaties.\nThe Honour of the Crown Is Not a Cause of Action but Can Generate Various Duties\nAs already noted, the honour of the Crown is a guiding constitutional principle that informs the interpretation of Aboriginal treaties. It also plays a crucial role in the implementation of treaties to ensure that no dishonour is brought to the government and, through this, to the Crown (Haida Nation, at para. 19; Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2005 SCC 69, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388, at para. 33; Henderson, at p. 887). The honour of the Crown imposes upon governments a high standard of honourable dealing with Indigenous peoples (R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at p. 1109; Manitoba Metis, at para. 69). It is a flexible and capacious doctrine that can measure and regulate conduct of the government in relation to [A]boriginal peoples (J. T. S. McCabe, The Honour of the Crown and its Fiduciary Duties to Aboriginal Peoples (2008), at p. 53).\nAlthough the honour of the Crown is a powerful constitutional doctrine, it is not a cause of action itself; rather, it speaks to how obligations that attract it must be fulfilled (Manitoba Metis, at para. 73 (emphasis in original)). At the same time, it is not a mere incantation, but rather a core precept that finds its application in concrete practices, and gives rise to different duties in different circumstances (Haida Nation, at paras. 16 and 18). The specific duties flowing from the honour of the Crown depend heavily on the context in which that honour is engaged (Mikisew Cree 2018, at para. 24; Manitoba Metis, at para. 74; Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. British Columbia (Project Assessment Director), 2004 SCC 74, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 550, at para. 25).\nFor example, in Haida Nation, this Court held that the honour of the Crown gives rise to a duty to consult when the Crown contemplates an action that will affect as yet unproven Aboriginal rights or title (para. 35) and could entail a duty of honourable negotiation (para. 20). In Badger, this Court said that the honour of the Crown requires avoiding any appearance of sharp-dealing (para. 41). In Marshall, the honour of the Crown was used, absent a complete written treaty text, to ground a duty to purposively interpret treaty promises to further reconciliation (paras. 41 and 49-52). In Wewaykum, the Court recognized that the honour of the Crown gives rise to a fiduciary duty where the Crown assumes discretionary control over a cognizable Aboriginal interest (paras. 79 and 81). And in Manitoba Metis, the honour of the Crown imposed a duty of diligent, purposive fulfillment of the constitutional obligation set out in s. 31 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, S.C. 1870, c. 3 (para. 94). The Huron and Superior plaintiffs say that the latter two duties  fiduciary duties and the duty of diligent fulfillment  arise in this case. I will address each.\nThe Crown Has No Fiduciary Duties in Respect of the Augmentation Promise\nIntroduction\nThis Court has recognized that the Crown may owe ad hoc and sui generis fiduciary duties to Indigenous peoples in respect of certain interests. Ad hoc fiduciary duties arise as a matter of private law and require utmost loyalty to the beneficiary (Williams Lake Indian Band v. Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2018 SCC 4, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 83, at para. 44; Alberta v. Elder Advocates of Alberta Society, 2011 SCC 24, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 261, at para. 43). By contrast, sui generis fiduciary duties are unique to the Crown-Indigenous relationship, flow from the honour of the Crown, and permit the Crown to balance competing interests (Williams Lake, at paras. 44 and 165; Hogg and Dougan, at p. 307). The plaintiffs say that both types of duties arise in this case.\nThe trial judge held that the Crown owes an ad hoc fiduciary duty to the Huron and Superior plaintiffs regarding the Augmentation Clause because it undertook to act exclusively in the best interest of the Treaties beneficiaries when engaging in a process to determine if an increase to the annuities was warranted (Stage One reasons, at para. 519; see also para. 525). She found, however, that the Crown does not owe a sui generis fiduciary duty in relation to the treaty promise, because there was no Crown undertaking of discretionary control over the Anishinaabes interest in land (para. 511).\nWriting for a unanimous Court of Appeal on this point, Hourigan J.A. held that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the Crown owes an ad hoc fiduciary duty. There was no evidence that the Crown agreed to act solely in the best interests of the treaty beneficiaries regarding procedural matters stemming from the Augmentation Clause. Such a duty, Hourigan J.A. concluded, would put the Crown in an inevitable conflict of interest by requiring the disclosure of confidential budgetary, land use, and other information relevant to its decision making about possible increases (paras. 608-9). Concerning the sui generis fiduciary duty, Hourigan J.A. agreed with the trial judge that no such duty arose (para. 585). In his view, the treaty rights were not sufficiently independent of the Crowns executive and legislative functions to ground a cognizable Aboriginal interest, and there was no evidence of a Crown undertaking of discretionary control over such an interest (paras. 627-28). \nIn their cross-appeals, the Huron and Superior plaintiffs challenge the Court of Appeals view that an ad hoc fiduciary duty would put the Crown in a conflict of interest. They also say that the evidentiary record supports finding that the Crown implicitly undertook to act exclusively in the best interests of the treaty beneficiaries regarding the process to determine a potential increase to the annuities (Huron plaintiffs A.F. on cross-appeal, at paras. 174-85; Superior plaintiffs A.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 4). As for the sui generis fiduciary duty, both plaintiffs say that the trial judge failed to consider whether a sui generis fiduciary duty might arise from the augmentation promise itself or from a pre-existing cognizable Aboriginal interest in the ceded land (Huron plaintiffs A.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 188; Superior plaintiffs A.F. on cross-appeal, at paras. 5, 12, 17 and 20). \nIn response, Ontario and Canada say that the Crown has no substantive or procedural ad hoc fiduciary duty because it did not expressly or implicitly undertake to act exclusively in the best interest of the treaty beneficiaries regarding the Augmentation Clause (Ontarios R.F. on cross-appeal, at paras. 13, 16 and 29; Canadas factum on cross-appeal, at para. 21). They submit that the Crown could not have made such an undertaking given its public responsibilities to balance competing interests (Ontarios R.F. on cross-appeal, at paras. 13(a), 16 and 33; Canadas factum on cross-appeal, at paras. 24-25). Ontario and Canada further argue that the Huron and Superior plaintiffs interest in augmented annuities is not a cognizable Aboriginal interest in respect of which the Crown may owe sui generis fiduciary duties, because this interest is a collective interest, created by the Treaties, in Crown activity and its proceeds rather than a pre-existing interest integral to the distinctive Indigenous communities relationship to the land (Canadas factum on cross-appeal, at para. 35; see also Ontarios R.F. on cross-appeal, at paras. 42-47 and 57).\nWhether a fiduciary duty exists is a question of mixed fact and law (Williams Lake, at para. 38). However, specific legal errors such as the application of an incorrect legal standard are reviewable for correctness. As I will elaborate, the trial judge properly found that no sui generis fiduciary duty arises in this case, but she erred in law in finding an ad hoc fiduciary duty. I agree with the Court of Appeal that neither duty arises.\nNo Ad Hoc Fiduciary Duty Arises\nAn ad hoc fiduciary duty may arise from the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples where the general conditions for a private law ad hoc fiduciary relationship are satisfied  that is, where the Crown has undertaken to exercise its discretionary control over a legal or substantial practical interest in the best interests of the alleged beneficiary (Williams Lake, at para. 44). An ad hoc fiduciary duty arises where there is: (1) an undertaking by the alleged fiduciary to act in the best interests of the alleged beneficiaries; (2) a defined class of beneficiaries vulnerable to the fiduciarys control; and (3) a legal or substantial practical interest of the beneficiaries that stands to be adversely affected by the alleged fiduciarys exercise of discretion or control (Elder Advocates, at para. 36; see also Manitoba Metis, at para. 50; Williams Lake, at para. 162, per Brown J., dissenting, but not on this point).\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in law in finding that an ad hoc fiduciary duty arose. There is no evidence that the Crown undertook to act in the best interests of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs in relation to the treaty promise.\nThe trial judge characterized the legal or substantial practical interest of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs as a right to have the Crown engage in a process to determine whether it could increase the annuities without incurring loss (Stage One reasons, at para. 525). She found that the Crowns promise to engage in this process was made in the best interests of the Treaties beneficiaries and with the utmost of loyalty to them (para. 524). The Crown has no competing interest or duty in the performance of this exercise, she explained, because [t]here is no other group to whom the Crown owes a duty of loyalty in this process (para. 524).\nThe evidentiary record does not support this finding. Although [t]here was ample evidence in the record . . . about the relationship of trust and reliance between the Treaty partners (Huron plaintiffs A.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 183), this evidence does not meet the high threshold required to establish an undertaking by the Crown to act in the best interests of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs. An ad hoc fiduciary duty is one of utmost loyalty to the beneficiary (Elder Advocates, at para. 43), and [n]ot every undertaking will ground an ad hoc fiduciary duty (J. Woodward, Aboriginal Law in Canada (loose-leaf), at  3:58). There must be a forsaking by the alleged fiduciary of the interests of all others in favour of those of the beneficiary, in relation to the specific legal interest at stake (Elder Advocates, at para. 31). Here, there is no evidence that the Crown undertook to forsake the interests of all others in favour of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs when discharging its obligations under the Augmentation Clause, either procedurally or substantively.\nIn addition, situations where [the Crown] will be shown to owe a duty of [utmost] loyalty to a particular person or group will be rare, particularly where an exercise of a government power or discretion is at issue (Woodward, at  3:58). In exercising its discretion about whether to increase the annuities and, if so, by how much, the Crown must consider not only the honour of the Crown, but also the wider public interest. This is apparent from the language and nature of the Augmentation Clause, which expresses the intention of Her Majesty . . . to deal liberally and justly with all Her subjects, and incorporates the economic condition. In these circumstances, and absent evidence to the contrary, I cannot conclude that the Crowns obligations regarding the Augmentation Clause involved an undertaking to forsake the interests of all others in favour of the plaintiffs.\nNo Sui Generis Fiduciary Duty Arises\nI am also unable to conclude that a sui generis fiduciary duty arises. A sui generis fiduciary duty is specific to the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples (Williams Lake, at para. 44, citing Wewaykum, at para. 78, Guerin v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335, at p. 385, and Sparrow, at p. 1108). Its origins lie in protecting the interests of Indigenous peoples in recognition of the degree of economic, social and proprietary control and discretion asserted by the Crown over them, which left them vulnerable to the risks of government misconduct or ineptitude (Wewaykum, at para. 80). \nA sui generis fiduciary duty arises where there is: (1) a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest; and (2) a Crown undertaking of discretionary control over that interest (Manitoba Metis, at para. 51; Williams Lake, at para. 44; Wewaykum, at paras. 79-83; Haida Nation, at para. 18). Unlike an ad hoc fiduciary duty, a sui generis fiduciary duty permits the Crown to balance competing interests. As Brown J. explained in Williams Lake, at para. 165 (dissenting, but not on this point): \nThis form of fiduciary duty imposes a less stringent standard than the duty of utmost loyalty incident to an ad hoc fiduciary duty. It requires Canada to act  in relation to the specific Aboriginal interest  with loyalty and in good faith, making full disclosure appropriate to the subject matter and with ordinary diligence: Wewaykum, at paras. 81 and 97. It allows for the necessity of balancing conflicting interests: Wewaykum, at para. 96.\nA sui generis fiduciary duty does not exist at large, but rather only in relation to a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest (Wewaykum, at para. 81; Williams Lake, at para. 52). Thus, [t]he specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest at stake must be identified with care (Williams Lake, at para. 52). The Huron and Superior plaintiffs identify two interests in relation to which, they argue, the Crown owes them sui generis fiduciary duties: (1) their treaty rights under the Augmentation Clause; and (2) their pre-existing interest in the ceded land, which is the source of their treaty rights under the Augmentation Clause. In my view, neither interest gives rise to a sui generis fiduciary duty.\nTreaty Rights Under the Augmentation Clause\nIn Williams Lake, Wagner J. (as he then was) explained that a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest must be sufficiently independent of the Crowns executive and legislative functions to give rise to responsibility in the nature of a private law duty (para. 52, citing Wewaykum, at paras. 74 and 85, Guerin, at p. 385, and D. E. Elliott, Much Ado About Dittos: Wewaykum and the Fiduciary Obligation of the Crown (2003), 29 Queens L.J. 1). \nThe Huron and Superior plaintiffs treaty right under the Augmentation Clause is, by definition, not sufficiently independent of the Crowns executive functions to give rise to a sui generis fiduciary duty, because it arises from the exercise of the Crowns executive treaty-making function. The Aboriginal interest is not the right to benefit economically from the land, or the right to have the Crown administer certain land on behalf of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs. Rather, it is a right to receive a certain annuity and to have the Crown consider, and if appropriate make, discretionary increases to that annuity from time to time. That right stems from the treaties, and would not exist had the Crown not exercised its treaty-making powers to that effect. \nManitoba Metis also supports this conclusion. There, this Court held that [a]n Aboriginal interest in land giving rise to a fiduciary duty cannot be established by treaty, or, by extension, legislation. Rather, it is predicated on historic use and occupation (para. 58). Although Manitoba Metis concerned an Aboriginal interest in land, not a treaty right, it is consistent with the general principle that specific or cognizable Aboriginal interests cannot be established by treaty or legislation.\nIn support of their position, the Huron and Superior plaintiffs rely on Karakatsanis J.s statement in Southwind v. Canada, 2021 SCC 28, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 450, that a strong fiduciary duty arises where the Crown is exercising control over Aboriginal and treaty rights that are protected under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (para. 62, citing Ermineskin Indian Band and Nation v. Canada, 2009 SCC 9, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 222, at para. 46). The Superior plaintiffs also point to Binnie J.s statement in Wewaykum that [t]he Guerin concept of a sui generis fiduciary duty was expanded in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, to include protection of the [A]boriginal peoples pre-existing and still existing [A]boriginal and treaty rights within s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (para. 78).\nNeither Southwind nor Wewaykum stands for the proposition that a treaty right is inherently a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest in respect of which the Crown may owe a sui generis fiduciary duty. Southwind concerned whether the trial judge erred in assessing equitable compensation for flooded reserve lands, not whether a treaty right is a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest attracting a sui generis fiduciary duty. Further, para. 46 of Ermineskin, to which Karakatsanis J. referred in Southwind, simply mentioned the bands submission in that case that, if a fiduciary duty arose from the treaty obligation in question, it would be constitutionally protected under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. This Court in Ermineskin ultimately did not find that a sui generis fiduciary duty arose in respect of this treaty right (paras. 49-50).\nFurthermore, language in prior jurisprudence of this Court referring to the more general fiduciary relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples does not assist in determining whether there is a specific sui generis fiduciary duty in a given case. In Wewaykum, Binnie J. explained that Sparrow expanded the idea of a sui generis fiduciary duty to include the protection of Aboriginal and treaty rights within s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982: \nThe sui generis nature of Indian title, and the historic powers and responsibility assumed by the Crown constituted the source of such a fiduciary obligation. In our opinion, Guerin, together with R. v. Taylor and Williams (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 360, ground a general guiding principle for s. 35(1). That is, the Government has the responsibility to act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to [A]boriginal peoples. The relationship between the Government and [A]boriginals is trust-like, rather than adversarial, and contemporary recognition and affirmation of [A]boriginal rights must be defined in light of this historic relationship. [Emphasis deleted.]\n\n(Wewaykum, at para. 78, citing Sparrow, at p. 1108.)\nIn this passage, the Court did not suggest that the Crown has a sui generis fiduciary duty in respect of all Aboriginal and treaty rights. Rather, the Court simply recognized that the Crown is in a trust-like relationship with Indigenous peoples. \nAlthough this Court now uses the language of fiduciary duties to denote specific duties owed by the Crown in respect of cognizable Aboriginal interests, this conception is of relatively recent vintage. At the time of Guerin (1984) and Sparrow (1990), the terms fiduciary obligation and fiduciary capacity were used to ground a general guiding principle for s. 35(1) that the Government has the responsibility to act in a fiduciary capacity with respect to [A]boriginal peoples (Sparrow, at p. 1108; McCabe, at pp. 58-59). Some have suggested that, during this period, this Court considered the fiduciary relationship as closely associated if not equivalent to the overarching principle of honour of the Crown, and that the tendency to conflate the fiduciary relation and the honour of the Crown continued for more than a decade after Sparrow (McCabe, at pp. 58-59). This would include the Wewaykum decision in 2002. However, under this Courts more recent jurisprudence, including Manitoba Metis, it is now recognized that the honour of the Crown remains a much broader concept than fiduciary duty (Hogg and Dougan, at p. 307). That said, the honour of the Crown has not subsumed or overtaken the Crowns fiduciary duties to Indigenous peoples. Rather, ad hoc and sui generis fiduciary duties continue to play an important and distinct role in shaping the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples in certain circumstances. \nI disagree with the Superior plaintiffs that this Courts decision in Bear Island, decided in 1991, stands for the proposition that the Crown owes a sui generis fiduciary duty regarding its obligations under the Robinson Treaties. Although the Court accepted the Crowns concession that it breached its fiduciary obligations to the Indians under the Robinson-Huron Treaty (at p. 575), the Court did not decide the case based on a breach of fiduciary duty or analyze whether a specific sui generis fiduciary duty exists regarding the treaty rights. In these circumstances, the Courts reference to fiduciary obligations is best understood as a reference to the more general fiduciary relationship discussed in earlier case law, which always exists in Crown-Indigenous dealings and reflects the broader duty of the honour of the Crown.\nPre-Existing Interest in Ceded Land\nFinally, the Crown does not owe a sui generis fiduciary duty in respect of the Huron and Superior plaintiffs pre-existing interest in the ceded land. At trial and on appeal, the plaintiffs suggested that the interest in the ceded territory that became the subject of the Robinson Treaties was historically occupied and communally held prior to contact and is, therefore, capable of constituting a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest in land in the pre-Treaty context (Stage One reasons, at para. 509). In response, Ontario and Canada pointed to the surrender provisions in the Robinson Treaties  which state that the signatories voluntarily surrender, cede, grant and convey . . . their right, title and interest to the Crown  as evidence that any pre-existing interest in the ceded land no longer exists.\nThe trial judge and Court of Appeal correctly concluded that even if such a pre-existing interest still exists, and even if it would amount to a specific or cognizable Aboriginal interest, the second requirement for a sui generis fiduciary duty is not met. Specifically, as the trial judge found, neither the treaty text nor the context in which the Robinson Treaties were signed provide any evidence that the Crown would administer the land on behalf of the Treaties beneficiaries (Stage One reasons, at para. 512). There was no undertaking by the Crown of discretionary control over the interest in land (paras. 511-12). \nI conclude the Crown is not subject to an ad hoc or sui generis fiduciary duty in respect of the augmentation promise in the Robinson Treaties. As I explain in the next section, however, the Crown is subject to a duty to diligently implement or fulfill that promise, and its failure to do so is a breach of treaty.\nThe Crown Has a Duty To Diligently Implement the Augmentation Promise\nIntroduction\nAll parties before this Court agree that the Crown has an obligation to diligently fulfill or implement the Augmentation Clause in the Robinson Treaties. They diverge, as the courts below did, on precisely what this duty requires of the Crown in practice, including how the past breaches of this obligation should be remedied. \nThe trial judge held that the honour of the Crown requires that the Crown work diligently to implement a process to consider increasing the annuities and the economic factors that interact with that decision, but the Crown does not have unfettered discretion on whether or how to make increases to the annuities (Stage One reasons, at para. 568). She also acknowledged the importance of renewing the treaty relationship to allow the parties to co-exist in a mutually respectful and beneficial relationship going into the future (para. 573). \nThe Court of Appeal was unanimous in the view that the honour of the Crown was engaged in this case, but divided on precisely how it should apply. The majority (per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., Hourigan J.A. concurring) held that, in the circumstances, the honour of the Crown obliges the Crown to increase the annuities beyond $4 per person as part of its duty to diligently implement the Augmentation Clause (paras. 87 and 241). The minority (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A.) would not have mandated an increase as part of the treaty obligation, but would have ruled that the honour of the Crown obliges the Crown, at minimum, to turn its mind from time to time to consider increasing the annuities beyond $4 (paras. 87 and 499). The Court of Appeal was also unanimous in the view that the Crowns discretion about whether and how to augment the annuities was justiciable and not unfettered (para. 88). \nBefore this Court, Ontario acknowledges that it has a duty to diligently implement the augmentation promise consistently with the honour of the Crown. But it says this duty is only procedural: fulfilling the duty simply requires the province to consider increases above the $4 cap from time to time (A.F., at paras. 97-98 and 102). In its view, the Crown cannot be ordered by a court to pay a particular sum of money in damages to the plaintiffs to remedy a past breach of the Augmentation Clause (paras. 105 and 108). Canada says that the duty of diligent implementation simply requires the Crown to implement the Augmentation Clause in a way that honours the purpose of the Treaties and advances reconciliation (R.F., at para. 38). Canada and Ontario both accept that whatever discretion the Crown has in implementing the Augmentation Clause is not unfettered (Ontarios A.F., at para. 3; Canadas R.F., at para. 4).\nThe Superior plaintiffs say that the duty of diligent and purposeful implementation is at the core of the Crowns obligations under the treaty, and requires the Crown to take positive and timely steps to fulfill the treaty promises (A.F. on cross-appeal, at para. 55). The Huron plaintiffs suggest that the duty of diligent fulfillment operates to constrain the exercise of [the Crowns] discretionary powers (R.F., at para. 109). They add that this duty is not . . . a freestanding duty, but instead is linked to the underlying claim for breach of treaty from which remedies, including damages, ultimately flow: When the Crown breaches its duty to honourably implement the Treaty, it breaches the Treaty itself (para. 109).\nAs I explain below, I disagree with Ontarios submission that the duty of diligent implementation imposes only procedural obligations regarding the implementation of the Augmentation Clause. Instead, I conclude that the Crown is required, and indeed was always required, to act in an honourable and timely way to pursue the purpose behind the treaty promise. As I explain when addressing remedies in the next section, this requires the Crown to pay an amount, subject to review by the courts, to compensate the Superior plaintiffs for its past breach of the Augmentation Clause, which in this case is a breach of both the duty of diligent implementation and of the treaty itself. \nThe Duty of Diligent Implementation\nThe duty of diligent implementation holds the Crown responsible for making good on its treaty promises. The duty was first recognized in this Courts decision in Manitoba Metis, which concerned certain obligations owed to the Red River Metis in the Manitoba Act, 1870. The Red River Metis had forcefully resisted colonial advances for many years, but agreed to become part of Canada in 1870. In return, Canada agreed to grant 1.4 million acres of land to Metis descendants and to recognize certain existing landholdings. These two pledges were set out in ss. 31 and 32 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, a constitutional instrument. \nOver the years, the Crown set aside some land for the Metis descendants, but errors and delays ensued. Allotments were abandoned, distributions of land became random, and speculators began acquiring Metis land through legal loopholes. In 1981, the Manitoba Metis Federation and individual Metis claimants sued the attorneys general of Canada and Manitoba for declarations that the Crown had breached a fiduciary duty owed to the Metis in implementing the Manitoba Act, 1870 and had failed to implement the land grant promise consistently with the honour of the Crown. Both the trial judge and the Manitoba Court of Appeal dismissed the action.\nThis Court unanimously found that no fiduciary duties arose out of the Crowns promises to the Metis in s. 31 of the Manitoba Act, 1870. Writing for the majority, McLachlin C.J. and Karakatsanis J. nevertheless ruled that the Metis were entitled to a declaration that the Crown had failed to act diligently in implementing the land grants. This duty flowed directly from the honour of the Crown and required the Crown to take a broad purposive approach to the interpretation of the land grant promise and to act diligently to fulfill it (para. 75).\nElaborating on the second requirement, the majority explained that although the law assumes that the Crown always intends to fulfill its solemn promises, including constitutional obligations (para. 79, citing Badger, and Haida Nation, at para. 20), the Crowns responsibilities go further: . . . if the honour of the Crown is pledged to the fulfillment of its obligations, it follows then that the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to endeavour to ensure its obligations are fulfilled with due diligence (para. 79, citing Moses, at para. 23).\nThe Crowns duty to ensure that its obligations are fulfilled requires that the Crown seek to perform the obligation in a way that pursues the purpose behind the promise to avoid leaving Indigenous parties with an empty shell of a promise (para. 80). It is a narrow and circumscribed duty which, in Manitoba Metis, was said to be engaged by the extraordinary facts before us, namely, a persistent pattern of errors and indifference that substantially frustrates the purposes of a solemn promise may amount to a betrayal of the Crowns duty to act honourably in fulfilling its promise (paras. 81-82). The majority found that the prompt and equitable implementation of the land grant promise was fundamental to reconciliation, which the Crowns mistakes and inaction had prevented. In the majoritys view, [a] government sincerely intent on fulfilling the duty that its honour demanded could and should have done better (para. 128). The Court ultimately issued a declaration that the federal Crown had failed to implement the land grant provision in s. 31 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 in accordance with the honour of the Crown (para. 154). \nSince Manitoba Metis, the duty of diligent implementation has received only limited attention in the jurisprudence (see, e.g., First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 52; Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 ONCA 565, 486 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at paras. 150-52; Watson v. Canada, 2020 FC 129, at paras. 499-500 (CanLII); Yahey v. British Columbia, 2021 BCSC 1287, 43 C.E.L.R. (4th) 1, at paras. 1779-87). This Courts comments in Manitoba Metis remain the most complete and authoritative statement of the law on this duty. \nAlthough all parties agree the Crown has an obligation to diligently fulfill or implement the Augmentation Clause in the Robinson Treaties, Ontario insists, like the Court of Appeal minority concluded, that the duty is only procedural: the duty will be fulfilled if the Crown shows it has at least considered or turned its mind to increasing the $4 annuity from time to time. \nI accept that the duty of diligent implementation speaks to how Crown obligations must be fulfilled, rather than specifying a particular result in a given case (Manitoba Metis, at para. 73). Nevertheless, the Court must guard against divorcing the duty of diligent implementation from the very nature of the treaty promise at issue. The duty of diligent implementation itself does not dictate a particular result in this case. However, what it means to diligently and honourably implement the augmentation promise cannot be understood in terms of procedure alone, without reference to what the augmentation promise requires. In this case, all parties have agreed that an increase to the annuity in respect of the past is required. To determine what the duty of diligent implementation or fulfillment requires in this case, the Court must consider the question posed in Haida Nation in the context of the duty to consult: . . . what is required to maintain the honour of the Crown and to effect reconciliation between the Crown and the Aboriginal peoples with respect to the interests at stake? (para. 45). In doing so, the Court must bear in mind that the honour of the Crown is a concept that necessarily finds its application in concrete practices (para. 16).\nI cannot accept Ontarios submission that a purely procedural duty  by which the Crown is simply required to consider or turn its mind to discretionary increases to the annuities from time to time  would maintain the honour of the Crown or effect reconciliation between the parties. Since 1875, when the first and only increase to the annuities was made, the Crown has failed to consider whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss and, if so, to exercise its discretion to determine whether and by how much to increase them. For well over a century, the Crown has shown itself to be a patently unreliable and untrustworthy treaty partner in relation to the augmentation promise. It has lost the moral authority to simply say trust us.\nI pause here to note the trial judges view that determining whether the Crown had fulfilled its duties under the Robinson Treaties were not Stage One issues (Stage One reasons, at para. 393; see also C.A. reasons, at para. 326). Yet, before this Court, both Canada and Ontario frankly acknowledged that, for some 150 years, the Crown has breached its duty to diligently implement the treaties augmentation promise. In doing so, they agreed that they have failed to uphold both the honour of the Crown and the principles of respect, responsibility, reciprocity, and renewal that underpinned the Anishinaabes perspective on the treaty relationship with the Crown (transcript, day 1, at p. 6; Canadas R.F., at para. 34). They agreed that some level of increase beyond $4 for the period between 1875 and today is required (transcript, day 1, at p. 15). This acknowledgement is reflected in the $10 billion settlement recently reached between the Huron plaintiffs, Ontario, and Canada for past breaches of the augmentation promise. \nConclusion\nI have no difficulty concluding that the Crown has clearly breached its duty to diligently fulfill the augmentation promise under the Robinson Treaties. As I explain below, I also have no difficulty concluding that the Huron and Superior plaintiffs are entitled to a remedy for this breach.\nThe Remedy for the Crowns Failure To Diligently Implement the Augmentation Promise\nIntroduction\nThe remedy owed by the Crown for its breach of the Robinson Treaties, and the potential for that remedy to advance reconciliation, are pivotal issues in these appeals.\nThe trial judge held that implementing the treaty promise requires the Crown to engage in a consultative process with the beneficiaries and pay an increased annuity, reflecting what she called a fair share of the proceeds of the territory. She rejected Ontarios submission that a declaration simply stating that the Crown was under an obligation to act honourably to fulfill the purpose of the Robinson Treaties would sufficiently restore the treaty relationship and the Crowns honour (Stage One reasons, at para. 496).\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal (per Lauwers and Pardu JJ.A., Hourigan J.A. concurring) ruled that it was reasonable for the trial judge to have no confidence that a simple declaration would trigger good faith negotiations (para. 276). They encouraged the parties to negotiate, rather than litigate, the remaining issues, including remedies (para. 327). They noted that negotiations allow the court to step back from [c]lose judicial management that may undermine the meaningful dialogue and long-term relationship that these treaties are designed to foster (para. 328, citing First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 60). Negotiated agreements, they added, would also create precision, continuity, transparency, and predictability in the treaty relationship and would be afforded judicial deference (para. 329). \nThe Court of Appeal minority (per Strathy C.J.O. and Brown J.A.) would have directed the trial judge to invite further submissions concerning the implementation of the treaties, including on: (a) the frequency with which the Crown is required to turn its mind to augmenting the annuities; (b) the considerations to be taken into account when determining whether the Crown can increase the annuities without incurring loss; (c) calculation of the amounts by which the Crown should have increased the annuities; and (d) damages resulting from the Crowns breach (para. 506). They recognized that promoting negotiation and the just settlement of Aboriginal claims as an alternative to litigation and judicially imposed outcomes can advance reconciliation (para. 494, citing Mikisew Cree 2018, at para. 22). But they also agreed with the trial judge that, given the Crowns neglect of the treaty promise for over a century and a half, the court had the authority and the obligation to impose specific and general duties on the Crown (paras. 503-4, citing Stage One reasons, at para. 497). \nAlthough Ontario now concedes that it has breached its constitutional duties under the Robinson Treaties, it argues that only declaratory relief is available for this breach. Substantive or coercive remedies, including damages, are unavailable because the honour of the Crown is not itself a cause of action (A.F., at paras. 105 and 108); substantive or coercive remedies would naturally drive the parties into an adversarial relationship (para. 111); and declaratory relief would be consistent with the principle that decisions about the allocation of public resources belong to legislatures and to the executive, not the courts (para. 113, citing Provincial Court Judges Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice), 2005 SCC 44, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 286, at para. 20). In these circumstances, Ontario says, a declaration that the Crown must exercise its discretion consistently with the honour of the Crown, and that this discretion is subject to review by the courts, is an appropriate and effective remedy.\nCanada and the Huron and Superior plaintiffs say that substantive or coercive remedies, including damages, are available here and should be determined at Stage Three. According to the Huron plaintiffs, the choice of remedy should be informed by whether it serves to repair the treaty relationship, restore the honour of the Crown, and give effect to the parties shared understanding of the treaty (R.F., at para. 115). The Superior plaintiffs add that a monetary award is consistent with reconciliation and that awarding compensation after identifying losses caused by the Crowns failure to exercise its discretion is the core work of the court (R.F., at para. 115). In Canadas view, declaratory remedies, while available here, are unlikely to be sufficient given the longstanding and ongoing nature of the Crowns breach (R.F., at para. 44).\nIn my view, a declaration clarifying the rights and obligations of the parties is an appropriate remedy in this case, as it will inform both the future implementation of the Robinson Treaties and clarify the nature of the past breach. At the same time, given the longstanding and egregious nature of the Crowns breach of the Augmentation Clause for almost a century and a half, a declaration, while helpful, would be insufficient to renew the treaty relationship and restore the Crowns honour. The Crown must provide redress for the conceded breach of its duty. In doing so, the Crown should take into account various factors including, but not limited to, the nature and severity of the breaches, the number of Anishinaabe and their needs, the benefits the Crown has received from the ceded territories and its expenses over time, the wider needs of other Indigenous populations and the non-Indigenous populations of Ontario and Canada, and the principles and requirements flowing from the honour of the Crown, including its duty to diligently implement its sacred promise under the treaty to share in the wealth of the land if it proved profitable. However, it is appropriate for that redress to be negotiated by the treaty partners, in a manner that is consistent with the goal of reconciliation. \nAs I will elaborate, I would therefore provide further direction requiring the Crown to engage in honourable and time-bound negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs concerning compensation for past breaches of the Augmentation Clause. If the parties are unable to arrive at a negotiated settlement, then the Crown must, within six months of the release of these reasons, exercise its discretion under the Augmentation Clause and set an amount to compensate the Superior plaintiffs for past breaches. The amount, and the process through which it is arrived at, will be subject to review by the courts.\nThe Full Range of Remedies Is Available \nThe Crowns breach of the augmentation promise is both a breach of the duty of diligent fulfillment and a breach of the treaty itself. In principle, the full range of remedies  declaratory and coercive  is available.\nIt is a well-established principle of Canadian law that [w]here there are legal rights there are remedies (Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at para. 102). Indeed, a right has practical value only to the extent that it is vindicated by an adequate remedy (J. Cassels and E. Adjin-Tettey, Remedies: The Law of Damages (3rd ed. 2014), at p. 1). Likewise, Aboriginal and treaty rights protected under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 will not be meaningful without effective remedies (K. Roach, Constitutional Remedies in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at  15:2).\nTo respect their constitutional status, uphold the honour of the Crown, and advance reconciliation, Aboriginal and treaty rights can be no less enforceable than other constitutional rights (Sparrow, at pp. 1106-7; see also Van der Peet, at paras. 20-21). As the guardians of the Constitution and guarantors of constitutionally entrenched rights, courts are responsible for ensuring that Aboriginal and treaty rights are protected by adequate, effective, and meaningful remedies (Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 155; Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 753). \nWhere the Crown has breached its treaty obligations or the duties arising from the honour of the Crown, the full range of remedies, including damages and other coercive relief, is available to remedy that breach (Roach, at  15:2). In the duty to consult context, for example, this Court has recognized that a breach of the duty can lead to a number of remedies ranging from injunctive relief against the threatening activity altogether, to damages, to an order to carry out the consultation prior to proceeding further with the proposed government conduct (Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. v. Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, 2010 SCC 43, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 650, at para. 37, citing Haida Nation, at paras. 13-14). \nAs with other constitutional rights, courts should take a purposive approach to determining the appropriate remedy for breaches of treaty obligations (Roach, at  15:2). As always, [t]he controlling question . . . is what is required to maintain the honour of the Crown and to effect reconciliation between the Crown and the Aboriginal peoples with respect to the interests at stake (Haida Nation, at para. 45). Restoring the honour of the Crown requires the courts to be creative within a principled legal framework and provide remedies that forward the goal of reconciliation (Hogg and Dougan, at p. 292; see also Roach, at  15:1-15:2). \nA Declaration Is an Appropriate Remedy in This Case\nIn my view, a declaration is an appropriate remedy in that it will offer a definitive statement of the rights and obligations under the Augmentation Clause to guide the parties in negotiating compensation for past breaches and to encourage the renewal of the treaty relationship moving forward. \nA declaration is a judicial statement confirming or denying a legal right of the applicant. Unlike most rulings, the declaratory judgment merely declares and goes no further in providing relief to the applicant than stating his rights (L. Sarna, The Law of Declaratory Judgments (4th ed. 2016), at p. 1). Declaratory relief is discretionary. A court may award a declaration where (a) the court has jurisdiction to hear the issue, (b) the dispute is real and not theoretical, (c) the party raising the issue has a genuine interest in its resolution, and (d) the responding party has an interest in opposing the declaration being sought (S.A. v. Metro Vancouver Housing Corp., 2019 SCC 4, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 99, at para. 60; Ewert v. Canada, 2018 SCC 30, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 165, at para. 81; see also Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2016 SCC 12, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 99, at para. 11, and Canada (Prime Minister) v. Khadr, 2010 SCC 3, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 44, at para. 46). A declaration should not be issued if it is not capable of having any practical effect in resolving the issues in the case (Solosky v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, at p. 833). \nAll parties agree that this Court can issue declaratory relief in this case. First, there is no question as to this Courts jurisdiction over the issues in these appeals. Second, the dispute between the parties is real and not theoretical: the parties disagree about many live issues, including the correct interpretation of the Augmentation Clause, the duties it imposes on the Crown, and the remedy for the Crowns breach of these duties. Third, although the Crown has acted dishonourably in neglecting its duties under the Augmentation Clause for close to 150 years, the long history of this litigation and the recent $10 billion settlement between the Crown and the Huron plaintiffs regarding past breaches suggest that all parties have a genuine interest in resolving the issues. Fourth, although before this Court Ontario now accepts that the appropriate remedy is a declaration stating that the Crown is required to exercise its discretion as to whether to augment the annuities, it has opposed declaratory relief of the kind sought by the plaintiffs for most of this litigation. Until recently, Ontario maintained that it had not breached the Augmentation Clause because it possessed unfettered discretion as to whether to increase the annuities beyond $4. In this sense, it has opposed a declaration recognizing its breach of the Augmentation Clause from day one. However, as this Court explained in Shot Both Sides v. Canada, 2024 SCC 12, at para. 81, the Crowns belated concession of a breach of a treaty right should not foreclose the possibility of declaratory relief. To hold otherwise would privilege form over substance with respect to the nature of the real dispute before us, and would overlook the protracted nature of the dispute that led the parties to this point (para. 81).\nIn my view, there is considerable value in this Court providing a declaration that clarifies the Crowns obligations regarding the Augmentation Clause and recognizes that the Crown has breached those obligations. Such a declaration will be a definitive statement of rights that the treaty partners can rely on in negotiations to determine how the Augmentation Clause must be honourably implemented regarding both the past and the future (see Manitoba Metis, at para. 137). In this regard, I agree with the following observations of Justice Rowe, writing extra-judicially with Diane Shnier:\nDeclarations allow courts to state generally what is necessary to comply with constitutionally guaranteed treaty rights, and allow the government flexibility in how to achieve that compliance. Further, declarations about a discrete issue or aspect of an agreement may facilitate negotiation outside the litigation process, which can be particularly important in the context of treaties with Aboriginal peoples.\n\n(The Limits of the Declaratory Judgment (2022), 67 McGill L.J. 295, at p. 318)\nAs this Court has noted, declaratory relief is not meant to represent the end of the reconciliation process for the Crowns breach of a treaty; it merely helps set the stage for further efforts at restoring the nation-to-nation relationship and the honour of the Crown (Shot Both Sides, at para. 74).\nA Declaration Is Appropriate, but Insufficient\nWhile a declaration is appropriate, I am of the view that a bare declaration, without more, is insufficient given the egregious and longstanding nature of the breaches at issue in these appeals. In these circumstances, a simple declaration would not adequately repair the treaty relationship or restore the honour of the Crown. It would not sufficiently vindicate the treaty rights or meaningfully advance reconciliation. \nThe treaties concluded between the parties were fundamentally alliances of equals founded on the principles of mutual respect, mutual responsibility, reciprocity, and renewal (Stage One reasons, at para. 423). In requiring the Crown to periodically revisit the annuity and consider increasing the amount, the Augmentation Clause embodies the parties desire for a continually renewing bond that would keep them in a relationship with one another in perpetuity. Yet today, well over a century has passed since the Crown has turned its mind to that promise, and by extension to the renewal of the relationship itself. Ontario expresses concern that any remedy beyond a pure declaration would drive the parties into an adversarial relationship (A.F., at para. 111). The Superior plaintiffs respond that it is not the requested remedy that has done this, but rather the Crowns abject failure for almost 150 years to honour sacred treaty rights (R.F., at para. 113). I agree with the Superior plaintiffs. The Crown cannot reasonably have believed that giving its treaty partners $4 each annually since 1875 was in any way honourable. \nWhat is more, since the Robinson Treaties were concluded in 1850, the Crown has derived enormous economic benefit from the ceded territories through mining and other activities. Meanwhile, as the Court of Appeal noted, the Anishinaabe treaty partners have experienced many deprivations in their communities, such as substandard housing and boil water advisories (para. 322). One treaty partner has thrived, while the other has often experienced immense hardship.\nBefore leaving this point, it is appropriate to recall that the trial judge found that the Robinson Treaties were motivated largely by the principles of kinship and mutual interdependence, as reflected in the Covenant Chain. This enduring alliance has been depicted using the metaphor of a ship tied to a tree with a metal chain: The metaphor associated with the chain was that if one party was in need, they only had to tug on the rope to give the signal that something was amiss, and all would be restored (Stage One reasons, at para. 65). The Anishinaabe treaty partners have been tugging on the rope for some 150 years now, but the Crown has ignored their calls. The Crown has severely undermined both the spirit and substance of the Robinson Treaties.\nBecause of this, and as the trial judge observed, after 168 years of no action on the part of the Crown, the court cannot simply accept the Crowns acknowledgment of their duty of honour and permit the Crown to carry on without further direction (Stage One reasons, at para. 492). I agree with the Huron plaintiffs that a mere declaration would risk forcing them to continue to rely on a historically dishonourable Treaty partner to take steps to restore the Treaty relationship (R.F., at para. 117). This would be deeply unsatisfactory and would risk leaving the Anishinaabe treaty partners with an empty shell of a promise once again. I would therefore provide additional direction to the Crown regarding the Superior plaintiffs to ensure that it exercises its discretion under the Augmentation Clause in a timely and honourable manner regarding past breaches.\nFurther Direction Is Needed\nAs I have said, I am of the view that the full range of remedies, including damages, is available for breach of treaty claims, just as they are for breaches of other constitutional rights. Even so, I am not convinced that proceeding immediately to a judicially calculated damages award for past breaches in Stage Three is appropriate at this time, given the nature of the treaty promise, the proper role of the courts, and the need to effectively repair the treaty relationship and restore the honour of the Crown. \nThe Nature of the Treaty Promise \nI agree with the Superior plaintiffs that after more than a century of Crown neglect, they have the right to a remedy. I have concluded that the Crown must increase the annuity beyond $4 per person regarding the past, since it would be patently dishonourable not to do so. However, the fact of the matter is that the Augmentation Clause is not a promise on the part of the Crown to pay a certain sum of money. Rather, it is a promise to consider whether the economic conditions allow the Crown to increase the annuities without incurring loss and, if they do, to exercise its discretion and determine whether to increase the annuities and, if so, by how much. \nThe Crown must exercise this discretion liberally and justly, consistently with the honour of the Crown and the language of the treaty itself, but it retains the authority and, in the present circumstances, has the obligation to set a figure that it considers will meet those requirements. Until the Crown has exercised that discretion through honourable engagement with its treaty partners and has proposed an amount of compensation, it should generally not be judicially compelled to pay a certain sum of money to redress the harms occasioned by its neglect. Absent a settlement, the Crown will be required to explain to the Superior plaintiffs and the court how it reached its determination and why. This would permit the court to pay careful attention to the manner in which the Crown exercised its discretion, having regard to both the amount determined and the process by which it arrived at that amount, when assessing whether the Crowns determination is honourable.\nI hasten to add that this does not mean that the Crown should never be judicially compelled to pay a certain sum of money as determined by a court. Under some circumstances, a court may decide to intervene and set the amount to be paid by the Crown. For example, a failure by the Crown to pay an honourable amount in all the circumstances should not limit a court to quashing the amount set by the Crown and remanding the issue to the Crown for redetermination. In such a case, a court may need to make a determination that the Crown refuses to make, or that it makes dishonourably. The Crown cannot be allowed to continue to undermine the very object and purpose of the treaty promise.  \nHowever, now that this Court has finally determined the Crowns obligations under the Augmentation Clause, and given Ontarios position before this Court that we are listening and you are going to tell us how to approach this, it can be expected that the Crown will diligently honour its longstanding treaty promise to the Anishinaabe. In my view, given the nature of the treaty promise at issue, the Crown must be afforded a circumscribed window within which to exercise its discretion, either through honourable negotiation or by determination of the Crown if necessary. This will create space for the parties to repair and renew their treaty relationship. As this Court recognized in Haida Nation, [w]hile Aboriginal claims can be and are pursued through litigation, negotiation is a preferable way of reconciling state and Aboriginal interests (para. 14).\nThe Proper Role of the Courts\nDirecting the Crown to exercise its discretion forthwith is also a measured approach that appropriately respects the proper role of the courts and the separation of powers. As Professor Kent Roach has explained in the context of Aboriginal rights:\n. . . courts that enforce Aboriginal rights must also consider a range of other factors and competing interests. Courts should provide remedies that respect institutional roles including the limits on the judiciary. In many cases, courts are hopeful that issues can be resolved out of court by a process of consultation and negotiation. This approach is particularly attractive in the Aboriginal rights context because of its potential to allow Aboriginal nations to exercise some degree of self-determination and because of the complexity of the issues and the broad range of reasonable solutions and forms of reconciliation. At the same time, Aboriginal rights may ultimately have to be enforced by the courts, albeit in a way that respects institutional roles and is fair to all those affected. [ 15:2]\nProfessor Roachs comments are instructive in relation to treaty rights as well. As in the Charter context, it is true here that an appropriate and just remedy must employ means that are legitimate within the framework of our constitutional democracy. . . . [A] court ordering a Charter remedy must strive to respect the relationships with and separation of functions among the legislature, the executive and the judiciary (Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 56). The amount by which the Crown might increase the annuity is a polycentric and discretionary determination that will inevitably reflect many social, economic, and policy considerations that may change over time, affecting the frequency and nature of net revenue and annuity calculations. Determining the amount of compensation owed for the past will involve similar considerations. I stress that courts are not incompetent or unable to entertain these considerations when necessary. Indeed, I acknowledge the jurisdiction of the courts to order compensation at Stage Three if appropriate to do so. However, I also recognize that courts are generally not well equipped to make polycentric choices or to evaluate the wide-ranging consequences that flow from policy implementation (Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 120, per LeBel and Deschamps JJ., dissenting; see generally Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at pp. 723-24). Accordingly, courts should exercise considerable caution before intervening in such circumstances. \nIn this regard, I am mindful that in Stage Three of this trial, argued and taken under reserve in September 2023, the Superior plaintiffs claimed damages totalling approximately $126 billion to compensate them for the Crowns past breaches of the Augmentation Clause. This figure is equivalent to approximately two-thirds of the total reported annual revenue of the province of Ontario, from all sources, in the 2022-23 fiscal year (Minister of Finance, 2023 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review  Building a Strong Ontario Together, Background Papers (2023)). I hasten to emphasize that the magnitude of this figure in no way drives the remedy in this decision. Naturally, where the Crown has defaulted on its payment obligations for almost 150 years, the amount due will be substantial. The Anishinaabe signatories cannot now be short-changed by the Crowns sticker shock, which is solely the result of the Crowns own dishonourable neglect of its sacred treaty promises. \nAt the same time, I have concluded that the Augmentation Clause constitutes a promise on the part of the Crown to exercise its discretion as to potential increases to the annuities beyond $4 per person where it can do so without incurring loss. This discretion must be exercised honourably, but also in accordance with Her Majestys desire to deal liberally and justly with all Her subjects  to do justice to the Anishinaabe treaty partners and Her Majestys other subjects. Accordingly, in exercising its discretion, the Crown will have to engage in complex polycentric decision making that weighs the solemnity of its obligations to the Anishinaabe and the needs of other Ontarians and Canadians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous alike. This is well within the expertise of the executive branch, but is much less within the expertise of the courts. \nThese principles concerning the proper role of the courts dovetail with the idea that [r]econciliation often demands judicial forbearance. Courts should generally leave space for the parties to govern together and work out their differences (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 4). As Lamer C.J. wrote in Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, it is through negotiated settlements, with good faith and give and take on all sides, reinforced by the judgments of this Court, that we will achieve . . . a basic purpose of s. 35(1)  the reconciliation of the pre-existence of [A]boriginal societies with the sovereignty of the Crown (para. 186; see also F. Hoehn, The Duty to Negotiate and the Ethos of Reconciliation (2020), 83 Sask. L. Rev. 1). As this Court has recognized in the duty to consult context, [t]rue reconciliation is rarely, if ever, achieved in courtrooms (Clyde River (Hamlet) v. Petroleum Geo-Services Inc., 2017 SCC 40, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1069, at para. 24; see also Mikisew Cree 2018, at para. 22).\nEven so, as my colleague Martin J. wisely observed during Ontarios oral submissions before this Court, accountability most certainly does take place in a courtroom (transcript, day 1, at p. 9). Indeed, judicial forbearance should not come at the expense of adequate scrutiny of Crown conduct to ensure constitutional compliance (First Nation of Nacho Nyak Dun, at para. 34). As in the present case, litigation may sometimes be the only way to bring an intransigent party to the negotiating table with a view to reaching a settlement and advancing reconciliation.\nAlthough it is not the business of the courts to force the Crown to exercise its discretion in a particular way, it is very much the business of the courts to review exercises of Crown discretion for constitutional compliance  to ensure that the Crown exercises its discretion in accordance with its treaty obligations and the constitutional principle of the honour of the Crown. It is appropriate in this case for this Court to order the government to repair the breach of its constitutional obligations, while leaving it up to the executive branch to determine the best means of doing so (see generally Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, at para. 96; Ardoch Algonquin First Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 FCA 473, [2004] 2 F.C.R. 108, at paras. 46-47, per Rothstein J.A. (as he then was)). While not a perfect analogy, a direction to this effect bears a family resemblance to an order in the nature of mandamus, insofar as it orders that discretion be exercised, without specifying exactly how (see D. J. M. Brown, J. M. Evans and A. J. Beatty, with the assistance of D. Fairlie, Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (loose-leaf), at  1:24; British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 41, at pp. 127-28; Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 F.C. 742 (C.A.), at pp. 767-68, affd [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1100; Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers, 2001 SCC 31, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 772, at para. 41).\nRenewing the Treaty Relationship and Restoring the Crowns Honour\nI am also guided by the fact that the Robinson Treaties were not only about securing land in exchange for a monetary annuity. As the trial judge found, [f]rom the Anishinaabe perspective, the central goal of the treaty was to renew their relationship with the Crown (Stage One reasons, at para. 412 (emphasis added)). For the Anishinaabe, the Treaties were not a contract and were not transactional; they were the means by which the Anishinaabe would continue to live in harmony with the newcomers and maintain relationships in unforeseeable and evolving circumstances (para. 423). The Huron plaintiffs say this best: What the Treaty promises is . . . an ongoing relationship with procedural and substantive aspects. The Crown cannot fulfill its duty by paying an arbitrary sum of money without engaging its Treaty partner (R.F., at para. 101 (emphasis added)). The Superior plaintiffs would be deprived of the relational aspect of the treaty if Stage Three of this litigation were to proceed as currently conceived. Accordingly, even though the Crown now concedes that it has breached the Augmentation Clause, Stage Three should not proceed directly to a traditional damages calculation.\nOf course, some may point out that the Crown has had almost 150 years to exercise its discretion and that, because of its failure to do so, compensation should now be available to the Superior plaintiffs in Stage Three immediately. Given the long history of this litigation and the dishonourable nature of the Crowns breach of treaty, I am sympathetic to this view. Yet it bears repeating that the Augmentation Clause is not a promise to pay a certain sum of money. It is a promise by the Crown to consider increases beyond $4 and, where appropriate, to exercise its discretion to increase the annuities. At this stage, a judicially calculated damages award would remove from the treaty implementation any exercise of Crown discretion and engagement between treaty partners  the very essence of the treaty promise respecting increases beyond $4. It would also fail to effectively renew the treaty relationship and restore the honour of the Crown. \nIn my view, then, a court-calculated compensation award for past breaches in relation to the Superior plaintiffs is not yet an appropriate recourse. Instead, I would direct a narrow, time-bound window for negotiation, after which the Crown is (failing a settlement) required to exercise its discretion honourably in a manner consistent with these reasons and determine an amount of compensation. Such a remedy has greater potential to fulfill the purposes of the Augmentation Clause and hold the Crown to account for its breach of the treaty to date. This limited timeline for negotiation strikes a delicate balance between ensuring the Superior plaintiffs receive compensation without extensive delay and encouraging real restoration of the treaty relationship.\nAlthough I recognize that the augmentation promise does not expressly require the parties to negotiate and agree on an annuity increase, it is undeniable that negotiation and agreement outside the courts have better potential to renew the treaty relationship, advance reconciliation, and restore the honour of the Crown. After all, historic treaties represent the establishment of a relationship of trust and mutual assistance between Indigenous peoples and the Crown, but the details of that relationship must be the object of permanent negotiations, in view of fleshing out the general principles governing the relations between the two peoples (S. Grammond, Terms of Coexistence: Indigenous Peoples and Canadian Law (2013), at p. 286). \nBecause of the considerations discussed above, I would declare the following:\nUnder the Augmentation Clause of the Robinson Treaties, the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time, whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. \nIf the Crown can increase the annuities without incurring loss, it must exercise its discretion as to whether to increase the annuities and, if so, by how much. \nIn carrying out these duties and in exercising its discretion, the Crown must act in a manner consistent with the honour of the Crown, including the duty of diligent implementation. \nThe Crowns discretion must be exercised diligently, honourably, liberally, and justly. Its discretion is not unfettered and is subject to review by the courts.\nThe Crown dishonourably breached the Robinson Treaties by failing to diligently fulfill the Augmentation Clause. \nThe Crown is obliged to determine an amount of honourable compensation to the Superior plaintiffs for amounts owed under the annuities for the period between 1875 and the present.\nWith a view to respecting the nature of the treaty promise, repairing the treaty relationship, restoring the honour of the Crown, and advancing reconciliation, I would also direct the Crown to engage meaningfully and honourably with the Superior plaintiffs in an attempt to arrive at a just settlement regarding past breaches. If such a settlement cannot be mutually agreed upon, the Crown will be obliged, within six months of the release of these reasons, to exercise its discretion and determine an amount to compensate for past breaches. Given that the Superior plaintiffs have now been waiting almost a century and a half for their treaty entitlement, the amount to be paid would not be stayed pending any potential review by the courts, and should be paid to the Superior plaintiffs within a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for the necessary legislative approvals.\nTo allow for the parties to take steps aimed at reconciliation and repairing the treaty relationship, I would also order that the stay imposed in respect of the Stage Three proceedings continue for an additional six months from the release of these reasons. If the Superior plaintiffs desire additional time to arrive at an honourable settlement with the Crown, it would be open to them to seek a further extension of the stay in the trial court. Given the long history of this litigation and the Crowns dishonourable conduct, it will not be open to the Crown to seek such an extension if opposed by the Superior plaintiffs. If a further extension is granted, the Crown will have until the expiry of that extension to come to a negotiated agreement or to determine an amount of compensation.\nIf a negotiated settlement regarding the past is not reached, the Superior plaintiffs may seek review before the courts of both the process the Crown has undertaken and the substantive amount it has determined as compensation. If Stage Three proceeds, it must of course be modified in accordance with these reasons. \nIf the Crown has exercised its discretion liberally, justly, and honourably in determining compensation in respect of the past breaches, then the courts should not intervene. A reviewing court should allow the Crown, as decision-maker, a degree of deference in relation to its exercise of discretion (see Sharpe, at p. 221-22). In assessing the Crowns determination, the court must consider the Crowns submissions on how it reached its determination, and why, bearing in mind the Crowns expertise in making complex polycentric decisions and recognizing that the exercise of discretion may permit a range of honourable results. The court should focus on the justification of the Crowns determination, having regard to the honour of the Crown. \nAlthough this is by no means an exhaustive list, the court should consider the following factors when reviewing the amount that the Crown sets: (a) the nature and severity of the Crowns past breaches, including the Crowns neglect of its duties for close to a century and a half; (b) the number of Superior Anishinaabe and their needs; (c) the benefits the Crown has received from the ceded territories and its expenses over time; (d) the wider needs of other Indigenous populations and the non-Indigenous populations of Ontario and Canada; and (e) principles and requirements flowing from the honour of the Crown, including its duty to diligently implement its sacred promise under the treaty to share in the wealth of the land if it proved profitable.\nGiven these directions, it should be apparent that Stage Three will not begin as an open-ended judicial assessment or quantification of damages for past breaches. Rather, Stage Three, if required, will begin as a review of the process in which the Crown has engaged and the substantive amount the Crown has determined as compensation to the Superior plaintiffs. However, if the court finds that the Crowns process or determination was not honourable, it may consider the appropriate remedy, including whether to remand the issue to the Crown for redetermination or set the amount to be paid by the Crown, lest the Crown continue to undermine the very object and purpose of the treaty promise. Although Stage Three has proceeded on the basis of an incorrect interpretation of the Robinson Treaties, it would be open to the parties to rely on some of the evidence already adduced before the trial judge to inform the courts review of the Crowns exercise of discretion. \nDisposition\nI would allow Ontarios appeals in part, dismiss the Huron and Superior plaintiffs cross-appeals, grant a declaration as set out in para. 304 of these reasons, and provide the directions set out in paras. 305-10. I would grant the Huron and Superior plaintiffs their costs of the appeals and cross-appeals on a solicitor-client basis.\nAppendix  Text of the Robinson Treaties\nAs reproduced in Canada, Indian Treaties and Surrenders: From 1680 to 1890  In Two Volumes (1891), vol.

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds the Honour of the Crown in Ontario (Attorney General) v. Restoule\n\nThis appeal concerns the interpretation of the Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior Treaties, specifically the Augmentation Clause, and the obligations of the Crown to the Anishinaabe people.\n\nThe Robinson-Huron and Robinson-Superior Treaties were signed in 1850 between the Anishinaabe people and the Crown, ceding large tracts of land in exchange for a perpetual annuity. The Augmentation Clause provides for the increase of the annuity if the ceded lands produce an amount that would allow the Crown to increase the annuity without incurring loss. The annuity was initially set at $600 for the Robinson-Huron Treaty and $500 for the Robinson-Superior Treaty. The treaties also provided for the creation of reserves for the Anishinaabe people and guaranteed their right to hunt and fish on the ceded land. The Anishinaabe people claimed that the Crown had breached its obligations under the treaties by failing to increase the annuity as required.\n\nThe case was heard in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, where the trial judge, Hennessy J., ruled that the Crown had a mandatory and reviewable obligation to increase the annuities under the treaties when the economic circumstances permitted. The trial judge also found that the Crown had breached its obligations under the treaties by failing to increase the annuity as required. The case was then appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which allowed the appeal in part and dismissed it in part. The Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge had erred in finding that the Crown had a sui generis fiduciary duty to administer the ceded land on behalf of the Anishinaabe people. However, the court also ruled that the Crown had a duty to diligently implement the augmentation clause and that the honour of the Crown required the Crown to increase the annuities beyond $4 per person. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, where the court ruled that the interpretation of historic treaties is reviewable for correctness. The court also found that the Crown had a duty to consider, from time to time, whether it could increase the annuities without incurring loss, and that the Crown's discretion in this regard was not unfettered.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada's decision in this case establishes the principle that the interpretation of historic treaties is reviewable for correctness, and that the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to diligently fulfill its treaty promises.\n\nWriting for the majority, Jamal J. held that the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time, whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can increase the annuities without incurring loss, it must exercise its discretion and decide whether to increase the annuities and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not unfettered; it is to be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the Crown. Although the Augmentation Clause is not in itself a promise to pay the Anishinaabe a certain sum of money, no party doubts that the Crown was able to increase the annuities beyond $4 per person without incurring loss, and that it should have exercised its discretion to do so. Thus, in the majority's view, the Crown must increase the annuity under the Robinson Treaties beyond $4 per person retrospectively, from 1875 to the present. It would be patently dishonourable not to do so. The majority also concluded that the plaintiffs' breach of treaty claims are not statute-barred by Ontario's limitations legislation. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of the Augmentation Clause, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to diligently fulfill this promise. The Crown's ongoing breach of its augmentation promise, in the circumstances, is also a breach of the treaties themselves.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court requires  the Crown to negotiate or, failing agreement, determine the compensation it  owes to First Nations for breaching its treaty promises.</strong>This judgment clarifies the rights  and obligations of the Crown and the Anishinaabe of Lake Huron and Lake  Superior under two historic treaties, and what the Crown must do to address its  breaches of those treaties. In 1850, the Anishinaabe of Lake  Huron and Lake Superior entered into treaties with the Crown, known as the  Robinson Treaties. Under the treaties, the Anishinaabe agreed to cede their  territories to the Crown and the Crown promised to provide in return an annuity  (a perpetual annual payment). The treaties provided for the increase of the  annuities over time under certain circumstances. This part of the treaty, known  as the \u201cAugmentation Clause\u201d, also provided that the amount \u201cpaid to each  individual\u201d each year would not exceed \u00a31 (equivalent to $4), but the Crown had the power to increase it to a higher amount chosen  in its discretion. The annuities  were increased to $4 to each individual in 1875, but have not increased since  then.The Anishinaabe of Lake Superior (\u201cSuperior  plaintiffs\u201d) filed a claim against the Crown in 2001 and the Anishinaabe of  Lake Huron filed their own claim in 2014 (\u201cHuron plaintiffs\u201d). Both plaintiffs alleged  the Crown had breached the Augmentation Clause and its fiduciary duty. Fiduciary  duty means that Canada is obliged to act in the best interest of Indigenous  Peoples. The plaintiffs asked the court to compensate them. The trial judge concluded that,  under the Augmentation Clause, the Crown must increase the annuities when the  economic circumstances warrant it, reflecting a \u201cfair share\u201d of the revenues  received by the Crown from the land. The trial judge said that the honour of  the Crown and a fiduciary duty required the Crown to diligently implement the  Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed from these decisions, arguing that  the trial judge was wrong in her interpretation of the Robinson Treaties. The Court of Appeal allowed Ontario\u2019s appeals in part. The Court of  Appeal agreed that the honour of the Crown applied to the case. A majority of the  Court of Appeal agreed that the Crown is required to increase the annuities  when the economic conditions warrant it, but did not agree that the treaties  promised a fair share of revenues. The Court of Appeal also agreed that the  Crown\u2019s power under the Augmentation Clause to decide whether to increase the  annuities is not unfettered. Unfettered means without any constraints. The  Court of Appeal also found that the Crown was not under a fiduciary duty in  relation to the Augmentation Clause. Ontario appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada on a number of issues, including the proper interpretation of the  Augmentation Clause, the nature and content of the Crown\u2019s obligation to give  effect to that clause, and the appropriate remedy for its breach. The Huron and  Superior plaintiffs cross\u2011appealed on the question of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duties. Before the Court, neither  Canada nor Ontario disputed that they are in longstanding breach of the annuity  promises.The Supreme Court has allowed  Ontario\u2019s appeals in part, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeals,  and issued a declaration about the rights and obligations under the  Augmentation Clause. <strong>An opportunity for negotiation and agreement outside the courtroom has  greater potential to renew the treaty relationship, advance reconciliation, and  restore the honour of the Crown.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Jamal held that  the interpretation of historic Crown-Indigenous treaties is reviewable for  correctness. This means that an appeal court can substitute its interpretation  for that of the lower court if deemed incorrect. Applying this standard of  review to this case, along with the relevant treaty interpretation principles,  Justice Jamal said that the Crown has a duty to consider, from time to time,  whether it can increase the annuities without incurring loss. If the Crown can  increase the annuities beyond $4 to each individual, it must exercise its discretion  and decide whether to do so and, if so, by how much. This discretion is not  unfettered; it must be exercised liberally, justly, and in accordance with the  honour of the Crown. The frequency with which the Crown must consider whether  it can increase the annuities must also be consistent with the honour of the  Crown. Justice Jamal added that, given the longstanding and  egregious nature of the Crown\u2019s breach of the Augmentation Clause, the Crown  must exercise its discretion and increase the annuities with respect to the  past. Having already reached a negotiated settlement concerning past breaches  with the Huron plaintiffs, the Crown is directed to engage in time-bound and  honourable negotiation with the Superior plaintiffs about compensation for past  breaches. Finally, although no specific fiduciary duties apply in respect of  the augmentation promise, the honour of the Crown requires the Crown to  diligently fulfill this promise. "

He was sentenced and served his time. After his release, P applied for a record suspension but his application was denied. At the time of his conviction, persons convicted of indictable offences could apply for a record suspension five years after their release. However, the transitional provisions of legislation enacted since then by Parliament retroactively rendered him permanently ineligible for a record suspension. The transitional provisions were declared unconstitutional by courts in other matters and Canada concedes that their retrospective application violates s. 11(h) and (i) of the Charter in a manner that cannot be justified by s. 1. P filed a notice of action seeking, inter alia, damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter against Canada for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the transitional provisions. In response to Ps action, Canada brought a motion on a question of law, asking two questions:\n1.\tCan the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a proposed Bill that was later enacted by Parliament, and subsequently declared invalid by a court pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\n2.\tCan the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into law, which legislation was later declared invalid by a court pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\n\tThe motion judge answered yes to both questions, finding that the government was entitled to only a limited immunity from Charter damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. The Court of Appeal dismissed Canadas appeal, agreeing with the motion judge that the government does not enjoy absolute immunity in exercising its legislative powers.\n\tHeld (Kasirer and Jamal JJ. dissenting in part and Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Martin, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ.: The questions should both be answered in the affirmative. The state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes Charter rights. Rather, as the Court held in Mackin v. New Brunswick (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 13, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 405, the state may be liable for Charter damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or was in bad faith or an abuse of power. An absolute immunity fails to properly reconcile the constitutional principles that protect legislative autonomy, such as parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary privilege, and the principles that require the government be held accountable for infringing Charter rights, such as constitutionality and the rule of law. Each of these principles constitutes an essential part of Canadas constitutional law and they must all be respected to achieve an appropriate separation of powers. By shielding the government from liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would subvert the principles that demand government accountability.\n\tSections 32(1) and 24 of the Charter, along with s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, entrench the courts role in holding the government to account for Charter violations. Pursuant to s. 32(1), the federal and provincial legislatures are subject to Charter scrutiny. A declaration of invalidity under s. 52(1), the first and most important remedy when dealing with unconstitutional legislation, allows courts to protect Charter rights while respecting the distinct role of the legislature in Canadas constitutional order. As for s. 24(1), it provides a personal remedy in the sense that it is specific to the violation of the applicants rights; it is a unique public law remedy against the state that should not be assimilated to the principles of private law remedies. An award of damages as a s. 24(1) remedy against the state for exceeding its legal powers has long been recognized as an important requirement of the rule of law. In Vancouver (City) v. Ward, 2010 SCC 27, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 28, the Court set out a four-step test for determining whether damages are an appropriate and just remedy: (1) whether a Charter right has been breached; (2) whether damages would fulfill one or more of the related functions of compensation, vindicating the right, or deterring future breaches; (3) whether the state has demonstrated that countervailing factors defeat the functional considerations that support a damage award and render damages inappropriate or unjust; and (4) the appropriate quantum of damages.\n\tWhile there is a general presumption against combining remedies under ss. 24(1) and 52(1), there is no categorical restriction. The existence of an alternative remedy is a countervailing consideration under the Ward test; however, provided an award of Charter damages is not duplicative, the potential to combine declarations and damages must remain available in situations where a declaration would fail to satisfy the functional need for compensation, vindication or to meaningfully deter future breaches. While good governance concerns may defeat an award of damages, the mere suggestion that damages will have a chilling effect on government is not sufficient to defeat an applicants functional entitlement to Charter damages established at steps one and two of the Ward test. Damages may promote good governance by encouraging constitutional compliance and deterring Charter breaches. Limited immunity for the state for the enactment of legislation subsequently declared unconstitutional is consistent with and best reconciles the constitutional principles underpinning both legislative autonomy and accountability: parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers, parliamentary privilege, the broad and purposive approach to rights and remedial provisions in the Charter, and constitutionalism and the rule of law.\n\tFirst, the principle of parliamentary sovereignty must not be confused with parliamentary supremacy. Parliamentary sovereignty does not mean that Parliament is above the Constitution; rather, Parliament remains subject to the constraints and accountability mechanisms of the Constitution, including the Charter. The supremacy of the Constitution in relation to Parliament is well recognized in each application of s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Limited immunity does not impair Parliaments power to make and repeal laws within the confines of the Constitution.\n\tSecond, limited immunity is consistent with the separation of powers. The separation of powers does not mean that each branch works in isolation. The Court has never adopted a watertight system of separation but rather has always emphasized that each branch cannot exercise undue interference, which depends entirely on the circumstances and the constitutional principles engaged. Holding the legislature liable for Charter damages when it seriously misuses its legislative power does not constitute undue judicial interference in the legislative process. Rather, damages are an after-the-fact remedy for a Charter violation. However, respect for the legislative role requires a high threshold for liability for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation.\n\tThird, courts can respect parliamentary privilege when applying the limited immunity threshold. Parliamentary privilege provides the legislature with the tools to execute its core functions. It operates by shielding some areas of legislative activity from external review: for example, parliamentary privilege gives members of the legislature the freedom of speech necessary to carry out their law-making power without fear of liability, and protects against the compellability of certain types of evidence, such as the testimony of sitting members of Parliament. The protection of these processes is fundamental to Canadas constitutional structure and the functioning of its democracy. Parliamentary privilege cannot be subordinated or diminished by other parts of the Constitution. But Charter damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation are not claimed against any individual members involved in the legislative process. The action is directly against the state. The basis for the states liability for damages under s. 24(1) is the breach of the claimants Charter right. The states conduct within the legislative process is not an independent basis for liability but rather informs whether damages are an appropriate and just remedy for the breach caused by the enactment of the Charter-infringing law. The states liability for unconstitutional legislation does not engage members personal immunity for parliamentary speech. Nor does it interfere with Parliaments power to control its own debates and proceedings, or dictate how the legislative function is exercised. Parliamentary privilege must not be extended beyond the scope necessary to protect the legislatures core democratic functions. However, parliamentary privilege may prevent claimants from adducing certain types of evidence relating to the legislative process and hence limit a claimants practical ability to satisfy the threshold in a given case. But this possibility does not foreclose the availability of such a cause of action in principle.\n\tFourth, an absolute immunity does not accommodate the principles recognized in the jurisprudence on constitutional remedies. It leaves little room for the principles that underpin legislative accountability  including the broad and purposive approach to rights and remedial provisions in the Charter, as well as constitutionalism and the rule of law. An absolute immunity would protect the government from any claim for damages for any unconstitutional legislation, no matter how egregious, and allow a narrow set of constitutional interests to dominate the analysis.\n\tA high bar for immunity, set by the Court in Mackin, has been good law for over two decades. It has resulted neither in chilling good governance, nor in a floodgate of claims against the state for damages. Although the Court may depart from precedent where there is a compelling reason to do so, there are no compelling reasons to overrule Mackin. The Mackin qualified immunity threshold is assessed at step three of the Ward framework and can be restated as follows: the good governance defence will prevail unless the law was clearly unconstitutional, in bad faith or an abuse of power. If the threshold is not met, the balance of constitutional principles tilts in favour of state immunity. In such cases, the constitutional imperative that the government be afforded the autonomy to govern effectively will defeat the claim to damages.\n\tPer Kasirer and Jamal JJ. (dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part and the first question answered in the negative. The Crown enjoys an absolute immunity from damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter when preparing and drafting primary legislation later found to be unconstitutional. Such conduct is protected from judicial interference by established categories of parliamentary privilege, namely freedom of speech and control over parliamentary proceedings. The courts have no jurisdiction to review or assign liability for the exercise of these established categories of parliamentary privilege. The second question should be answered in the affirmative, but in a qualified manner: damages may only be available under s. 24(1) for harms flowing from clearly unconstitutional enactments. Mackin should be clarified to eliminate bad faith and abuse of power in enacting primary legislation as grounds for damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter, as they inevitably trench on established categories of parliamentary privilege. They would also strain the separation of powers by asking the courts to entertain non-justiciable questions. The Crown may, however, be liable in damages under s. 24(1) for harms flowing from clearly unconstitutional enactments. The clearly unconstitutional threshold is a nuanced standard that appropriately protects the autonomy of Parliament and the limited immunity necessary for legislators to carry out their work, while employing a purposive approach to s. 24(1) remedies to vindicate Charter rights.\n\tThe doctrine of parliamentary privilege refers to the sum of the privileges, powers, and immunities of the federal Houses of Parliament or provincial legislative assemblies, and of their individual members, that are necessary to their capacity to function as legislative bodies. Parliamentary privilege helps Canadas constitutional democracy maintain the fundamental separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, by shielding some areas of legislative activity from external review. Parliamentary privilege is part of the Constitution of Canada. Since one part of the Constitution cannot be abrogated or diminished by another part of the Constitution, actions or conduct protected by parliamentary privilege are not subject to the Charter. Once the existence of a category of parliamentary privilege is established, conduct or activities that are themselves an exercise of that privilege are not subject to review by the courts, even when such conduct or activities are alleged to violate the Charter. This means that such conduct or activities cannot be the basis of a Charter breach and cannot give rise to a Charter remedy such as damages under s. 24(1).\n\tIn the instant case, three uncontroversial points regarding the questions at issue guide the analysis. First, there is no debate that the questions, which inquire as to the Crowns liability in its executive capacity, refer to the liability of the Canadian government qua executive, to be distinguished from the legislature. Second, there is no debate that the Charter, including s. 24(1), applies to Parliament and the government of Canada, pursuant to s. 32(1)(a) of the Charter. Third, remedies under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 and s. 24(1) of the Charter can be combined. A remedy will be appropriate and just within the meaning of s. 24(1) when it furthers the general objectives of the Charter by compensating the plaintiff for any loss, vindicating rights, or deterring future breaches.\n\tBoth questions before the Court raise distinct parliamentary privilege considerations relating, in question 1, to the legislative process of preparing and drafting legislation, and in question 2, to the grounds on which legislation, once enacted, may be reviewed. Concerning the first question, the Crown cannot be liable for preparing and drafting legislation. Government officials and Ministers involved in preparing and drafting legislation enjoy the parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech for words or conduct connected to their legislative work. Whether the privilege applies is not determined by the nature of the relevant individual, but by the activities in which they are engaged and the necessity of those activities to core legislative functions. Robust legislative debate, which falls within the privilege over freedom of speech, is the lifeblood of Parliaments day-to-day business. Exposing the Crown, in its executive capacity, to liability in damages for the conduct of government officials and Ministers in preparing and drafting legislation would inevitably intrude upon this category of privilege.\n\tAs with the free speech privilege, exposing the Crown to liability for the words or conduct of government officials and Ministers in preparing and drafting legislation would unavoidably trench on the established privilege over the proceedings of Parliament. This privilege is broad: it includes everything said or done by a Member in the exercise of their functions as a Member in committees of either House, as well as everything said or done in either House in the transaction of parliamentary business. It also extends to matters taking place outside the houses of Parliament. The words and conduct of Members who are occupied in something closely and necessarily related to a proceeding in Parliament are accorded absolute privilege. It cannot reasonably be suggested that preparing and drafting legislation is not closely and necessarily related to proceedings in Parliament.\n\tParliamentary privilege is a threshold jurisdictional issue under the Ward framework regarding Charter damages under s. 24(1). If the existence of a recognized category of parliamentary privilege is proved, there can be no judicial review of the exercise of the privilege, even on Charter grounds. This conclusion is a direct consequence of the constitutional nature of parliamentary privilege and its status as a rule of curial jurisdiction. The privilege cannot be the subject of a judicial balancing as to whether countervailing good governance concerns at step three of Ward defeat the functional considerations that support a damages award and render damages inappropriate or unjust. Instead, the existence of the privilege means that the courts lack jurisdiction to undertake any further inquiry. In addition, the Crown in its executive capacity cannot be held liable for the work of Ministers and other government officials in preparing and drafting legislation because, in doing so, they act in a legislative rather than an executive capacity. Such conduct is not Crown conduct that can be attributed to the executive for which the Crown can be liable in an action brought under s. 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act.\n\tWith respect to the second question, if it is interpreted as relating to whether an enactment that violates the Charter can ever give rise to Charter damages under s. 24(1) after a bill has become law and the legislative process is complete, the answer is a qualified yes. The limited immunity rule in Mackin should be modified to clarify that the Crown can be liable in damages for the breach of Charter rights caused by legislation only when the legislation is shown to have been clearly unconstitutional at the time it was enacted. There are compelling reasons to revisit Mackin. None of the authorities cited in Mackin support awarding Charter damages against the Crown for harms caused by unconstitutional primary legislation. The test enunciated in Mackin also conflicts with the doctrine of parliamentary privilege, as well as the separation of powers and principles of justiciability. None of these points was argued in Mackin, and the Court did not consider them in its reasons.\n\tThe bad faith and abuse of power thresholds in Mackin are inappropriate thresholds in respect of damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for unconstitutional primary legislation because they conflict with the doctrine of parliamentary privilege and principles of justiciability, and strain the separation of powers. The doctrine of parliamentary privilege prevents courts from passing judgment on the process of enacting legislation. Scrutinizing legislation for evidence of bad faith or abuse of power, even once the law has already been enacted, would inevitably pull courts into judging the legislative process, which is beyond their jurisdiction. The courts cannot put Parliament on trial.\n\tIn addition, inquiring into whether primary legislation was in bad faith and an abuse of power as standards for awarding Charter damages would threaten the separation of powers by requiring the courts to consider questions that are not justiciable. Justiciability refers to a set of judge-made rules, norms, and principles delineating the scope of judicial intervention in social, political, and economic life. A court may decline to answer a question on the ground of justiciability when doing so would take it beyond its proper constitutional role, or if the court cannot provide an answer within its area of expertise. Once legislation has been found to be unconstitutional, there is no legal yardstick to measure whether the legislation was in bad faith or involved an abuse of power. Asking whether the legislation is in bad faith or constitutes an abuse of power requires the court to pass judgment on the content of the legislation on grounds other than its constitutionality, which strays into evaluating the wisdom or policy of the law and is not the proper role of the courts. The appropriate use of Hansard as proof of historical context or purpose in statutory interpretation must be distinguished from its inappropriate use to prove that legislation is in bad faith. The former does not impugn the freedom of speech or the integrity of parliamentary proceedings; the latter does.\n\tIn the context of legislative enactments, absolute immunity overshoots what is required to protect parliamentary privilege and the separation of powers. These constitutional imperatives can be respected by a test that focuses on whether the enactment itself clearly violated established constitutional norms at the time it was enacted. A qualified or limited immunity preserves the courts power under s. 24(1) to craft remedies that meaningfully vindicate Charter rights, while ensuring that effective government is not jeopardized by overbroad state liability that trenches on parliamentary privilege. To overcome the good governance concerns at step three of the Ward framework, a claimant must show that the legislation was clearly unconstitutional in the sense that the unconstitutionality was readily or obviously demonstrable at the time the legislation was enacted and could not be subject to any serious debate. Such a standard focuses on legislative outputs rather than legislative inputs, and on how the impugned legislation must be significantly wide of the constitutional mark before damages will be an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter. The clearly unconstitutional standard allows courts to consider whether legislation has an unconstitutional purpose as a factor in a damages assessment, and it is an appropriately high but not insurmountable bar for claimants to meet. If an enactment was clearly unconstitutional at the time of enactment, this should be readily or obviously demonstrable.\n\tPer Cote and Rowe JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and both questions answered in the negative. The preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation necessarily implicates parliamentary privilege, which is fundamentally at odds with awarding damages against the Crown in the manner sought. Both parliamentary privilege and the Charter constitute components of the Constitution of Canada. Neither one subordinates the other. The Charter must, as a matter of constitutional law, be given effect in a manner that is compatible with parliamentary privilege. Parliamentary privilege is rooted in the earliest chapters of Canadas constitutional history, and reflects an inherited legacy of struggle between the Crown and Parliament in the United Kingdom, one that reaches back to Parliaments origins. The Court has a responsibility to preserve the inheritance of Canadas constitutional order. It should not be discarded, and parliamentary privilege should not be subordinated to s. 24(1) of the Charter. To do so would be to depart from precedent and to do so unwisely.\n\tCanadas constitutional arrangements (aside from Aboriginal and treaty rights) consist of four written and unwritten components: the Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982, constitutional conventions, Crown prerogative and parliamentary privilege. The unwritten components, including parliamentary privilege, fulfill a necessary role in Canadas constitutional order  they are no less part of the Constitution than are the two Constitution Acts. In addition, there are underlying (unwritten) principles that contribute to giving effect to Canadas constitutional arrangements. These principles are not themselves components of the Constitution; rather, they assist in interpreting the Constitution and arriving at answers to questions not otherwise provided for in the Constitution. They do not have a substantive policy content and cannot be the basis to challenge the validity of legislation. Norms expressed in the underlying/unwritten principles of constitutionalism and the rule of law do not constitute a basis to override parliamentary privilege, any more than they can constitute a basis to invalidate legislation. Parliamentary sovereignty and the separation of powers (plus constitutionalism and the rule of law) are underlying/unwritten principles that inform interpretation of the constituent components of the Constitution, but parliamentary privilege is different in that it is itself part of the Constitution. This distinction is fundamental.\n\tThe Constitution Act, 1867 established that parliamentary privilege, which was essential to the operation of the largely unwritten constitution of the United Kingdom, would also be part of Canadas Constitution; the preamble states that Canada will have a Constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom. Parliamentary privilege was also specifically dealt with in s. 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which provides that the privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons, and by the members thereof respectively, shall be such as are from time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada. Thus, parliamentary privilege was from the outset a component of Canadas Constitution and continues to be so today. Unwritten components of the Constitution  including parliamentary privilege  have continued to be given faithful effect because they continue to play a crucial role in Canadas constitutional order.\n\tChief among the functions of parliamentary privilege is that it ensures that Parliament and provincial legislatures are able to carry out their work effectively. The purpose of privilege is to recognize Parliaments exclusive jurisdiction to deal with complaints within its privileged sphere of activity. A two-step process applies when courts are confronted with a privilege claim. First, the court must assess whether the existence and scope of the claimed privilege have been authoritatively established. If so, then the courts inquiry stops. The second step, which is not relevant in the instant case given the established nature of the privileges in question, requires the court to assess the necessity of the privilege asserted.\n\tParliamentary privilege ensures that the legislature is safeguarded from interference by the other two branches of the state, the executive and the judiciary. Intervention by the executive or by the courts in the working of legislatures would inevitably create delays, disruption, uncertainties and costs which would hold up the nations business and on that account would be unacceptable.\n\tParliamentary privilege also structures the dialogue between the courts and the legislature. By delineating the scope of what is open to review, this privilege ensures that legislatures are able to respond to decisions in which courts give meaning to the Constitution, and where necessary, invalidate legislation. The dialogical nature of constitutional development in Canada is reflected in the second look cases in which the Court has wrestled with what weight to afford Parliaments attempt to reformulate legislation in response to a decision under s. 52(1). Consistent in these cases is the principle that Parliament should not be discouraged from trying again to reformulate legislation so that it is consistent with the Charter.\n\tRespect for the separation of powers  which has been repeatedly affirmed as a constitutional principle  precludes judicial scrutiny of the legislative process. Subordinating parliamentary privilege in order to impose s. 24(1) damages for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation risks drawing the courts into a supervisory role over the legislative process.\n\tIn the instant case, the privileges invoked are the Houses exclusive control over its proceedings, and the privilege related to freedom of speech. They are both well established, and are rooted in art. 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1689, which established that the freedom of speech and debates, or proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. It has long been accepted that these privileges must be held absolutely and constitutionally if they are to be effective; the legislative branch of government must enjoy a certain autonomy which even the Crown and the courts cannot touch. Judicial consideration of these privileges shows that the broad shelter afforded by the operation of parliamentary privilege is agnostic towards the content of what is protected. It matters not what was said or what the impugned conduct involved  what matters is whether the conduct in question relates to the assemblys ability to fulfill its constitutional functions.\n\tParliamentary privilege attaches to the entire process through which legislation is developed and adopted. It extends to the range of Parliamentary actors who are involved in the legislative process. When ministers develop legislation, they act in a parliamentary capacity. Despite an inevitable overlap between executive and legislative functions inherent in their work in developing legislation, because they are engaged in the law-making process when they develop legislation, the process is generally protected from judicial oversight.\n\tWhile the existence and limits of parliamentary privilege are justiciable, their operation is not. Once a court finds that a privilege exists and describes its extent, the courts role ends. It is for the legislature itself to determine whether the exercise of the privilege was proper; such matters are not reviewable by the courts. The wide berth given to parliamentary privilege has been reflected in the manner in which the Court has approached apparent conflicts between parliamentary privilege and other components of the Constitution. The solution, when a conflict emerges between parliamentary privilege and another component of the Constitution, is not to read down the protections afforded by parliamentary privilege  the solution is to read the relevant constitutional components in a compatible way. It is not open to the courts to intrude upon the bona fides of parliamentary debates and proceedings. The courts have long recognized the defining significance of Parliaments work and the need for parliamentarians to debate and develop legislation freely. Parliamentary privileges are vital to the separation of powers as they enable parliamentarians  both individually and collectively  to freely express themselves and to act on matters of importance to Canadians, including controversial public policy issues, without fear of interference from the Crown or the courts.\n\tThe Charter did not negate the fundamental constitutional tenets upon which British parliamentary democracy rested or mark a clean break with existing constitutional structures that came before the passage of the Constitution Act, 1982. Instead, the passage of the Charter must be understood within the broader context of Canadas constitutional development. Many consider the Charter to be the paramount constitutional instrument. This is incorrect. All parts of the Constitution must be read together, and no one can be subordinated to the others. That said, the Charter was accompanied by a revolutionary transformation of sorts, in the nature and extent of demands by litigants for courts to use their authority to advance goals that those litigants had not achieved through the electoral process. But it is not for the courts to pass upon the policy or wisdom of legislative will or question the wisdom of enactments which are within the competence of the Legislatures. Temperance and moderation in the face of such invitations remain fundamental to the appreciation by the judiciary of its own position in the constitutional scheme.\n\tThe theory of liability endorsed by the courts below in the instant case  elides the distinction between the Crown in its executive and legislative capacities. Canadas Constitution incorporates the Westminster system of government, which was varied for a federal structure rather than a unitary state. Subsequent developments in the Constitution have built on this. In the contemporary constitutional order, the Crown acts in multiple distinct capacities, federal and provincial, as well as executive and legislative. The Crown in its executive capacity and the Crown in its legislative capacity are distinct. The Crown in its executive capacity consists of the King (through the Governor General) exercising the executive government and authority of and over Canada, as continued in the Constitution Act, 1867, s. 9. Those executive powers are, by constitutional convention, exercised by the Prime Minister, Cabinet, and public authorities in furtherance of statutory delegation of authority. The Crown-in-Parliament consists of the monarch (Governor General) acting in their legislative capacity. The Crown-in-Parliament embraces three determinative acts that are part of Parliaments core functions as a legislative body: royal recommendation, royal consent and royal assent.\n\tThe Crown, thus, is at the heart of both the executive and legislative branches of government, but plays different roles in each. While Canadas constitutional order envisages some overlap as to the Crown in its various capacities, the law does not recognize executive control of the legislative branch. This is consistent with the scope of parliamentary privilege and its application across the various steps in the legislative process. The preparation of legislation is a complex process involving multiple actors across government. The courts are ill-equipped to deal with the procedural complexities of the legislative process. The distinctive roles played by the Crown reflects the separation of powers between the different branches of government, and the balance between them. This is part of the explanation as to why absolute immunity is needed for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation, but not for determination of the validity of legislation once it is enacted or the legality of acts taken pursuant to the legislation.\n\tMackin does not resolve the question as to how parliamentary privilege operates where someone seeks s. 24(1) damages for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. The Court in Mackin did not turn its attention to this question nor has Mackin been applied in this way. The Court cannot rely on a passing reference in Mackin as the basis to depart from a substantial body of jurisprudence on parliamentary privilege and to abandon the fundamental principle that components of the Constitution do not negate one another. Mackin cannot be the basis for deciding that s. 24(1) damages can apply against the Crown in its executive capacity for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. Parliamentary privilege was never mentioned, much less discussed. To the extent, if any, that Mackins brief reference to damages for the mere enactment of a law represents a holding of the Court, it should be treated as weak precedent at most. Accordingly, the matter being considered in the instant case must be seen as novel for the Courts consideration.\n\tTo remain faithful to the Courts jurisprudence, the Courts role must be limited to establishing the existence of the privileges in question, rather than inquiring into their operation. Parliamentary privilege stands without exception. Moreover, the Crown in its executive capacity cannot be liable for the preparation, drafting, or enactment of legislation, as it is not part of the legislative process. Rather it is the Crown-in-Parliament which is so; legislation is approved by the Commons and the Senate, followed by royal assent. Seeking damages from the Crown in its executive capacity for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation is conceptually incoherent. The Attorney General of Canada is not the legal representative of Parliament and cannot represent Parliament in legal proceedings.\n\tAbsolute immunity is necessary. Parliamentary privilege is like an eggshell; one cannot break it just a little. In order for the Crown in its executive capacity to be held liable for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation, courts will need to inquire into the motivations and knowledge of those engaged in the legislative process. The inquiry into bad faith or abuse of power can manifest itself in any variety of ways, many that cannot now be contemplated. Legislatures will have to ask themselves whether a court, sitting in judgment of their actions with the benefit of hindsight, will deem theirs to be an improper purpose. Furthermore, a clearly unconstitutional standard will necessarily depend on the eye of the beholder, and what is known to the court sitting in judgment of the legislatures actions ex post facto.\n\tEnabling s. 24(1) damages would upset the dialogical balance between legislatures and the courts. Courts will be thrust into a position of overseeing the work of Parliament, and inquiring into the motives and knowledge of parliamentarians and others involved in the legislative process. Extending s. 24(1) damages to the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation would deprive Parliament of its ability to meaningfully respond to decisions in which the judiciary has determined the validity of laws or the legality of actions taken pursuant to those laws. Further, given the number of parliamentary actors and the vagaries of the legislative process, it is unclear whose alleged actions would be at issue in any claim seeking Charter damages for the drafting and enactment of any one statute. Absolute immunities are required for certain institutions to function. This is exemplified by the fact that the judiciary enjoys an absolute immunity in the exercise of its adjudicative function.\n\tRemedies under s. 24(1) are available following the enactment of legislation, in relation to executive action pursuant to legislation. P is not without recourse to a remedy, nor would others be. P could have applied for judicial review on Charter grounds of the decision to deny his application for a criminal record suspension. That remedy accords fully with Canadas constitutional arrangements and would in no way detract from parliamentary privilege.\nCases Cited\nBy Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis J.\n\tDiscussed: Mackin v.

However, other foundational constitutional principles require that the state be afforded the legislative autonomy to govern effectively. At the heart of this appeal is a question about how to reconcile these principles in the context of s. 24(1) of the Charter, which authorizes courts to grant such remedies to individuals for the infringement of their Charter rights as is considered appropriate and just in the circumstances. \nThe facts as pleaded indicate that the respondent Joseph Powers Charter rights were violated when Parliament enacted legislation that retrospectively changed the availability of criminal record suspensions for certain offenders. These changes made Mr. Power permanently ineligible for a record suspension. As a result, he was unable to maintain his employment. The appellant Attorney General of Canada concedes that the retrospective application of the legislation violates s. 11(h) and (i) of the Charter in a manner that cannot be justified by s. 1 (A.R., at pp. 89 and 91). Mr. Power brings a claim against Canada for damages under s. 24(1). He asserts that the invalid law infringed his Charter rights, and that damages are an appropriate and just remedy for this infringement. Canada seeks to strike the claim in a preliminary application.\nThis appeal raises the question of whether damages can ever be an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter in respect of the enactment of legislation later declared unconstitutional. Canada submits that it enjoys absolute immunity from s. 24(1) damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. It argues that the state cannot be held liable for anything done in the exercise of legislative power.\nWe disagree. The state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes Charter rights. Rather, as this Court held in Mackin v. New Brunswick (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 13, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 405, the state enjoys a limited immunity in the exercise of its law-making power. Accordingly, damages may be awarded under s. 24(1) for the enactment of legislation that breaches a Charter right. However, the defence of immunity will be available to the state unless it is established that the law was clearly unconstitutional, or that its enactment was in bad faith or an abuse of power. This is a high threshold. But it is not insurmountable.\nAn absolute immunity fails to properly reconcile the constitutional principles that protect legislative autonomy, such as parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary privilege, and the principles that require the government be held accountable for infringing Charter rights, such as constitutionality and the rule of law. Each of these principles constitutes an essential part of our constitutional law and they must all be respected to achieve an appropriate separation of powers. By shielding the government from liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would subvert the principles that demand government accountability. The necessary reconciliation of these principles demands that we affirm the limited immunity threshold recognized in Mackin.\nWe would dismiss the appeal.\nBackground\nMr. Power filed a notice of action at the Court of Queens Bench of New Brunswick in 2018. He alleges that the transitional provisions contained in the Limiting Pardons for Serious Crimes Act, S.C. 2010, c. 5, s. 10, and the Safe Streets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1, s. 161, are unconstitutional. He seeks a declaration of invalidity pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and he also seeks damages under s. 24(1) against Canada for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the transitional provisions. He claims that the amending legislation was enacted in bad faith, abusively, and with knowledge of its unconstitutionality.\nMr. Powers statement of claim alleges the following facts. \nIn 1996, he was convicted of two indictable offences. He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment. He served his time. After his release, he enrolled in college and graduated with an X-ray technician diploma. He became a medical radiation technologist in a hospital in New Brunswick.\nIn 2011, his employer received a tip that he had a criminal record and suspended him from his employment. He searched for a new job but found that his criminal record prevented him from working in his field.\nIn 2013, he applied for a record suspension. At the time of his conviction, persons convicted of indictable offences could apply for a record suspension five years after their release. However, the transitional provisions retroactively rendered him permanently ineligible for a record suspension. His application was denied. He has not since been able to find work in his profession in New Brunswick or Quebec. \nThe transitional provisions have since been declared unconstitutional by provincial and federal courts (Chu v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 BCSC 630, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 449; Charron v. The Queen, Ont. S.C.J., No. 16-67821, June 14, 2017; Rajab v. The Queen, Ont. S.C.J., No. 16-67822, June 14, 2017; P.H. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 393, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 461). These courts found that the transitional provisions unjustifiably violated s. 11(h) and (i) of the Charter because they retroactively increased an offenders punishment. \nIn response to Mr. Powers action, Canada brought a motion on a question of law to the Court of Queens Bench. Canada concedes that the transitional provisions are unconstitutional, but maintains that there can be no liability for damages under s. 24(1) based on the enactment of unconstitutional legislation (as distinct from its implementation or enforcement) that is later deemed to violate Charter rights.\nJudicial History\nCourt of Queens Bench of New Brunswick, 2021 NBQB 107 (Dysart J.) \nCanada asked the motion judge two questions:\nCan the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a proposed Bill that was later enacted by Parliament, and subsequently declared invalid by a court pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\nCan the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into law, which legislation was later declared invalid by a court pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\nThe motion judge recognized that these questions turned on the single issue of whether the state enjoys an absolute immunity in respect of the enactment of legislation. He found that the state did not. Accordingly, he answered yes to both questions. After reviewing this Courts jurisprudence, the motion judge found that the government was entitled to only a limited immunity from Charter damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. The motion judge found that this Court set a high threshold for such liability in Mackin, and that subsequent cases had not displaced this threshold.\nCourt of Appeal of New Brunswick, 2022 NBCA 14, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 68 (Richard C.J. and LaVigne and LeBlond JJ.A.)\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed Canadas appeal, agreeing with the motion judge that Mackin held that the government does not enjoy absolute immunity in exercising its legislative powers. In addition, the court rejected Canadas argument that various constitutional principles require a finding of absolute immunity. It explained that the separation of powers, parliamentary sovereignty, and parliamentary privilege are consistent with the high threshold recognized in Mackin.\nIssue\nThis appeal raises a single issue: can damages ever be an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter for the enactment of legislation later declared unconstitutional? \nThe courts below and both of the parties before this Court framed the two motion questions as turning on this single issue. The parties have not asked us to consider the two questions under separate analyses. Nor have they submitted how we might address the questions differently. \nAs the motion judge recognized, the answer to the issue  [i]n effect, is there absolute state immunity with respect to the legislative function?  will determine the states liability under s. 24(1) with respect to the passage of legislation (para. 22 (CanLII)). In our view, the analysis of the single issue as framed above will answer both questions.  \nThat said, the range of state actors and conduct set out in the first question is much broader than the second. The first question refers to government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a proposed Bill that is later enacted and subsequently declared invalid by a court. But, as this Court has recognized, a Ministers legislative and executive powers can overlap and are sometimes difficult to disentangle in the law-making process (Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council), 2018 SCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765, at paras. 33 and 40). Moreover, government officials can include public servants  acting in their capacity as part of the executive  engaged in policy development and advice to Ministers and Cabinet on the preparation of legislation. Given the broad and ambiguous scope of conduct implicated by this question, the extent of the states immunity in preparing and drafting a proposed Bill should not be determined in the absence of any submissions on the point, especially where the question is one of absolute immunity.\nMr. Powers claim focuses squarely on Parliaments enactment of the unconstitutional legislation. There is no need in this case to define the exact limits as between the executive and parliamentary roles and conduct in the pre-enactment legislative process.\nThus, we approach the issue in this case as did the courts below and the parties in this Court. Both questions ask whether the state may be liable for Charter damages for the enactment of invalid legislation. Our answer that there is no absolute immunity applies to both question one and question two.\nAnalysis\nWe begin our analysis by briefly setting out the constitutional provisions and constitutional principles engaged by this appeal. We then turn to how this Court has dealt with these principles in the context of s. 24(1), most notably in Mackin. Next, we explain why the high threshold established in Mackin should not be overturned. We conclude by clarifying this threshold.\nConstitutional Provisions and Principles\nCanada and Mr. Power advance opposing views on how to interpret and apply s. 24(1) in the context of a claim for damages for unconstitutional legislation that violates a Charter right. Canada submits that important constitutional principles require an absolute immunity for such damages. Mr. Power submits that the government is only entitled to a limited immunity. \nCharter Interpretation\nWe start with the proper approach to Charter interpretation. \nThe Charter must be given a generous and expansive interpretation; not a narrow, technical or legalistic one (Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 156). Charter provisions must be interpreted in a broad and purposive manner and placed in their proper linguistic, philosophic, and historical contexts (Reference re Senate Reform, 2014 SCC 32, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 704, at para. 25).\nA purposive approach considers constitutional principles. Indeed, the Constitution must be interpreted with a view to discerning the structure of government that it seeks to implement. The assumptions that underlie the text and the manner in which the constitutional provisions are intended to interact with one another must inform our interpretation, understanding, and application of the text (Reference re Senate Reform, at para. 26). \nSection 32(1): Application of the Charter \nWith this approach in mind, we turn to the applicability of the Charter to the legislative branch of government. \nSection 32(1) of the Charter states that it applies to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament and to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\nClearly, the federal and provincial legislatures are subject to Charter scrutiny. As this Court has explained, the words of s. 32(1) express that the Charter is essentially an instrument for checking the powers of government over the individual (McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 261). The Charter is intended to constrain governmental action inconsistent with those rights and freedoms (Hunter, at p. 156). As explained further below, ss. 32(1) and 24 of the Charter, along with s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, entrench the courts role in holding the government to account for Charter violations (M. L. Pilkington, Damages as a Remedy for Infringement of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1984), 62 Can. Bar Rev. 517, at pp. 535 and 552-67).\nRemedies for Breaches of Charter Rights\nThe Charter guarantees the rights and freedoms of all Canadians and provides remedies for their breach. Granting remedies is the courts most meaningful function under the Charter (Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, at p. 196). \nIt is well accepted that the need for a purposive and generous approach to Charter interpretation holds equally true for Charter remedies as for Charter rights (Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 24). Courts have a duty to determine the appropriate constitutional remedy for a Charter violation and to ensure that the remedy is commensurate with the extent of the violation (Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203, at para. 46). This appeal is concerned with declarations of unconstitutionality under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 and damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter.\nSection 52(1) provides that the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect. \nA declaration of invalidity under s. 52(1) is the first and most important remedy when dealing with unconstitutional legislation (Vancouver (City) v. Ward, 2010 SCC 27, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 28, at para. 1). Section 52(1) establishes the supremacy of the Constitution and empowers courts to declare legislation of no force or effect in part or in full. This remedy allows courts to protect Charter rights while respecting the distinct role of the legislature in our constitutional order (Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at p. 715; Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 629, at paras. 84-99).\nSection 24(1) provides that anyone whose Charter rights or freedoms have been infringed or denied may apply for such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances. \nSection 24(1) provides a personal or individual remedy in the sense that it is specific to the violation of the applicants rights (R. v. Albashir, 2021 SCC 48, at para. 33; R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 61). It must be remembered, however, that it is a unique public law remedy against the state that should not be assimilated to the principles of private law remedies (Ward, at paras. 22 and 31; Ravndahl v. Saskatchewan, 2009 SCC 7, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 181, at paras. 26-27).\nLike other Charter provisions, s. 24(1) must be interpreted generously and purposively (Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 24). It must be construed in a manner that best ensures the attainment of its objects and, more generally, benefits from the principle of statutory interpretation that remedial statutes should receive a large and liberal interpretation (R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc., 2001 SCC 81, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575 (Dunedin), at para. 18). \nThe remedial discretion afforded to courts under s. 24(1) is broad. This Court has stated that the language of this provision appears to confer the widest possible discretion on a court to craft remedies for violations of Charter rights (Dunedin, at para. 18), and that it is difficult to imagine language which could give the court a wider and less fettered discretion (Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at p. 965). \nThe broad discretion afforded under s. 24(1) and a purposive approach to remedies combine to give meaning to the idea that Charter rights are only as meaningful as the remedies provided for their breach. In this way, s. 24(1) is a cornerstone upon which the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter are founded, and a critical means by which they are realized and preserved (Dunedin, at para. 20). \nIn Doucet-Boudreau, the Court noted that s. 24 must be allowed to evolve to meet the different contexts in which Charter violations occur, and must remain flexible and responsive to the needs of a given case (para. 59). In general terms, the Court explained that a just and appropriate remedy under s. 24(1) will: (1) meaningfully vindicate the claimants rights and freedoms; (2) employ means that are legitimate within the framework of our constitutional democracy; (3) be a judicial remedy which vindicates the right while invoking the function and powers of a court; and (4) be fair to the party against whom the order is made (paras. 55-58). \nDamages as a Section 24(1) Remedy \nAn award of damages against the state for exceeding its legal powers has long been recognized as an important requirement of the rule of law (K. Roach, Constitutional Remedies in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at  11:1, citing Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121; see also W. H. Charles, Understanding Charter Damages: The Judicial Evolution of a Charter Remedy (2016)). \nIn Ward, this Court set out a four-step test for determining whether damages are an appropriate and just remedy:\nHas a Charter right been breached? \nWould damages fulfill one or more of the related functions of compensation, vindicating the right, or deterring future breaches?\nHas the state demonstrated that countervailing factors defeat the functional considerations that support a damage award and render damages inappropriate or unjust? \nWhat is the appropriate quantum of damages? \nCanadas argument for absolute immunity to a claim for damages rests on two propositions that implicate the countervailing factors considered at the third step.\nFirst, Canada relies on the availability of an alternative remedy. Canada asserts that the availability of a declaration of invalidity under s. 52(1) will always render damages inappropriate and unjust. Canada asserts that damages will never be appropriate for the enactment of legislation subsequently declared unconstitutional because the declaration of unconstitutionality will always be sufficient. Canada submits that judicial review of a decision under the invalid law may also be appropriate in certain cases. \nWhile there is a general presumption against combining remedies under ss. 24(1) and 52(1) (Schachter, at p. 720; Mackin, at paras. 78-81), there is no categorical restriction. This Court has instead adopted a functional and flexible approach to combining remedies that is driven by principled and purposive considerations (Ferguson, at para. 53; G, at para. 147; Roach, Constitutional Remedies, at  3:8-3:18). It is true that the existence of an alternative remedy is a countervailing consideration (Ward, at para. 33). However, the concern with alternative remedies is to avoid duplication and double recovery (para. 35; Brazeau v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 ONCA 184, 149 O.R. (3d) 705, at para. 43). Provided an award of Charter damages is not duplicative, the potential to combine declarations and damages must remain available in situations where a declaration would fail to satisfy the functional need for compensation, vindication or to meaningfully deter future breaches (Albashir, at paras. 61-67; Ward, at para. 56; see also P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  40:13). In some cases, a declaration of invalidity alone may be an insufficient and even hollow remedy. The availability of a declaration under s. 52(1) cannot absolutely displace a claim for damages under s. 24(1). The same is true for the availability of judicial review for a decision under the invalid law. \nThe second countervailing consideration that Canada raises in support of absolute immunity are concerns for good governance. Canada submits that Charter damages would interfere with Parliaments law-making functions, impeding the states ability to govern effectively. While this Court has held that good governance concerns may defeat an award of damages, we have also cautioned that the mere suggestion that damages will have a chilling effect on government is not sufficient to defeat the applicants functional entitlement to Charter damages established at steps one and two of the four-step test (Ward, at para. 38). Indeed, damages may promote good governance by encouraging constitutional compliance and deterring Charter breaches. Canada nonetheless submits that constitutional principles  that ground those good governance concerns  require that there be an absolute bar to Charter damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation.\nConstitutional Principles\nCanada argues that anything less than absolute immunity is inconsistent with three longstanding and foundational constitutional principles: parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers, and parliamentary privilege. Mr. Power responds that these principles do not necessitate absolute immunity and, moreover, that such immunity is inconsistent with other foundational constitutional principles, including constitutionalism and the rule of law. Each of these principles inform the separation of powers. We will briefly consider each in turn, before addressing the parties substantive submissions later in the analysis. \nParliamentary Sovereignty, Separation of Powers, and Parliamentary Privilege\nCanada rightly notes that parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers and parliamentary privilege are constitutional principles that ensure that democratically elected officials are free to make laws and to hold the executive to account, without undue interference from an unelected judiciary. The preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 states that Canada has a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom. Parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers and parliamentary privilege are core features of the British Constitution (R. (on the application of Miller) v. Prime Minister, [2019] UKSC 41, [2019] 4 All E.R. 299). As a result, these are also important constitutional principles in Canada.\nAs for parliamentary sovereignty, there are important differences between the United Kingdom and Canada. In the United Kingdom, the laws enacted by the Crown in Parliament are the supreme form of law (Miller, at para. 41; see also Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation, 2018 SCC 48, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 189, at paras. 54-55). In Canada, it is the Constitution that is the supreme law: the legislature can make or unmake any law it wishes, within the confines of its constitutional authority (Mikisew, at para. 36 (emphasis added)). In other words, in Canada the principle of parliamentary sovereignty must not be confused with parliamentary supremacy (Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 308-9).\nThe separation of powers is part of the foundational architecture of our constitutional order. It is a constitutional principle which recognizes that the three branches of government have different functions, institutional capacities and expertise; and that each must refrain from undue interference with the others (Fraser v. Public Service Staff Relations Board, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 455, at pp. 469-70; British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Provincial Court Judges Association of British Columbia, 2020 SCC 20, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 506, at paras. 65-66). The separation of powers allows each branch to fulfill its distinct but complementary institutional role without undue interference and to create a system of checks and balances within our constitutional democracy (Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 29). \nParliamentary privilege plays an essential role in our democratic and constitutional order by allowing legislative officials to carry out their function, including vigorously debating laws and holding the executive to account (Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Quebec, 2018 SCC 39, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687, at paras. 1 and 20-21; New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319, at p. 354). \nThis Court has characterized parliamentary privilege as the sum of the privileges, immunities and powers enjoyed by the Senate, the House of Commons and provincial legislative assemblies, and by each member individually, without which they could not discharge their functions (Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 667, at para. 29; see also J. P. J. Maingot, Parliamentary Privilege in Canada (2nd ed. 1997), at pp. 14-15). Courts cannot review conduct within an area of parliamentary privilege, even for compliance with the Charter (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 384). The sphere of activity for which privilege is claimed must therefore be closely scrutinized, and it will only receive protection if it is closely and directly connected with the fulfillment by the assembly or by its members of their functions as a legislative and deliberative body (Chagnon, at para. 27; Vaid, at para. 46).  \nConstitutionalism and the Rule of Law\nMr. Power submits that none of these principles are absolute and that none mandate absolute immunity. Rather, these principles must be reconciled with the role of courts as guardians of the Constitution, as reflected in the principles of the rule of law and constitutionality, both of which require courts to award meaningful and effective remedies for breaches of the Charter (Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at para. 72; Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 25). \nThe rule of law is a fundamental postulate of our constitutional structure (Roncarelli, at p. 142) and is clearly implicit in the very nature of a Constitution (Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 750). It protects individuals from arbitrary state action by providing that the law is supreme over the acts of both government and private persons (Reference re Secession of Quebec, at paras. 70-71). \nThe Constitution is the supreme law of Canada. The principle of constitutionalism finds clear expression in s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Thus, with the adoption of the Charter, the Canadian system of government was transformed to a significant extent from a system of Parliamentary supremacy to one of constitutional supremacy (Reference re Secession of Quebec, at para. 72; see also Newfoundland (Treasury Board) v. N.A.P.E., 2004 SCC 66, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 381, at paras. 105-6; C. Mathen and P. Macklem, eds., Canadian Constitutional Law (6th ed. 2022), at pp. 16-1 and 1275; L. E. Weinrib, Of diligence and dice: Reconstituting Canadas Constitution (1992), 42 U.T.L.J. 207; K. Roach, The Separation and Interconnection of Powers in Canada: The Role of Courts, the Executive and the Legislature in Crafting Constitutional Remedies (2018), 5 J.I.C.L. 315). \nThese principles lie at the root of our system of government (Reference re Secession of Quebec, at para. 70). Together, they explain the duty that courts have to act as vigilant guardians of constitutional rights and the rule of law (Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 110). Thus, courts play a fundamental role in holding the executive and legislative branches of government to account in Canadas constitutional order.\nWe agree with Mr. Power that these constitutional principles must be respected in determining the judicial reach of meaningful remedies for breaches of the Charter. Together, they inform the appropriate balance underlying the extent of immunity for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. \nThis Court Has Recognized a Limited Immunity for the Enactment of Unconstitutional Legislation \nWe now turn to how this Courts jurisprudence has addressed these constitutional principles in the context of state immunity for Charter damages. Mr. Power argues that Mackin directly dealt with the question in this appeal. He submits that Mackin rejected an absolute immunity and that we are bound to do the same here. Canada, however, argues that Mackin is not authoritative on this question and, in any case, subsequent cases have displaced the limited immunity established in Mackin.\nMackin Set a High Threshold for Damages\nWe agree with Mr. Power and the courts below that in Mackin, this Court considered precisely the same issue: the availability of Charter damages for the enactment of Charter-infringing unconstitutional legislation. \nThe applicants in Mackin were two provincial court judges. They challenged a provincial statute that eliminated the system of supernumerary judges in favour of a panel of retired judges paid on a per diem basis. They claimed that the statute violated the right to judicial independence enshrined in s. 11(d) of the Charter and sought s. 24(1) damages and s. 52(1) declaratory relief.\nThe Court agreed with the judges that the legislation was unconstitutional and declared it to be of no force or effect. Turning to the claim for damages, Gonthier J. explained that while legislative bodies enjoy immunity from damages for the mere enactment or application of a law that is subsequently declared to be unconstitutional (para. 78 (emphasis added)), such immunity will give way to liability when the law was clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power (para. 79 (emphasis added)). He concluded that damages were not justified in that case because there was no evidence to suggest that this threshold was satisfied (para. 82). \nIn our view, the following three points can be distilled from Mackin.\nFirst, Mackin concerned only the enactment of legislation. The states actions under the law was not at issue: it was the legislation itself that abolished the supernumerary judicial status, thereby depriving the judges of their status and income  and thus, their independence. Accordingly, we do not accept Canadas argument that Mackin never contemplated a claim for damages against the state for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. The Mackin principle of limited immunity was plainly set out in the context of the enactment of law, and as applying to legislative bodies (para. 78).\nSecond, the Court did not deny the judges claim because the state enjoyed an absolute immunity for the enactment of legislation, but because the threshold was not satisfied. Gonthier J. found that there was no evidence to suggest the government of New Brunswick acted in bad faith or abused its power. He explained that the government could not have known of later developments in the law concerning judicial independence at the time the statute was enacted. In reaching this conclusion, Gonthier J. looked to the states motives, knowledge and conduct during the legislative process. He found the state had a perfectly legitimate purpose when it passed the invalid law: efficiency, flexibility and cost savings (para. 70). He also found that there was no evidence the state acted with wilful blindness with respect to its constitutional obligations (para. 82), nor that the state enacted the law with knowledge of its unconstitutionality, nor for an ulterior motiv[e] (para. 83). \nThird, the threshold for liability established in Mackin was expressly designed to reconcile competing constitutional principles. Gonthier J. explained that the limited immunity given to government is specifically a means of creating a balance between the protection of constitutional rights and the need for effective government (para. 79). To award damages merely because legislation was unconstitutional would fail to strike the right balance because it would not give effect to the need for effective government. Yet, at the same time, he recognized that the government and its representatives are required to exercise their powers in good faith and to respect the established and indisputable laws that define the constitutional rights of individuals (ibid.). \nFor these reasons, Gonthier J. held that the clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power threshold provides the appropriate qualification on the states liability for the enactment of an unconstitutional law. \nThe Mackin Threshold Has Not Been Overruled by Subsequent Cases\nCanada further argues that if Mackin established a limited immunity, this Court has overruled that immunity in subsequent cases. \nWe do not agree. Rather, we agree with Mr. Power and the courts below that the post-Mackin jurisprudence does not depart from the limited immunity threshold.\nThe first category of cases said to have overruled Mackin are those Canada says demonstrate that the limited immunity threshold in Mackin has been restricted in application to situations of executive action, such that it no longer applies in the realm of legislative power. We reject this argument.\nTrue, some of this Courts cases have referred to the threshold applying to executive conduct under the law. For example, in Ward, McLachlin C.J. referred to Mackin as applying to state conduct under the law (para. 39). And in Henry v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 24, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 214, Moldaver J. referred to it as applying to state action taken pursuant to a law (para. 42). But those cases involved such executive conduct. There is no inconsistency here. As explained above, Gonthier J. said in Mackin that the threshold applied to the enactment or application of legislation later declared unconstitutional (para. 78 (emphasis added)). Indeed, the Mackin threshold was described in general terms in Ward as recognizing that the state must be afforded some immunity from liability in damages resulting from the conduct of certain functions that only the state can perform. Legislative and policy-making functions are one such area of state activity (para. 40 (emphasis added)). \nSimilarly, in Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia, 2020 SCC 13, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 678, this Court considered a different type of situation again: whether the Mackin threshold applied to government decisions made under government policies. Canada points out that at one point the Mackin threshold is described as applying to acts carried out pursuant to a law that is subsequently declared to be invalid (para. 168). But, at another point, the threshold is described as applying to those who make laws or the legislature (ibid.). Both are consistent with Mackin, and the Court was unanimous on this point. Although dissenting in the result, Brown and Rowe JJ. noted that a key holding in Mackin was its broad formulation of the immunity threshold and that it plainly encompasses acts of both the legislatures and other public officials (paras. 286-87 (emphasis deleted)).\nCanada also argues that the principles set down in Mikisew overrule Mackin. We do not agree. Canada is right that Mikisew says that courts should not meddle with the law-making process, including in the enactment of legislation. However, Mikisew is readily distinguishable. This appeal concerns remedies for an invalid law that breaches Charter rights. Mikisew concerned whether to impose a procedural step in the form of a duty to consult under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 within the legislative process (paras. 31 and 52). And, while the majority in Mikisew accepted that it is rarely appropriate for courts to scrutinize the law-making process (para. 2), and that the judiciary should forebear from intervening in this process (para. 32), it also noted that after-the-fact review remains available in some circumstances (para. 52). \nA Charter damages analysis under s. 24(1) is conceptually distinct from the recognition of a duty to consult. As the motion judge and the Court of Appeal in this case explained, there is an important difference between, on the one hand, courts requiring the legislature to implement a substantive step within the legislative process, such as the pre-enactment consultations contemplated in Mikisew, and on the other, courts enforcing the Charter by requiring the state to pay damages for a Charter violation, even when that violation results from an unconstitutional law (motion judges reasons, at paras. 54-55; C.A. reasons, at para. 23). Compelling the government to consult as part of the legislative process would be a clear interference with Parliaments exclusive control over its own procedures. By contrast, post-enactment damages do not unduly interfer[e] with Parliament, including its control over its own procedures (Mikisew, at para. 35, citing Criminal Lawyers Association, at para. 29). Such damages do not compel the legislature to regulate its own internal affairs in a certain way. Mikisew does not determine the outcome of this appeal.\nFinally, Canada raises Ernst v. Alberta Energy Regulator, 2017 SCC 1, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 3, as an example of the approach the Court should take in this case. In Ernst, this Court held that an administrative board, in exercising its adjudicative function, is immune from liability for damages. Ernst is of limited assistance to this appeal. Although Ernst engaged some of the same constitutional principles at work in this case, it did so in a different context. Ernst was concerned with protecting a different state function and implicated a different balance of underlying constitutional principles. An assessment into immunity must focus on the branches of government implicated by the claim (K. Cooper-Stephenson, Charter Damages Claims (1990), at p. 316). It is not surprising that a different form of state action raised different concerns about constitutional design and institutional relationships. Nothing in Ernst suggests a retreat from Mackin.\nAccordingly, we cannot accept Canadas submission that the Mackin threshold has been overruled. \nMackin Should Not Be Overruled\nCanadas final argument is that if this Court has not overruled Mackin already, it should do so now. Canada submits that the constitutional principles underpinning legislative autonomy and good governance require absolute immunity for the enactment of legislation subsequently declared unconstitutional. Mr. Power responds that an absolute immunity would be inconsistent with the other fundamental constitutional principles engaged by the states law-making function.\nWe agree with Mr. Power. Canada has not provided a compelling reason to overrule a precedent of this Court. Accordingly, we would not overturn Mackin. Limited immunity respects the constitutional principles underpinning both legislative autonomy and accountability. As this Court has said before, effective government and respect for constitutional rights are both important pillars of our democracy (Ernst, at para. 25). In order to fulfill its institutional function, the legislative branch requires an independent space for elected representatives to carry out their parliamentary duties, to freely debate and decide what laws should govern, and to exercise the unfettered ability to hold the executive branch of the state to account. But absolute immunity would subvert the principles that command government compliance with the Charter and the courts role in enforcing its fundamental guarantees.\nLimited Immunity Respects All of the Constitutional Principles\nAs McLachlin J., as she then was, explained in Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 876, [w]here apparent conflicts between different constitutional principles arise, the proper approach is not to resolve the conflict by subordinating one principle to the other, but rather to attempt to reconcile them (para. 69). And as Mr. Power notes, our Courts jurisprudence demonstrates that there is no one constitutional principle that dominates the remedial analysis (R.F., at para. 76, citing G, at paras. 89-99, R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19, at para. 60, and Albashir, at para. 34). \nOur constitutional jurisprudence has not created hierarchies of constitutional principles. It has aimed to provide flexibility and accommodation in the pursuit of good governance and fundamental rights. This is especially important in an era of increased transparency and accountability. Our constitutional remedies must reflect the interdependency of principles, and balance the need for both government autonomy and accountability. \nAs we will explain, the Mackin threshold is consistent with and best reconciles each of the constitutional principles engaged by this appeal. \nFirst, parliamentary sovereignty is not undermined by the Mackin threshold. As noted above, parliamentary sovereignty does not mean that Parliament is above the Constitution. Parliament remains subject to the constraints and accountability mechanisms of the Constitution, including the Charter. By the text of s. 32(1), the Charter specifically applies to Parliament and the provincial legislatures. The supremacy of the Constitution in relation to Parliament is well recognized in each application of s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Limited immunity does not impair Parliaments power to make and repeal laws within the confines of the Constitution. \nSecond, limited immunity is consistent with the separation of powers. The separation of powers does not mean that each branch is completely separate or works in isolation. The separation of powers in Canada is not strict (Reference re Secession of Quebec, at para. 15; Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, at para. 10). We have never adopted a watertight system of separation of judicial, legislative and executive functions (Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 107). Rather, our Court has always emphasized that each branch cannot exercise undue interference, which depends entirely on the circumstances and the constitutional principles engaged. The availability of an after-the-fact judicial remedy for unconstitutional legislation does not interfere with the law-making process. However, respect for the legislative role requires a high threshold for liability for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. The high bar for liability established in Mackin ensures that the judiciary does not unduly interfere with the governments ability to carry out its legislative function. Absolute immunity would give insufficient respect to the judicial role to provide meaningful remedies for the breach of constitutional rights.\nLike parliamentary privilege, discussed below, the separation of powers supports the need for some immunity, but not absolute immunity. Holding the legislature liable for Charter damages when it seriously misuses its legislative power does not constitute undue judicial interference in the legislative process. Rather, damages are an after-the-fact remedy for a Charter violation. Insofar as an award of damages provides any guidance to the legislature at all, it merely says that the government and its representatives are required to exercise their powers in good faith and to respect the established and indisputable laws that define the constitutional rights of individuals (Mackin, at para. 79). While the separation of powers demands a core of legislative autonomy, it also demands legislative accountability through the role of the courts.\nThird, courts can respect parliamentary privilege when applying the limited immunity threshold. Parliamentary privilege provides the legislature with the tools to execute its core functions. It operates by shielding some areas of legislative activity from external review (Chagnon, at para. 1). For example, it shields against legal proceedings for what was said during debate, giving members of the legislature the freedom of speech necessary to carry out their law-making power without fear of liability. Parliamentary privilege also protects against the compellability of certain types of evidence, discussed below, such as the testimony of sitting members of Parliament (Vaid, at para. 29). The protection of these processes is fundamental to Canadas constitutional structure and the functioning of our democracy. Parliamentary privilege cannot be subordinated or diminished by other parts of the Constitution.\nBut Charter damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation are not claimed against any individual members involved in the legislative process. The action is against the state. An action for public law damages is not a private law action in the nature of a tort claim for which the state is vicariously liable but [a distinct] public law action directly against the state for which the state is primarily liable (Ward, at para. 22, citing Dunlea v. Attorney-General, [2000] NZCA 84, [2000] 3 N.Z.L.R. 136, at para. 81; Henry (2015), at para. 34; see also Maharaj v. Attorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago (No. 2), [1979] A.C. 385 (P.C.), at p. 399). The nature of the remedy requires the state (or society writ large) to compensate an individual for breaches of the individuals constitutional rights (Ward, at para. 22). For these reasons, the Attorney General for the Crown or a government agency is the appropriate defendant in Charter damages claims (Roach, Constitutional Remedies, at  11:13).\nIt is also worth emphasizing that the basis for the states liability for damages under s. 24(1) is the breach of the claimants Charter right. The states conduct within the legislative process is not an independent basis for liability but rather informs whether damages are an appropriate and just remedy for the breach caused by the enactment of the Charter-infringing law. Mr. Powers action does not engage members personal immunity for parliamentary speech. Nor does it interfere with Parliaments power to control its own debates and proceedings, or dictate how the legislative function is exercised. Mr. Power does not suggest that parliamentary speech or anything done in the legislative process breached his Charter rights.\nWe reject Canadas suggestion that recognized categories of parliamentary privilege extend to bar external review of every stage in the law-making process, and of all speech and all conduct by government officials or Ministers related to the law-making process, including their unspoken motivations. Courts must be careful to avoid enlarging recognized categories of privilege in response to broad or vague assertions of privilege, especially in the context of an alleged Charter rights violation (see, e.g., M.-A. Roy, Le Parlement, les tribunaux et la Charte canadienne des droits et libertes: vers un modele de privilege parlementaire adapte au XXIe siecle (2014), 55 C. de D. 489, at pp. 512, 517 and 521). For example, we do not view parliamentary privilege over freedom of speech in Parliament or control over legislative proceedings as inherently extending to government officials, including public servants acting in an executive capacity, involved in policy development and advisory roles related to the preparation of legislation. The concern is not with the nature of the official, but with the breadth of state conduct implicated by this suggestion. Canadas broad conceptualization of parliamentary privilege is not known in Canadian law, and is not necessary to protect Parliaments constitutional role. Nor has Canada demonstrated that the scope of the privilege it invokes is inexorably supported under the strict necessity test. For this reason, we fundamentally disagree with the scope of parliamentary privilege asserted by our colleagues. \nThis Court has emphasized that parliamentary privilege must not be extended beyond the scope necessary to protect the legislatures core democratic functions (Chagnon, at para. 25; Vaid, at para. 41). In both Vaid and Chagnon, this Court rejected claims of parliamentary privilege, recognizing that the scope of each category of privilege must be carefully scrutinized, in part on the basis that the matters protected by the claimed privilege cannot be externally reviewed, including by courts on Charter grounds. In Vaid, this Court held that the parliamentary privilege to control parliamentary proceedings did not extend so far as to preclude a human rights claim on the basis of discrimination by the chauffeur to the Speaker of the House of Commons. In Chagnon, this Court held that the parliamentary privilege to either manage employees or to exclude strangers from the National Assembly does not prevent judicial review of the dismissal of security guards employed by the National Assembly. Because of its inherent nature, parliamentary privilege means that its existence and scope must be strictly anchored to its rationale, delimited by the purposes it serves. Such an approach helps to reconcile the privilege with the Charter, by ensuring that it is only as broad as is necessary for the proper function of a constitutional democracy. \nA limited immunity reconciles the importance of parliamentary privilege with the Charter by ensuring that the privilege is no broader than is justified for a functioning constitutional democracy. In this respect, we agree that parliamentary privilege, like parliamentary institutions themselves, must operate within  and never trump  the constitutional framework from which those bodies have emerged, and upon which they depend for their lawful authority and powers. In a country respectful of the rule of law, the courts must continue to maintain the supremacy of constitutional norms (W. J. Newman, Parliamentary Privilege, the Canadian Constitution and the Courts (2008), 39 Ottawa L. Rev. 573, at p. 609). \nWe also note that this Court has made clear that privilege claims should not be adjudicated at too high a level of generality (Vaid, at para. 51). As Mr. Power submits, [i]ssues regarding the admissibility of parliamentary statements cannot be decided in the abstract (R.F., heading of para. 94). An assertion of privilege must be particularized in the circumstances of the claim. \nTo be clear though, parliamentary privilege may prevent claimants from adducing certain types of evidence relating to the legislative process. In this way, parliamentary privilege may limit a claimants practical ability to satisfy the threshold in a given case. Indeed, it may well be that a claimant will not be able to lead any evidence. But this possibility does not foreclose the availability of such a cause of action in principle. While a claimant obviously cannot, for example, subpoena members of Parliament to establish a claim for damages, the claimant could lead other evidence related to the parliamentary process and relevant to the claim. There are many kinds of legislative documents routinely relied upon by courts in the context of public law litigation. For example, in Brazeau, Sharpe and Juriansz JJ.A. relied on government memoranda and reports, public records and social science and expert reports in assessing a s. 24(1) claim for damages (paras. 74-86). Thus, while it is beyond question that the conduct and speech protected by parliamentary privilege is not subject to review under the Charter by the judiciary (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 384), we do not agree that parliamentary privilege inherently precludes Charter damages for unconstitutional legislation. \nIt does not improperly undermine parliamentary privilege for the courts, engaged in a proper judicial task, to examine evidence and adjudicate an assertion of privilege in the context of a claim for damages. Courts regularly assess such evidence, including Hansard, in determining the background and purpose of legislation under a s. 1 analysis (see, e.g., R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295; R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 463, at p. 484; R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 31; R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at paras. 88-90). Indeed, this Court has in other contexts assessed whether the legislature acted in good faith in enacting a law (see, e.g., Libman v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 569, at para. 63; Ell v. Alberta, 2003 SCC 35, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 857, at paras. 3 and 38), or whether the state had actual or constructive knowledge of the unconstitutional effects of a law (Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 17, at para. 114). Granted, the purpose of the review may be different in a claim for Charter damages. But these examples reveal that the judicial assessment of the nature of legislation and Parliaments purpose or objective in enacting it can be accomplished without violating parliamentary privilege.\nFourth, an absolute immunity does not accommodate the principles recognized in this Courts jurisprudence on constitutional remedies. It leaves little room for the principles that underpin legislative accountability  including the broad and purposive approach to rights and remedial provisions in the Charter, as well as constitutionalism and the rule of law. All these principles militate against absolute immunity. We agree in this respect with Mr. Power, who submits that [a]n absolute immunity is . . . incompatible with the remedial discretion of the courts  a fundamental feature of the Charter  and with the idea that flexibility is necessary to arrive at appropriate remedies involving legislation (R.F., at para. 81, citing G, at paras. 101 and 146).\nAs discussed above, the Charter effected a revolutionary transformation of the Canadian polity under which courts were mandated to bring the entire legal system into conformity with a complex new structure of rights-protection (L. E. Weinrib, Canadas Charter of Rights: Paradigm Lost? (2002), 6 Rev. Const. Stud. 119, at p. 120). Even before the Charter, the courts role in holding the legislature accountable was recognized as part of the fabric of Canadas constitutional order. As Dickson J. (as he then was) explained in Amax Potash Ltd. v. Government of Saskatchewan, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 576, at p. 590: \n\tA state, it is said, is sovereign and it is not for the Courts to pass upon the policy or wisdom of legislative will. As a broad statement of principle that is undoubtedly correct, but the general principle must yield to the requisites of the constitution in a federal state. By it the bounds of sovereignty are defined and supremacy circumscribed. The Courts will not question the wisdom of enactments which, by the terms of the Canadian Constitution are within the competence of the Legislatures, but it is the high duty of this Court to insure that the Legislatures do not transgress the limits of their constitutional mandate and engage in the illegal exercise of power. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(See also Manitoba Language Rights, at p. 745.)\nThe Charter demands that legislative power be constrained by constitutional rights. Courts are constitutionally obliged to hold the government accountable when it breaches such rights, including by providing meaningful remedies in the face of their violation. An absolute immunity would undermine the purpose and text of s. 24(1), which asks courts to look at the specific context of a given violation to determine whether a remedy is appropriate and just. The Charter requires courts to enforce constitutional rights. Enforcement means ensuring that remedies are commensurate with the extent of the violation (Corbiere, at para. 46). In this way, the separation of powers also protects the judiciarys independence to carry out its constitutional duties: Nothing less [is] required to maintain the normative ordering of the Canadian legal system (Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 109).\nAn absolute immunity would protect the government from any claim for damages for any unconstitutional legislation, no matter how egregious. We accept Mr. Powers assertion that an absolute immunity allows a narrow set of constitutional interests to dominate the analysis (R.F., at para. 81).\nIn setting a high bar for immunity, Mackin has stood the test of time. It has been good law for over two decades. It has resulted neither in chilling good governance, nor in a floodgate of claims against the state for damages. The state will continue to benefit from immunity unless the high threshold is satisfied. This exacting threshold functions to limit the scope of causes of action for damages. And, as always, the state can apply for a s. 24(1) claim to be dismissed summarily if the claimant fails to plead circumstances which could, if accepted, satisfy the Mackin threshold for liability (Henry (2015), at para. 43). \nThis Court may depart from precedent where there is a compelling reason to do so, including if the precedent was inconsistent with a binding authority or statute, it has proven unworkable, or its rationale has been eroded by significant social or legal change (R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 44; R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 202). There are no compelling reasons to overrule Mackin. The states immunity has been and remains qualified.\nClarifying the Mackin Threshold\nThe question remains how to best articulate the qualified immunity threshold. The parties and interveners point to a number of different descriptions within Mackin and ask us to clarify the threshold. \nIn Mackin, Gonthier J. used several formulations to describe the circumstances in which damages may be an appropriate and just remedy for legislation later declared unconstitutional. Gonthier J. initially sets out the threshold as capturing state conduct that was clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power (paras. 78-79). Later, in applying the threshold, he looked to whether the state enacted the unconstitutional law negligently, or with wilful blindness with respect to its constitutional obligations at that time (para. 82). He concluded there was no evidence the legislation was enacted wrongly, for ulterior motives or with knowledge of its unconstitutionality (para. 83). \nThese different formulations reflect different lines of inquiry aimed at assessing the context of the enactment of the Charter-infringing law in that case. Gonthier J. focused on the state of the law at the time of enactment, and on any evidence of the states motives, conduct, and knowledge in relation to its unconstitutionality. \nGonthier J.s various formulations, with the exception of negligence, describe instances in which the enactment would have been clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power. In our view, however, negligence does not connote the gravity of misconduct this threshold was designed to capture. While Gonthier J.s statements indicate that there was no evidence that would meet even this lower standard in that case, in our view, the use of the term negligence was not intended to lower the general threshold. It does not form part of the threshold. The concept of negligence is unhelpful as it does not reflect the high standard demanded by the constitutional principles underlying the analysis.\nNonetheless, an objective assessment of the unconstitutionality of the legislation can assist in identifying whether the threshold is met, provided the standard remains high. Indeed, like negligence, the French translation in Mackin of clearly wrong  clairement fautif  signals such an objective standard. A number of interveners favoured a threshold that focussed on an objective review of the legislation under the clearly wrong component of the threshold. Other interveners point out that the concept of wrongfulness has led to some confusion. We would clarify that this inquiry is better understood as a focus on whether the legislation is clearly unconstitutional, which directs a judge to look objectively at the legislation itself, particularly the nature and extent of its constitutional invalidity. Underlying this objective assessment is a presumption of the legislatures knowledge of and respect for basic Charter rights. \nHowever, we would reject any of the formulations suggested by the interveners that would set the threshold so high that it immunizes the government from liability for unprecedented but egregious constitutional breaches. Thus, the threshold will be met where the legislation was clearly unconstitutional in the sense that, at the time of its enactment, it would clearly violate Charter rights (M. L. Pilkington, Monetary Redress for Charter Infringement, in R. J. Sharpe, ed., Charter Litigation (1987), 307, at pp. 319-20, cited with approval in Guimond v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 347, at para. 15; R. J. Sharpe and K. Roach, The Charter of Rights and Freedoms (7th ed. 2021), at p. 511). Such egregious or obvious violations of Charter rights are clearly wrong. We would not set the test as high as Jamal J.s proposed articulation of the clearly unconstitutional threshold.\nA finding of clear unconstitutionality will usually imply that the state either knew that the law was clearly unconstitutional, or was reckless or wilfully blind as to its unconstitutionality. As Sharpe and Juriansz JJ.A. helpfully explained in Brazeau, where the law is clearly unconstitutional, the state may have shown a clear disregard for Charter rights by proceeding with a course of action in the face of a known risk that the Charter will be violated or by deliberately failing to inquire about the likelihood of a Charter breach when the state knows that there is a good reason to inquire (para. 87, citing Ward, at para. 43). \nWhile the clearly unconstitutional standard will likely resolve most issues of whether the limited immunity applies, other rare situations may require judges to ask whether there is evidence that the state acted in bad faith or abused its power in enacting the invalid law. Principles of constitutionalism and legality require that the threshold leaves room for meaningful recourse for breach of constitutional rights involving such intentional state misconduct. \nWe would not attempt to define bad faith or abuse of power in the law-making process with exactitude without the benefit of a full record and submissions. This standard may, for example, be met in cases where the state acted for an improper purpose, or was dishonest. We would not, however, limit the concepts of bad faith and abuse of power to an examination of the legislations purpose. \nWhen it comes time to assess an allegation of bad faith or abuse of power on the basis of specific facts, other contexts of bad faith and abuse of power may provide guidance (see, e.g., Roncarelli, at p. 141; Finney v. Barreau du Quebec, 2004 SCC 36, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17, at para. 39; Hinse v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 35, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 621, at paras. 48-53; see also Special Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada 1979  The Abuse of Power and the Role of an Independent Judicial System in Its Regulation and Control (1979)). However, we note that these concepts are flexible and their content will vary from one area of law to another (Entreprises Sibeca Inc. v. Frelighsburg (Municipality), 2004 SCC 61, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 304, at para. 25). In the context of the states law-making function, in which Parliament and legislative bodies are entitled to enact any law within their constitutional confines, bad faith and abuse of power may require a higher degree of misconduct than in other contexts. These are legal standards applied by courts, they are not means of evaluating the wisdom or policy of the enactment process or the enacted law. \nOur colleague Jamal J. accepts the clearly unconstitutional standard but rejects bad faith and abuse of power. He reasons that while clearly unconstitutional is an objective standard, based on the enactment of the legislation, bad faith and abuse of power inherently implicate conduct that is beyond judicial review. We disagree. In our view, bad faith or abuse of power could be satisfied without violating parliamentary privilege. Moreover, like bad faith and abuse of power, the clearly unconstitutional standard implicates Parliaments conduct in enacting legislation. As we explained, a finding of clear unconstitutionality amounts to a conclusion that in enacting the legislation, lawmakers knew the law was unconstitutional, or were reckless or wilfully blind as to its unconstitutionality. Changing the verb enacting to the noun enactment does not change the nature of the inquiry.\nWe appreciate that discerning institutional motivation or the knowledge of legislative bodies when enacting legislation is a difficult task. We further appreciate that although Charter damages lie against the state and not individual lawmakers or government officials, the state acts through the vehicle of individuals. As with other contexts of institutional state conduct, whether it is possible to attribute the bad faith or abuse of power of an individual or group to the institution itself will depend on the facts of a given case. It bears repeating here that the basis for liability under s. 24(1) is the states breach of a Charter right. In cases like Mr. Powers claim, it is the invalid law that breached his right. Any inquiry into state misconduct in enacting the invalid law is to assess whether damages are just and appropriate for that breach, not to create an independent basis for liability.\nWhere the claimant puts forward a particularized allegation that the Mackin threshold has been met, the claim must be assessed on the basis of evidence obtained in a way that does not violate parliamentary privilege, such as statements made outside of the parliamentary process.\nThus, we would clarify that clearly wrong reflects an objective assessment into whether the legislation was clearly unconstitutional at the time it was enacted, and that bad faith and abuse of power remain part of the threshold. To that extent we would restate the Mackin threshold relating to the enactment of legislation later found to be unconstitutional: the good governance defence will prevail unless the law was clearly unconstitutional, in bad faith or an abuse of power. The exacting nature of the threshold means that an applicants failure to provide detailed particulars will be fatal to their claim at the pleadings stage (Henry (2015), at para. 43). Bald or vague assertions will necessarily fall short.\nThe Threshold Is Assessed at Step Three of the Ward Framework \nCanada submits that the immunity threshold should be a preliminary matter, before engaging with the Ward framework. In the alternative, it submits that the threshold can operate within the third step of the Ward test. Mr. Power asserts that the countervailing considerations raised by Canada in this appeal should be considered and balanced at the third step of the Ward test.\nIn our view, the four-part test in Ward governs all claims for Charter damages. Immunity is not a preliminary question in a claim for Charter damages based on invalid legislation. The states limited immunity defence fits best as a consideration at the third step of the Ward test. In order for an inquiry into the states limited immunity to arise under s. 24(1), a claimant must first demonstrate that their rights were violated as a result of an unconstitutional law, and that damages are an otherwise appropriate and just remedy for that violation (Ward, at paras. 23-24). This Court and others have recognized that the Mackin threshold and other immunity considerations are an expression of the principles underlying the good governance concerns considered at the third stage of Ward (Ward, at paras. 39 and 68; Ernst, at para. 42; Brazeau, at paras. 46-48; Roach, Constitutional Remedies, at  11:11 and 11:20; P. W. Hogg, P. J. Monahan and W. K. Wright, Liability of the Crown (4th ed. 2011), at pp. 204-5; Hogg and Wright, at  40:19). Like good governance concerns in other contexts, the limited immunity threshold functions to ensure damages that may otherwise interfere with effective government are not awarded unless the state conduct meets a minimum threshold of gravity (Ward, at para. 39; Henry (2015), at paras. 39-41). \nLimited immunity ends at the point where it no longer strikes a justifiable constitutional balance. If the state enacts legislation that is subsequently declared invalid and that is clearly unconstitutional, in bad faith or in an abuse of power, good governance concerns can no longer justify shielding the government from liability for violating Charter rights. Damages may instead promote good governance by supporting the foundational principle of good governance that state action must comply with the Constitution (Ward, at para. 38). If the Mackin threshold is not met, the balance of constitutional principles tilts in favour of state immunity. In such cases, the constitutional imperative that the government be afforded the autonomy to govern effectively will defeat the claim to damages. \nConclusion\nState immunity for the exercise of legislative power remains limited. There is no absolute immunity for the enactment of legislation later found to be unconstitutional. This conclusion answers both of the constitutional questions posed by Canada. In reaching this conclusion, we have explained that the state may be liable for Charter damages for enacting invalid legislation only if it is clearly unconstitutional or was in bad faith or an abuse of power. Because the first question implicates a broader range of state conduct and actors than the second question  indeed it implicates matters far beyond those raised by Mr. Powers claim  the answer must be the same.\nTo approach the first question separately in this case would have raised issues of the accountability of public servants who form part of the executive. Parliamentary privilege attaches to Parliament as a separate branch of government and shields certain spheres of parliamentary activity from judicial review. If the conduct of public servants related to the preparation of legislation is included within parliamentary privilege and attracts absolute immunity, it would inevitably risk extending the privilege to the executive, with far-reaching and unforeseeable consequences. Thus, we disagree with our colleagues answer to the first question.\nAccordingly, the constitutional questions are answered as follows: \nAnswer to question 1: Yes.\nAnswer to question 2: Yes. \nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\n\tThe reasons of Kasirer and Jamal JJ. were delivered by\n\tJamal J. \nOverview\nThis appeal presents two questions of law posed by the Attorney General of Canada. First, can the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages under s. 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a bill that is enacted by Parliament but subsequently declared inconsistent with the Charter and of no force or effect under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982? Second, can the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for Parliament enacting a bill into law that is later declared inconsistent with the Charter and of no force or effect under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\nThe New Brunswick Court of Queens Bench and Court of Appeal answered both questions in the affirmative. They followed this Courts decision in Mackin v. New Brunswick (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 13, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 405, which held that a court may award damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for harms suffered because of a law that is later declared unconstitutional when the law is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power (para. 78). Although the Attorney General of Canada had argued that there can be no Crown liability for the enactment of legislation because of parliamentary privilege, the separation of powers, and parliamentary sovereignty, the Court of Appeal said that until the Supreme Court overrules [Mackin] or limits its application, we are duty-bound to apply it (2022 NBCA 14, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 68, at para. 20).\nI accept that the courts below were bound to follow Mackin as a precedent of this Court. However, the parties in Mackin did not raise parliamentary privilege and the Court did not address the privilege in its reasons. In my respectful view, Mackin should now be clarified. Aspects of Mackin conflict with the constitutional doctrine of parliamentary privilege, principles of justiciability, and the separation of powers. Applying Mackin without clarification or modification would intrude into the constitutionally-assigned domain of Parliament.\nParliamentary privilege includes the sum of the privileges, immunities and powers enjoyed by the Senate, the House of Commons and provincial legislative assemblies, and by each member individually, without which they could not discharge their functions (Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 667, at para. 29(2) (citation omitted)). It includes the privileges of freedom of speech in the legislative process and Parliaments exclusive control over parliamentary proceedings. This Court has recognized that, in principle, parliamentary privilege can extend to members of Parliament or a legislative assembly, and to parliamentary officers, employees, and officials (Vaid, at paras. 29(11) and 41). The issue is not the nature of the individual but whether their activities are necessary to the legislative functions that parliamentary privilege was originally designed to protect (Vaid, at paras. 4 and 44). Courts have jurisdiction to determine the existence of a recognized category of parliamentary privilege, but they have no jurisdiction to review the exercise of the privilege, even for compliance with the Charter. Because the privilege is part of the Constitution of Canada, it cannot be abrogated or diminished by another part of the Constitution, including the Charter. Parliamentary privilege is a corollary to the separation of powers because it gives the legislative branch of government the autonomy it requires to perform its constitutionally-assigned functions. \nAgainst this backdrop, the first question posed by the Attorney General should be answered in the negative for two reasons. First, the doctrine of parliamentary privilege creates an exception to the possibility of Crown liability for the conduct of government officials and Ministers in preparing and drafting legislation. The preparation and drafting of legislation is core legislative conduct that is necessarily incidental to proceedings in Parliament. Such conduct is protected from judicial interference by the established categories of parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech and control over parliamentary proceedings. The courts have no jurisdiction to review or assign liability for the exercise of these established categories of privilege, even after the legislative process has concluded, and even when it is alleged that the legislation infringed the Charter. \nSecond, the Crown, in its executive capacity, cannot be liable for the legislative work of Ministers and the government officials supporting them in preparing and drafting legislation because this is legislative rather than executive conduct, and thus cannot be attributed to the Crown in its executive capacity. The Crown cannot be liable for legislative conduct in an action brought under s. 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50, which provides the statutory basis for suing the Crown in right of Canada by taking proceedings in the name of the Attorney General of Canada. \nThe second question should be answered in the affirmative, but in a qualified manner. Mackin should be clarified to eliminate bad faith and abuse of power in enacting primary legislation as grounds for damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter. These grounds would inevitably trench on the established categories of parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech and control over parliamentary proceedings. They would draw the courts into scrutinizing whether the substance of the legislation is in bad faith or an abuse of power after that legislation has already been found to be unconstitutional. This question is not justiciable and would strain the separation of powers.  \nAlthough bad faith and abuse of power are unavailable as grounds for damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter, the clearly wrong threshold contemplated in Mackin remains available under the second question. I would, however, reformulate that threshold by holding that the Crown could be liable for damages under s. 24(1) for harms caused by clearly unconstitutional enactments, if the unconstitutionality was readily or obviously demonstrable at the time of enactment and could not have been subject to any serious debate. \nThe standard of clearly unconstitutional is a justiciable standard that allows a court to consider whether legislation had the unconstitutional purpose of infringing a Charter right in evaluating whether damages would be an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter. This is analytically distinct from the non-justiciable standard of whether the legislation involved bad faith or an abuse of power. \nIn addition, the bad faith and abuse of power standards are not anchored in considerations relating to the constitutionality of legislation and would therefore inevitably stray into judging the wisdom or policy of the law, which is not the proper role of the courts. The clearly unconstitutional standard, on the other hand, protects parliamentary privilege as a rule of curial jurisdiction and upholds the separation of powers, while allowing individuals whose rights have been breached by clearly unconstitutional enactments to seek Charter damages in appropriate cases.\nBackground\nIt is common ground from the pleadings that the respondent, Joseph Power, was convicted of two indictable offences of sexual assault in 1996 and sentenced to two eight-month terms of incarceration to be served concurrently. He served his sentence and was released from custody in 1996.\nMr. Power further pleads that, in 2010, he inquired about obtaining a pardon, now called a record suspension, but he did not apply for one at that time. In 2011, Mr. Powers employer, a hospital, learned of his criminal record and suspended him from his job as a medical radiation technologist because it saw his criminal record as a risk in his work.\nIn 2013, Mr. Power applied for a record suspension but was refused. In 2010, Parliament had enacted the Limiting Pardons for Serious Crimes Act, S.C. 2010, c. 5, and in 2012, it had enacted the Safe Streets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1. These statutes made individuals convicted of certain criminal offences permanently ineligible for a record suspension. The transitional provisions of both statutes applied the legislation retrospectively to offences committed before they came into force, making Mr. Power permanently ineligible for a record suspension.\nThe transitional provisions were successfully challenged in unrelated litigation as being contrary to s. 11(h) and (i) of the Charter and were declared to be of no force or effect (Chu v. Canada (Attorney General), 2017 BCSC 630, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 449; P.H. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 393, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 461). It is no longer disputed that the transitional provisions unjustifiably infringe the Charter.\nIn May 2018, Mr. Power sued the Crown in right of Canada. He alleged that his inability to receive a record suspension caused him to lose his job and made him ineligible for membership in the governing bodies for medical radiation technologists. Relying on this Courts decision in Mackin, he asserted that the enactment and application of the transitional provisions was conduct that was clearly wrong, undertaken in bad faith, and an abuse of power, and claimed damages against the Crown under s. 24(1) of the Charter.\nThe Crown sought particulars of Mr. Powers claim. Mr. Power responded that the transitional provisions were clear violations of the Charter and were imposed in bad faith, with the intention to add to the punishment of offenders who had been sentenced prior to the passing of the legislation (Statement of Particulars of Joseph Power, reproduced in A.R., at p. 85). He also alleged the Attorney General of Canada knew that the effect of the transitional provisions would be to increase punishment of certain convicted persons after the fact, which violated the Charter (p. 85). Finally, Mr. Power asserted that it was an abuse of power to impose these provisions despite being aware of their unconstitutional effect on him and other persons convicted of crimes prior to the passing of the legislation (p. 85).\nThe Attorney General of Canada then applied to the courts for the determination of two questions of law: whether the Crown, in its executive capacity, could be held liable in damages for (i) government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a proposed bill enacted by Parliament, and (ii) Parliament enacting a bill into law, when a court later declares the law to be unconstitutional under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nThe New Brunswick Court of Queens Bench and Court of Appeal blended these questions into a single question: Do the Crown and its officials enjoy absolute immunity when exercising a legislative function? Relying on this Courts decision in Mackin, both courts held that the Crown enjoys a limited and not an absolute immunity. Accordingly, they answered the two questions posed by the Attorney Generals motion in the affirmative.\nIn its reasons, the Court of Appeal remarked that the Attorney General of Canada forcefully argues that there can be no Crown liability for the enactment of legislation that may be found to be unconstitutional because of immunity arising from the separation of powers, parliamentary sovereignty, and parliamentary privilege (para. 20). The court acknowledged that Mackin did not expressly address these issues, but considered itself duty-bound to apply Mackin as precedent unless and until this Court overturns it or limits its application (para. 20). Applying Mackin, the Court of Appeal said that the legislative branch and those within it are free to make policy choices and adopt laws, although they may have to pay a price if they do so in circumstances that are clearly wrong, or where bad faith or abuse of power is proven (para. 23).\nAnalysis\nAlthough Mr. Powers claim is principally concerned with his ability to obtain damages as a remedy for unconstitutional legislation under s. 24(1) of the Charter, the doctrine of parliamentary privilege forms the essential undercurrent of the Attorney General of Canadas appeal before this Court. Accordingly, I will first set out the relevant law on parliamentary privilege, and will then explain how this doctrine informs the answers to the two questions of law posed by the Attorney General.\nThe Constitutional Doctrine of Parliamentary Privilege\nDefinition\nParliamentary privilege refers to the sum of the privileges, powers, and immunities of the federal Houses of Parliament or provincial legislative assemblies, and of their individual members, that are necessary to their capacity to function as legislative bodies (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  1:7, citing New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319, at p. 385, and W. J. Newman, Parliamentary Privilege, the Canadian Constitution and the Courts (2008), 39 Ottawa L. Rev. 573; see also Vaid, at paras. 29(2), 29(4) and 29(5); Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Quebec, 2018 SCC 39, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687, at para. 19; F. Chevrette and H. Marx, Droit constitutionnel: Principes fondamentaux: Notes et jurisprudence (2nd ed. rev. 2021), at p. 401). The idea of necessity is . . . linked to the autonomy required by legislative assemblies and their members to do their [legislative work] (Vaid, at para. 29(4)). Necessity is to be read broadly, based on what the dignity and efficiency of Parliament or the legislative assembly requires (Vaid, at para. 29(7), quoting New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 383).\nParliamentary privilege provides a legal exemption from some duty, burden, attendance or liability to which others are subject (Chagnon, at para. 19, citing J. P. J. Maingot, Parliamentary Immunity in Canada (2016), at p. 13; see also New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 378). As noted by Joseph Maingot, a former law clerk and parliamentary counsel to the House of Commons of Canada, parliamentary privilege, though part of the general and public law of Canada, is an exemption from the ordinary law ((2016), at p. 289 (footnotes omitted)). As will be seen, this includes an exemption from review under the Charter.\nHistory and Sources\nParliamentary privilege has been part of the lex parliamentis or the law of Parliament and subsequently part of the common law and statute law of the United Kingdom for centuries (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 344-45, per Lamer C.J.; Hogg and Wright, at  1:7). Although the doctrine can be traced to the eleventh century (Maingot (2016), at p. 19), it developed most significantly in the seventeenth century through the struggle of the House of Commons for independence from the other branches of government, including the Crown and the judiciary, which did not hesitate to interfere in the workings of Parliament, such as by arresting and prosecuting members of Parliament for allegedly speaking seditious words in debate in the House of Commons (Chagnon, at para. 22; see also New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 344-45). The doctrine was partly codified in England by art. 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1689 (Eng.), 1 Will. & Mar. Sess. 2, c. 2, which affirms that [t]he freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament (see Vaid, at para. 21; Chagnon, at para. 22; New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 345).\nBefore Confederation, the colonial legislatures in Canada enjoyed parliamentary privilege at common law as an inherent and necessary part of their legislative functions, known as inherent privileges (Chagnon, at paras. 18 and 23; see also Kielley v. Carson (1842), 4 Moo. 63, 13 E.R. 225 (P.C.), at pp. 234-35, discussed in New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 346, per Lamer C.J., and at pp. 381-82, per McLachlin J. (as she then was); Chagnon, at para. 108, per Cote and Brown JJ., dissenting; Maingot (2016), at pp. 272 and 307). At Confederation, parliamentary privilege became part of the Constitution of Canada through the preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867, which states that Canada has a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 377; Vaid, at paras. 21 and 29(3); Chagnon, at paras. 18 and 23).\nAt the federal level, unlike the provincial level, s. 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867 authorizes Parliament to define by legislation the parliamentary privileges of the Senate and House of Commons and their members. Section 18 provides:\n18 The privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons, and by the members thereof respectively, shall be such as are from time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada, but so that any Act of the Parliament of Canada defining such privileges, immunities, and powers shall not confer any privileges, immunities, or powers exceeding those at the passing of such Act held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and by the members thereof.\nParliament exercised its power under s. 18 by enacting s. 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-1, which states that the Senate and House of Commons and their members hold the privileges, immunities, and powers held by the U.K. House of Commons at the time of the passing of the Constitution Act, 1867, as well as those defined by statute, which cannot exceed those held by the Parliament at Westminster at the time the statute is enacted.\nThrough s. 4 of the Parliament of Canada Act, the Senate and House of Commons now enjoy the full extent of the privileges permitted under the Constitution (Vaid, at para. 35). Thus, at the federal level, the main body of the parliamentary privileges are legislated privileges, rather than inherent privileges, and unlike provincial parliamentary privileges, have an express constitutional foundation in s. 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (Vaid, at paras. 36-37; see also H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at para. V-1.226).\nSection 5 of the Parliament of Canada Act further states that the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament are part of the general and public law of Canada and shall be judicially noticed by all courts in Canada (see Maingot (2016), at pp. 272, 274 and 281-82).\nParliamentary Privilege Is a Corollary to the Separation of Powers\nParliamentary privilege helps Canadas constitutional democracy maintain the fundamental separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government (Vaid, at para. 21; Chagnon, at para. 21). As this Court has noted, [t]here are few issues as important to our constitutional equilibrium as the relationship between the legislature and the other branches of the State on which the Constitution has conferred powers, namely the executive and the courts (Vaid, at para. 4). Parliamentary privilege has been called a corollary to the separation of powers because it help[s] to protect each branchs ability to perform its constitutionally-assigned functions (British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Provincial Court Judges Association of British Columbia, 2020 SCC 20, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 506, at para. 66). The privilege does this [b]y shielding some areas of legislative activity from external review and by granting the legislative branch of government the autonomy it requires to perform its constitutional functions (Chagnon, at para. 1; see also Vaid, at para. 41).\nTwo-Step Test for Parliamentary Privilege at the Federal Level\nQuestions of parliamentary privilege at the federal level are subject to a two-step test. At the first step, a court asks whether the existence and scope of the claimed privilege has been authoritatively established under Canadian or British precedent, and if so, the court must accept the privilege without further inquiry into the necessity of the privilege or the merits of its exercise (Vaid, at paras. 37 and 39). If the proposed category has not been authoritatively established, then, at the second step, the court asks whether the privilege claimed is justified under a necessity test. The court must consider whether the activity is so closely and directly connected with the functions of the legislative assembly or its members that outside interference would undermine the level of autonomy required to enable the assembly and its members to do their work with dignity and efficiency (Vaid, at para. 46; see also Chagnon, at paras. 29 and 31). The party invoking parliamentary privilege bears the burden at both steps, but once the privilege is established the propriety of its exercise is beyond the review of the courts (Vaid, at paras. 5, 29(8) and 53; Chagnon, at para. 32).\nIn Vaid, Binnie J. identified the categories of parliamentary privilege that have been authoritatively established by precedent as including: (a) freedom of speech; (b) control by the Houses of Parliament over debates or proceedings in Parliament, including the day-to-day procedure in the House; (c) the power to exclude strangers from proceedings; (d) disciplinary authority over members; (e) disciplinary authority over non-members who interfere with the discharge of parliamentary duties; and (f) immunity of members from subpoena during parliamentary session (para. 29(10)).\nParliamentary Privilege Is a Rule of Curial Jurisdiction\nParliamentary privilege is a rule of curial jurisdiction (Duffy v. Canada (Senate), 2020 ONCA 536, 151 O.R. (3d) 489, at para. 35). When a matter falls within the scope of parliamentary privilege, the exercise of the privilege cannot be reviewed by any external body, including a court (Vaid, at paras. 29(9) and 34; Chagnon, at paras. 19 and 24; New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 350, per Lamer C.J., and at pp. 382-84, per McLachlin J.). Parliamentary privilege recognizes Parliaments exclusive jurisdiction to deal with complaints within its privileged sphere of activity (Vaid, at paras. 4, 29(9) and 30 (emphasis in original); see also New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 383-84; Maingot (2016), at p. 277; the Hon. M. Rowe and M. Oza, Structural Analysis and the Canadian Constitution (2023), 101 Can. Bar Rev. 205, at pp. 225-27; A. Marcotte, Structural Analysis, Unwritten Principles and Constitutional Remedies: Charter Damages for the Enactment of Legislation by Parliament (2024), 18 J.P.P.L. 69, at pp. 78-79).\nWhen a claim of parliamentary privilege is made, the courts have jurisdiction to determine the existence and scope of a claimed privilege, but they have no jurisdiction to adjudicate its exercise (Vaid, at paras. 40-41 and 47-48; Chagnon, at paras. 2 and 32; New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 350, per Lamer C.J., and at pp. 384-85, per McLachlin J.). Ascertaining the existence and the scope of parliamentary privilege falls within the exclusive domain of the judiciary, while the exercise of this constitutional power falls within the exclusive domain of the legislature (see Maingot (2016), at p. 304; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. V-1.221). Thus, questions relating to the existence and scope of parliamentary privilege are justiciable, but questions as to its exercise are not justiciable (L. Sossin and G. Kennedy, Boundaries of Judicial Review: The Law of Justiciability in Canada (3rd ed. 2024), at  7:7).\nAs stated by McLachlin J. for the majority in New Brunswick Broadcasting, parliamentary privileges must be held absolutely and constitutionally if they are to be effective; the legislative branch of our government must enjoy a certain autonomy which even the Crown and the courts cannot touch (p. 379). The effect of parliamentary privilege is to confer an immunity from judicial review over the privileged matter (p. 342, per Lamer C.J.; Marcotte, at p. 79). \nHowever, immunity from judicial review does not mean that parliamentary privilege conflicts with the rule of law in the sense that parliamentary institutions and their members lack accountability. Parliamentary privilege does not create a gap in the general public law of Canada but is an important part of it (Vaid, at para. 29(3)). Although the courts may not review conduct or activity protected by parliamentary privilege, the House of Commons, Senate, and provincial and territorial legislative assemblies each have their own powers of judicature and can examine such conduct or activity (Vaid, at paras. 20, 29(9), 30 and 41; New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 379-80; Maingot (2016), at pp. 20, 197, 282-85 and 299-304). As Binnie J. remarked in Vaid: [t]he House, with one voice, accuses, condemns, and executes (para. 30, citing Stockdale v. Hansard (1839), 9 Ad. & E. 1, 112 E.R. 1112 (Q.B.), at p. 1171). Lord Rodger of the United Kingdom Supreme Court also explained this point well in R. v. Chaytor, [2010] UKSC 52, [2011] All E.R. 805, at para. 105:\nThe expression, the High Court of Parliament, makes the point that Parliament has a certain power of judicature  as do the two Houses in their separate capacities. In exercising this jurisdiction the Houses apply the law and custom of Parliament (lex et consuetudo parliamenti).\nOur Court has also noted that while legislative assemblies are not accountable to the courts for the ways in which they exercise their parliamentary privilege, they remain accountable to the electorate (Chagnon, at para. 24, citing S. R. Chaplin, House of Commons v. Vaid: Parliamentary Privilege and the Constitutional Imperative of the Independence of Parliament (2009), 2 J.P.P.L. 153, at p. 164; see also New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 365, per Lamer C.J.).\nThe Exercise of Recognized Categories of Parliamentary Privilege Is Not Subject to the Charter\nParliamentary privilege is not a mere principle of interpretation, rule of evidence, or constitutional convention  rather, it is part of the Constitution of Canada. As a result, although the Charter applies to Parliament or a provincial or territorial legislature under s. 32(1) of the Charter, actions or conduct protected by parliamentary privilege are not subject to the Charter (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 382-84; Vaid, at para. 33; Chagnon, at para. 2; Hogg and Wright, at  1:7 and 37:7; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. V-1.219, IX-7, XII-2.7 and XII-2.11; Maingot (2016), at pp. 290-91; Marcotte, at p. 79). This is because one part of the Constitution, such as the doctrine of parliamentary privilege, cannot be abrogated or diminished by another part of the Constitution, such as the Charter (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 373, citing Reference re Bill 30, An Act to amend the Education Act (Ont.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1148; see also Vaid, at para. 30; Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 42; Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 876, at p. 917, per McLachlin J., concurring in the result; Hogg and Wright, at  37:7; Maingot (2016), at pp. 290-91).\nThe seminal decision on this point is New Brunswick Broadcasting. This Court held that the Nova Scotia House of Assembly had an inherent parliamentary privilege to exclude the media from accessing the Assemblys public gallery in order to film proceedings, and that the freedom of the press guaranteed under s. 2(b) of the Charter did not apply to the exercise of this parliamentary privilege. Speaking for the majority, McLachlin J. accepted that the Charter generally applies to a legislative assembly under s. 32(1) (at pp. 370-71), but she added that the unwritten constitutional doctrine of parliamentary privilege is also part of the Constitution of Canada under s. 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, through the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867. As McLachlin J. explained:\n. . . given the clear and stated intention of the founders of our country in the Constitution Act, 1867 to establish a constitution similar to that of the United Kingdom, the Constitution may also include such privileges as have been historically recognized as necessary to the proper functioning of our legislative bodies. [p. 377]\nJustice McLachlin emphasized that recognizing the doctrine of parliamentary privilege as part of the Constitution of Canada is not a case of importing an unexpressed concept into our constitutional regime, but of recognizing a legal power fundamental to the constitutional regime which Canada has adopted in its Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 377). The proper application of the doctrine of parliamentary privilege is thus as fundamental to the Canadian constitutional regime of the Charter as it is to the Constitution Act, 1867.\nJustice McLachlin also noted that once a court determines that parliamentary conduct or actions are protected by parliamentary privilege, and thus within the legislatures exclusive jurisdiction, the privilege is held absolutely and is immune from intrusion by other branches of government (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 379, 383 and 387-88). Furthermore, the effect of recognizing the constitutional status of the right to exclude strangers such as the media from the chamber was that the Charter cannot cut down on that right, on the principle that one part of the Constitution cannot abrogate another part of the Constitution (p. 390). She concluded that because the Nova Scotia House of Assembly had exercised its parliamentary privilege to exclude strangers from its deliberations, the Charter does not apply to its conduct (p. 393 (emphasis added); see also p. 390).\nIn Doucet-Boudreau, this Court cited New Brunswick Broadcasting in support of the proposition that if there is some constitutional limit to the remedial power . . . in s. 24(1) of the Charter, the judge ordering a remedy must respect this boundary, because no part of the Constitution can abrogate or diminish another part of the Constitution (para. 42). As will be developed, and as implicitly recognized in Doucet-Boudreau, the authority of the courts to award damages under s. 24(1) is subject to the constitutional limit imposed by parliamentary privilege.\nThis Courts decision in Vaid confirmed the principle enunciated in New Brunswick Broadcasting that although the Charter applies to Parliament and the provincial and territorial legislatures and all matters within their authority, actions or conduct protected by parliamentary privilege are not subject to review under the Charter. The Court in Vaid extended this principle from the inherent parliamentary privileges of provincial legislatures at issue in New Brunswick Broadcasting to the legislated parliamentary privileges of Parliament. In Vaid, Justice Binnie said that this point must now be taken as settled (para. 33). Professors Hogg and Wright have explained that, after Vaid, there is no difference in constitutional status between legislated privilege and inherent privilege. Both are exempt from the Charter of Rights ( 1:7 (emphasis added); see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. XII-2.13).\nVaid also highlighted how parliamentary privilege functions as a rule of curial jurisdiction and is shielded from Charter review. Justice Binnie explained that New Brunswick Broadcasting held that the press freedom guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter did not prevail over parliamentary privilege, and affirmed that [o]ne part of the Constitution cannot abrogate another part of the Constitution (para. 30). He added that [i]n matters of privilege, it would lie within the exclusive competence of the legislative assembly itself to consider compliance with human rights and civil liberties (para. 30). He illustrated how parliamentary privilege is not subject to review under the Charter with the following example:\nIt would be intolerable, for example, if a member of the House of Commons who was overlooked by the Speaker at question period could invoke the investigatory powers of the Canadian Human Rights Commission with a complaint that the Speakers choice of another member of the House discriminated on some ground prohibited by the Canadian Human Rights Act, or to seek a ruling from the ordinary courts that the Speakers choice violated the members guarantee of free speech under the Charter. [Emphasis added; para. 20.]\nMost recently, in Chagnon, Karakatsanis J., for a majority of the Court, held that courts cannot review the exercise of parliamentary privilege, even on Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms grounds (para. 2 (emphasis added)). As she explained, [j]udicial review of the exercise of parliamentary privilege, even for Charter compliance, would effectively nullify the necessary immunity this doctrine is meant to afford the legislature (para. 24 (emphasis added; citations omitted)).\nTo sum up, parliamentary privilege is an integral part of the Constitution of Canada. Once the existence of a category of parliamentary privilege is established, conduct or activities that are themselves an exercise of that privilege are not subject to review by the courts, even when such conduct or activities are alleged to violate the Charter. As elaborated below, this means that such conduct or activities cannot be the basis of a Charter breach and, accordingly, cannot give rise to a Charter remedy such as damages under s. 24(1).\nI now turn to the two questions posed by the Attorney General of Canada.\nQuestion One: The Crown Cannot Be Liable for Damages Under Section 24(1) of the Charter For Preparing and Drafting Legislation Later Found to Infringe the Charter\nThe first question posed by the Attorney General of Canada asks whether the Crown in its executive capacity can be held liable in damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a bill that is validly enacted but later declared unconstitutional. The second question asks whether the Crown in its executive capacity can be liable in damages for Parliament enacting a bill into law when that law is later declared unconstitutional. \nBefore this Court, the Attorney General of Canada submits that the answer to both questions . . . turns on a single issue, namely whether Charter damages can ever be an appropriate and just remedy in respect of the process leading to the enactment of primary legislation that is later declared unconstitutional (A.F., at para. 24). This approach seeks to answer both questions by posing a third. The respondent submits that while the Attorney Generals formulation is imperfect, the ultimate answer [to the question posed] is yes (R.F., at para. 20). \nIn my view, both questions raise distinct parliamentary privilege considerations relating, in question 1, to the legislative process of preparing and drafting legislation, and in question 2, to the grounds on which legislation, once enacted, may be reviewed. The two questions do not lend themselves to a single, blended analysis with a uniform answer and, accordingly, each should be addressed separately as originally posed. This Court is well equipped to address the two questions separately, having received extensive submissions on all the relevant considerations of parliamentary privilege and the separation of powers from both parties and no fewer than 21 interveners.\nAs I will explain, the answer to the first question must be no. Parliamentary privilege, through the established categories of privilege of freedom of speech and control over parliamentary proceedings, precludes Crown liability for the legislative process. The authorities establish that parliamentary privilege extends to members of Parliament or a legislative assembly, and conduct by parliamentary officers and employees, officials, and the public, when they are engaged in proceedings in Parliament. Whether the privilege is engaged is determined not by the nature of the relevant individual but by the conduct in which they are engaged, and in particular, whether that conduct is necessary to the core legislative functions that parliamentary privilege protects. In addition, because persons participating in the legislative process act in a legislative rather than an executive capacity, the Crown in its executive capacity cannot be liable for such conduct in an action brought under s. 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. \nBefore turning to these points, I briefly address three uncontroversial points regarding the framing of the Attorney Generals questions that guide the analysis that follows. \nThree Uncontroversial Points\nThe Crown in its Executive Capacity Refers to the State or Government\nEach of the questions posed by the Attorney General in this appeal inquire as to the Crowns liability in its executive capacity. There is no debate that this refers to the liability of the Canadian government qua executive, to be distinguished from the legislature.\nAs Professors Hogg and Wright note, the legal system of Canada recognizes the state as a legal person, capable of acquiring rights and liabilities under common law or statute law, capable of suing and being sued, and bound by the decisions of courts and other properly constituted tribunals ( 10:1). In Canada, the state is often called the Crown, in recognition of the Queen or King as the formal head of state ( 10:1). The Crown in its executive capacity is also commonly described as the state or the government (P. W. Hogg, P. J. Monahan and W. K. Wright, Liability of the Crown (4th ed. 2011), at p. 12-13; see also RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at p. 598). At the federal level, s. 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act provides that [p]roceedings against the Crown may be taken in the name of the Attorney General of Canada. This is the statutory basis for suing the Crown in right of Canada.\nIn our constitutional system, however, the Crown acts at the federal and provincial and territorial levels, and in distinct executive, legislative, and judicial capacities. At the federal level, the Crown refers to: (a) the head of the executive authority or government of Canada (Constitution Act, 1867, s. 9); (b) the sovereign in the exercise of his formal legislative role in assenting to, refusing to assent to, or reserving parliamentary bills (Constitution Act, 1867, ss. 17, 55 and 91); and (c) the sovereign in the exercise of the judicial authority of the courts (see generally Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council), 2018 SCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765, at paras. 16, 18 and 33, per Karakatsanis J., at paras. 128-33, per Brown J., concurring, and at para. 148, per Rowe J., concurring; Clyde River (Hamlet) v. Petroleum Geo-Services Inc., 2017 SCC 40, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1069, at para. 28; Canada (Auditor General) v. Canada (Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 49, at pp. 103-4; Hogg, Monahan and Wright, at pp. 11-13; and Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. II.84, II.89 and II.96). \nAlthough the state is recognized as a legal person capable of acquiring liabilities, it is also settled that Parliament, the House of Commons, the Senate, and the provincial legislative assemblies, as parts of the legislative branch of government, are not legal entities and cannot sue or be sued (Maingot (2016), at pp. 163 and 198; see also J. P. J. Maingot, Parliamentary Privilege in Canada (2nd ed. 1997), at p. 179). Therefore, even though this Court has said that s. 24(1) Charter remedies are awarded against the state rather than any particular branch of government (Vancouver (City) v. Ward, 2010 SCC 27, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 28, at para. 22), state liability involves the liability of the Crown in its executive capacity, not in its legislative capacity. \nThe Charter Applies to Parliament and the Government of Canada\nThere is also no debate that the Charter, including s. 24(1), applies to Parliament and the government of Canada. Section 32(1)(a) of the Charter states that the Charter applies . . . to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament. As this Court has recognized, the Charter applies broadly to the legislative, executive, and administrative branches of government in respect of all matters within their authority (Dickson v. Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, 2024 SCC 10, at para. 41, citing Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students  British Columbia Component, 2009 SCC 31, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 295, at para. 14, and RWDSU, at p. 598). Still, an established exception to this principle is that conduct protected by parliamentary privilege is not subject to review under the Charter.\nRemedies Under Section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 and Section 24(1) of the Charter Can Be Combined\nLastly, recent jurisprudence of this Court has emphasized there is no hard-and-fast rule against combining remedies under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 (such as a declaration of invalidity) with an individual remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter (such as damages) when the individual remedy is appropriate and just in the circumstances (Ontario (Attorney General) v. G, 2020 SCC 38, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 629, at para. 142; R. v. Albashir, 2021 SCC 48, at paras. 62-67; see also Hogg and Wright, at  40:13).\nA remedy will be appropriate and just within the meaning of s. 24(1) when it furthers the general objectives of the Charter by compensating the plaintiff for any loss, vindicating rights, or deterring future breaches (Ward, at para. 25). This Court in Ward established a four-step inquiry for Charter damages under s. 24(1):\nThe first step in the inquiry is to establish that a Charter right has been breached. The second step is to show why damages are a just and appropriate remedy, having regard to whether they would fulfill one or more of the related functions of compensation, vindication of the right, and/or deterrence of future breaches. At the third step, the state has the opportunity to demonstrate, if it can, that countervailing factors defeat the functional considerations that support a damage award and render damages inappropriate or unjust. The final step is to assess the quantum of the damages. [para. 4]\nThe Crown Cannot Be Liable for Preparing and Drafting Legislation\nParliamentary Privilege Precludes Crown Liability for the Legislative Process\nThe doctrine of parliamentary privilege entails that the Crown cannot be liable for the conduct of government officials and Ministers when carrying out core legislative work or work that is closely and necessarily related to proceedings in Parliament (Maingot (2016), at pp. 7 and 75). Preparing and drafting proposed legislation is undoubtedly core legislative work and is protected from judicial interference and supervision by the established categories of parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech and control over parliamentary proceedings. The courts have no jurisdiction to review the exercise of these parliamentary privileges, even after the legislative process has concluded, and even when it is alleged that the legislation infringed the Charter. And because there can be no judicial review of such privileged conduct under the Charter, this question must be resolved as a threshold jurisdictional issue, not as a countervailing good governance concern at the third step of the Ward framework. If parliamentary privilege applies in respect of the legislative process, the Charter does not apply. \nFreedom of Speech\nGovernment officials and Ministers involved in preparing and drafting proposed legislation enjoy the established parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech for words or conduct connected to their legislative work. Freedom of speech, which protects robust legislative debate, is the lifeblood of Parliaments day-to-day business. As a result, words and conduct connected to the legislative process are necessarily protected by parliamentary privilege.\nThis Court has affirmed unequivocally that the freedom of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 345, per Lamer C.J., citing the Bill of Rights of 1689; see also Vaid, at paras. 29(10) and 39; Chagnon, at para. 22). The free speech privilege includes an immunity from civil proceedings with respect to any matter arising from the carrying out of the duties of a member of the House through a constitutional right . . . to speak freely in the House without fear of civil reprisal (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 385). The privilege applies not only to speech in the House of Commons and the Senate, but also to speech before their committees, none of which is actionable in the ordinary courts, whether or not it is said in good faith (Maingot (2016), at p. 31; see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. V-1.186).\nAn established category of privilege such as freedom of speech applies to the conduct by Parliament or its officers and employees within its necessary scope (Vaid, at para. 29(11) (emphasis added)). It also protects members and officials in the exercise of their functions that are necessary to allow a legislature to discharge its duties with efficiency or to assure its independence and dignity (Vaid, at para. 41, citing J. G. Bourinot, Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in the Dominion of Canada (4th ed. 1916), at p. 37 (emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted)). On the parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech, see generally Ontario v. Rothmans Inc., 2014 ONSC 3382, 120 O.R. (3d) 467 (Rothmans Inc.), at paras. 9-20; Lavigne v. Ontario (Attorney General) (2008), 91 O.R. (3d) 728, at paras. 23 and 47-55; Gagliano v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FC 576, [2005] 3 F.C.R. 555, at paras. 62-97 and 108-11, affd 2006 FCA 86, 268 D.L.R. (4th) 190; Canada (Deputy Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police) v. Canada (Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2007 FC 564, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 752, at paras. 63-65; and Prebble v. Television of New Zealand Ltd., [1995] 1 A.C. 321 (P.C.), at pp. 332-34).\nMaingot adds that all persons, even members of the public, exercising the privilege of freedom of speech while participating in proceedings in Parliament are accountable only to Parliament regardless of their false or malicious intent or conduct ((2016), at pp. 71-72):\nWhile taking part in such proceedings [in Parliament], officers of Parliament, Members of Parliament, and the public are immune from being called to account in the courts or elsewhere, save the Houses of Parliament, for any act done or words uttered in the course of participating, however false or malicious the act and however malicious the words might be; and any member of the public prejudicially affected is without redress.\nA useful illustration of the relevant principles is the decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Rothmans Inc., which recognized that the privilege can extend beyond members of Parliament, officers, and employees to the public more broadly. In Rothmans Inc., the Crown sued tobacco companies for damages under Ontarios Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act, 2009, S.O. 2009, c. 13. The Crowns statement of claim alleged that the companies repeatedly misrepresented the risks of smoking before House of Commons committees and federal legislative committees. One of the companies brought a motion to strike those claims on the basis of parliamentary privilege. The court agreed that the paragraphs should be struck because statements made before those committees were absolutely protected by the privilege over free speech. The court rejected the Crowns argument that it was premature to strike the claims at the pleadings stage on the basis that an evidentiary context was required to determine whether the speech was privileged:\n. . . as can be seen from the authorities, the [free speech] privilege applies broadly to those who participate in parliamentary proceedings  a witness, counsel, a stranger, the public, a person, those who participate, or others whose assistance the House considers necessary for conducting its proceedings. . . . Indeed, art. 9 of the Bill of Rights does not refer to any particular class of individuals, but rather insulates parliamentary freedom of speech, debates and proceedings from external review. [Footnote omitted; para. 29.]\nThe critical point is that, as I have said, whether the privilege applies is not determined by the nature of the relevant individual, but by the activities in which they are engaged and the necessity of those activities to core legislative functions. Thus, the claim of privilege in Vaid was rejected not because Mr. Vaid was the chauffeur to the Speaker of the House of Commons rather than a member of Parliament, but because his activities at the relevant time (driving the speaker) were found to be remote from the legislative functions that parliamentary privilege was originally designed to protect (para. 4). In the context of members or government officials engaged in preparing and drafting legislation, the privilege necessarily applies to their words and conduct not simply because they are members of Parliament or government officials, but because the core legislative activities in which they are engaged (the preparation and drafting of legislation) is absolutely protected by an established category of parliamentary privilege, namely the freedom of speech.\nThe first question posed by the Attorney General of Canada must therefore be answered in the negative. Exposing the Crown, in its executive capacity, to liability in damages for the conduct of government officials and Ministers in preparing and drafting legislation would inevitably intrude upon the parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech for words or conduct connected to Parliaments legislative work. It does not matter that liability would be deferred until after the legislation is enacted (Mikisew Cree, at para. 38; see also Marcotte, at p. 83). The purpose of imposing liability would be to discourage a certain type of speech by requiring the government to pay a price for it, to use the New Brunswick Court of Appeals words (para. 23). This would inevitably trench on the parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech and upset the delicate constitutional equilibrium among the branches of government.\nControl Over Parliamentary Proceedings\nA second authoritatively established category of parliamentary privilege is the House of Commons exclusive control over its own proceedings, often called the privilege over proceedings in Parliament. Like the privilege over freedom of speech, the privilege over proceedings in Parliament was recognized in art. 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1689, which states that proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. \nThe privilege over proceedings in Parliament is broad. It was recognized by this Court in Vaid as including control by the Houses of Parliament over debates or proceedings, including the day-to-day procedure in the House (Vaid, at para. 29(10); see also Mikisew Cree, at para. 37, per Karakatsanis J.). Maingot adds that, as a technical parliamentary term, proceedings are the events and steps leading up to some formal action, including a decision, taken by the House in its collective capacity ((2016), at p. 74, citing Erskine Mays Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament (21st ed. 1989), by C. J. Boulton, ed., at p. 92; see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. V-1.232 and V.1-240). This privilege includes everything said or done by a Member in the exercise of his functions as a Member in committee of either House, as well as everything said or done in either House in the transaction of parliamentary business (Maingot (2016), at pp. 92-93). It encompasses voting, making amendments, asking questions, presenting petitions, as well as any papers or other material connected with parliamentary proceedings, such as notices of motion, reports, and drafts (Maingot (2016), at pp. 74-75 and 93-94; see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. V-1.232 and V.1-240). \nThe privilege also extends to matters taking place outside the houses of Parliament and the provincial or territorial legislatures. The words and conduct of Members who are occupied in something closely and necessarily related to a proceeding in Parliament are accorded absolute privilege (Maingot (2016), at p. 7). This Court has recognized that in matters so closely and directly connected with proceedings in Parliament[,] intervention by the courts would be inconsistent with Parliaments sovereignty as a legislative and deliberative assembly (Vaid, at para. 44 (emphasis deleted), citing U.K., Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, vol. 1, Report of Proceedings of the Committee (1999), at para. 247; see also Canada (Board of Internal Economy) v. Boulerice, 2019 FCA 33, [2019] 3 F.C.R. 145, at para. 104). It cannot reasonably be suggested that preparing and drafting legislation is not closely and necessarily related to proceedings in Parliament.\nAs with the free speech privilege, the spectre of the Crowns liability for the words or conduct of government officials and Ministers in preparing and drafting legislation would unavoidably trench on the established privilege over the proceedings of Parliament. Quite apart from the evidentiary difficulties that may arise in seeking to admit such evidence at trial, the courts are, more fundamentally, without jurisdiction to adjudicate the exercise of this privilege, whether under the Charter or otherwise.\nParliamentary Privilege Is a Threshold Jurisdictional Issue Under the Ward Framework\nIt is worth addressing where parliamentary privilege fits in the four-part Ward framework for Charter damages under s. 24(1). Is it a threshold jurisdictional question, as urged by the Attorney General of Canada? Or is it a good governance consideration to be considered at the third step of Ward, as urged by Mr. Power? In my view, parliamentary privilege raises a threshold jurisdictional question.\nThe reason is straightforward. If the existence of a recognized category of parliamentary privilege is proved, there can be no judicial review of the exercise of the privilege, even on Charter grounds. Words or conduct protected by parliamentary privilege is simply not subject to the Charter. There is no sense in which privileged words or conduct can result in a breach of a Charter right to satisfy the first step of Ward.\nThis conclusion is a direct consequence of the constitutional nature of parliamentary privilege and its status as a rule of curial jurisdiction. The privilege cannot be the subject of a judicial balancing as to whether countervailing good governance concerns at step three of Ward defeat the functional considerations that support a damage award and render damages inappropriate or unjust (para. 4). Instead, the existence of the privilege means that the courts lack jurisdiction to undertake any further inquiry.\nThe Crown Cannot Be Liable for Participating in the Lawmaking Process\nThe relationship between parliamentary privilege and the legislative process leads to a related conclusion: the Crown in its executive capacity cannot be held liable for the work of Ministers and other government officials participating in the legislative process because, in doing so, they act in a legislative rather than an executive capacity. Such conduct is not Crown conduct that can be attributed to the executive for which the Crown can be liable in an action brought under s. 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. This provision itself reflects the separation of powers.\nThis Court confirmed these principles in Mikisew Cree in rejecting the view that the Crown has a duty to consult Aboriginal peoples under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 during the legislative process. A key issue was whether the conduct of the executive during the legislative process is Crown conduct that could trigger a duty to consult under s. 35(1). This turned partly on whether the Federal Court has jurisdiction over executive actors during the legislative process under s. 17(1) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, which provides that the Federal Court has concurrent original jurisdiction in all cases in which relief is claimed against the Crown, defined in s. 2(1) of the Act as Her Majesty in right of Canada. \nSpeaking for the majority on this point, Karakatsanis J. held that the law-making process does not constitute Crown conduct that triggers the duty to consult (Mikisew Cree, at para. 2). She ruled that the term the Crown or Her Majesty in right of Canada does not extend to executive actors when they are exercising legislative power (para. 16 (citation omitted)). As a result, she concluded, the Federal Court has no jurisdiction under s. 17(1) of the Federal Courts Act to consider claims involving the exercise of legislative power in the law-making process. \nIn separate reasons, Brown J. agreed that s. 17 of the Federal Courts Act provides a jurisdictional bar to the Federal Court entertaining claims involving the exercise of legislative power in the legislative process, because such claims do not involve Crown conduct. As he explained:\nThis conclusion is . . . compelled by Part IV of the Constitution Act, 1867  entitled Legislative Power. Part IV sets out, inter alia, the powers of both houses of Parliament  the House of Commons and the Senate  in respect of whose exercise Parliament is sovereign, subject only to the limits of its legislative authority as set out in the Constitution Act, 1867. The development, introduction and consideration of bills in the House of Commons are all necessary exercises of legislative power in the law-making process. While Cabinet ministers are members of the executive, they participate in this process  for example, by presenting a government bill  not in an executive capacity, but in a legislative capacity. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(Mikisew Cree, at para. 113)\nThe statutory bar against the Federal Court entertaining claims involving exercises of legislative power during the legislative process reflects the separation of powers. Although courts of inherent jurisdiction do not face such a statutory jurisdictional limitation, the underlying separation of powers rationale of this provision remains relevant. Speaking for a plurality of the Court on this point, Brown J. noted that the entire law-making process  from initial policy development to and including royal assent  is an exercise of legislative power which is immune from judicial interference (Mikisew Cree, at para. 117). In support of this proposition, he cited this Courts decision in Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525, at p. 559, where Sopinka J. stated that [t]he formulation and introduction of a bill are part of the legislative process with which the courts will not meddle. Justice Karakatsanis cited the same passage in her reasons in Mikisew Cree, in support of her view that [t]he development of legislation by ministers is part of the law-making process, and this process is generally protected from judicial oversight (para. 34). She also cited Reference re Resolution to amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753, to the effect that [c]ourts come into the picture when legislation is enacted and not before (p. 785). Importantly, Justice Karakatsanis added that the same separation of powers concerns would arise even if the duty to consult doctrine were to be enforced only after the legislation has been enacted:\nApplying the duty to consult doctrine during the law-making process would lead to significant judicial incursion into the workings of the legislature, even if such a duty were only enforced post-enactment. . . . Directly transposing such executive requirements into the legislative context would be an inappropriate constraint on legislatures ability to control their own processes. [Emphasis in original; para. 38.]\nI conclude that the Crown, in its executive capacity, cannot be held liable in an action brought under s. 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act for the conduct of government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting legislation because such conduct is legislative rather than executive conduct.\nConclusion\nThe first question posed by the Attorney General of Canada should be answered in the negative. The Crown cannot be held liable in damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for alleged harms stemming from the legislative process of preparing or drafting legislation.\nQuestion Two: The Crown Cannot Be Liable for Damages Under Section 24(1) of the Charter for Enacting Legislation, but Can Be Liable Under Section 24(1) for Harm Caused by Enacted Legislation That Is Clearly Unconstitutional \nThe Attorney General of Canadas second question asks whether the Crown, in its executive capacity, can be held liable for damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for enacting a law that is later found unconstitutional under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. If this question is interpreted, like the first question, as relating to conduct during the legislative process of enacting a bill into law, then I would answer it in the negative. The Crown cannot be liable for words or conduct during the legislative process in preparing, drafting, or enacting legislation. \nIf, however, the second question is interpreted as relating to whether an enactment that violates the Charter can give ever rise to Charter damages under s. 24(1), after a bill has become law and the legislative process is complete, then I would answer with a qualified yes. I would reject the Attorney General of Canadas call to overrule the limited immunity rule in Mackin and replace it with an absolute immunity. Instead, I would modify Mackin to clarify that the Crown can be liable in damages for the breach of Charter rights caused by legislation only when the legislation is shown to have been clearly unconstitutional at the time it was enacted. Bad faith and abuse of power are inappropriate thresholds for Crown liability in relation to the enactment of primary legislation. They would inevitably trench on parliamentary privilege and would threaten the separation of powers by requiring the courts to consider questions that are not justiciable. Nevertheless, some of the same facts that would be considered in evaluating whether the legislation is clearly unconstitutional, such as whether legislation has an unconstitutional purpose, could be said to relate to bad faith or an abuse of power. The difference is, when considering primary legislation, clearly unconstitutional is a justiciable standard that does not trench on parliamentary privilege, whereas bad faith and abuse of power are not justiciable standards and would trench on the privilege.\nThe Mackin Limited Immunity Standard\nIn Mackin, this Court had to decide whether provincial legislation abolishing the system of supernumerary judges and replacing it with a per diem system contravened the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence in s. 11(d) of the Charter and the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867, and if so, whether the Court should award damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter to the judges who challenged the legislation. Justice Gonthier, for a majority of the Court, approached the issue of whether Charter damages are available for the enactment or application of unconstitutional legislation by drawing on general principles of public law. He formulated a rule that would allow for damages only if there is conduct that is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power: \nAccording to a general rule of public law, absent conduct that is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power, the courts will not award damages for the harm suffered as a result of the mere enactment or application of a law that is subsequently declared to be unconstitutional (Welbridge Holdings Ltd. v. Greater Winnipeg, [1971] S.C.R. 957; Central Canada Potash Co. v. Government of Saskatchewan, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 42). In other words [i]nvalidity of governmental action, without more, clearly should not be a basis for liability for harm caused by the action (K. C. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise (1958), vol. 3, at p. 487). In the legal sense, therefore, both public officials and legislative bodies enjoy limited immunity against actions in civil liability based on the fact that a legislative instrument is invalid. [Emphasis in original; para. 78.]\nJustice Gonthier held that the legislation at issue in Mackin violated the guarantee of judicial independence, but rejected the claim for Charter damages. Applying the rule he had formulated allowing for Charter damages when legislation is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power, Gonthier J. saw no evidence that the provincial government knew about the unconstitutionality of the legislation or that it had acted negligently, in bad faith, or abused its powers in adopting the legislation (para. 82).\nThis Court Has Interpreted Mackin Inconsistently\nThis Courts subsequent decisions have interpreted Mackin inconsistently. At times, this Court has recognized that Mackin allows for damages or other remedies under s. 24(1) of the Charter for the enactment of unconstitutional primary legislation (see R. v. Demers, 2004 SCC 46, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 62; Canada (Attorney General) v. Hislop, 2007 SCC 10, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 429, at para. 102; Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia, 2020 SCC 13, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 678, at paras. 166-69). \nOn another occasion, this Court has cited Mackin for the opposite proposition, stating that well-established principles of public law rule out the possibility of awarding damages when legislation is declared unconstitutional . . . on the grounds of . . . non-compliance with the Canadian Charter (Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Communaute urbaine de Montreal, 2004 SCC 30, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 789, at para. 19). \nMost often, however, this Court has cited Mackin as holding that damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter are available for the enforcement of a law later declared unconstitutional only if the states conduct under the law was clearly wrong, in bad faith, or an abuse of power (see Ward, at paras. 39 and 43; Henry v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 24, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 214, at para. 124, per McLachlin C.J. and Karakatsanis J., concurring in the result; Ernst v. Alberta Energy Regulator, 2017 SCC 1, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 174, per McLachlin C.J. and Moldaver, Cote and Brown JJ., dissenting; Kosoian v. Societe de transport de Montreal, 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 335, at para. 71; Albashir, at para. 40). \nDespite this Courts inconsistent interpretation of Mackin, the decision cannot reasonably be interpreted as limited to post-enactment Crown conduct under a law. The reasons of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal leave no doubt that the case involved a claim for damages for the New Brunswick governments alleged bad faith in enacting an unconstitutional law (see Rice v. New Brunswick (1999), 235 N.B.R. (2d) 1, at paras. 54-55 and 59, per Ryan J.A. for the majority, and at paras. 73-74, per Drapeau J.A., concurring). In this Courts decision in Mackin, Justice Gonthier applied the standard of clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power to the government itself in adopting the legislation, and not simply to government conduct taken under the legislation (para. 82).\nBad Faith and Abuse of Power Are Inappropriate Standards for Awarding Charter Damages for Unconstitutional Primary Legislation\nThe Attorney General of Canada, as a party to this appeal, expressly asks this Court to overrule or limit the application of Mackin on this point. This Court can therefore entertain whether to do so (see R. v. McGregor, 2023 SCC 4, at para. 23). Several interveners also ask this Court to revisit Mackin, including the Attorneys General of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan, as well as the Speaker of the House of Commons and the Speaker of the Senate.\nI recognize that this Court should be very slow to accede to requests to overturn its prior decisions. The doctrine of precedent or stare decisis (we stand by the things that have been decided) is fundamental to the certainty and predictability on which our system of law depends (R. J. Sharpe, Good Judgment: Making Judicial Decisions (2018), at pp. 146-47). It is not enough to overturn precedent that a judge of this Court, or a different panel of this Court, happens to think that the earlier decision was wrongly decided (Plourde v. Wal-Mart Canada Corp., 2009 SCC 54, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 465, at para. 13; Sharpe, at p. 163). This Courts practice is against departing from its precedents unless there are compelling reasons to do so (R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 44). Such reasons can include where the prior decision overlooked binding authority or a relevant statute (a decision rendered per incuriam), has proven unworkable, or if its rationale has been eroded by significant societal or legal change (R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 202, per Cote, Brown and Rowe JJ., concurring in the result).\nIn my view, there are compelling reasons to revisit Mackin to provide appropriate clarification. None of the authorities cited in Mackin support awarding Charter damages against the Crown for harms caused by unconstitutional primary legislation. The test enunciated in Mackin also conflicts with the doctrine of parliamentary privilege, as well as the separation of powers and principles of justiciability. None of these points was argued in Mackin, and this Court did not consider them in its reasons. The limited immunity rule adopted in Mackin would, in my view, have been materially different had the Court considered these matters. \nNone of the Authorities Cited in Mackin Supports Awarding Charter Damages for Harm Arising From Unconstitutional Legislation\nIn Mackin, Justice Gonthier cited two pre-Charter cases, Welbridge Holdings Ltd. v. Greater Winnipeg, [1971] S.C.R. 957, and Central Canada Potash Co. v. Government of Saskatchewan, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 42, to ground the possibility of awarding Charter damages for unconstitutional legislation that is clearly wrong, in bad faith, or an abuse of power. With respect, neither case supports awarding Charter damages for injury caused by unconstitutional legislation. None of the principles or cases cited in Mackin address civil liability for enacting primary legislation (see Marcotte, at p. 86).\nIn Welbridge, this Court dismissed a claim for damages in negligence against a municipality for harm arising from a zoning by-law subsequently declared ultra vires. Justice Laskin, as he then was, stated that [i]t would be incredible to say in such circumstances that [the municipality] owed a duty of care giving rise to liability in damages for its breach (p. 969). As he noted: Invalidity is not the test of fault and it should not be the test of liability (p. 969 (citation omitted)). Welbridge dealt with potential civil liability flowing from a zoning by-law. The decision provides no basis for awarding Charter damages for unconstitutional primary legislation. \nIn Central Canada Potash, this Court dismissed a tort action against a government official alleging intimidation for threatening enforcement action under regulations later found to be ultra vires the province. Justice Martland held that the government was entitled to enforce the law unless it was found to be ultra vires. He said that it would be unfortunate, in a federal state such as Canada, if it were to be held that a government official, charged with the enforcement of legislation, could be held to be guilty of intimidation because of his enforcement of the statute whenever a statute whose provisions he is under a duty to enforce is subsequently held to be ultra vires (p. 90). The decision equally provides no basis for awarding Charter damages for unconstitutional primary legislation.\nIn Mackin, Gonthier J. also cited, at para. 78, Rene Dussault and Louis Borgeats leading treatise, Administrative Law: A Treatise (2nd ed. 1990), vol. 5, at p. 177, which states that [i]n our parliamentary system of government, Parliament or a legislature of a province cannot be held liable for anything it does in exercising its legislative powers. This text, on its face, plainly described an absolute, not a qualified, immunity (Marcotte, at p. 86). It does not support the rule in Mackin of limited immunity for the harms caused by unconstitutional primary legislation.\nAt the same time, I acknowledge that Mackin is not a case about parliamentary privilege. As noted above, parliamentary privilege was not argued by the parties or addressed by the Court. Justice Gonthiers reasons in Mackin simply did not address the impact of the rule he enunciated on parliamentary privilege. He drew on the general rule of public law that there is no state liability absent conduct that is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power, or, in French, [un] comportement clairement fautif, de mauvaise foi ou dabus de pouvoir. These are standards for the liability of public officials that had never previously been applied to primary legislation. This focus on the conduct of government officials taken under a law is also apparent in Gonthier J.s discussion of Guimond v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 347, to the effect that if the government and its representatives . . . act in good faith and without abusing their power under prevailing law and only subsequently are their acts found to be unconstitutional, they will not be liable (Mackin, at para. 79 (emphasis added)). \nAll these factors suggest that what is called for in the present circumstances is to clarify the scope of Mackin rather than to completely overrule it.\nBad Faith and Abuse of Power Are Inappropriate Thresholds for Charter Damages for Unconstitutional Primary Legislation\nThe bad faith and abuse of power thresholds in Mackin are inappropriate thresholds in respect of damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for unconstitutional primary legislation because they conflict with the doctrine of parliamentary privilege and principles of justiciability, and strain the separation of powers. The parties did not raise these matters in Mackin, nor did this Court consider them in its reasons. This has been criticized as being a significant oversight given the importance of these matters to this Courts jurisprudence, both before and after Mackin (Marcotte, at p. 87). \nAsking courts to adjudicate whether legislation has indicia of bad faith or an abuse of power, as part of an assessment under s. 24(1) of the Charter, would inevitably draw courts into judging the legislative process. It would also require courts to evaluate the substance of legislation based on criteria other than constitutionality, which are not justiciable and are therefore outside our proper role. In my view, the only appropriate threshold for awarding damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for the harms caused by unconstitutional primary legislation is when the legislation is clearly unconstitutional.  \nBad Faith and Abuse of Power as Thresholds for Charter Damages for Unconstitutional Primary Legislation Conflict With Established Categories of Parliamentary Privilege\nBad faith and abuse of power as thresholds for awarding Charter damages for unconstitutional legislation would draw the courts into evaluating the legislative process and would inevitably trench on the parliamentary privilege over freedom of speech and control by the Houses of Parliament over debates or proceedings.\nAt one level, it is of course impossible to evaluate the motives of a collective body such as the House of Commons or the Senate. As Binnie J. once wrote, [t]he motives of a legislative body composed of numerous persons are unknowable except by what it enacts (Consortium Developments (Clearwater) Ltd. v. Sarnia (City), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 45). A court cannot know the motives of Parliament or of a provincial or territorial legislature; it can only examine the content of the legislation they enact. \nThe doctrine of parliamentary privilege also prevents courts from passing judgment on the process of enacting legislation. Scrutinizing legislation for evidence of bad faith or abuse of power, even once the law has already been enacted, would inevitably pull the courts back into judging the legislative process which, as I explained under question one, is beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. The courts cannot put Parliament or a provincial or territorial legislature on trial. As the authorities establish, words, conduct, procedures, or anything that legitimately falls within the process of enacting legislation would be necessarily incidental or closely and necessarily related to proceedings in Parliament (Maingot (2016), at pp. 7 and 76). They are captured by the well-established categories of privilege over freedom of speech and debates and proceedings in Parliament. Matters within these established categories attract absolute immunity. As noted by Maingot, [w]hen part of parliamentary business, . . . whatever is said in the Senate or the House of Commons or in one of the committees is not actionable in the ordinary courts, whether or not it is said in good faith ((2016), at p. 31 (emphasis added)). Similarly, in an authority cited approvingly by this Court in Vaid, at para. 29(10), Prebble, Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated categorically (at p. 337): \n. . . their Lordships are on the view that parties to litigation, by whomsoever commenced, cannot bring into question anything said or done in the House by suggesting (whether by direct evidence, cross-examination, inference or submission) that the actions or words were inspired by improper motives or were untrue or misleading.\n(See also Duffy, at para. 64; Janssen-Ortho Inc. v. Amgen Canada Inc. (2005), 256 D.L.R. (4th) 407 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 78; Club Pro Adult Entertainment v. Ontario (2006), 150 C.R.R. (2d) 1 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 1-7 and 119, revd in part on other grounds 2008 ONCA 158, 42 B.L.R. (4th) 47; Rothmans Inc., at para. 31).\nOnce the focus moves from the legislative process to the content of primary legislation, different but equally insurmountable problems arise. Judging the content of legislation on a basis other than constitutionality, such as whether the legislation is in good faith or involves an abuse of power, raises non-justiciable questions and strains the separation of powers, which I address next.\nBad Faith and Abuse of Power as Standards for Awarding Charter Damages for Unconstitutional Primary Legislation Are Not Justiciable Questions and Strain the Separation of Powers\nJusticiability refers to a set of judge-made rules, norms and principles delineating the scope of judicial intervention in social, political and economic life (L. M. Sossin, Boundaries of Judicial Review: The Law of Justiciability in Canada (2nd ed. 2012), at p. 7, cited in Highwood Congregation of Jehovahs Witnesses (Judicial Committee) v. Wall, 2018 SCC 26, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 750, at para. 33; see also Bruker v. Marcovitz, 2007 SCC 54, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 607, at para. 41). It is first and foremost, a normative inquiry into the appropriateness as a matter of constitutional judicial policy of the courts deciding a given issue or, instead, deferring to other decision-making institutions (Canada (Auditor General), at pp. 90-91).\nA court may decline to answer a question on the ground of justiciability when doing so would take it beyond its proper constitutional role, or if the court cannot provide an answer within its area of expertise, such as its expertise in interpreting legislation or determining its constitutionality (Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), at p. 545; see also La Rose v. Canada, 2023 FCA 241, 488 D.L.R. (4th) 340, at paras. 24-36; Turner v. Canada, [1992] 3 F.C. 458 (C.A.), at pp. 460-62; Marcotte, at pp. 83-84). Writing before his appointment to the bench, Justice Cromwell explained that whether a question is justiciable may be determined according to both institutional and constitutional standards. It includes both the question of the adequacy of judicial machinery for the task as well as the legitimacy of using it (T. A. Cromwell, Locus Standi: A Commentary on the Law of Standing in Canada (1986), at p. 192 (emphasis added)).\nI obviously accept that the question of whether the conduct of government officials in implementing a law or policy is in bad faith or involves an abuse of power is a justiciable question. Courts routinely undertake such inquiries (see Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121, at p. 141; Finney v. Barreau du Quebec, 2004 SCC 36, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17, at para. 39; Hinse v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 35, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 621, at paras. 48-53). The question of whether legislation is constitutional is also justiciable.\nCourts also routinely examine the purpose of legislation in evaluating whether it infringes the Charter. As noted by Professors Hogg and Wright, [i]f the purpose of a law is to abridge a Charter right, then the law will be unconstitutional ( 36:13 (emphasis in original)). The leading authority on this point is R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 334, where Dickson J., as he then was, held that the Sunday observance legislation infringed the freedom of religion guarantee of the Charter because it had the unconstitutional purpose of compelling observance with the Christian Sabbath.\nThe difficulty arises, however, after legislation has been judged to be unconstitutional. At this point, asking the further questions of whether the legislation is in bad faith or constitutes an abuse of power inevitably requires the court to pass judgment on the content of the legislation on grounds other than its constitutionality, which strays into evaluating the wisdom or policy of the law and is not the proper role of the courts (see Reference re Anti-Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, at pp. 424-25; Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 496-99; R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 5; R. v. Clay, 2003 SCC 75, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 735, at para. 4; Hogg and Wright, at  12:8). Such matters are not justiciable. As Justice Lorne Sossin and Gerard Kennedy explain, [w]here the judgment of the legislature or executive branch is called into question, it falls to the electorate and the democratic process to resolve such disputes, not the courts ( 6:8). \nOnce legislation has been found to be unconstitutional, there is simply no legal yardstick to measure whether the legislation was in good faith or involved an abuse of power. Countenancing judicial assessment of such matters brings to mind the dictum of Professor Bora Laskin, before his appointment to the bench, that [l]aw at this point dissolves into politics (Case and Comment (1955), 33 Can. Bar Rev. 215, at p. 219).\nHansard Remains Available to Aid Statutory Interpretation When Determining the Constitutionality of Primary Legislation\nRemoving bad faith and abuse of power as criteria for awarding Charter damages under s. 24(1) does not mean that Hansard evidence is unavailable to aid statutory interpretation when determining the constitutionality of legislation, such as in determining whether legislation has the unconstitutional purpose of infringing a Charter right (see, for example, R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at paras. 88-91 and 98-99; Canada (Attorney General) v. Whaling, 2014 SCC 20, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 392, at paras. 66-69), or in determining whether legislation is constitutional on federalism grounds (see, for example, Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, 2020 SCC 17, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 283, at paras. 40-45). Using Hansard for this purpose does not seek to impugn speech or proceedings before Parliament, but rather seeks to give effect, whenever possible, to what was said or done there. \nAlthough this Court now generally permits the cautious use of Hansard in statutory interpretation, it has warned that the court [should be] mindful of the limited reliability and weight of [such] evidence (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 35; see also Sharma, at paras. 88-89). Marcotte helpfully notes that [t]his practice is not in tension with parliamentary privilege because it assists in interpreting Parliaments actions rather than frustrating its functions as a legislative and deliberative body (pp. 80-81). He cites in support Lord Browne-Wilkinsons speech in the House of Lords in Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v. Hart, [1993] A.C. 593, at p. 638, that [f]ar from questioning the independence of Parliament and its debates, the courts would, to the extent possible, be giving effect to what is said and done there. \nThe appropriate use of Hansard as proof of historical context or purpose in statutory interpretation must therefore be distinguished from its inappropriate use to prove that legislation is in bad faith. The former does not impugn the freedom of speech or the integrity of parliamentary proceedings; the latter does (see Marcotte, at p. 81).\nConclusion\nCourts cannot adjudge whether parliamentary conduct or speech in the legislative process or the content of legislation are in bad faith or involve an abuse of power. Such inquiries would infringe parliamentary privilege, threaten the separation of powers, and invite consideration of non-justiciable matters.\nThis leaves the question of whether the clearly wrong threshold in Mackin is an appropriate threshold for Charter damages under s. 24(1). In my view, the clearly wrong threshold is justiciable and can apply without diminishing parliamentary privilege, but should be modified to the standard of clearly unconstitutional. I address this issue next.\nClearly Unconstitutional Is the Only Appropriate Threshold for Awarding Charter Damages for Unconstitutional Primary Legislation\nAlthough bad faith and abuse of power are inappropriate standards for awarding damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter for unconstitutional primary legislation, a rule of absolute immunity is also inappropriate. Absolute immunity overshoots what is required to protect parliamentary privilege and the separation of powers. Both these constitutional imperatives can be respected by a test that focuses not on legislative inputs, which inevitably involves judging the legislative process, but on legislative outputs, namely whether the enactment itself clearly violated established constitutional norms at the time it was enacted. In my view, therefore, the central insight of Mackin remains good law: the state enjoys a limited, not absolute, immunity from liability in damages when unconstitutional legislation harms an individual. Such individuals may sue the Crown in right of Canada by taking proceedings in the name of the Attorney General of Canada for harms caused by clearly unconstitutional legislation.\nI will first discuss why an absolute state immunity from damages is untenable and then address the clearly unconstitutional standard.\nAbsolute State Immunity Is Inconsistent With the Broad Remedial Discretion of the Courts under Section 24(1) of the Charter\nSection 24(1) of the Charter gives the courts broad, remedial discretion to fashion meaningful remedies that they consider appropriate and just in the circumstances. In Mills, McIntyre J. observed that [i]t is difficult to imagine language which could give the court a wider and less fettered discretion (Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, at pp. 965-66; see also Ward, at para. 17; R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc., 2001 SCC 81, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575, at para. 18 (Dunedin Construction).\nEven so, the discretion under s. 24(1) of the Charter is not unfettered (Ward, at para. 19). As this Court has highlighted, an appropriate and just remedy . . . is one that meaningfully vindicates the rights and freedoms of the claimants and employ[s] means that are legitimate within the framework of our constitutional democracy (Doucet-Boudreau, at paras. 55-56 (emphasis added)). Courts must apply s. 24(1) to facilitate access to appropriate remedies, while respecting the existing jurisdictional scheme of the courts and not intruding on legislative powers more than necessary to achieve the aims of the Charter (Dunedin Construction, at para. 23). \nThe Attorney General of Canada urges an absolute state immunity from damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter, largely based on parliamentary privilege. Yet doing so would subordinate the broad remedial power of the courts under s. 24(1) to a blanket assertion of privilege. An absolute immunity is unnecessary because it would overshoot what is required to protect parliamentary privilege. As Warren Newman explains, parliamentary privilege is not a substantive end in itself, and must operate within  and never trump  the constitutional framework from which [parliamentary institutions] have emerged, and upon which they depend for their lawful authority and powers (p. 609). \nBoth the constitutional doctrine of parliamentary privilege and an individuals right to seek Charter damages under s. 24(1) can be protected by a test that focuses not on legislative inputs, that is, on speech or conduct in the legislative process, but rather on legislative outputs, as reflected in the text of the legislation. The former inevitably trenches on parliamentary privilege by inviting judicial scrutiny of speech and conduct in Parliament; the latter does not. Although courts often consider speech or conduct in the legislative process (such as speech recorded in Hansard) when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation, in such cases the courts are applying the justiciable standard of constitutionality, rather than the non-justiciable standard of whether the legislation is in bad faith or constitutes an abuse of power.\nOur countrys history highlights that laws themselves, rather than just conduct under laws, can cause significant harm to targeted individuals. For example, the so-called Chinese head tax imposed by An Act to restrict and regulate Chinese immigration into Canada, S.C. 1885, c. 71, s. 4, required every person of Chinese origin entering Canada to pay a fee or head tax solely because of their Chinese heritage. It is an example of legislated discrimination, rather than simply discriminatory state conduct under legislation. If absolute immunity for legislative enactments were upheld, a court would be barred from considering whether it could ever be just and appropriate to provide damages in similar circumstances today.\nAnother example highlights the dangers of a rule of absolute immunity. Consider hypothetical legislation mandating a person found guilty of shoplifting to be automatically subject to corporal punishment. This legislation would be manifestly unconstitutional, yet the absolute immunity rule sought by the Attorney General of Canada would categorically prevent the courts from awarding Charter damages to affected individuals, even if no other appropriate and just remedy were available. Faced with such a clear and serious Charter violation, the courts cannot be so restricted. Some may say that such an extreme hypothetical is unhelpful as it is unlikely to arise. I disagree. When the government seeks a rule giving it absolute immunity, as it does in this appeal, it is not only appropriate to test the rule with an extreme case, it is essential. \nUnlike absolute immunity, a qualified or limited immunity preserves the courts power under s. 24(1) to craft remedies that meaningfully vindicate Charter rights and freedoms, while ensuring that effective government is not jeopardized by overbroad state liability that trenches on parliamentary privilege. In the context of legislative enactments rather than state conduct under legislation, the clearly wrong or clearly unconstitutional threshold best advances both aims.\nThe Clearly Wrong or Clearly Unconstitutional Standard\nIt remains to consider the content of the clearly wrong standard in Mackin. In my view, the Crown may be liable in damages for harms caused by unconstitutional primary legislation when the impugned legislation was clearly wrong, in the sense that its unconstitutionality was readily or obviously demonstrable at the time of enactment and could not be subject to any serious debate. \nAt the outset, I recall this Courts instruction in Ward that [d]ifferent situations may call for different thresholds of liability under s. 24(1) of the Charter (para. 43). For example, in Guimond, in the context of governmental action, this Court asked whether there was evidence of wrongful conduct, bad faith, negligence or collateral purpose (para. 17). In cases involving damages for malicious prosecution, intentional misconduct or malice may be the proper threshold, while in instances of negligent police investigation, negligence may be apt (see Ward, at para. 43). \nThe Attorney General of Alberta argues that absent indistinguishable binding precedent on the constitutionality of an enactment, Charter damages for unconstitutional primary legislation will never be appropriate (I.F., at para. 22). The Attorney General of Ontario similarly says there must be binding authority that directly determines the constitutional issue, and allows for liability only if the defending government does not have a credible legal argument for distinguishing that authority (I.F., at paras. 3 and 19). These thresholds are overly restrictive. As the Court of Appeal for Ontario explained in Francis v. Ontario, 2021 ONCA 197, 154 O.R. (3d) 498, at para. 74, a government cannot turn a blind eye to overwhelming evidence of the unconstitutionality of its actions just because a court has yet to pronounce on that which is obvious. Professor Kent Roach similarly observes that [g]overnments should not aggressively fly into Charter danger zones simply on the basis that there is no decided case that indicates that what they proposed to do is unconstitutional. That type of behavior is corrosive to the rule of law (Constitutional Remedies in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at  11:20). I agree.\nIn my view, the appropriate standard for harms caused by an unconstitutional enactment is this: to overcome the good governance concerns at step three of the Ward framework, a claimant must show that the legislation was clearly unconstitutional in the sense that the unconstitutionality was readily or obviously demonstrable at the time the legislation was enacted and could not be subject to any serious debate. \nSuch a standard focuses on legislative outputs rather than legislative inputs. It allows claimants to advance Charter damages claims without having to struggle in discovery or be faced with claims of Cabinet or solicitor-client privilege in trying to discover what was in the subjective minds of Ministers and other key players when they enacted a law or refused to amend a law in the face of mounting Charter warnings (Roach, at  11:11). And it focuses on how the impugned legislation must be significantly wide of the constitutional mark before damages will be an appropriate and just remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter.\nI hasten to add that the clearly unconstitutional standard allows courts to consider whether legislation has an unconstitutional purpose as a factor in a damages assessment. As this Court recognized in Big M Drug Mart, legislation that has the purpose of infringing a Charter will be unconstitutional. Although I agree with Professors Hogg and Wright that Canadian legislative bodies rarely enact laws that have the purpose of abridging a Charter right (at  36:14), this possibility cannot be completely discounted. In cases where a legislature enacts legislation with the purpose of infringing a Charter right, courts can consider this fact in evaluating whether the legislation is clearly unconstitutional, and thus, in deciding whether damages are appropriate and just under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Assessing whether legislation has an unconstitutional purpose might well involve reviewing some of the same facts and referring to Hansard as would be involved in assessing whether legislation is in bad faith or involves an abuse of power. Those facts would, however, be used to measure the legislation against the justiciable standard of whether the legislation has a constitutional purpose, rather than against the non-justiciable standards of whether the legislation is in bad faith or involves an abuse of power.\nI am sensitive to the concerns of those who say the mere possibility of damages for unconstitutional legislation will chill the lawmaking function of Parliament and the provincial and territorial legislatures. They suggest it will cause lawmakers to be timid in discharging their responsibilities and lead to inaction on contentious issues for fear that laws will not pass constitutional muster. In my view, these concerns highlight why clearly unconstitutional is the proper threshold. As Professor Marilyn L. Pilkington has explained, since a primary purpose of imposing liability in damages is to deter unconstitutional acts, it makes sense to limit liability to those acts which are clearly unconstitutional (Damages as a Remedy for Infringement of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1984), 62 Can. Bar Rev. 517, at p. 558 (emphasis added)). \nOn the other hand, there will be those who say that the standard of clearly unconstitutional is too high. It will, they say, be too difficult for claimants to demonstrate that a law was clearly unconstitutional, and thus successful claims for Charter damages will be rare. In my view, clearly unconstitutional is an appropriately high but not insurmountable bar for claimants to meet. If an enactment was clearly unconstitutional at the time of enactment, this should be readily or obviously demonstrable.\nConclusion\nThe Crown enjoys an absolute immunity from damages under s. 24(1) of the Charter when preparing and drafting primary legislation later found to be unconstitutional. At the same time, the Crown has only a limited immunity from damages under s. 24(1) for harms flowing from clearly unconstitutional enactments. Clearly unconstitutional is a nuanced standard that appropriately protects parliamentary privilege as a rule of curial jurisdiction, while allowing recovery for harms caused by clearly unconstitutional legislation. It protects the autonomy of Parliament and the limited immunity necessary for legislators to carry out their work, while employing a purposive approach to s. 24(1) remedies to vindicate Charter rights.\nDisposition\nI would answer the two questions of law posed by the Attorney General of Canada as follows:\nQuestion: Can the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a proposed bill later enacted by Parliament, and declared invalid by a court under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982? \nAnswer: No.\nQuestion: Can the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for Parliament enacting a bill into law, which legislation was later declared invalid by a court under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982? \nAnswer: Yes.\nI would allow the appeal in part. I would grant costs to the respondent.\n\tThe reasons of Cote and Rowe JJ. were delivered by\n\tRowe J.  \nIn the words of Cicero, Hanc retinete, quaeso, Quirites, quam vobis tanquam hereditatem, majores vestry reliquerunt. In translation: Preserve, I beseech you, these liberties that your ancestors have left you as an inheritance. \nParliamentary privilege flows from pragmatism and historical practice, serving to protect freedoms that are necessary for the exercise of legislative authority (New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 319, at pp. 378-90; M. Rowe and M. Oza, Structural Analysis and the Canadian Constitution (2023), 101 Can. Bar Rev. 205). Though it dates from the earliest days of Canadas constitutional inheritance, parliamentary privilege is no less integral today than are other components of Canadas Constitution. \nThe protection of this privilege is essential for the public interest. This necessity is firmly established in this Courts jurisprudence. In New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 389, Justice McLachlin (as she then was) stated that it is fundamental to the working of government for the judicial branch not to overstep its bounds and to show proper deference for the legitimate sphere of activity of the other [branches]. This fundamental verity, however, requires more than acknowledgment: parliamentary privilege, and the constitutional scheme of which it is an integral component, must be preserved or else, perhaps unwittingly, we will undo the coherence, completeness, and integrity of that constitutional scheme, one on which this country has relied as it was formed, as it has grown, and as it has matured.  \nIn this appeal, the Court is to determine: first, whether the Crown in its executive capacity can be liable for damages under s. 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting legislation that is subsequently declared invalid pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and, second, whether the Crown in its executive capacity can be liable under s. 24(1) for Parliament enacting legislation later declared invalid pursuant to s. 52(1). Because the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation necessarily implicates parliamentary privilege, this Court must decide whether this privilege is compatible with such damages under s. 24(1). For the reasons that follow, I would hold that parliamentary privilege is fundamentally at odds with awarding damages against the Crown in the manner sought. As a consequence, I would allow the Crowns appeal.  \nMy conclusion follows from a simple premise: The Charter must, as a matter of constitutional law, be given effect in a manner that is compatible with parliamentary privilege. Because parliamentary privilege enjoys constitutional status it is not subject to the Charter, as are ordinary laws. As this Court said in Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 876, it is a well accepted principle that one part of the Constitution cannot be used to invalidate a provision in another part (para. 31). Both parliamentary privilege and the Charter constitute components of the Constitution of Canada. Neither one subordinates the other.  \nUnwritten components of Canadas Constitution, including parliamentary privilege, continue to fulfill a necessary role in Canadas constitutional order. This case is about two elements of parliamentary privilege: freedom of speech in Parliament, and the exclusive control the legislature has over its proceedings. Without these privileges, the legislature would not be able to freely do its work. The respondent calls on us to detract from these privileges, unmindful (or indifferent) of the effect this will have on the legislative function. But the unimpeded functioning of Parliament is not an anachronism; rather, it is foundational to liberal democracy.\nFramework of Analysis\nBefore considering the nature and role of parliamentary privilege, it is useful to situate it among other written and unwritten components of Canadas Constitution. After doing so, I explain the constitutional nature and origins of parliamentary privilege, and the function that it plays in Canadas contemporary constitutional order, including how it supports the parliamentary autonomy necessary for the legislature to carry out its work, structures the constitutional dialogue between Parliament and the courts, and undergirds the separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches. Parliamentary privilege, including the privileges related to free speech and proceedings in Parliament, has received considerable judicial attention; this jurisprudence instructs us as to the absolute nature of parliamentary privilege and the broad manner in which it is construed. \nParliamentary privilege is rooted in the earliest chapters of Canadas constitutional history, and reflects an inherited legacy of struggle between the Crown and Parliament in the United Kingdom, one that reaches back to Parliaments origins. The ancient lineage of this component of our constitutional order does not diminish its role or significance in the present day  the opposite is true. The passage of the Constitution Act, 1982 and the Charter modified Canadas constitutional structure in certain respects, most notably by qualifying the principle of Parliamentary supremacy that Canada had inherited from the U.K. But it did not displace other components of our constitutional order, including parliamentary privilege. As such, the present appeal requires this Court to give meaning to two components of Canadas Constitution  parliamentary privilege, and s. 24(1) of the Charter  in a compatible way. \nI conclude by explaining how absolute immunity in respect of the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation flows necessarily from the need for the Crown to be able to act freely in its legislative capacity to develop and adopt legislation. By this means the Charter and parliamentary privilege work together, neither subordinating the other. This absolute immunity has an end point. It is when legislation has been enacted. Laws and their implementation are always open to challenge before the courts. Parliamentary privilege does not insulate laws and their implementation from judicial scrutiny; rather it does so for the process of developing and adopting legislation. Judges can no more oversee the consideration of legislation then can members of Parliament oversee the preparation of our judgments. The Crowns appeal should be allowed, and the questions posed to this Court answered in the negative. \nThe Structural Foundations of Parliamentary Privilege \nThe Canadian Constitution consists of written and unwritten components. They set out how sovereign authority is constituted, who can exercise that authority, for what purposes, by which means, and with what limitations. The written constitution is defined in s. 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 to include:\n(a) the Canada Act 1982, including this Act;\n\n(b) the Acts and orders referred to in the schedule; and\n\n(c) any amendment to any Act or order referred to in paragraph (a) or (b).\nSection 52(2) refers to the Constitution as the instruments that are constitutional in nature. It does not refer to all of the constitutional arrangements by which Canada is governed. \nCanadas constitutional arrangements (aside from Aboriginal and treaty rights) consist of four components:\n\n(1)\tConstitution Acts of 1867 and 1982;\n(2)\tconstitutional conventions;\n(3)\tCrown prerogative; and \n(4)\tparliamentary privilege.\nIn addition, there are underlying (unwritten) principles that contribute to giving effect to Canadas constitutional arrangements. These principles are not themselves components of the Constitution. Rather, they assist in: (a) interpreting the Constitution, e.g., in the Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3 (P.E.I. Judges Reference), where the principles of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary assisted in interpreting s. 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867; and (b) arriving at answers to questions not otherwise provided for in the Constitution, the leading example being the Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217 (Secession Reference), in which the Court had regard to the principles of democracy, federalism and the protection of minorities in order to describe the conditions under which a province could secede from Confederation. These underlying/unwritten principles do not have a substantive policy content. Rather, in their interpretative role (P.E.I. Judges Reference) and their gap-filling role (Secession Reference) they are ascertained from the relationship between the institutions of the state and, having been so ascertained, they are used to give further definition to those relationships. This method of reasoning, though the Court did not use this term, is structural analysis. As was confirmed in Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 845, these underlying/unwritten principles cannot be the basis to challenge the validity of legislation. This is because, while being descriptive of the Constitution, they are not themselves components of the Constitution.2 \nNorms expressed in the underlying/unwritten principles of constitutionalism and the rule of law do not constitute a basis to override parliamentary privilege, any more than they can constitute a basis to invalidate legislation; instead, such principles are to be understood in light of constitutional structures, including those governing the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. Parliamentary privilege is foremost amongst these structures. \nReturning to the unwritten components of the Constitution, conventions, Crown prerogative and parliamentary privilege are no less a part of the Constitution than are the two Constitution Acts. This was recognized in New Brunswick Broadcasting, as well as in the Secession Reference. While parliamentary sovereignty and the separation of powers (plus constitutionalism and the rule of law) are underlying/unwritten principles that inform interpretation of the constituent components of the Constitution, parliamentary privilege is different in that it is itself part of the Constitution. This distinction is fundamental.\nParliamentary privilege was inherited from the U.K. The framing of the Constitution Act, 1867, and the third resolution of the Quebec Conference of 1864, which laid out the framework for the Constitution Act, 1867 specifically, made clear that a key objective of Confederation was to give effect to the Westminster system (Rowe and Oza, at p. 210). This resolution spoke to the linkages in the eyes of the framers between the promotion of the best interests of the people of these Provinces and their desire to follow the model of the British Constitution, so far as our circumstances will permit (Quebec Resolutions, clause 3).\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 established that this privilege, which was and remains essential to the operation of the largely unwritten constitution of the U.K., would also be part of Canadas Constitution; the preamble states that Canada will have a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom. Thereby, parliamentary privilege, along with constitutional conventions and Crown prerogative, became unwritten components of the Canadian Constitution. In addition to what was set out in the preamble, parliamentary privilege was also specifically dealt with in s. 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which provides that [t]he privileges, immunities, and powers to be held, enjoyed, and exercised by the Senate and by the House of Commons, and by the members thereof respectively, shall be such as are from time to time defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada. Thus, in this belt-and-suspenders approach (the preamble, plus s. 18), parliamentary privilege was from the outset a component of Canadas Constitution and continues to be so today.  \nThis Courts reasons in Secession Reference affirm the importance of the unwritten components of the Constitution: \nThe Constitution of Canada . . . includes the constitutional texts enumerated in s. 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Although these texts have a primary place in determining constitutional rules, they are not exhaustive. The Constitution also embraces unwritten, as well as written rules . . . . [T]he Constitution of Canada includes \n\nthe global system of rules and principles which govern the exercise of constitutional authority in the whole and in every part of the Canadian state.\n\nThese supporting principles and rules, which include constitutional conventions and the workings of Parliament, are a necessary part of our Constitution because problems or situations may arise which are not expressly dealt with by the text of the Constitution. In order to endure over time, a constitution must contain a comprehensive set of rules and principles which are capable of providing an exhaustive legal framework for our system of government. Such principles and rules emerge from an understanding of the constitutional text itself, the historical context, and previous judicial interpretations of constitutional meaning. [para. 32]\nThat our Constitution embraces unwritten, as well as written rules (P.E.I. Judges Reference, at para. 92) reflects this Courts understanding of an architecture of the institutions of state and of their relationship to citizens based on certain underlying principles (para. 93; Toronto (City), at para. 49, per Wagner C.J. and Brown J.). These rules have full legal force and may give rise to substantive legal obligations (Secession Reference, at para. 54, quoting Reference re Resolution to Amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753, at p. 845; Toronto (City), at para. 49, per Wagner C.J. and Brown J.).\nUnwritten components of our Constitution  including parliamentary privilege  have continued to be given faithful effect (see, e.g., Alford v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 ONCA 306, at para. 46 (CanLII), describing the independence of Parliament from executive and judicial interference as one of the basic principles of Canadian democracy). This is because, as I explain below, they continue to play a crucial role in Canadas constitutional order. \nWhat Is Parliamentary Privilege?\nChief among the functions of parliamentary privilege is that it ensures that Parliament and provincial legislatures are able to carry out their work effectively. I return to this point in the section that follows, but first I examine here the scope and content of parliamentary privilege, including the privileges associated with free speech and proceedings, as well as the consideration of these privileges in the courts of this country and the U.K. Because the appeal at bar requires this Court to consider the impact of the proposed view of liability under s. 24(1) on the privileges associated with Parliament, I focus in these reasons on the judicial and academic treatment of the privileges associated with the federal legislature, rather than those attaching to the provincial legislatures. \nAs described in Erskine Mays Treatise on The Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament (25th ed. 2019), at p. 239:\nParliamentary privilege is the sum of certain rights enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament and by Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions, and which exceed those possessed by other bodies or individuals.\nAs noted above, legislatures in Canada were modelled on the British Parliament, and like it, they enjoy certain privileges. In the U.K., parliamentary privilege developed through the struggle of the House of Commons for independence from the other branches of government, i.e., the Crown and the other courts (Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du Quebec, 2018 SCC 39, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687, at para. 22). \nThe struggle has deep historical roots in the hard-won independence of Parliament. Initially, the Crown and the courts showed no hesitation to intrude into the sphere of the Houses of Parliament. . . . For example, in 1629, Charles I had Sir John Eliot and two other members charged and imprisoned for sedition for words spoken in debate in the House (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 344, per Lamer C.J.; see also Rowe and Oza, at p. 225). \nBut the inaction in response to violations of Parliaments privileges was not to last; by 1641, Parliament was resolved. The King, determined to crush dissent in the Commons, ordered the arrest of five members and of one of the Lords. The Lords refused to order the arrests. On January 4, 1642, the King went to the Commons and demanded that the House produce the fugitive members:\n. . . [the King] did what none of his predecessors had ever dared do: he went to the House of Commons with three or four hundred armed men. One who was present that day described the scene: \n\nThen the Kinge steped upp to his place and stood upon the stepp, but sate not doun in the [Speakers] chaire. And, after hee had looked a greate while, hee told us, hee would not breake our priviledges, but treason had noe priviledge; hee came for those five gentlemen, for hee expected obedience yeasterday, and not an answere. Then hee calld [two of the members], by name, but noe answere was made. Then hee asked the Speaker if they were heere, or where they were. \n\nUppon that the Speaker fell on his knees, and desired his excuse, for hee was a servant to the House, and had neither eyes, nor tongue, to see or say anything but what they commanded him. Then the King told him, hee thought his owne eyes were as good as his, and then said his birds were flowen . . . . [First text in brackets in original.] \n\n(J. Trueman, Britain: The Growth of Freedom (1960), at pp. 250-51)\nThis violation of parliamentary privilege triggered the English Civil War.\nThough the English Civil War and the events that preceded it are far behind us, parliamentary privilege, and conventions such as those that deal with the operation of Cabinet, continue to represent foundational rules that deal with practical problems (M. Rowe and M. Collins, The Constitution of Canada (2017-18), 49 Ottawa L. Rev. 93, at p. 98). \nIn Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 667, this Court considered the nature and role of parliamentary privilege in detail, in the context of a human rights commission complaint by an employee of the House of Commons who alleged that he had been dismissed on the basis of race, colour, and national or ethnic origin. The Speaker of the House of Commons challenged the jurisdiction of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, based on the view that the Speakers power to hire, manage, and dismiss employees fell under the scope of parliamentary privilege and, thus, outside of the Commissions jurisdiction. Although the Court rejected the Speakers privilege claim, because the Speaker was unable to establish that a privilege related to management of employees covered the case in question, Justice Binnie clarified that [t]he purpose of privilege is to recognize Parliaments exclusive jurisdiction to deal with complaints within its privileged sphere of activity (para. 4 (emphasis in original)). Parliamentary privilege, therefore, is one of the ways in which the fundamental constitutional separation of powers is respected (para. 21). As such, Justice Binnie held that the court below was in error to focus on the grounds on which the asserted privileged was exercised, rather than whether the privilege itself had been established. I emphasize this distinction made by Justice Binnie. I am in full agreement.\nAlthough the substance of the asserted privilege in Vaid differs greatly from the free speech and control proceedings privileges at issue in this case, both of which are widely recognized and the existence of which is not contested by the respondent, Justice Binnies reasons notably summarized a number of propositions that are now accepted both by the courts and by the parliamentary experts, several of which are of particular relevance for the present appeal (at para. 29): \n2. Parliamentary privilege in the Canadian context is the sum of the privileges, immunities and powers enjoyed by the Senate, the House of Commons and provincial legislative assemblies, and by each member individually, without which they could not discharge their functions . . . . \n\n3. Parliamentary privilege does not create a gap in the general public law of Canada but is an important part of it, inherited from the Parliament at Westminster by virtue of the preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 and in the case of the Canadian Parliament, through s. 18 of the same Act . . . .\n\n. . .\n\n5. The historical foundation of every privilege of Parliament is necessity. If a sphere of the legislative bodys activity could be left to be dealt with under the ordinary law of the land without interfering with the assemblys ability to fulfill its constitutional functions, then immunity would be unnecessary and the claimed privilege would not exist . . . .\n\n. . .\n\n7. Necessity in this context is to be read broadly. The time-honoured test, derived from the law and custom of Parliament at Westminster, is what the dignity and efficiency of the House require . . . . [T]he references to dignity and efficiency are also linked to autonomy. A legislative assembly without control over its own procedure would, said Lord Ellenborough C.J. almost two centuries ago, sink into utter contempt and inefficiency . . . . Inefficiency would result from the delay and uncertainty would inevitably accompany external intervention. Autonomy is therefore not conferred on Parliamentarians merely as a sign of respect but because such autonomy from outsiders is necessary to enable Parliament and its members to get their job done. \n\n8. Proof of necessity may rest in part in shewing that it has been long exercised and acquiesced in (Stockdale v. Hansard, at p. 1189). . . .\n\n9. Proof of necessity is required only to establish the existence and scope of a category of privilege. Once the category (or sphere of activity) is established, it is for Parliament, not the courts, to determine whether in a particular case the exercise of the privilege is necessary or appropriate. In other words, within categories of privilege, Parliament is the judge of the occasion and manner of its exercise and such exercise is not reviewable by the courts: Each specific instance of the exercise of a privilege need not be shown to be necessary (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 343 . . .). \n\n. . .\n\n10. Categories include freedom of speech . . .; control by the Houses of Parliament over debates or proceedings in Parliament (as guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of 1689) including day-to-day procedure in the House . . .; [and] immunity of members from subpoenas during a parliamentary session . . . . Such general categories have historically been considered to be justified by the exigencies of parliamentary work. [Emphasis deleted.]\nThe application of these established propositions led Justice Binnie to conclude that a two-step process applies when courts are confronted with a privilege claim. First, the court must assess whether the existence and scope of the claimed privilege have been authoritatively established (Vaid, at para. 39). If the privilege is so established, then the courts inquiry stops, without further inquiry into the necessity of the privilege or the merits of its exercise in the particular case (Duffy v. Canada (Senate), 2020 ONCA 536, 151 O.R. (3d) 489, at para. 33, citing Vaid). The second step, which is not relevant in this appeal given the established nature of the privileges in question, requires the court to assess whether the privilege is so closely and directly connected with the fulfilment by the assembly or its members of their functions as a legislative and deliberative body . . . that outside interference would undermine the level of autonomy required to enable the assembly and its members to do their work with dignity and efficiency (Vaid, at para. 46; see also Duffy, at para. 33). I emphasize the implications of parliamentary privilege for the boundaries of judicial scrutiny of the asserted privilege in this appeal. \nThe Constitutional Function of Parliamentary Privilege\nDespite the constitutional nature of parliamentary privilege, one might be tempted to see it as a historical artifact that can safely be diminished to accommodate s. 24(1) damages, as urged on us by the respondent. To the contrary, courts have long recognized the critical constitutional function of parliamentary privilege. In this regard, I would note the constitutional functions relating to parliamentary autonomy, structuring the constitutional dialogue, and undergirding the separation of powers.\nParliamentary Autonomy\nAs I observed in Chagnon, at para. 65: \nParliamentary privilege is one of the ways in which the fundamental constitutional separation of powers is respected (Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 667, at para. 21).\nParliamentary privilege ensures that the legislature is safeguarded from interference by the other two branches of the state, the executive and the judiciary. It protects the operation of the legislature from outside interference, where such interference would impede the fulfillment of [Parliaments] constitutional role (Chagnon, at para. 65).\nAs this Court held in Vaid, intervention by the executive or by the courts in the working of legislatures would inevitably create delays, disruption, uncertainties and costs which would hold up the nations business and on that account would be unacceptable (para. 20). Protection from such interventions is reflected in the test for parliamentary privilege, which asks whether the privilege asserted is necessary for the legislature to do its work. Necessity in this context is to be read broadly (para. 29). The time-honoured test, derived from the law and custom of Parliament at Westminster, is what the dignity and efficiency of the House require (para. 29(7)):\nIf a matter falls within this necessary sphere of matters without which the dignity and efficiency of the House cannot be upheld, courts will not inquire into questions concerning such privilege. All such questions will instead fall to the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislative body. \n\n(New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 383)\nIt is for this reason that [t]he idea of necessity is thus linked to the autonomy required by legislative assemblies and their members to do their job (Vaid, at para. 29(4)). But, the courts role ends when it describes the four corners of parliamentary privilege. Having described the box, courts have always understood that it is not their role to take the cover off the box and reach inside it.\nCanadian courts have also considered the degree of autonomy required for Parliament to do its work. This approach is illustrated in Janssen-Ortho Inc. v. Amgen Canada Inc. (2005), 256 D.L.R. (4th) 407 (Ont. C.A.), which concerned a question in the House of Commons based on allegedly libellous broadcasts. In that case, the court dealt with what was properly the work of a legislator, potential interference in internal matters of the House, as well as the potential for delay, disruption, and uncertainty in upholding the decision of the motions judge to strike the claim for defamation arising from statements in the House (para. 78).  \nStructuring the Constitutional Dialogue\nParliamentary privilege also structures the dialogue between the courts and the legislature. By delineating the scope of what is open to review, this privilege ensures that legislatures are able to respond to decisions in which courts exercise their role to give meaning to the Constitution, and where necessary, invalidate legislation. As Justice R. J. Sharpe explained in Good Judgment: Making Judicial Decisions (2018):\n. . . judicial decisions striking down laws under the Charter rarely end the debate. More often than not, Parliament or the legislature is free to enact another law that has the same objective but that pays proper heed to the fundamental right or freedom at issue. [p. 245]\nOn the dialogue metaphor, Justice Sharpe then wrote:\nWhat the dialogue metaphor describes is less like a conversation and more like a complex division of labour where each branch has its own distinct, though complementary, role to play in a joint enterprise. I suggest that the dialogue is the sort of conversation one can imagine between an architect and an engineer on the design and construction of a building. They both have their own distinctive role and expertise, but they must work together, and the building will not be built without a dialogue between the two of them.\n\n(p. 248, quoting A. Kavanagh, The Lure and the Limits of Dialogue (2016), 66 U.T.L.J. 83, at p. 120.)\nThe dialogical nature of constitutional development in Canada is reflected in the second look cases in which this Court has wrestled with what weight to afford Parliaments attempt to reformulate legislation in response to a decision under s. 52(1). One might compare the perspective of Justices McLachlin (as she then was) and Iacobucci in R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at para. 58, wherein they expressed the view that the [c]ourts do not hold a monopoly on the protection and promotion of rights and freedoms with how Chief Justice McLachlin expressed the view subsequently in Sauve v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer), 2002 SCC 68, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 519, at para. 17: The healthy and important promotion of a dialogue between the legislature and the courts should not be debased to a rule of if at first you dont succeed, try, try again. In Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp., 2007 SCC 30, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, she further held (at para. 11) that [t]he mere fact that the legislation represents Parliaments response to a decision of this Court does not militate for or against deference. Consistent in Chief Justice McLachlins consideration of the second look cases is the principle that Parliament should not be discouraged from trying again to reformulate legislation so that it is consistent with the Charter.\nUndergirding the Separation of Powers\nRespect for the separation of powers precludes judicial scrutiny of the legislative process. The separation of powers underpins the Westminster system (Rowe and Oza, at p. 226; see also M. Rowe, C. Puskas and A. Cruise, The Separation of Powers in Canada (2024), 1 S.C.L.R. (3d) 323). Parliamentary privilege accords with the operation of the separation of powers: it grants the legislative branch of government the autonomy it requires to perform its constitutional functions, and, [b]y shielding some areas of legislative activity from external review, [it] helps preserve the separation of powers (Chagnon, at para. 1). Parliamentary privilege is one of the ways in which the fundamental constitutional separation of powers is respected (Vaid, at para. 21; Chagnon, at para. 65).\nThe principle of separation of powers, as highlighted in the U.K. in R. (on the application of SC and others) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, [2021] UKSC 26, [2022] 3 All E.R. 95, at para. 165, is characterized as follows:\n. . . so far as relating to the courts and Parliament, [it] requires each of them to abstain from interference with the functions of the other, and to treat each others proceedings and decisions with respect. It follows that it is no part of the function of the courts under our constitution to exercise a supervisory jurisdiction over the internal procedures of Parliament.\nThe doctrine of justiciability, a set of largely judge-made rules, norms and principles delineating the scope of judicial intervention in social, political and economic life, is noteworthy insofar as it reflects the recognition on the part of the courts of the need to respect the boundaries of judicial power where they run up against the operation of the legislatures (L. M. Sossin and G. Kennedy, Boundaries of Judicial Review: The Law of Justiciability in Canada (3rd ed. 2024), at  1:2).The doctrine recognizes that not every subject is suitable for judicial determination, and imposes limits on the reach of judicial oversight: \n. . . the legislative branch, so long as it observes the constitutional norms prescribed by the Constitution Act may exercise its legislative power in any manner it chooses. The courts may review legislation in relation to constitutional limitations on legislative power, but may not review it to test its intrinsic merit. The courts will not concern themselves with the wisdom of legislation or the possibility of abuse of legislative power. \n\n(B. L. Strayer, The Canadian Constitution and the Courts: The Function and Scope of Judicial Review (3rd ed. 1988), at pp. 219-20)\nThe separation of powers has been repeatedly affirmed as a constitutional principle (P.E.I. Judges Reference, at para. 138; Wells v. Newfoundland, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 52; Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 107; Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, at paras. 3 and 10, all cited by Cote J. in References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 175, at para. 279).\nIn my reasons in Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Governor General in Council), 2018 SCC 40, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 765, I wrote about the risk of the courts being drawn into a supervisory role over the legislative process:\nAs surely as night follows day, if such a duty were to be imposed, disagreements would arise as to the foregoing questions and many others. How would such disagreements be resolved? Where a constitutionally mandated duty exists, affected parties would inevitably turn to the courts. Thus, courts would be drawn into a supervisory role as to the operation of a duty to consult in the preparation of legislation (as well as, in all likelihood, other matters, notably budgets, requiring approval by the legislature). I agree with Justice Browns discussion on the impact of imposing a duty to consult on the separation of powers. [para. 169] \nThe same concern holds true with respect to subordinating parliamentary privilege in order to impose s. 24(1) damages for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation.  \nParliamentary Privilege Is Absolute in Nature and Has Been Broadly Construed \nThroughout these reasons, I refer to parliamentary privilege to refer to these certain rights with which the House of Commons and the Senate are endowed. However it is helpful to specify the privileges that have been invoked by the Attorney General of Canada: the Houses exclusive control over its proceedings, often referred to as the privilege bearing on proceedings in Parliament, and the privilege related to freedom of speech (A.F., at para. 58). As such, I explain here the meaning and application of these privileges, which have been extensively examined by courts in Canada and in the U.K. This judicial consideration has shown that parliamentary privilege is absolute in nature, and broadly construed in light of the function it plays in Canadas constitutional arrangements.  \nFree Speech and Proceedings\nThe parliamentary privileges related to free speech and control of proceedings are both well established  there is no serious debate today that each has been long exercised and acquiesced in (Stockdale v. Hansard (1839), 9 Ad. & E. 1, 112 E.R. 1112 (Q.B.), at p. 1189). They are rooted in art. 9 of the Bill of Rights of 1689 (Eng.), 1 Will. & Mar. Sess. 2, c. 2, which established that [t]he freedom of speech and debates, or proceedings in Parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament (J. P. J. Maingot, Parliamentary Privilege in Canada (2nd ed. 1997), at p. 77). As noted by Sir William Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (17th ed. 1830), Book I, at pp. 162-63, whatever matter arises concerning either house of parliament ought to be examined, discussed, and adjudged in that house to which it relates, and not elsewhere.\nCanadas Parliament has claimed these privileges for itself, as provided by s. 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (see H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at paras. V-1.217 and V-1.226). Parliaments decision to claim the full extent of the privileges enjoyed by the Parliament in London removes any doubt that these privileges apply in the present appeal:\n4 The Senate and the House of Commons, respectively, and the members thereof hold, enjoy and exercise \n\n(a) such and the like privileges, immunities and powers as, at the time of the passing of the Constitution Act, 1867, were held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and by the members thereof, in so far as is consistent with that Act; and \n\n(b) such privileges, immunities and powers as are defined by Act of the Parliament of Canada, not exceeding those, at the time of the passing of the Act, held, enjoyed and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom and by the members thereof.\n\n(Parliament of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-1, s. 4)\nThat Parliament opted to claim the full extent of these privileges is unsurprising. As Justice McLachlin (as she then was) noted, in New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 385 [t]he need for the right of freedom of speech is so obvious as to require no comment. And yet, as shown by this case, the need for freedom of speech in Parliament does require not just comment, but firm, resounding, and unequivocal confirmation. Confident legislative assemblies are cradles of popular liberty; timorous ones are instrumentalities of control by the well-situated. \nIn cases where the extent of parliamentary privileges has been raised, courts have consistently interpreted them broadly. In New Brunswick Broadcasting, Justice McLachlin (as she then was) held that [i]t has also long been accepted that these privileges must be held absolutely and constitutionally if they are to be effective; the legislative branch of our government must enjoy a certain autonomy which even the Crown and the courts cannot touch (p. 379 (emphasis added)). \nIn Duffy, at paras. 66-68 and 112-13, the Court of Appeal for Ontario considered a claim by a member of the Senate alleging that representatives of the Prime Ministers Office and individual senators improperly interfered with a Senate investigation into his expenses. The Senate moved to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction, arguing that the impugned conduct fell within its established parliamentary privileges related to discipline and internal affairs, Parliamentary proceedings, and freedom of speech. In concluding that the action was properly dismissed, Jamal J.A. (as he then was), found that Senator Duffys allegations about political interference in the Senates internal investigation and the decision to suspend him fell within the established privilege over proceedings in Parliament and that as a consequence the courts ha[d] no jurisdiction to evaluate their propriety, fairness, or legality (para. 61). \nThe privilege of freedom of speech also applied, Jamal J.A. wrote, because \n[w]hile taking part in [proceedings in Parliament], officers of Parliament, Members of Parliament, and the public are immune from being called to account in the courts or elsewhere, save the Houses of Parliament, for any act done or words uttered in the course of participating, however false or malicious the act and however malicious the words might be; and any member of the public prejudicially affected is without redress. [Text in brackets in original.]\n\n(para. 65, quoting J. P. J. Maingot, Parliamentary Immunity in Canada (2016), at pp. 71-72.) \nI adopt this statement by Jamal J.A. It identifies with clarity the need for immunity by Parliament from interference by courts in the proceedings of Parliament, even where those proceedings are alleged to be tainted by falsehood or malice. It also underscores the reason why, as noted by Maingot, the freedom of speech privilege,\nthough of a personal nature, is not so much intended to protect the Members against prosecutions for their own individual advantage, but to support the rights of the people by enabling their representatives to execute the functions of their office without fear of either civil or criminal prosecutions. [p. 26] \nThe functional explanation provided by Maingot illustrates the fallacy in the respondents suggestion that s. 24(1) liability against the Crown (rather than individual parliamentarians) does not raise parliamentary privilege concerns. In either case, it is the ability of parliamentarians to carry out their work effectively that is at issue. \nIn Ontario v. Rothmans Inc., 2014 ONSC 3382, 120 O.R. (3d) 467, the court considered a claim by a defendant tobacco company that statements about the risks of smoking before House of Commons committees could not be relied upon to support allegations of misrepresentation and conspiracy. At issue was whether the parliamentary privilege related to freedom of speech extended to members of the public appearing before Parliamentary committees. In concluding that the parliamentary privilege did so apply, the court noted that while questions may arise about the precise scope of the privilege from time to time, it is clear from the authorities that, at minimum, statements made by a person in the course of participating in a parliamentary proceeding cannot be used against that person in a civil action (para. 20). The absolute nature of the protection shields statements made by a person during the course of parliamentary proceedings from being used against them in a civil action (para. 14, quoting Janssen-Ortho Inc. v. Amgen Canada Inc., 2004 CanLII 8595 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 31). \nCanadian and Commonwealth courts have elsewhere determined that the following elements are under the umbrella of proceedings in Parliament:\nFormal action by the House (see Vaid, at para. 29(10); Duffy, at para. 59; Club Pro Adult Entertainment Inc. v. Ontario (2006), 150 C.R.R. (2d) 1 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 119, revd in part on other grounds 2008 ONCA 158, 42 B.L.R. (4th) 47); \nFormal interventions by members (including introducing legislation, voting, debates) (see Duffy, at paras. 59-61; Canada (Board of Internal Economy) v. Boulerice, 2019 FCA 33, [2019] 3 F.C.R. 145, at paras. 104-11; Prebble v. Television New Zealand Ltd., [1994] 3 All E.R. 407 (P.C.), at p. 413);\nTestimony of witnesses (see Gagliano v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FC 576, [2005] 3 F.C.R. 555, at paras. 62-97; Canada (Deputy Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police) v. Canada (Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2007 FC 564, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 752, at para. 65); and\nIncidental documents or actions which include those related to the consideration of draft legislation (see Vaid, at para. 44; Guergis v. Novak, 2022 ONSC 3829, at paras. 75-77 (CanLII)). \nAlso captured in this definition of proceedings are matters taking place outside of Parliament provided that they are so closely and directly connected with proceedings in Parliament that intervention by the courts would be inconsistent with Parliaments sovereignty as a legislative and deliberative assembly (Vaid, at para. 44 (emphasis deleted), quoting U.K., Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, vol. 1, Report and Proceedings of the Committee (1999), at para. 247).\nThis brief canvass of judicial consideration of the free speech and proceedings privileges shows that courts have recognized that the broad shelter afforded by the operation of parliamentary privilege is agnostic towards the content of what is protected. It matters not what was said or what the impugned conduct involved  what matters is whether the conduct in question relates to the assemblys ability to fulfill its constitutional functions (Vaid, at para. 29(5)). The wide berth afforded to Parliaments control over its own proceedings and speech is reflected in the broad manner in which they have been construed by Canadian courts, and the deference towards their operation shown by the courts. \nThe Scope of the Parliamentary Privileges  \nThe privileges related to free speech and proceedings in Parliament are well established, and constitutional in nature. However, the question remains  how far do these privileges extend? And do they reach the actions of ministers and officials who would ordinarily be considered to be part of the executive branch as they prepare and draft legislation? \nThis Courts jurisprudence provides an answer: parliamentary privilege attaches to the entire process through which legislation is developed and adopted, and protects ministers and officials when they carry out legislative duties. \nIn Vaid, Justice Binnie confirmed that parliamentary privilege extends to control by the Houses of Parliament over debates or proceedings in Parliament, including day-to-day procedure in the House (para. 29(10)). Mikisew Cree further clarifies that parliamentary privilege also extends to the law-making process more broadly (para. 37, per Karakatsanis J., paras. 122-26, per Brown J., and paras. 165(g) and 171, per Rowe J.).\nMikisew Cree affirmed that [t]he process of law-making does not only take place in Parliament. Rather, it begins with the development of legislation  and notably, for the purposes of the present appeal insofar as it considers liability attaching to the process of developing legislation, Justice Karakatsanis confirmed that [w]hen ministers develop legislation, they act in a parliamentary capacity (para. 2). So, despite an inevitable overlap between executive and legislative functions inherent in the work of Ministers in developing legislation, because they are engaged in the law-making process when they develop legislation, the process is generally protected from judicial oversight (paras. 33-34). \nThough the Court in Mikisew Cree was divided on the reasoning, seven of the nine members of the Court either wrote or concurred in reasons affirming that the preparation and drafting of legislation implicates the separation of powers and is protected from judicial review by parliamentary privilege. In her reasons, which were joined in by Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Gascon, Justice Karakatsanis held that:\nTwo constitutional principles  the separation of powers and parliamentary sovereignty  dictate that it is rarely appropriate for courts to scrutinize the law-making process. The process of law-making does not only take place in Parliament. Rather, it begins with the development of legislation. When ministers develop legislation, they act in a parliamentary capacity. As such, courts should exercise restraint when dealing with this process. Extending the duty to consult doctrine to the legislative process would oblige the judiciary to step beyond the core of its institutional role and threaten the respectful balance between the three pillars of our democracy. It would also transpose a consultation framework and judicial remedies developed in the context of executive action into the distinct realm of the legislature. Thus, the duty to consult doctrine is ill-suited to the law-making process; the law-making process does not constitute Crown conduct that triggers the duty to consult. [para. 2]\nJustice Brown, concurring in the result, underscored that ministers of the Crown engaged in the preparation and drafting of legislation are acting pursuant to the power conferred on them by Part IV of the Constitution Act, 1867. He noted that the entirety of the law-making process, including policy decisions leading to the development of a legislative proposal to be considered by Cabinet, is an exercise of legislative power which is immune from judicial interference:\nI agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the entire law-making process  from initial policy development to and including royal assent  is an exercise of legislative power which is immune from judicial interference. As this Court explained in Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 28, the making of policy choices is a legislative function, while the implementation and administration of those choices is an executive function. This precludes judicial imposition of a duty to consult in the course of the law-making process.\n\n. . .\n\n. . . Ministers of the Crown play an essential role in, and are an integral part of, the legislative process . . . . The fact that except in certain rare cases, the executive frequently and de facto controls the legislature (Wells, at para. 54) does not, however, mean that ministers dual membership in the executive and legislative branches of the Canadian state renders their corresponding executive and legislative roles indistinguishable for the purposes of judicial review. . . .\n\nAs a matter of applying this Courts jurisprudence, then, the legislative process begins with a bills formative stages, even where the bill is developed by ministers of the Crown. [paras. 117 and 119-20]\nI adopted the reasons of Justice Brown (Justices Moldaver and Cote in turn concurred in my reasons). I further explained the consequences for the separation of powers of imposing a duty to consult on the process of preparing legislation for consideration by the legislature. I outlined the many steps involved in this process, and explained the steps at which Ministers and their officials are engaged (para. 160). \nParliamentary privilege thus extends to the range of Parliamentary actors who are involved in the legislative process. Parliament has the right to exercise unfettered freedom in the formulation, tabling, amendment, and passage of legislation (Galati v. Canada (Governor General), 2015 FC 91, [2015] 4 F.C.R. 3, at para. 34). In applying parliamentary privilege, the court must have regard to: \nthe breadth of the process of legislative development; and\nthe stages at which parliamentarians and their staff, individual ministers, the Cabinet, members of the civil service, witnesses before Parliament, and the Governor General (or Lieutenant Governors, in the case of the provinces), interact to develop and pass legislation (Mikisew Cree, at paras. 160-64, per Rowe J., concurring (describing the steps that lead to the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation)).\nBecause of the interlocking nature of the process of legislative development which involves many participants at each step, the definition of proceedings in Parliament necessarily captures everything said or done by a member in the exercise of his functions as a member of a committee of either House, as well as everything said or done in either House with the transaction of parliamentary business (Maingot (1997), at p. 81; see also Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. V-1.186, V-1.232 and V-1.240). \nThe Judiciary and Parliamentary Privilege \nThe absolute nature of the immunities related to free speech and proceedings in Parliament has been maintained by this Court and courts in the United Kingdom. See, e.g., Stockdale v. Hansard, at p. 1191, per Patteson J.: Beyond all dispute, it is necessary that the proceedings of each House of Parliament should be entirely free and unshackled; that whatever is done or said in either House should not be liable to examination elsewhere . . . . While the existence and limits of parliamentary privilege are justiciable, their operation is not (Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. V-1.221). Once a court finds that a privilege exists and describes its extent, the courts role ends. It is for the legislature itself to determine whether the exercise of the privilege was proper; such matters are not reviewable by the courts.  \nWhere parliamentary privilege applies, the subject matter falls within the authority of the legislative assembly. Courts lack jurisdiction over the privileged matter (Vaid, at para. 4; Chagnon, at para. 19). \nAs aptly stated by Jamal J.A. in his reasons for the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Duffy: \nParliamentary privilege is a rule of curial jurisdiction. The effect of a matter falling within the scope of parliamentary privilege is that its exercise cannot be reviewed by any external body, including a court: Vaid, at paras. 29(9), 34; Chagnon, at paras. 19, 24; New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 350, 382-84 S.C.R.; and Boulerice, at para. 54. Parliamentary privilege recognizes Parliaments exclusive jurisdiction to deal with complaints within its privileged sphere of activity: Vaid, at paras. 4, 29(9) and 30 (emphasis in original); New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 383-84 S.C.R.; and Boulerice, at para. 55. The principles of parliamentary privilege are a means of distinguishing areas of judicial and legislative body jurisdiction: New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 383-84 S.C.R. Parliamentary privilege thus provides an immunity from judicial review: New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 342 S.C.R. [Emphasis in original; para. 35.]\nThat said, while courts properly consider the extent of parliamentary privilege, once a matter is found to come within that privilege, courts do not review the manner in which the privilege is exercised (Fielding v. Thomas, [1896] A.C. 600 (P.C.); Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. V-1.219, IX.7, XII-2.7 and XII-2.11). Or, as this Court put it in Reference re Resolution to Amend the Constitution, at p. 785: Courts come into the picture when legislation is enacted and not before (unless references are made to them for their opinion on a bill or a proposed enactment). Thus, for example, legislative decision making is not subject to any duty of fairness. Legislatures are subject to constitutional requirements for valid law-making [e.g. division of powers], but within their constitutional boundaries, they can do as they see fit (Wells, at para. 59).\nThe wide berth given to parliamentary privilege has been reflected in the manner in which this Court has approached apparent conflicts between parliamentary privilege and other components of the Constitution. The Courts reasons in Harvey, at para. 70, are instructive; in that case, this Court considered a claim by an appellant who challenged his removal from the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly after being found guilty of committing an illegal act. In deciding that the removal was proper, this Court considered how to balance the appellants claim under s. 3 of the Charter with the legislatures claim to parliamentary privilege, and concluded that a balance must be struck by interpreting the democratic guarantees of s. 3 in a purposive way. The Court concluded that [t]he purpose of the democratic guarantees in the Charter must be taken to be the preservation of democratic values inherent in the existing Canadian Constitution, including the fundamental constitutional right of Parliament and the legislatures to regulate their own proceedings (para. 70). The Court affirmed that the constitutional nature of parliamentary privilege requires courts to interpret Charter provisions in a manner compatible with the scope of privilege. \nConstitutional norms govern our basic institutions, both their operation and interrelation. Where courts are required to ascertain the scope or effect of unwritten norms, on occasion they turn their minds to structural analysis (A. Marcotte, Structural Analysis, Unwritten Principles and Constitutional Remedies: Charter Damages for the Enactment of Legislation by Parliament (2024), 18 J.P.P.L. 69; Rowe and Oza, at p. 225). Harvey thus further clarifies that the solution, when a conflict emerges between parliamentary privilege and another component of the Constitution, is not to read down the protections afforded by parliamentary privilege  the solution is to read the relevant constitutional components in a compatible way.\nIt is not open to the courts to intrude upon the bona fides of parliamentary debates and proceedings. The courts have long recognized the defining significance of Parliaments work and the need for parliamentarians to debate and develop legislation freely. As the Speaker of the Senate submitted, these privileges are vital to the separation of powers as they enable parliamentarians  both individually and collectively  to freely express themselves and to act on matters of importance to Canadians, including controversial public policy issues, without fear of interference from the Crown or the courts (I.F., at para. 21). In Roman Corp. Ltd. v. Hudsons Bay Oil & Gas Co. Ltd., [1971] 2 O.R. 418 (H.C.J.), at p. 139, affd [1972] 1 O.R. 444 (C.A.), the High Court of Justice for Ontario held that [t]he Court has no power to inquire into what statements were made in Parliament, why they were made, who made them, [and] what was the motive for making them or anything about them (p. 423). This approach is consistent in the jurisprudence. \nThe Charter and Parliamentary Privilege\nIt is critical to be clear that the Charter did not negate the fundamental constitutional tenets upon which British parliamentary democracy rested (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 377) and did not displace parliamentary privilege. It is helpful here to consider Canadas constitutional development in a comparative manner. Our constitutional structure, as explained above, draws heavily on the constitutional structure and norms of the U.K. as they stood in 1867. That constitutional model, in turn, has been characterized as one of immanent constitutionalism that emerges gradually by means of a process of accretion, a process of organic growth that can be attributed to factors peculiar to Britain and to its history including, inter alia, a cautious common-sense-oriented pragmatism that primes adaptation and abhors radical change and rupture (M. Rosenfeld, Constitutional Identity, in M. Rosenfeld and A. Sajo, eds., The Oxford Handbook of Comparative Constitutional Law (2012), 756, at p. 764). This process of organic growth can be contrasted with the kind of constitution making that occurs in the context of a clean break  wherein a revolutionary change in governance structure marks a fresh start in constitutional development (see V. C. Jackson and M. Tushnet, Comparative Constitutional Law (1999), at p. 333). \nSo, to put the point in slightly more colloquial terms: the year 1982 in Canada was not like the year 1789 in France: the passage of the Charter did not mark a clean break with existing constitutional structures that came before the passage of the Constitution Act, 1982. Canada held true to its inherited tradition of incremental constitutional growth. Arrangements that were in place at the time of Confederation and that were not modified by constitutional documents remain largely in place and operative. The passage of the Charter must be understood within the broader context of Canadas constitutional development; the Charter did not take aim at or displace the majority of the unwritten elements that comprise Canadas Constitution, including parliamentary privilege. Instead, as this Court has previously established, the Charter must be read in a way that is compatible with other elements of Canadas Constitution, including parliamentary privilege.\nMany consider the Charter to be the paramount constitutional instrument. This is incorrect. All parts of the Constitution must be read together, and no one can be subordinated to the others. Justice McLachlin (as she then was) explained this in Harvey:\nThe power of Parliament and the legislatures to regulate their procedures both inside and outside the legislative chamber arises from the Constitution Act, 1867. The preamble to the Constitution Act, 1867 affirms a parliamentary system of government, incorporating into the Canadian Constitution the right of Parliament and the legislatures to regulate their own affairs. The preamble also incorporates the notion of the separation of powers, inherent in British parliamentary democracy, which precludes the courts from trenching on the internal affairs of the other branches of government. As I wrote in New Brunswick Broadcasting, supra, at p. 389:\n\nOur democratic government consists of several branches: the Crown, as represented by the Governor General and the provincial counterparts of that office; the legislative body; the executive; and the courts. It is fundamental to the working of government as a whole that all these parts play their proper role. It is equally fundamental that no one of them overstep its bounds, that each show proper deference for the legitimate sphere of activity of the other.\n\nBecause parliamentary privilege enjoys constitutional status it is not subject to the Charter, as are ordinary laws. Both parliamentary privilege and the Charter constitute essential parts of the Constitution of Canada. Neither prevails over the other. While parliamentary privilege and immunity from improper judicial interference in parliamentary processes must be maintained, so must the fundamental democratic guarantees of the Charter. Where apparent conflicts between different constitutional principles arise, the proper approach is not to resolve the conflict by subordinating one principle to the other, but rather to attempt to reconcile them. [Emphasis added; paras. 68-69.]\nIn other words, one part of the Constitution cannot abrogate another part of the Constitution (Reference re Bill 30, An Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1148; New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 373 and 390).  \nThe Chief Justice and Justice Karakatsanis, at para. 94 of their reasons, state that the Charter effected a revolutionary transformation of the Canadian polity (quoting L. E. Weinrib, Canadas Charter of Rights: Paradigm Lost? (2002), 6 Rev. Const. Stud. 119, at p. 120). With respect, I must disagree. The Charter, as I have explained above, did not present a clean break with foundational elements of Canadas constitutional order. \nThat said, the Charter was accompanied by a revolutionary transformation of sorts; not a revolution that, as my colleagues suggest, displaced longstanding elements of our constitutional order, but rather a revolution in the nature and extent of demands by litigants for courts to use their authority to advance goals that those litigants had not achieved through the electoral process. I do not read the reasons of Justice Dickson (as he then was) in Amax Potash Ltd. v. Government of Saskatchewan, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 576, at p. 590, which my colleagues cite in support of their view, as heralding a revolutionary transformation of the Canadian polity. Rather, Justice Dicksons measured words in Amax Potash speak for themselves: . . . it is not for the Courts to pass upon the policy or wisdom of legislative will or question the wisdom of enactments which, by the terms of the Canadian Constitution are within the competence of the Legislatures (p. 590). I agree, and for that reason I eschew the invitation for the judiciary to overstep its bounds by subordinating parliamentary privilege to the Charter (New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 389). Temperance and moderation in the face of such invitations remain fundamental to the appreciation by the judiciary of its own position in the constitutional scheme (Vaid, at para. 24, quoting Canada (Auditor General) v. Canada (Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 49, at p. 91, per Dickson C.J.; see also M. Rowe, The Virtue of Judicial Restraint, or Who Guards the Guardians? (2022), 55 U.B.C. L. Rev. 311). \nCrown-in-Parliament Versus Crown in its Executive Capacity\nHaving established the constitutional nature and functions of parliamentary privilege, I now turn to the theory of liability endorsed by the courts below and the respondent in this appeal, and the incoherence of the suggestion that the Crown in its executive capacity can be held liable for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. Canadas Constitution, unlike that of our American neighbours, was not crafted by those leading colonial rebellions. Instead, it incorporates the Westminster system of government, which was varied for the circumstances of this country, notably a federal structure rather than a unitary state. Subsequent developments in our Constitution have built on this. A consequence of this is the distinctive roles of the Crown in both executive and legislative capacities. It is helpful to clarify and distinguish the Crown in these two functions. \nIn the contemporary constitutional order, the Crown acts in multiple distinct capacities, federal and provincial, as well as executive and legislative. (For the sake of simplicity, I leave aside consideration of the Crown in its judicial capacity, other than to note en passant that the inherent authority of Superior Court judges is an offshoot of the Crown in its judicial capacity.) This Court has emphasized that the Crown in its executive capacity and the Crown in its legislative capacity are distinct. In Clyde River (Hamlet) v. Petroleum Geo-Services Inc., 2017 SCC 40, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1069, at para. 28, this Court held that:\nIn one sense, the Crown refers to the personification in Her Majesty of the Canadian state in exercising the prerogatives and privileges reserved to it. The Crown also, however, denotes the sovereign in the exercise of her formal legislative role (in assenting, refusing assent to, or reserving legislative or parliamentary bills), and as the head of executive authority (McAteer v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 ONCA 578, 121 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 51; P. W. Hogg, P. J. Monahan and W. K. Wright, Liability of the Crown (4th ed. 2011), at pp. 11-12; but see Carrier Sekani, at para. 44). For this reason, the term Crown is commonly used to symbolize and denote executive power.\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 establishes that [p]lenary executive power is affirmed . . . to continue to repose in Her Majesty (W. J. Newman, The Crown, the Queen, and the Structure of the Constitution, in D. M. Jackson and C. McCreery, eds., A Resilient Crown: Canadas Monarchy at the Platinum Jubilee (2022), 13, at p. 17). The Crown in its executive capacity, thus, consists of the King (through the Governor General) exercising the Executive Government and Authority of and over Canada, as continued in the Constitution Act, 1867 (s. 9). Today, as from before Confederation, those executive powers are, by constitutional convention, exercised by the Prime Minister, Cabinet, and public authorities in furtherance of statutory delegation of authority. \nThe Crown-in-Parliament consists of the monarch (Governor General) acting in their legislative capacity. As Justice Brown explained in Mikisew Cree, the Crown-in-Parliament embraces three determinative acts that are part of Parliaments core functions as a legislative body: royal recommendation, royal consent and royal assent (para. 130 (emphasis deleted), quoting C. Robert, The Role of the Crownin-Parliament: A Matter of Form and Substance, in M. Bedard and P. Lagasse, eds., The Crown and Parliament (2015), 95, at p. 96). The involvement of the Crown is essential to the operation of Parliament; as the opening words of s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 state: It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make Laws for the Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada . . . . Thus, Parliament consists of the House of Commons, the Senate and the Crown-in-Parliament. \nThe respondent urges this Court to disregard the distinction between the Crown in its executive and legislative capacities, because, he suggests, the executive and legislative branches are closely entangled in Canada (R.F., at para. 73). This indicates a profound lack of understanding (or indifference to) Canadas constitutional order. It also flies in the face of precedent. In Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, this Court stated that while the executive through its control of a House of Commons majority may in practice dictate the position the House of Commons takes . . . [this] is not . . . constitutionally cognizable by the judiciary (p. 103). That the Crown is engaged at various stages of the legislative process is foundational to our constitutional order, but is dismissed by the respondent as irrelevant (R.F., at para. 72).\nIn Mikisew Cree, this Court distinguished the role of the Crown-in-Parliament from the Crown in its executive capacity, and firmly rejected the notion of Crown control of the process of legislative enactment (para. 129). It found that the process by which laws are made is not in fact Crown conduct  which is to say, that the Crown in its executive capacity (the context in which the Crown is ordinarily used) does not control the legislative process (paras. 33-34, per Karakatsanis J., paras. 101-2, 113, 117, 120 and 133, per Brown J., and paras. 148 and 160, per Rowe J.). This is true notwithstanding the fact that individual parliamentarians who are also members of the executive  i.e. parliamentarians who serve as ministers and the Prime Minister  are involved in, and in fact are integral to, the legislative process. \nThe Crown, thus, is at the heart of both the executive and legislative branches of government, but plays different roles in each. While our constitutional order envisages some overlap as to the Crown in its various capacities, this Court has been clear that the law does not recognize executive control of the legislative branch. This is consistent with the scope of parliamentary privilege and its application across the various steps in the legislative process. \nAs this Courts examination of the legislative process in Mikisew Cree shows, the preparation of legislation is a complex process involving multiple actors across government: This is why the separation of powers operates the way it does. The courts are ill-equipped to deal with the procedural complexities of the legislative process (para. 164, per Rowe J.). The distinctive roles played by the Crown reflects the separation of powers between the different branches of government, and the balance between them: \nOur democratic government consists of several branches: the Crown, as represented by the Governor General and the provincial counterparts of that office; the legislative body; the executive; and the courts. It is fundamental to the working of government as a whole that all these parts play their proper role. It is equally fundamental that no one of them overstep its bounds, that each show proper deference for the legitimate sphere of activity of the other. \n\n(New Brunswick Broadcasting, at p. 389, per McLachlin J.)\nThis is part of the explanation as to why absolute immunity is needed for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation, but not (of course) for determination of the validity of legislation once it is enacted or the legality of acts taken pursuant to the legislation. \nApplication to the Present Appeal\nThe Framing of the Issues \nThe questions posed by the Attorney General of Canada to the New Brunswick Court of Queens Bench read as follows: \nCan the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for government officials and Ministers preparing and drafting a proposed Bill that was later enacted by Parliament, and subsequently declared invalid by a court pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982? and\nCan the Crown, in its executive capacity, be held liable in damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into law, which legislation was later declared invalid by a court pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\n(2021 NBQB 107, at para. 3 (CanLII))\nThe courts below concluded that the two questions could be blended into a single question. . . . Do the Crown and its officials enjoy absolute immunity when exercising a legislative function? (2022 NBCA 14, 471 D.L.R. (4th) 68, at para. 16). The respondent frames his arguments by reference to the liability of the state (see, e.g., R.F., at para. 1) and argues that the distinction between the Crown in its legislative or executive capacity is irrelevant in the Charter context (para. 72). \nThe majority adopts this framing, noting that a ministers legislative and executive powers can overlap and are sometimes difficult to disentangle in the law-making process (para. 20). But, as I noted above, a plurality of the Court in Mikisew Cree established that the work of ministers and their officials in preparing legislation begins with policy development and implicates parliamentary privilege. The work of these actors does not become executive as opposed to legislative simply because they were carried out by, or with the assistance of, public servants. . . . Their actions, rather, are directed to informing potential changes to legislative policy and are squarely legislative in nature (para. 121, per Brown J.). \nI therefore disagree that the two questions can be blended. This formulation elides the distinction between the Crown in its various capacities, and muddies the analytical waters. As suggested by the framing of the questions referred by the Attorney General of Canada, the Crown manifests itself in multiple distinct capacities. Furthermore, I cannot agree that the fact that Ministers carry out both parliamentary and executive duties can justify sweeping ministerial conduct that is unquestionably legislative in nature into the scope of liability against the state (that is, the Crown in its executive capacity). This amounts to a collateral attack on the legislative nature of the work of Ministers and their officials in developing legislation.\nThe Respondents Argument Runs Contrary to Constitutional Structure and Subordinates Unwritten Components of the Constitution \nThis Court is called on to consider how parliamentary privilege operates where someone seeks s. 24(1) damages for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. The respondent suggests that Mackin v. New Brunswick (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 13, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 405, resolves this question  but the Court in Mackin did not turn its attention to how damages under s. 24(1) can be reconciled with giving effect to parliamentary privilege. My colleagues note that Mackin has been applied in the context of executive actions taken pursuant to statute (majority reasons, at paras. 68 et seq.). But they do not point to any examples of Mackin being applied as the basis for damages under s. 24(1) for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation  and they cannot, because Mackin has never been applied in this way. In light of the constitutional nature of parliamentary privilege, and the fact that s. 24(1) is to be given effect in a manner that is compatible with parliamentary privilege, this Court cannot rely on a passing reference in Mackin as the basis, first, to depart from a substantial body of jurisprudence on parliamentary privilege and, second, to abandon the fundamental principle that components of the Constitution do not negate one another. \nMackin Does Not Resolve the Questions Before the Court Today \nMackin concerned a challenge to a New Brunswick bill that abolished the system of supernumerary judges in that province. This Courts consideration of the matter focused on the constitutionality of the impugned bill; while the applicants sought damages under s. 24(1), this question was dispensed with, under the heading other questions, in seven paragraphs. The respondent and my colleagues in the majority rely on a single statement in this brief aside in Justice Gonthiers reasons: \n. . . while legislative bodies enjoy immunity from damages for the mere enactment or application of a law that is subsequently declared to be unconstitutional (para. 78 (emphasis added)), such immunity will give way to liability when the law was clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power (para. 79 (emphasis added)).\n\n(majority reasons, at para. 61)\nThis selective reading of Justice Gonthiers drive by analysis on the question of s. 24(1) damages cannot be the basis to decide the present appeal and the fundamental questions it raises about whether one component of Canadas Constitution can subordinate another. To begin with, the statement was, in Justice Gonthiers own view, representative only of the general rule of public law (para. 78). Additionally, the two cases cited by Justice Gonthier do not deal with the question of parliamentary privilege (see Welbridge Holdings Ltd. v. Greater Winnipeg, [1971] S.C.R. 957; Central Canada Potash Co. v. Government of Saskatchewan, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 42). \nMoreover, the brief consideration of the availability of damages focused on governmental action (Mackin, at para. 78), i.e. actions of the executive pursuant to statutory authority and to the exercise of this authority in good faith (para. 79). Justice Gonthier did not turn his mind to the question of whether liability could arise from the preparation and drafting of legislation and its consideration by Parliament. It is inconceivable that so careful and learned a jurist would determine so profound a question as that before us without considering parliamentary privilege. Mackins conclusion cannot be the basis for deciding that s. 24(1) damages can apply against the Crown in its executive capacity for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. Parliamentary privilege was never mentioned, much less discussed. It beggars reason to suggest that the Court intended to overturn its precedents affirming the centrality of parliamentary privilege to Canadas constitutional order without in any way adverting to this issue. To the contrary, I would note that he cited with approval R. Dussault and L. Borgeats Administrative Law: A Treatise (2nd ed. 1990), vol. 5, at p. 177, which notes: \nIn our parliamentary system of government, Parliament or a legislature of a province cannot be held liable for anything it does in exercising its legislative powers. The law is the source of duty, as much for citizens as for the Administration, and while a wrong and damaging failure to respect the law may for anyone raise a liability, it is hard to imagine that either Parliament or a legislature can as the lawmaker be held accountable for harm caused to an individual following the enactment of legislation.\nWhile the adoption of the Charter means that a plaintiff is no longer restricted to an action in damages based on the general law of civil liability, Justice Gonthier noted that the reasons that inform the general principle of public law are also relevant in a Charter context (Mackin, at para. 79). \nThis truncated consideration of the question of damages led Justice Gonthier to his real conclusion: an action for damages cannot normally be combined with an action seeking a declaration of invalidity based on s. 52(1) (see para. 80, citing Schachter v. Canada, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679). Later cases applying Mackin are consistent with the conclusion that Mackin did not obliquely overturn a cornerstone of Canadas constitutional structure. In Vancouver (City) v. Ward, 2010 SCC 27, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 28, Chief Justice McLachlin confirmed that Mackin applies to state action under valid statutes subsequently declared invalid (para. 43). Such state action relates to what happens after legislation is adopted. Parliamentary privilege relates to matters that precede that point.  \nTo the extent, if any, that Justice Gonthiers brief reference to damages for the mere enactment of a law represents a holding of this Court, it should be treated as weak precedent at most. We need not speculate too much to be able to get to the root of Justice Gonthiers holding in Mackin. The methodology for answering that question is well settled. For all decisions, it is essential to identify the ratio decidendi and obiter dicta to understand whether and how the precedent applies. The Latin term ratio decidendi means the reason for deciding and obiter dictum means something said in passing (Blacks Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), at pp. 569 and 1514; see also M. Rowe and L. Katz, A Practical Guide to Stare Decisis (2020), 41 Windsor Rev. Legal Soc. Issues 1). \nAt this Court more than others, decisions can often be perceived as having a ratio decidendi broader than what decides the matter at hand, as cases that are accepted for leave at this stage reflect a consideration of broader legal questions and speak to the formulation of the law beyond what is required by the facts of the case (Rowe and Katz, at p. 9). However, in R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 56, Justice Binnie explained that the notion of binding effect as a matter of law was disavowed by this Court in P.E.I. Judges Reference. He went on to explain (at para. 57): \nThe issue in each case . . . is what did the case decide? Beyond the ratio decidendi . . .[,] [a]ll obiter do not have, and are not intended to have, the same weight. The weight decreases as one moves from the dispositive ratio decidendi to a wider circle of analysis which is obviously intended for guidance and which should be accepted as authoritative. Beyond that, there will be commentary, examples or exposition that are intended to be helpful and may be found to be persuasive, but are certainly not binding . . . . The objective of the exercise is to promote certainty in the law, not to stifle its growth and creativity. The notion that each phrase in a judgment of this Court should be treated as if enacted in a statute is not supported by the cases and is inconsistent with the basic fundamental principle that the common law develops by experience.\nIn this appeal, the respondents (and the majoritys) characterization of the holding in Mackin and which elements of Justice Gonthiers reasoning bind this Court go far beyond the conventional rationale for deciding what a case stands for. Though Justice Sharpe wrote that drawing the line between the ratio and obiter dicta is a matter of argument and judgment (pp. 149-50), it is my view that, to the extent a statement in a decision reflects the Courts considered view of an area of law, it provides guidance that should be treated as binding (Rowe and Katz, at p. 10). But Justice Gonthiers examination of the question of damages for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation was not, with all respect, considered  it was, instead, a footnote to a decision that was focused entirely elsewhere. \nMy colleagues point to Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia, 2020 SCC 13, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 678, to suggest that this Court was unanimous in concluding that Mackin applies to the work of the legislature (para. 71). But, Conseil scolaire (a s. 23 case) did not deal with the question of whether and how Mackins standard can be reconciled with parliamentary privilege. In our joint reasons, Justice Brown and I argued that the rationale underlying Mackin  that duly enacted laws should be enforced until declared invalid  should be extended to the policy-making context in order to avoid an approach that focused on the vehicle of state action to the detriment of the broader good governance concerns that were at play (Conseil scolaire, at para. 284, quoting Ward, at para. 39). But the present appeal addresses a different set of actors (i.e., parliamentarians and others involved in the legislative process) and a different set of governance concerns (Parliaments ability to carry out its work effectively). [S]tate action taken pursuant to a law is not at issue here (Henry v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 24, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 214, at para. 42). The government, the state and Parliament are not interchangeable for the purposes of s. 24(1) damages, and the democratic and separation of powers concerns that attach to each are not fungible. \nFor the foregoing reasons, the matter being considered in this appeal must be seen as novel for the Courts consideration, not as an issue settled in Mackin.\nThe Respondents Argument Is Inconsistent With This Courts Jurisprudence\nTo remain faithful to this Courts jurisprudence, this Courts role must be limited to establishing the existence of the privileges in question, rather than inquiring into their operation. The respondent asks this Court to go further, suggesting that the operation of parliamentary privilege is a mere evidentiary question, or one that can somehow be reconciled at a later stage when these proceedings  or the appeals inevitably spawned by it  return to this Court. This is a mistaken and dangerous view. In considering the respondents submissions on this point, I cannot help but hear an echo of King Charles Is infamous challenge in 1642  we are told that the respondent would not break Parliaments privileges, but that infidelity to the Charter has no privilege. \nTo the contrary, parliamentary privilege stands without exception. As the Commons held this to be true in 1642, so it is true today: the privilege of Parliament is absolute or it is no privilege at all. What would arise if the respondent succeeds is a licence whereby the courts supervise the preparation and consideration of legislation to ensure consistency with an ill-defined standard of conduct or a retrospective assessment of what Parliament should have understood about the constitutionality of the impugned legislation. It is not sufficient to hold, as did the court below, that the legislative branch simply may have to pay a price if they exercise their constitutional functions in circumstances that are clearly wrong (C.A. reasons, at para. 23). The undermining of privilege in this case is of a grave nature. More grave still: where damages are to be awarded based on the misconduct of legislators, then surely other remedies will follow. Section 24(1) of the Charter does not, after all, limit the forms of relief available. Injunctive relief cannot, therefore, be ruled out in giving effect to the view of the respondent. The effect would be to place supervision of the agenda and proceedings of Parliament in the control of judges. This would be profoundly undemocratic. \nThe Crown in its Executive Capacity Cannot Be Liable for the Preparation, Drafting, or Enactment of Legislation \nThe respondents submissions display a disdain for Canadas constitutional structure; this is evidenced, inter alia, by the logical incoherence of making the Crown in its executive capacity liable for the operation of Parliament. The Crown in its executive capacity is not part of the legislative process. Rather it is the Crown-in-Parliament which is so; legislation is approved by the Commons and the Senate, followed by royal assent. Seeking damages from the Crown in its executive capacity for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation is conceptually incoherent. It betrays a profound misunderstanding of the constitutional arrangements to which the claim relates. \nIt is entirely unclear how a suit as envisaged by the respondent would practically proceed. If the Attorney General were named the defendant, would this officer of the executive be responsible for coordinating the legal defence of ministers acting in their legislative capacities? Of parliamentarians considering and voting on the legislation, or of parliamentarians who introduce a private members bill that later becomes law? Of the speakers of the chambers in presiding over the legislations passage? Who is to testify? Who can be subject to disclosure of documents? Who will be called on to explain alleged misconduct? These questions are not hypotheticals  they are the inevitable result of the respondents theory of liability. \nThe Attorney General of Canada is not the legal representative of Parliament. The theory of liability suggested in the decisions below thus overlooks a crucial fact: the Attorney General of Canada does not (and in fact, cannot) represent Parliament in legal proceedings. In previous cases where claims have been brought against one of the chambers of Parliament the Attorney General has represented the executive branch as an intervener (as in Vaid) or separate respondent (as in Duffy), rather than the chamber in question. The chambers are of course, independent of the executive branch of government (and [are], accordingly, separately represented) (I.F., Speaker of the Senate, at para. 13).\nAs the Speaker of the House of Commons put it, confidence in the executive branch is tested in the House: by convention, upon the loss of support of a majority of Members, the government is expected to resign or seek the dissolution of Parliament in order for a general election to be held (I.F., at para. 10). The Speaker also notes that there is no tenable theory by which the executive could be liable for Charter damages for decisions taken during the law-making process. The Crown qua executive is not vicariously liable or otherwise liable for the actions or statements of Members of Parliament in the Senate or House of Commons (para. 61). I agree. \nProperly characterized, the respondent is effectively seeking damages from the Crown-in-Parliament by imposing liability on the Crown in its executive capacity, a structural sleight of hand that the respondent does not and cannot explain. To do so, the respondent asks us to subordinate parliamentary privilege. These arguments are not sound in law. To the contrary, they depart fundamentally and incoherently from Canadas settled constitutional arrangements. \nAbsolute Immunity Is Necessary: Violating Parliamentary Privilege Will Break the Egg\nI pause here to address what may seem a tempting compromise between the positions staked out by the appellant and respondent: why not enable litigants to subordinate parliamentary privilege only insofar as is necessary to establish well-founded claims for relief under s. 24(1)? The answer is that it cannot be done. Parliamentary privilege is like an eggshell; one cannot break it just a little. \nThe problem with the theory of liability advanced by the respondent is that, in order for the Crown in its executive capacity to be held liable for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation  even if that liability is limited to instances of bad faith, abuse of power, or clearly wrong conduct  courts will need to inquire into the motivations and knowledge of those engaged in the legislative process. Investigation by the courts into the propriety of conduct related to preparing, introducing and considering legislation would inevitably lead the courts to examine parliamentary proceedings or speech uttered in those proceedings (I.F., Speaker of the Senate, at para. 5). \nRegarding Reliance on Hansard\nI note further that a fundamental distinction exists between reliance on parliamentary proceedings in the construction of statutes to assess their constitutionality and use of proceedings to ground liability in regard to the process of adopting a statute. As the Speaker of the Senate notes, a declaration under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 does not amount to an impeachment or questioning of debates or proceedings in Parliament. It is a determination about a laws compliance with the Constitution  a role that clearly falls to and is within the jurisdiction of courts of competent jurisdictions  and not that of the legislators who developed, introduced, debated and adopted the law (I.F., at para. 45 (emphasis deleted)). \nThough parliamentary debates can be of use to establish facts, and to assess the purpose of an enactment, this does not engage courts in questioning the propriety of proceedings in Parliament. It is suggested that as we rely on Hansard to assist in determining Parliamentary purpose, so too can we rely on Hansard here to determine whether Parliament was operating in bad faith (R.F., at paras. 100-102). But Hansard can be relied on, at best, cautiously. As Justice Rennie held in Mohr v. National Hockey League, 2022 FCA 145, [2021] 4 F.C.R. 465:\nI accept that legislative history may be used . . . as it may inform the purpose of the legislation (Alberta (Attorney General) v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2021 FCA 84, [2021] 2 F.C.R. 426, 41 C.E.L.R. (4th) 157, at paragraph 127). But even here, care must be taken not to confuse the evolution of the legislation, which is law, with what individual politicians or regulators think or hope the legislation says. There is a substantive difference between committee proceedings that shed light on the evolution and legislative history of a law on the one hand and on the other hand the testimony of academics and public servants which may be aspirational, disputable or of arguable relevance. [para. 63]\nStatements of purpose in the legislative record may be rhetorical and imprecise, or poor indicators of purpose; what is to be identified is Parliaments purpose, not the purposes of its individual members (R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at para. 89; R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at para. 36; R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at p. 293). Statements by individual parliamentarians are therefore indicative only of the views of that legislator; they cannot establish Parliamentary intent in an institutional sense. The longstanding caution of courts in accepting this sort of evidence should bear on the respondents arguments here  and should give courts pause before attributing the words or actions of a given parliamentarian to a finding that the Mackin threshold has been met. \nStatements of purpose in this context also differ in kind from the statements that would be used to ascribe intent for the purposes of the Mackin test; in the former sense, they should be understood as interpretative aids to help courts give effect to Parliaments purpose, not undermine it. See Pepper v. Hart, [1993] A.C. 593 (H.L.), at p. 646. \nThe Mackin Standard Is Inapposite in the Legislative Context \nNeither the respondent nor my colleagues in the majority specify how the Mackin standard is to be applied in the context of the specifics of the legislative process. My colleagues in the majority, at paras. 105-11, conclude that bad faith or abuse of power in the law-making process is better defined on a case-by-case basis bearing in mind that whether it is possible to attribute the bad faith or abuse of power of an individual or group to the institution itself [(the legislature)] will depend on the facts of a given case. No doubt, this inquiry into bad faith or abuse of power can manifest itself in any variety of ways, many that cannot now be contemplated. Legislatures will have to ask themselves whether a court, sitting in judgment of their actions with the benefit of hindsight, will deem theirs to be an improper purpose (para. 107), and which of the flexible formulations of bad faith and abuse of power proffered by my colleagues in the majority will ultimately be applied when the day of judgment on the actions of legislators arrives (para. 108). \nIn seeking to distinguish Mikisew Cree, my colleagues in the majority suggest that post-enactment damages do not unduly interfer[e] with Parliament, including its control over its own procedures . . . . Such damages do not compel the legislature to regulate its own internal affairs in a certain way (para. 73). But the imposition of liability as proposed by the respondent does invade the legislatures right to manage its own proceedings, as I explain above. \nFurthermore, the suggestion that parliamentary privilege is only implicated if the proposed liability unduly interferes with the operation of the privilege finds no support in the jurisprudence. Instead, Vaids two step test for questions of parliamentary privilege governs. The privileges claimed here are authoritatively established (para. 29). The courts thus have no jurisdiction to adjudicate the exercise of the privileges in question (paras. 40-41 and 47-48; Chagnon, at paras. 2 and 32; New Brunswick Broadcasting, at pp. 350 and 384-85). \nThe fact that ministers and officials are implicated in the scope of liability sought by the respondent does not change that fact, as [p]ublic servants making policy recommendations prior to the formulation and introduction of a bill are not executing existing legislative policy or direction (Mikisew Cree, at para. 121). There is no basis to derogate from our conclusion, in Mikisew Cree, that these actors exercise legislative rather than executive authority when they develop legislation. The scope of the privileges at issue is not in question; they protect Parliaments ability to fulfill its constitutional role, as they always have done. I cannot endorse the truncated view of parliamentary privilege advanced by my colleagues, which would seem to guarantee Parliaments ability to control its own proceedings only as long as those proceedings do not implicate Parliaments very raison detre, that being the enactment of legislation. \nJustice Jamal suggests a standard that turns on whether the unconstitutionality was readily or obviously demonstrable at the time of enactment and could not have been subject to any serious debate (para. 127), but I fear that this standard will also undermine parliamentary privilege.\nMy colleague notes that he is sensitive to the risk of chilling the lawmaking function (para. 249). But the clearly unconstitutional standard is fraught with risk in this regard as well. Whether the unconstitutionality of a given enactment was readily or obviously demonstrable at the time the legislation was enacted (para. 246) will necessarily depend on the eye of the beholder, and what is known to the court sitting in judgment of the legislatures actions ex post facto. The potential for self-censorship, and the risk that this hindsight analysis will preclud[e] unfettered and vigorous debate about the merits and wisdom of legislation (I.F., Speaker of the House of Commons, at para. 63) is inescapable. \nSection 24(1) Liability Will Upset the Dialogical Balance and Create Unforeseen Consequences \nEnabling s. 24(1) damages, as called for by the respondent, would upset the dialogical balance between legislatures and the courts. Courts will be thrust into a position of overseeing the work of Parliament and the provincial legislatures, and inquiring into the motives and knowledge of parliamentarians and others involved in the legislative process. The same concern that arose in Mikisew Cree, i.e. that judicial scrutiny of the legislative process would undermine [Parliaments] ability to act as the voice of the electorate would come to fruition (para. 36, per Karakatsanis J.). \nExtending s. 24(1) damages to the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation would hamper the dialogue between courts and legislatures, by depriving Parliament of its ability to meaningfully respond to decisions in which the judiciary has determined the validity of laws or the legality of actions taken pursuant to those laws. While this Court has stated that the legislatures should not try, try again to overcome binding precedent from this Court, the respondent would seemingly do away with the ability of Parliament and the legislatures to try in the first case. The risk that an adverse decision under s. 52(1) invalidating a piece of legislation, or some portion of it, will suffice to meet the threshold for conduct under Mackin will be too high. Legislatures will need to insulate themselves against the risk. Some will ask whether proceeding under s. 33 is an option.\nThe Speaker of the House of Commons warns that Members of Parliament will self-censor if liability is possible, precluding unfettered and vigorous debate about the merits and wisdom of legislation. Similarly, Members worried about Charter damages would not be able to proceed fearlessly and thus fail to act as a meaningful check on executive power (I.F., at para. 63). Those proceedings and speech often deal with highly sensitive topics, on which members of the House and Senate are required to give their full and frank assessment in order for Parliament to be able to carry out its work: Controversial issues, such as how legislative initiatives impact marginalized groups or Charter rights, are often raised and sometimes form the basis for bills and amendments that senators put forward (I.F., Speaker of the Senate, at para. 11). \nFurther, given the number of parliamentary actors and the vagaries of the legislative process, the conduct surrounding any given legislation cannot be meaningfully ascribed to any one set of Parliamentarians. As such, it is unclear whose alleged actions would be at issue in any claim seeking Charter damages for the drafting and enactment of any one statute (I.F., Speaker of the House of Commons, at para. 65). And that is to say nothing of legislation introduced in minority governments, private members bills, amendments, committee reports etc., all of which implicate [c]ountless parliamentary actors (para. 66).\nThe New Brunswick Court of Appeal said that [c]laims attacking the bona fides of parliamentary action will be extremely rare, and those that are made will likely be subjected to motions to strike or for summary judgment to determine whether the allegations meeting the [Mackin] threshold can be proven (para. 24). It is unclear what basis the New Brunswick Court of Appeal had for its speculation that future claims will be rare if this Court sanctions s. 24(1) damages for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. With this Courts imprimatur, I expect that claims for such damages will proliferate. \nThe effort to subordinate parliamentary privilege to s. 24(1) in this case parallels the effort to subordinate parliamentary privilege to s. 35(1) in Mikisew Cree. In that case, I addressed (at paras. 161-71) the serious but difficult to ascertain consequences of doing this. (I would also rely on what Justice Brown set out in his reasons, which I adopted at para. 148.) At para. 165(h) I considered the impacts of the imposition of a duty to consult on the legislative process:\nThe relationship among the institutions of the executive and between them and Parliament are complex. What would be the impact on the operation of Cabinet, on the role of the Prime Minister or Premier as the head of Cabinet, and on the responsibility of the ministry to the legislature? Would there not be significant and likely unforeseeable consequences for the conventions, practices and procedures by which Cabinet operates and its relationship to the legislature? \nIf parliamentary privilege can be subordinated to one provision of the Constitution Act, 1982, then why not to other provisions? And, if damages can be awarded, then why not other forms of relief, notably interim injunctions? In this case, as in Mikisew Cree, courts are called on to start down the pathway of supervising the operation of legislative institutions. This has profound significance.\nIn Chagnon, at para. 74, I similarly observed that violating parliamentary privilege could have unforeseen consequences, a caution which bears with equal force on the present appeal:\nParliamentary privilege, derived from centuries of conflict and diverse experience, should be circumscribed with great caution and after careful reflection. It is difficult sometimes to see the connections between what is necessary for the autonomy and proper functioning of the legislature and the extent of parliamentary privilege. The legislature is not like a department or a regulatory agency; it is the central pillar of representative democracy. Profound deference should be shown as to how it chooses to operate.\nThe Respondent Asks the Court To Overturn Settled Precedent \nThe respondent ignores an unbroken line of settled precedent. So, too, does the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, in suggesting that the legislative branch and those within it are free to make policy choices and adopt laws, although they may have to pay a price if they do so in circumstances that are clearly wrong, or where bad faith or abuse of power is proven (para. 23). This necessarily requires an inquiry into the state of mind and motivations of legislators. This is a frontal attack on parliamentary privilege. The logical implication is clear: parliamentary privilege is subordinate to the Charter. I do not agree.\nThe New Brunswick Court of Appeal misread Mackin and failed to understand the clarification provided by Ward. I do not seek to overturn Mackin or Ward. I simply read them accurately.\nWhile not stated as such, the majority overrules Vaid and New Brunswick Broadcasting, at least as to s. 24(1). The legal cordon sanitaire around the internal operations of legislatures having been breached for one provision of the written Constitution, will it be breached for others? One cannot be certain, other than to anticipate that further efforts to do so will follow. We will then see whether this is the start of a progressive erosion. Even if confined to s. 24(1), one can expect any variety of efforts by counsel to utilize this as a means for courts to exercise oversight over legislative processes, e.g., by seeking injunctive relief to halt legislative proceedings where irreparable harm is alleged.\nAbsolute Immunity Is Required \nTo many, it seems difficult to reconcile the rule of law with the concept of absolute immunity. My colleague Justice Cote wrote in Ontario (Attorney General) v. Clark, 2021 SCC 18, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 607, that Roncarelli [v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121,] is emblematic of a conception of the rule of law that is incompatible with absolute immunities. As this conception of the rule of law took hold in the second half of the 20th century, judges and legislators began to view absolute immunities with suspicion and to gradually erode them (para. 63).\nIn this view, absolute immunities are anachronistic, especially after the Constitution Act, 1982. But absolute immunities are not anachronistic where they are still required for certain institutions to function. This is exemplified by the fact that the judiciary enjoys an absolute immunity in the exercise of its adjudicative function. This too, is deeply rooted in history (Morier v. Rivard, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 716, at pp. 738-39, citing Halsburys Laws of England (4th ed. 1973), vol. 1, at pp. 197 et seq., Nos. 206 and 210; and H. Brun and G. Tremblay, Droit constitutionnel (1982), at p. 514). In Ernst v. Alberta Energy Regulator, 2017 SCC 1, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 3, Chief Justice McLachlin and Justices Moldaver and Brown, dissenting, but not on this point, determined that:\nWe acknowledge that our common law recognizes absolute immunity from personal liability for judges in the exercise of their adjudicative function. This is necessary to maintain judicial independence and impartiality (Sirros v. Moore, [1975] 1 Q.B. 118 (C.A.); Gonzalez v. British Columbia (Ministry of Attorney General), 2009 BCSC 639, 95 B.C.L.R. (4th) 185; Taylor v. Canada (Attorney General), [2000] 3 F.C. 298 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2000] 2 S.C.R. xiv). Such immunity is not inconsistent with the Charter, as judicial immunity itself is a fundamental constitutional principle (Taylor, at para. 57). Similarly, we anticipate that compelling good governance concerns rendering Charter damages inappropriate or unjust will exist where the state actor has breached a Charter right while performing an adjudicative function. [para. 171]\nIt is therefore clear that the recognition of absolute immunities  in specific contexts, attached to particular actors, is not inconsistent with the Charter after all.\nSeen another way, if a Parliamentary committee were to summon a judge to testify before the committee as to the deliberations leading to the rendering by the judge of a decision, the summons would be resisted as such questioning would be impermissible as part of the absolute immunity of judges relating to the exercise of the adjudicative function. \nThe mirror image of this is that by virtue of parliamentary privilege, legislators have absolute immunity from being called to account before a court for their deliberations as legislators. Is there not a constitutional symmetry, in that legislators cannot require judges to justify how we make our decisions, nor can we require them to justify how they make their decisions? Or is the rule simply that judges are immune from such questioning of their bona fides, but parliamentarians are to be subject to such questioning? Would not this rule be somewhat self-serving?   \nRemedies\nThe jurisprudence is clear that remedies under s. 24(1) are available following the enactment of legislation, in relation to executive action pursuant to legislation. As the Attorney General of Canada points out, Mr. Power is not without recourse to a remedy, nor would others be. The respondent might have sought relief specific to his circumstances in addition to a declaration of invalidity. An example of this is given by Justice Roussel in P.H. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FC 393, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 461, at paras. 96-98:\nI have concluded that this Court has the jurisdiction to grant the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by the parties, namely because the ITO test is met and P.H. has established that he has standing. This Court has sufficient evidence to support a declaration of invalidity because the constitutional question is essentially a matter of law. Moreover, based on the principles underlying judicial comity, this Court considered the reasoning in Chu to conduct its own legal analysis.\n\nI conclude that the Transitional Provisions have the effect of increasing punishment, thus violating both paragraphs 11(h) and 11(i) of the Charter. In the absence of any evidence to justify the violation, I also conclude that these provisions cannot be saved under section 1 of the Charter. Consequently, section 10 of the [Limiting Pardons for Serious Crimes Act, S.C. 2010, c. 5] and section 161 of the [Safe Streets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1] are declared to be constitutionally invalid and of no force or effect pursuant to subsection 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\nFinally, to remedy P.H.s individual situation, I will issue injunctive relief to require the Parole Board of Canada to consider his application for a record suspension in accordance with the provisions of the [Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-47] as they read at the time he committed the offence in June 2009.\nMr. Power could have applied for judicial review on Charter grounds of the decision to deny his application for a criminal record suspension. That remedy accords fully with Canadas constitutional arrangements. It would in no way detract from parliamentary privilege. \nConclusion\nThis Court has a responsibility to preserve the inheritance of Canadas constitutional order. But, the respondent calls on us to discard this and to subordinate parliamentary privilege to s. 24(1) of the Charter. To do so would be to depart from precedent and to do so unwisely.\nI would allow the Attorney General of Canadas appeal, and answer the questions posed as follows: \nQuestion 1: No. \nQuestion 2: No. \n\tAppeal dismissed with costs, Kasirer and Jamal JJ. dissenting in part and Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Department of Justice Canada  Prairie Region, Winnipeg; Department of Justice Canada  Atlantic Region, Halifax.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Trudel Johnston & Lesperance, Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, Civil Law Division  Constitutional Law Branch, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Ministere de la Justice du Quebec, Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Nova Scotia: Attorney General of Nova Scotia  Legal Services Division  Department of Justice, Halifax.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of New Brunswick: Attorney General of New Brunswick  Legal Services  Constitutional Group, Fredericton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Manitoba: Attorney General of Manitoba, Legal Services Branch  Constitutional Law Section, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Ministry of Attorney General, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Prince Edward Island: Attorney General of Prince Edward Island, Department of Justice & Public Safety, Charlottetown.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice and Attorney General  Constitutional Law Branch, Regina.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Justice  Constitutional and Aboriginal Law, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador: Department of Justice & Public Safety, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. Johns.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Fisher River Cree Nation, the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation, the Manto Sipi Cree Nation, and the Lake Manitoba First Nation: Sotos, Toronto; Cochrane Saxberg, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Quebec Native Women Inc.: Dionne Schulze, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Speaker of the Senate: Senate of Canada, Ottawa; Cochrane Saxberg, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights: Olthuis Van Ert, Ottawa; Megan Stephens Law, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Constitution Foundation: Baker & McKenzie, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Queens Prison Law Clinic: Koskie Minsky, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the John Howard Society of Canada: McCarthy Tetrault, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the West Coast Prison Justice Society: Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Speaker of the House of Commons: Gowling WLG (Canada), Ottawa.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside absolute immunity for the Crown in cases of unconstitutional legislation.\n\nThis appeal concerns the issue of whether damages can be awarded against the Crown for the enactment of legislation that is later declared unconstitutional.\n\nJoseph Power, the respondent, was convicted of two indictable offences in 1996 and served his sentence. He was subsequently denied a record suspension due to transitional provisions in the Limiting Pardons for Serious Crimes Act and the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which were later declared unconstitutional by provincial and federal courts. Power claimed that the changes were unconstitutional and sought damages under section 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Attorney General of Canada conceded that the changes were unconstitutional but argued that the Crown enjoys absolute immunity from damages for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation.\n\nThe motion judge and the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick held that the Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and that damages may be awarded under section 24(1) of the Charter for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation. The Supreme Court of Canada was asked to determine whether the Crown enjoys absolute immunity from damages under section 24(1) of the Charter for the preparation, drafting, and enactment of legislation. The Court ultimately dismissed the appeal, affirming the decisions of the lower courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada held that the state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes Charter rights, but rather enjoys a limited immunity in the exercise of its law-making power, which requires that the law was clearly unconstitutional, or that its enactment was in bad faith or an abuse of power.\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice and Karakatsanis J. held that the state may be liable for Charter damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or was enacted in bad faith or an abuse of power, striking a balance between the need for effective government and the need to hold the government accountable for infringing Charter rights. The Court's decision provides guidance on the circumstances in which damages may be awarded against the Crown for the enactment of unconstitutional legislation, establishing a high threshold for liability that requires a clear breach of Charter rights or bad faith on the part of the government.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that the state can be required to pay damages for making unconstitutional  legislation in limited circumstances.</strong>This appeal is about whether the state is immune from liability for  damages when it makes legislation that courts later find to be unconstitutional.  Immunity from liability for damages means a situation in which courts cannot  require the payment of such damages.Joseph Power says he applied for  a record suspension in 2013 but his application was denied. A record suspension  allows people who were convicted of a criminal offence, but have completed  their sentence and demonstrated that they are law-abiding citizens, to have  their criminal record kept separate and apart from other criminal records in  some circumstances. Mr. Power says his criminal record prevented him from  working in the field in which he had trained.At the time of Mr. Power\u2019s conviction  in 1996, persons convicted of indictable offences could apply for a record suspension five years  after their release. An indictable offence is a category of more serious criminal  offences. Legislation enacted in 2010 and 2012 rendered Mr. Power permanently ineligible  for a record suspension. This legislation was declared unconstitutional by  courts in other proceedings and the Attorney General of Canada agrees that it violates the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  Mr. Power says he is owed damages under s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter </em>for the breach of his rights caused by the enactment of the  legislation.The Attorney General of Canada asked  the court hearing Mr. Power\u2019s claim to answer two questions. First, can the  state be required to pay damages for governments preparing and drafting a Bill  that later became law, and was subsequently declared unconstitutional? Second,  can the state be required to pay damages for Parliament enacting a Bill into  law, which was later declared unconstitutional?The Court  of Queen\u2019s Bench of New Brunswick answered  \u201cyes\u201d to both questions, finding that the state was entitled to only a limited  immunity from <em>Charter</em> damages for  unconstitutional legislation. The Court of Appeal of New  Brunswick agreed and dismissed the Attorney General of Canada\u2019s  appeal. The Attorney General appealed to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has dismissed the  Attorney General\u2019s appeal.<strong> </strong><strong>The state may be required to pay damages for making  unconstitutional legislation if it is clearly unconstitutional, or was in bad  faith or an abuse of power.</strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice Wagner and Justice Karakatsanis held that the answer to both questions is  \u201cyes\u201d. The state is not entitled to an absolute immunity from liability for  damages when it enacts unconstitutional legislation that infringes <em>Charter</em> rights. Rather, it may be liable  for <em>Charter </em>damages if the legislation is clearly unconstitutional or  was in bad faith or an abuse of power. An absolute immunity fails to properly  reconcile the constitutional principles that protect legislative autonomy, such  as parliamentary sovereignty and parliamentary privilege, and the principles  that require the government be held accountable for infringing <em>Charter</em> rights, such as  constitutionality and the rule of law. Each of these principles constitutes an  essential part of Canada\u2019s constitutional law and they must all be respected to  achieve an appropriate separation of powers. By shielding the government from  liability in even the most egregious circumstances, absolute immunity would  subvert the principles that demand government accountability. "

A physical altercation ensued during which H used a chokehold to restrain the guest, who lost consciousness and died. The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that H caused the guests death by placing him in a chokehold. However, based on her assessment of the evidence, she acquitted H of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the requisite subjective mens rea. She also found H not guilty of the lesser included offence of manslaughter, finding that his defence of self-defence under s. 34 of the Criminal Code had an air of reality and that the Crown had failed to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crowns appeal of the acquittal and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis of the mens rea for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the acquittal restored.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Cote, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ.: The Crown has a limited right of appeal on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. In the instant case, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the precise errors of law at the root of its intervention and it is not a case in which the appellate court could reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the evidence without calling into question the trial judges evaluation of the evidence. Furthermore, even if the alleged errors were ones of law, the trial judge did not commit any such errors. While an inference that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action can be available in some cases, it is not an error of law for a trial judge to reach a different conclusion about a particular accuseds mens rea based on the evidence, and there was no error of law in the trial judges assessment of the evidence on the mens rea. As for self-defence, the trial judge followed the framework set out in the Criminal Code, specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found, and expressed clear conclusions on each element.\n\tThe Crowns ability to appeal an acquittal is circumscribed by s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. This provision provides that a courts jurisdiction to hear an appeal of an acquittal depends upon there being an error involving a question of law alone. The restricted nature of the Crowns ability to appeal from an acquittal has deep roots in the principles that underlie the Canadian criminal justice system. The most important justification behind the limited nature of the Crowns right of appeal lies in the principle against double jeopardy. Expanding the Crowns right of appeal beyond its proper scope would have a profound impact on the interests of accused persons, especially due to the considerable anxiety created by the prospect of a new trial after a person has been acquitted.\n\tThe scope of the Crowns right of appeal of an acquittal depends on what qualifies as a legal question. An appealable error must be traced to a question of law, rather than a question about how to weigh evidence and assess whether it meets the standard of proof. A trial judges alleged shortcomings in assessing the evidence may constitute an error of law giving rise to a Crown appeal of an acquittal where the trial judge made a finding of fact for which there is no evidence; there is disagreement with respect to the legal effect of findings of fact or of undisputed facts; an assessment of the evidence is based on a wrong legal principle; and there is a failure to consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence. However, even if the Crown is able to point to an error of law, acquittals are not overturned lightly. The Crown must also convince the appellate court, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the verdict of acquittal would not necessarily have been the same had the error not occurred.\n\tGiven the circumscribed ambit of the Crowns right of appeal from acquittals and the pressing policy considerations that underpin it, appellate courts should expressly identify the offending errors of law. A failure to precisely identify the error of law risks expanding Crown appeals beyond the scope of s. 676. This risk is especially high when the error pertains to an alleged shortcoming in the trial judges handling of the evidence. It is not enough to simply assert or state that a trial judge has committed a legal error with respect to their assessment of the evidence. Appellate courts should articulate with precision how the trial judge erred in law.\n\tIn the instant case, the Court of Appeal did not adequately explain why the error it claimed to have identified was one of law alone for the purposes of s. 676(1)(a). The court did not find fault with how the trial judge stated or interpreted the legal standard for the mental element for murder. Rather, it alleged that the error of law was based on how the trial judge assessed the evidence. The Court of Appeal did not state precisely what error of law it thought was committed in relation to the mens rea for murder. The absence of a clearly articulated error of law makes it difficult to conduct effective appellate review and makes it unclear as to whether the alleged error is one of law. In this case, there is no error of law.\n\tThere is no legal rule as to the general dangerousness of chokeholds. Each case must be assessed on its own facts. The dangerousness of a chokehold can vary based on factors such as its nature, force and length. The proposition that a chokehold is always an inherently dangerous act runs the risk of inappropriately injecting an objective element into the mens rea analysis for murder. The subjective foresight required for murder is focused solely on what the accused intended, and the analysis cannot consider what the accused ought to have known about the inherent dangerousness of a chokehold. Thus, when considering the mens rea for murder, a trial judge should not be and cannot be required to assess an accuseds intention against the fact that someone else in their position should have or would have been aware of the danger the chokehold posed. Accordingly, for an accused to be convicted of murder, it is not sufficient for the Crown to prove that a particular accused knew that a chokehold in the circumstances was dangerous or that a reasonable person in the accuseds position would have known that the chokehold would cause bodily harm that was likely to cause death. Neither of these findings would meet the requisite level of subjective intent required for a murder conviction, namely that the accused intended to cause death or that the accused intended to cause bodily harm that they knew was likely to cause death but was reckless as to whether or not death ensued.\n\tIn the instant case, the trial judge accepted that, at the time, H did not think the chokehold was inherently dangerous and that he also did not have time, in the midst of the altercation, to think about its dangerousness. The trial judge reviewed all the evidence in detail and ultimately concluded that she had a reasonable doubt as to whether H intended to kill the deceased or knew that the chokehold was likely to do so. The trial judges conclusion that there was no intent to murder was firmly grounded in the evidence pertaining to Hs subjective state of mind. The Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judges assessment that the chokehold used in these circumstances was intended to be a regular calm down method. Such a disagreement as to the characterization of a chokehold in these particular circumstances was not an error of law that justified overturning an acquittal.\n\tAn objective approach is applied to the aspects of the self-defence analysis that measure an accuseds actions against those of a reasonable person in similar circumstances. In the instant case, the trial judges reasons make clear that she understood she was to assess whether Hs actions were reasonable in the circumstances and she repeatedly and expressly referred to the appropriate objective standard. The trial judge did not inappropriately focus on what H himself thought at the time of the impugned conduct. The Court of Appeals failure to clearly identify which element of the self-defence inquiry was engaged was problematic as each has its own considerations and methods of evaluation. There were no grounds for concluding that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis or in her application of the law on self-defence.\n\tPer Rowe J.: There is agreement with the majority that self-defence applies and that the acquittal should be restored. However, separate reasons to clarify the Crowns right to appeal an acquittal are necessary. While the majority emphasizes that the Crowns right to appeal an acquittal is narrow and limited, there is an exception that warrants note. As myths relating to sexual assault have been characterized as errors of law, where the Crown characterizes an aspect of a trial judges reasons as incorporating a myth, it would meet the requirement that the appeal be on a question of law alone.\nCases Cited\nBy Martin and Moreau JJ.\n\tApplied: R. v.

Purser and Daniel J. Song, K.C., for the intervener the Criminal Trial Lawyers Association.\nThe reasons for judgment of Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Cote, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ. were delivered by\n\tMartin and Moreau JJ.  \n\nIntroduction\nThe appellant, Daniel Hodgson, was acquitted of second degree murder following a trial by judge alone. He attended a house party, and was asked to assist with removing Bradley Winsor, another guest, who refused to leave despite repeated requests to do so. A physical altercation ensued during which Mr. Hodgson used a chokehold to restrain Mr. Winsor, who lost consciousness. Tragically, and despite resuscitation attempts, Mr. Winsor died. The trial judge found that Mr. Hodgson lacked the mens rea for murder and that because he used the chokehold as a means of self-defence to protect himself and others attending the party, he had a defence to the lesser included offence of manslaughter.\nThe Crown appealed, arguing that this was one of the exceptional cases in which the trial judge had committed an error of law that would allow an appellate court to review and reverse an acquittal. The Nunavut Court of Appeal agreed and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis of the mens rea for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. \nOn further appeal to this Court, after the hearing, we restored Mr. Hodgsons verdict of acquittal and stated that written reasons would follow. These are those reasons.\nFirst, we explain the foundations of the Crowns limited right of appeal on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. Second, we address whether the trial judge was required as a matter of law to accept that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action when assessing the mens rea for murder. We conclude that while this inference is available in some cases, it is not an error of law for a trial judge to reach a different conclusion about a particular accuseds mens rea based on the evidence. Third, we explain why there is no legal error in the trial judges approach to self-defence. While she did not have the benefit of this Courts reasoning in R. v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37, her analysis aligns with its principles. She correctly understood what was required under each of the statutory elements in s. 34 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. We are therefore of the view that the trial judge made no errors of law in her reasons. \nFacts\nMr. Hodgson and Mr. Winsor (the deceased) both attended a house party in Iqaluit on the evening of May 18, 2017. Earlier in the night, Mr. Hodgson and Mantra Ford-Perkins were out celebrating a friends birthday. They ran into Crystal Mullin and two others (Margaret Sikkinerk and Samantha Mullin). Crystal Mullin invited all of them to her home. Shawn Burke and his friend, Mr. Winsor, were out on their own and were also invited to Crystal Mullins home. All of the house party attendees were socializing and drinking together. Mr. Winsor became increasingly intoxicated throughout the night and had, at some point, also consumed cocaine. At various points throughout the night, Mr. Winsor had behaved inappropriately towards Crystal Mullin. For example, when Crystal Mullin had been heading towards her bedroom, Mr. Winsor was aggressive and tried to get into her room because he wanted to be physically intimate with her. \nAs a result of Mr. Winsors intoxication, Mr. Burke began to repeatedly ask Mr. Winsor to turn over his truck keys so that Mr. Winsor would not drive while intoxicated. Mr. Burke also repeatedly asked Mr. Winsor to leave Crystal Mullins home. Mr. Winsor refused to do either. Eventually, a physical altercation broke out between Mr. Burke and Mr. Winsor during which Mr. Winsor pushed Mr. Burke against a wall. \nDuring this period, Mr. Hodgson was sleeping in a nearby spare bedroom. Ms. Ford-Perkins woke Mr. Hodgson to ask for his help in dealing with the situation between Mr. Burke and Mr. Winsor. At the time, Mr. Hodgson was 38 years old, 6 feet tall, weighed 210 pounds and was quite strong. Mr. Winsor was 23 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 304 pounds. Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Winsor had not had any prior relationship, interaction or communication before that night but had spoken to each other during the house party. There were no indications of any bad blood between them. \nMr. Hodgson left the bedroom and intervened in the altercation between Mr. Burke and Mr. Winsor after he believed that he saw Mr. Winsor make a fist. At the time, Mr. Hodgsons dominant hand was injured. Mr. Hodgson unsuccessfully tried to pull Mr. Winsor to the ground by pulling on his shoulders from behind. Mr. Winsor responded by elbowing Mr. Hodgson in the head. Mr. Hodgson then put Mr. Winsor in a chokehold. As Mr. Winsor and Mr. Hodgson struggled, the two fell to the floor. \nAt this point, Crystal Mullin, Ms. Sikkinerk and Samantha Mullin had entered the living room, where the altercation was taking place. They, along with Mr. Burke, shouted at Mr. Hodgson to stop. Mr. Burke noticed that Mr. Winsors face was turning blue and that Mr. Hodgson was not listening to their calls for him to stop. Mr. Burke then pulled Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Winsor apart. The chokehold incident was over quite quickly, and the eyewitnesses were all surprised that Mr. Winsor did not recover. Samantha Mullin called an ambulance. Ms. Sikkinerk and Mr. Burke performed CPR on Mr. Winsor, but he died from his injuries. \nJudgments Below\nNunavut Court of Justice (Charlesworth J.)\nThe evidence before the court included an agreed statement of facts, the testimony of Mr. Hodgson and the individuals at the party, and expert evidence from the Crown and defence opining on the cause of death. It was not disputed that a significant amount of pressure fractured Mr. Winsors hyoid bone, bruised the muscles in his neck, and caused internal hemorrhaging. Neck compression can lead to unconsciousness in as little as 10 seconds, but it is not uncommon for someone to become unconscious and survive without permanent injury. While the pathologists saw the neck compression as the primary factor in Mr. Winsors death, they disagreed as to the role other factors may have played in causing it. Dr. Chiasson, the defence pathologist, viewed Mr. Winsors enlarged heart and the consumption of alcohol and cocaine as contributing factors to his death. The Crown expert, Dr. Milroy, disagreed, although he acknowledged that these factors could make Mr. Winsor less likely to survive the chokehold. \nThe trial judge conducted a thorough review of the evidence of Mr. Hodgson and each witness and made explicit findings of facts, including conclusions on credibility and reliability. \nThe trial judge found that it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson caused Mr. Winsors death by placing Mr. Winsor in a chokehold. However, based on the trial judges assessment of the evidence, she acquitted Mr. Hodgson of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the requisite subjective mens rea attaching to this serious crime, that is, proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson intended to kill or intended to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to kill (trial reasons, at para. 93, reproduced in A.R., part I, at p. 24).  \nThe trial judge determined that all requirements for manslaughter, including the mental element, were present as Mr. Hodgson caused Mr. Winsors death by the unlawful act of intentionally applying force to Mr. Winsor without his consent. The trial judge next considered Mr. Hodgsons claim to have acted in self-defence and defence of others under s. 34 of the Criminal Code. She concluded that the defence had an air of reality and then went on to consider each of the elements of s. 34 of the Criminal Code. She found, with respect to s. 34(1)(a), that Mr. Hodgson believed on reasonable grounds that Mr. Winsor was making a threat of force against the others. In relation to s. 34(1)(b), Mr. Hodgson used the chokehold for the purpose of defending or protecting himself and the others from the threat posed by Mr. Winsor. As to s. 34(1)(c), the trial judge considered each of the factors set out in s. 34(2), related each factor to the facts as she found them, and concluded that the Crown had failed to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. While indicating that proportionality was the factor causing the most concern, the trial judge found that Dr. Chiassons evidence raised the possibility that the chokehold may have only been fatal because of factors specific to Mr. Winsor, which were not known to Mr. Hodgson. Given her doubt as to whether Mr. Hodgsons use of a chokehold was disproportionate in the circumstances, the trial judge found Mr. Hodgson not guilty of manslaughter.\nNunavut Court of Appeal, 2022 NUCA 9 (Schutz, Campbell and Pentelechuk JJ.A.)\nIn a brief decision, the Nunavut Court of Appeal allowed the Crowns appeal from the acquittal and ordered a new trial. \nThe court was of the view that the trial judge erred in failing to address the Crowns argument based on R. v. Lemmon, 2012 ABCA 103, 65 Alta. L.R. (5th) 177, that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous act. The critical portion of the Court of Appeals reasons in respect of the perceived errors concerning the mens rea for murder is set out in para. 5 (CanLII):\n. . . the trial judge did not address [the issue of inherent dangerousness] in her reasons for acquittal, either in respect of the intent for murder or manslaughter, but, rather, appeared to accept that a chokehold was a regular calm down method or a known calm down move. While [Mr. Hodgson] admitted he was trying to stop Mr Winsor from struggling, including possibly rendering him unconscious, the trial judge did not assess this evidence with respect to what [Mr. Hodgson] believed or intended considering the dangerousness of squeezing Mr Winsors neck to the point of unconsciousness, or the possible recklessness of his actions. But for this error, the verdict on second degree murder may well have been different. [Emphasis added.]\nWith respect to self-defence, the Nunavut Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in law by failing to assess Mr. Hodgsons actions in relation to what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances. Instead of doing so, the trial judge assessed Mr. Hodgsons response through a purely subjective lens.\nThe court concluded that the Crown had met its burden of demonstrating that the errors of law had a material bearing on the acquittal.\nIssues\nThis appeal raises three issues:\nWhat does it mean that a Crown appeal of an acquittal under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code is limited to a ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone?\nDid the trial judge err in law regarding the mens rea for second degree murder?\nDid the trial judge err in law in relation to self-defence?\nWhat Does It Mean That a Crown Appeal of an Acquittal Under Section 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code Is Limited to a Ground of Appeal That Involves a Question of Law Alone?\nIn Canadian law, the Crowns ability to appeal an acquittal is circumscribed by s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. It reads:\n676 (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal\n(a) against a judgment or verdict of acquittal or a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder of a trial court in proceedings by indictment on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone;\nA courts jurisdiction to hear and address an appeal of an acquittal thus depends upon there being an error involving a question of law alone. \nMr. Hodgson concedes that the error identified by the Court of Appeal in relation to self-defence, if made, would qualify as an error of law under s. 676(1)(a). However, with respect to the mens rea for murder, Mr. Hodgson submits there was no question or error of law that would allow the Court of Appeal to intervene.\nTo address this argument, we look to the principles and historical foundations informing the narrow scope of the Crowns right to appeal from an acquittal; canvass the meaning of the term question of law alone; give guidance on the level of specificity that Crown counsel and appellate courts must provide when invoking a question of law alone to overturn an acquittal; and explain why the Court of Appeal failed to identify an error of law with respect to the intent for murder. \nHistorical Foundations of the Crowns Limited Right of Appeal\nThe restricted nature of the Crowns ability to appeal from an acquittal has deep roots in the principles that underlie our criminal justice system and was [translation] [d]eveloped in a particular historical context characterized by the reluctance of Anglo-Canadian law to allow for [it] (LSJPA  151, 2015 QCCA 35, at para. 57 (CanLII), per Kasirer J.A., as he then was). Indeed, [t]here is a historical aversion to Crown appeals that grounds the differing limitations placed on appellate access as between the Crown and a convicted person (R. v. Budai, 2001 BCCA 349, 153 B.C.A.C. 98, at para. 123, per Ryan J.A.).\nHistorically, the Crowns ability to appeal from an acquittal in Canada has been limited to questions of law alone. Although the provisions that set out the Crowns right of appeal have evolved over the years, this constraint has remained consistent. For example, when Canadas Criminal Code was enacted in 1892, an appeal by the Crown against an acquittal was possible only when a question of law had been reserved for the opinion of the Court of Appeal or through a leave process which allowed the case to proceed as though the question had been reserved (Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616, at p. 662; see The Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, ss. 743 and 744; see also B. L. Berger, Criminal Appeals as Jury Control: An Anglo-Canadian Historical Perspective on the Rise of Criminal Appeals (2006), 10 Can. Crim. L.R. 1, at p. 36). There were further amendments in 1900 and 1909, and the Crowns right to appeal an acquittal on a question of law was repealed altogether in 1923 (S.C. 1923, c. 41, s. 9). It is not clear whether this removal was intentional, but the right was later restored in 1930 (Morgentaler, at pp. 662-63; see the explanatory note accompanying s. 38 of House of Commons Bill 138, An Act to amend the Criminal Code, 4th Sess., 16th Parl., 1930 (first reading, May 14, 1930)). The amended text of the relevant provision, s. 1013(4) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, granted the Attorney General the right to appeal an acquittal on an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone (S.C. 1930, c. 11, s. 28). Unlike previous iterations of the Crowns ability to appeal from an acquittal, this amendment did not include a requirement of leave by the trial judge or the Court of Appeal (see the discussion of the 1900 and 1909 amendments in Morgentaler, at p. 662). \nThis latter amendment  which also reflects the present law  has been described as an extraordinary remedy (Department of Justice and Public Safety, Guide Book of Policies and Procedures for the Conduct of Criminal Prosecutions in Newfoundland and Labrador, 2022 (online), at p. 23-2). The Crowns ability to appeal an acquittal has been viewed as an innovation in the procedure of criminal law that was a striking departure from fundamental principles of security for the individual (Cullen v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 658, at pp. 665-66, per Rand J., dissenting), having created an exception to the general rule that no person should be tried twice on the same charge (Guide Book of Policies and Procedures for the Conduct of Criminal Prosecutions in Newfoundland and Labrador, at p. 23-2). Commentators have referred to it as drastic, exceptional, special, unusual and limited in an extrem[e] or narrow manner (see, e.g., Wexler v. The King, [1939] S.C.R. 350, at p. 358; Rose v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 441, at p. 442; R. v. Podetz (1981), 26 A.R. 307 (C.A.), at para. 10; R. v. W.F.M. (1995), 169 A.R. 222 (C.A.), at para. 5; M. L. Friedland, Double Jeopardy (1969), at p. 295; R. v. Orlin (1945), 85 C.C.C. 150 (Que. K.B. (App. Side)), at p. 153; R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 33; R. v. Rudge, 2011 ONCA 791, 108 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 35). \nMany other countries also restrict Crown appeals from acquittals. Indeed, the Crowns right of appeal from an acquittal is broader in Canada than in most other common law jurisdictions (see R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 46, and R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 13, both citing R. v. Evans, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 629, at pp. 645-46). The United Kingdom imposes significant limitations on the scope of Crown appeals (see Criminal Justice Act 2003 (U.K.), 2003, c. 44, ss. 57(4), 63, 67, 76(3), 76(4), 77, 78 and 79; H. Stewart, Procedural Rights and Factual Accuracy (2020), 26 Legal Theory 156, at pp. 170-71), and many foreign jurisdictions do not allow appeals from acquittals at all (see S. Coughlan, Criminal Procedure (4th ed. 2020), at p. 587). \nRationales for the Crowns Limited Right of Appeal\nThe absence of a principle of parity of appellate access in the criminal process as between the Crown and the accused is explained on the basis of the different policy considerations underlying the Crowns right of appeal against acquittals (Biniaris, at para. 33). \nAvoiding wrongful convictions is one rationale that explains why the scope of the accuseds right of appeal is wider than the Crowns. As explained in Biniaris, [e]rror-free trials are desirable as such, but even more so as a safeguard against wrongful convictions (para. 26). \nIn the case of jury trials, appellate courts respect for a jury acquittal is another reason for limiting the Crowns right of appeal to questions of law alone (T. Desjardins, Lappel en droit criminel et penal (2nd ed. 2012), at para. 72). \nThe most important justification behind the limited nature of the Crowns right of appeal, however, lies in the principle against double jeopardy. In the United States, it is for this reason that the Supreme Court has concluded that an appeal against an acquittal would violate the Fifth Amendment (see, e.g., McElrath v. Georgia, 601 U.S. 87 (2024), at p. 94). The protection against double jeopardy is also part of the framework that governs the Crowns ability to obtain a retrial after an acquittal in the United Kingdom (Criminal Justice Act 2003, s. 76(4)(c)). \nThis rationale is also crucial in Canadian law. Our Court has held that the Crowns ability to appeal an acquittal does not violate s. 11(h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 155-56, per McIntyre J., dissenting, but not on this point). Nevertheless, as Kasirer J.A. noted in LSJPA  151, the Crowns [translation] limited right of appeal seeks to prevent an appeal on the facts to protect acquitted persons from the double jeopardy associated with a new trial (para. 57 (footnote omitted)). As explained in Cullen, [a]t the foundation of criminal law lies the cardinal principle that no [individual] shall be placed in jeopardy twice for the same matter . . . . It is the supreme invasion of the rights of an individual to subject [that individual] by the physical power of the community to a test which may mean the loss of [their] liberty or [their] life; and there is a basic repugnance against the repeated exercise of that power on the same facts unless for strong reasons of public policy (p. 668). \nThus, expanding the Crowns right of appeal beyond its proper scope would have a profound impact on the interests of accused persons, especially due to the considerable anxiety created by the prospect of a new trial after a person has been acquitted (see Budai, at para. 125, quoting R. v. Potvin, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 880, at p. 890, per McLachlin J., concurring in the result). Allowing the Crowns restricted right of appeal to expand beyond its scope would undermine the provisions protection against wrongful convictions and double jeopardy. \nDefining the Scope of the Crowns Limited Right of Appeal\nThe history and rationale of s. 676(1)(a) is important for understanding the purpose and scope of the Crowns limited right of appeal and helps answer the vexed question of what constitutes, for jurisdictional purposes, an error of law alone (see R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 24). In Biniaris, this Court held that a question of law alone is used in contrast to the right of the accused to appeal both on questions of law, questions of fact, and questions of mixed fact and law (para. 30). The Court declined the invitation to distinguish between a question of law alone and a question of law, holding that there is nothing different between them and that both terms must receive the same interpretation (para. 31).\nConsequently, the scope of the Crowns right of appeal of an acquittal depends on what qualifies as a legal question. This assessment will generally turn on the character of the alleged error, rather than on its severity (R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 17). A legal question generally flows from an accepted or uncontested factual situation; the appellate court can then reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the evidence without calling into question the trial judges evaluation of the evidence (M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2023 (30th ed. 2023), at para. 51.55). Clear examples of legal questions which do not depend on the facts of a given case include, for instance, statutory interpretation, the scope of a constitutional right, and the definition of the essential elements of an offence (para. 51.58).\nIn other situations, drawing the line between questions of law and questions of fact or of mixed fact and law can become more challenging. This is often the case when the alleged error concerns a trial judges assessment of the evidence. As this Court explained in R. v. Chung, 2020 SCC 8, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 405, [a]n appealable error must be traced to a question of law, rather than a question about how to weigh evidence and assess whether it meets the standard of proof (para. 10 (citations omitted)). There are, however, situations in which a trial judges alleged shortcomings in assessing the evidence constitute an error of law giving rise to a Crown appeal of an acquittal (J.M.H., at para. 24).\nIn J.M.H., the Court identified four non-exhaustive such situations:\nMaking a finding of fact for which there is no evidence  however, a conclusion that the trier of fact has a reasonable doubt is not a finding of fact for the purposes of this rule;\nThe legal effect of findings of fact or of undisputed facts;\nAn assessment of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle;\nA failure to consider all of the evidence in relation to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.\nEven if the Crown is able to point to an error of law, acquittals are not overturned lightly (see R. v. Cowan, 2021 SCC 45, at para. 46). The Crown must also convince the appellate court, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the verdict of acquittal would not necessarily have been the same had the error not occurred (Graveline, at para. 15; R. v. Sutton, 2000 SCC 50, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 595, at para. 2). While the Crown need not persuade the appellate court that the verdict would necessarily have been different, its burden in this respect is a very heavy one (see Graveline, at paras. 14-15 and 19, quoting R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at p. 374; see also Sutton, at para. 2). \nFailure to Articulate an Error of Law for the Mens Rea for Murder\nThe Court of Appeal did not find fault with how the trial judge stated or interpreted the legal standard for the mental element for murder. Rather, the court alleged that the error of law was based on how the trial judge assessed the evidence regarding the characterization of a chokehold and the weight assigned to its gravity. Specifically, she failed to apply Lemmon and did not assess this evidence with respect to what [Mr. Hodgson] believed or intended considering the dangerousness of squeezing Mr Winsors neck to the point of unconsciousness, or the possible recklessness of his actions (para. 5).\nWith respect, there are two main problems with this approach. First, we are not convinced that the Court of Appeal articulated an error of law with respect to the trial judges handling of the mental element for murder. Second, the Court of Appeal did not adequately explain why the error it claimed to have identified was one of law alone for the purposes of s. 676(1)(a). It acknowledged that Crown appeals are limited to errors of law that have a material bearing on the acquittal and then asserted at para. 9: Having reviewed the evidence and the reasons in this matter, we find [the Crown] has met that burden in this case and appellate intervention is warranted. However, the Court of Appeal did not state precisely what error of law it thought was committed in relation to the mens rea for murder. The absence of a clearly articulated error of law makes it difficult to conduct effective appellate review (see R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869). \nGiven the circumscribed ambit of the Crowns right of appeal from acquittals and the pressing policy considerations that underpin it, appellate courts should expressly identify the offending errors of law. Courts and counsel must remain vigilant in this regard, because it is sometimes difficult to distinguish questions of law alone from questions of mixed fact and law or from questions of fact. Courts especially must remain vigilant because [i]t is not usually difficult for an experienced Crown counsel to frame an appeal in language suggesting that a question of law is there involved when in fact it is not (R. v. Odeon Morton Theatres Ltd., [1974] 3 W.W.R. 304 (Man. C.A.), at pp. 304-5; see also R. v. Chatwin Motors Ltd., [1980] 2 S.C.R. 64, at p. 76, quoting this passage with approval).\nA failure to precisely identify the error of law risks expanding Crown appeals beyond the scope of s. 676. This risk is especially high when the error pertains to an alleged shortcoming in the trial judges handling of the evidence. Such expansion would undermine important principles, including that against double jeopardy. Thus, it is not enough to simply assert or state that a trial judge has committed a legal error with respect to their assessment of the evidence. Appellate courts should articulate with precision how the trial judge erred in law.\nBeyond invoking two decisions  Lemmon and R. v. Cooper, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146  the Court of Appeal did not explain why the error it claims to have identified with respect to the intent for murder is one of law. On this point, it is worth noting that [t]he determination of the intent or foresight of a person at the time of his participation in a homicide is often a difficult question of fact (Biniaris, at para. 51 (emphasis added); see also, on intent as a question of fact, Schuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, at pp. 599-600, and R. v. B. (G.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 57, at pp. 68-69). We agree with Mr. Hodgson that, in this case, the determination of criminal intent was a quintessential factual conclusion based on an assessment of the evidence by the trier of fact. As stated in George, at para. 24: . . . no legal error arises from mere disagreements over factual inferences or the weight of evidence . . . .\nThe Crown identified the error of law as the trial judges failure to consider the inherent dangerousness of the chokehold used by Mr. Hodgson. The Crown claims the legal errors committed fall within the second, third and fourth categories from J.M.H., in that the trial judge erred in relation to the legal effect of findings of fact, assessed evidence based on a wrong legal principle or failed to consider all of the evidence in relation to guilt or innocence. \nWe disagree; the alleged error is not one of law. As this Court explained in Chung, the second and third errors identified in J.M.H. address errors where the trial judges application of the legal principles to the evidence demonstrates an erroneous understanding of the law, either because the trial judge finds all the facts necessary to meet the test but errs in law in its application, or assesses the evidence in a way that otherwise indicates a misapprehension of the law (Chung, at para. 11 (emphasis added)). It is this erroneous understanding or misapprehension of the law that an appellate court must precisely identify and articulate when overturning an acquittal. For example, if a court concludes that the trial judge erred in assessing the evidence based on the wrong legal principle, it should explain which principle is at issue, which of its components or aspects is at the root of the error, and how the trial judges reasons demonstrate an erroneous understanding or misapprehension of that component or aspect. With respect, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the precise error of law at the root of its intervention. This is not a case in which the appellate court can reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the evidence without calling into question the trial judges evaluation of the evidence.\nFurthermore, even if we proceed on the basis that the alleged errors are ones of law, as we explain in the next section, the trial judge did not commit any such errors. \nDid the Trial Judge Err in Law Regarding the Mens Rea for Second Degree Murder?\nThe Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in her analysis of the mens rea for murder by not considering the proposition, from Lemmon, that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous act (C.A. reasons, at para. 5). The court was also of the view that blocking someones airway is always an act which is more than merely transient or trifling in nature (para. 6). \nWe instead conclude that the trial judge made no error of law concerning the mens rea for murder. The Court of Appeals approach on this point inappropriately imported an objective element to the assessment of the mens rea for murder and read the Lemmon case too widely. Nor was the trial judge required to mention the proposed common sense inference that Mr. Hodgson intended to kill Mr. Winsor because the natural and probable consequence of choking someone forcefully to the point of unconsciousness is death. This argument erroneously discredits the trial judges specific findings as to Mr. Hodgsons mens rea based on a generally available inference. In the result, the Court of Appeal effectively reweighed the evidence in a manner not available to an appellate court. \nThe Legal Test for Mens Rea\nThe Court of Appeals reference to the proposition that a blocked airway is more than a transient or trifling injury relates only to the mens rea for manslaughter  which requires an objective foreseeability of the risk of bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory in the context of a dangerous act (R. v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, at p. 961; R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 44-45). Foreseeability of death is not required. The objective mens rea of manslaughter is not concerned with what the accused intended or knew; rather, the mental fault lies in failure to direct the mind to a risk which the reasonable person would have appreciated (Creighton, at p. 58). Thus, a conviction for manslaughter requires that the underlying unlawful act be one that is objectively dangerous (p. 43). The trial judge understood this framework; it is clear from her reasons that she considered the objective dangerousness of a chokehold and that in the absence of self-defence, Mr. Hodgson had the requisite objective mental fault to be found guilty of manslaughter.\nIn contrast, a conviction for murder cannot rest on anything less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight (R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, at p. 654 (emphasis added); R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633, at p. 646). Murder is distinguished from manslaughter only by the mental element with respect to the death (Vaillancourt, at p. 654, quoted in Creighton, at p. 17, per Lamer C.J., concurring). The requisite intent for murder is an intent to kill or an intent to cause bodily harm that the offender knows is likely to cause death and is reckless as to whether or not death ensues (R. v. Walle, 2012 SCC 41, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 438, at para. 3). \nA conviction for murder requires subjective intent because it is an offence that carries with it the most severe stigma and punishment of any crime in our society (Martineau, at p. 645). The law requires subjective foresight of death because the criminal liability for murder is of the highest kind and cannot be justified except where the actor possesses a culpable mental state in respect of that result (Martineau, at p. 645, citing R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833). Thus, the harsh stigma and punishment associated with murder is reserved for those who choose to intentionally cause death or who choose to inflict bodily harm that they know is likely to cause death (Martineau, at p. 646).\nGiven this rationale, any slippage from the high bar of subjective intent required for murder must be avoided. The accuseds actions are not to be measured against the objective standard of a reasonable person in the same circumstances. The mens rea for murder requires more than an intention to cause bodily harm that the accused knew was dangerous; an accused must have intended to cause bodily harm that they knew was likely to cause death. Thus, the proposition that a chokehold is always an inherently dangerous act runs the risk of inappropriately injecting an objective element into the mens rea analysis for murder. This is because the subjective foresight required for murder is focused solely on what the accused intended, and the analysis cannot consider what the accused ought to have known about the inherent dangerousness of a chokehold.  \nThus, when considering the mens rea for murder, a trial judge should not be (and indeed cannot be) required to assess an accuseds intention against the fact that someone else in their position should have or would have been aware of the danger the chokehold posed. Accordingly, for an accused to be convicted of murder, it is not sufficient for the Crown to prove that a particular accused knew that a chokehold in the circumstances was dangerous or that a reasonable person in the accuseds position would have known that the chokehold would cause bodily harm that was likely to cause death. Neither of these findings would meet the requisite level of subjective intent required for a murder conviction, namely that the accused intended to cause death or that the accused intended to cause bodily harm that they knew was likely to cause death but was reckless as to whether or not death ensued. \nConsequently, accepting the proposition that a chokehold is always an inherently dangerous act in every case would inappropriately import an objective element into the analysis of the mens rea of murder. Accepting this proposition would also usurp the role of the trier of fact, who must assess the dangerousness of a chokehold based on the facts of the particular case.\nIn light of the fact that the trial judge in this case found that Mr. Hodgson would have been guilty of manslaughter if not for the act having been committed in self-defence, or in defence of others, it is clear that she properly considered that a chokehold can be dangerous. Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that, as a method of restraint, chokeholds can certainly carry with them a degree of danger. As Dr. Milroy explained, strangulation prevents breathing and deprives the brain of blood and, thereby, of oxygen. Thus, unlike a headlock  which merely immobilizes someone by limiting their movement  a neck compression chokehold can rapidly lead to unconsciousness. The tragic consequences that Mr. Winsor suffered, including serious injuries in addition to a loss of consciousness and death, speak to how dangerous chokeholds can be.\nHowever, in respect of the subjective mens rea for murder, the trial judge accepted the testimony of Mr. Hodgson as to his state of mind when he used the chokehold on Mr. Winsor. Mr. Hodgson testified that the chokehold was meant to restrain [Mr. Winsor] and try and throw him to the ground and that he maintained the chokehold until Mr. Winsor stopped struggling because he was afraid of Mr. Winsor (transcript, reproduced in A.R., part V, at pp. 423-24). The trial judge accepted that, at the time, Mr. Hodgson did not think the chokehold was inherently dangerous and that he also did not have time, in the midst of the altercation, to think about its dangerousness. His personal experience included viewing videos in the media of law enforcement using chokeholds to induce unconsciousness; he witnessed such a technique used effectively when he was a bouncer in 1998 and had used it himself in 2016. Although the person he had used it on in 2016 was rendered unconscious, that person did not die and instead got up and started fighting immediately after (p. 446). While Mr. Hodgson acknowledged seeing news stories of people dying as a result of being placed in chokeholds by police, he testified that he could not say for sure whether he knew that chokeholds were dangerous at the time of the party (p. 462).\nThe trial judge also considered other available evidence that could realistically bear on Mr. Hodgsons intent, including the circumstances in which Mr. Hodgson became involved in the altercation, the short duration of the chokehold, the evidence of the other guests who were surprised that Mr. Winsor did not recover quickly after being put in the chokehold, and the experts opinions on how long it might take for a chokehold to lead to unconsciousness and death. She found that this party suddenly took an unpleasant turn; Mr. Hodgson was asked to intervene and he did what he could to control Mr. Winsor (para. 94). The trial judge also accepted that Mr. Hodgsons injured right hand meant many [other] forms of potential control were likely unavailable (para. 120). When Mr. Hodgson initially tried to pull Mr. Winsor away from the confrontation, he elbowed Mr. Hodgson in the head, and the trial judge accepted that it did not appear that non-physical means were reducing the threat Mr. Winsor posed at the time. Mr. Hodgson only put Mr. Winsor in a chokehold for a fairly short period of time, and everyone at the party was surprised that Mr. Winsor was not responsive afterwards (para. 94).\nThe trial judge characterized the chokehold as a known calm down move that would have seemed proportional in all of the circumstances (para. 120). In this case, it was open to the trial judge to make this factual finding. Mr. Burke testified that he had seen the chokehold manoeuvre used on others and believed the chokehold that Mr. Hodgson used was just a regular calm down method. One of the experts also testified that the same type of chokehold is regularly used in martial arts. \nThe trial judge reviewed all this evidence in detail and ultimately concluded that she had a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr. Hodgson intended to kill Mr. Winsor or knew that the chokehold was likely to do so. She found there was no evidence that satisfie[d] [her] beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson intended to cause death or knew that what he did would have that result (para. 97 (emphasis added)). Her conclusion that there was no intent to murder was firmly grounded in the evidence pertaining to Mr. Hodgsons subjective state of mind. \nWith respect, the Court of Appeal seems to have simply disagreed with the trial judges assessment that the chokehold used in these circumstances was intended to be a regular calm down method. Such a disagreement as to the characterization of a chokehold in these particular circumstances is not an error of law that justifies overturning an acquittal.\nNo Error of Law in Respect of Lemmon and Cooper  \nIn Lemmon, the Alberta Court of Appeal noted that chokeholds are, by their very nature, inherently dangerous. The Court of Appeal in the present case quoted Lemmon for the proposition that\n[r]endering a person unconscious, whether by choking, strangulation or suffocation, is an inherently dangerous act that is easily capable of causing death, or brain injury with devastating lifelong consequences. . . . The difference in the outcome, between unconsciousness, brain damage and death, may be only a matter of a few additional seconds of pressure.\n\n(C.A. reasons, at para. 6, quoting Lemmon, at para. 28.)\nRespectfully, Lemmon is being read too widely if taken to establish a general legal proposition that a chokehold is always an inherently dangerous act. Lemmon was a sentencing decision in which the Alberta Court of Appeal was commenting on the gravity of offences committed under s. 246 of the Criminal Code, in which the attempt to choke, suffocate, or strangle another person is for the purpose of rendering another person insensible, unconscious or incapable of resistance: in essence, to overcom[e] resistance to [the] commission of [an] offence (para. 26). In Lemmon, the accused choked the victim to unconsciousness for the purpose of subduing her and sexually assaulting her. In such a case, the very purpose and intent behind the act of choking was for the accused to overcome the intended victim by rendering her unconscious in order to commit another indictable offence. That there is an inherently dangerous quality to such actions, however, does not mean that trial judges must in every case conclude that every chokehold or action that affects a persons airways is always an inherently dangerous act.\nThe Court of Appeal also quoted this Courts statement in Cooper, indicating that [s]ince breathing is essential to life, it would be reasonable [though not required] to infer the accused knew that strangulation was likely to result in death (C.A. reasons, at para. 6 (text in brackets in original), quoting Cooper, at p. 159). \nIn Cooper, the accused was mad at the victim, grabbed her by the throat with both hands and choked her for up to two minutes until she died. Based on this specific evidence, it was open to the trier of fact to infer [that] the accused knew that strangulation was likely to result in death because breathing is essential to life (p. 159). However, the Court also specifically stressed that the jury was, of course, not required to make such an inference (p. 159 (emphasis added)). Accordingly, Cooper should not be read as a blanket legal statement as to the dangerousness of all forms of chokeholds in every scenario.\nThe dangerousness of a chokehold can vary based on factors such as its nature, force and length. For example, Dr. Milroy explained that certain recreational martial arts forms use chokeholds similar to the one Mr. Hodgson used in order to render a person unconscious or nearly unconscious. Even in that context, however, it is possible for chokeholds to have fatal consequences. In assessing the facts of each case, trial judges must be fully attuned to the potential dangerousness of the chokehold before them. The Court, however, cannot pre-emptively establish a single way of characterizing chokeholds. There is thus no legal rule that follows from either Lemmon or Cooper as to the general dangerousness of chokeholds. Rather, each case must be assessed on its own facts. \nFurther, while the Crown made arguments based on the Lemmon case, the trial judge committed no error by failing to refer to it by name or to explicitly deal with this authority. According to R. v. Morin, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 286, at p. 296, there is no obligation in law on a trial judge to record all or any specific part of the process of deliberation on the facts.\nDid the Trial Judge Err in Law in Failing to Consider the Common Sense Inference? \nThe Crown next argues that the trial judge erred in law by failing to consider the common sense inference, namely that sane and sober individuals intend the natural and probable consequences of their actions, in light of all the relevant evidence (Walle, at paras. 58-63). The common sense inference the Crown proposes is that choking someone forcefully to the point of unconsciousness amounts to an intentional infliction of bodily harm where the natural consequence is death. \nWe are of the view that this argument is ill founded. While it was certainly open to the trial judge to consider the common sense inference, she was not bound to draw it.\nWhile the common sense inference can serve as a helpful marker against which to measure the rather amorphous concept of intent, it does not replace a trial judges evaluation of subjective intent (Walle, at para. 63). It is a permissive inference, not a presumptive one (R. v. Seymour, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 252, at para. 20; R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 104; Walle, at para. 63). Thus, it cannot be an error for a trial judge to not seize it. A trier of fact must carefully consider the evidence that points away from the common sense inference before acting on it, as this Court aptly put in Walle:\nIf, however, there is no evidence that could realistically impact on whether the accused had the requisite mental state at the time of the offence, or if the pertinent evidence does not leave the [trier of fact] in a state of reasonable doubt about the accuseds intent, then the [trier of fact] may properly resort to the common sense inference in deciding whether intent has been proved. [para. 67]\nIn this case, the trial judge chose not to infer Mr. Hodgsons mental state and based on the evidence she did accept, she had a reasonable doubt as to whether Mr. Hodgson intended to cause death or bodily harm that he knew was likely to result in death. The trial judge had the benefit of Mr. Hodgsons testimony that he did not think the chokehold was dangerous and that he did not intend to kill or harm Mr. Winsor (trial reasons, at para. 88). Having accepted his testimony, this put an end to her mens rea analysis, and there was no need for her to consider the common sense inference. The trial judge is presumed to know the law and need not state reasons for every inference that was or was not drawn (R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 74). The absence of an express refusal on the trial judges part to engage with the common sense inference cannot constitute an error of law in circumstances where she clearly articulated her findings in relation to the mens rea for murder.\nIn sum, we see no error, and certainly no error of law, in the trial judges assessment of the evidence on the mens rea for manslaughter or murder.\nDid the Trial Judge Err in Law in Relation to Self-Defence?\nAt trial, Mr. Hodgson also argued that he acted in self-defence and defence of others as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge found that there was an air of reality to the defence and considered each of the sections three elements and held that the Crown had failed to disprove self-defence on the lesser and included charge of manslaughter. \nThe Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in law because she improperly took a solely subjective approach to assessing [Mr. Hodgsons] response to the perceived threat posed by Mr. Winsor (para. 8). While recognising that the trial judge did not have the benefit of this Courts reasoning in Khill, the Court of Appeal noted that previous case law had consistently measured an accuseds response to a perceived threat by considering what a reasonable person would have done in like circumstances. The court quoted Khill for the proposition that the trier of fact should not be invited to simply slip into the mind of the accused. The focus must remain on what a reasonable person would have done in comparable circumstances and not what a particular accused thought at the time (C.A. reasons, at para. 8, quoting Khill, at para. 65). \nWhile the trial decision was released before Khill and could not have included its terminology and phrasing, we are of the view that the trial judge nevertheless understood what s. 34 required of her. She followed the framework for self-defence as set out in the Criminal Code, specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found, and expressed clear conclusions on each element.\nIn some respects, it is difficult to understand what precise legal error motivated the Court of Appeal to order a new trial on this ground. While the critique that a solely subjective approach was taken is clear, it is less clear to which element of the s. 34 analysis this criticism attaches. The Court of Appeals holding that the trial judge did not assess Mr. Hodgsons actions in considering what a reasonable person would have done in like circumstances suggests that it was of the view the trial judge erred in her analysis of s. 34(1)(c) (para. 7); however, the phrase the Court of Appeal chose to describe the perceived error  [Mr. Hodgsons] response to the perceived threat (para. 8)  can encompass one, some, or all of the statutory elements of s. 34. The Court of Appeals failure to clearly identify which element(s) of the self-defence inquiry under s. 34(1)(a) to (c) was engaged is problematic as each has its own considerations and methods of evaluation.   \nFirst, under s. 34(1)(a), the accused must have subjectively believed that force or a threat thereof was being used against their person or against that of another (Khill, at para. 52). However, the accuseds belief must also be held on reasonable grounds. In order to assess the reasonableness of the accuseds belief, the trier of fact will apply a modified objective standard that takes into account what a reasonable person with the relevant characteristics and experiences of the accused would perceive (Khill, at para. 57). That the accuseds actual belief must be held on reasonable grounds imports an objective component to ensure conformity with community norms and values when weighing the moral blameworthiness of the accuseds actions (Khill, at para. 53). The trial judge applied this modified objective standard and held, based on the evidence she accepted from Crystal Mullin, Mr. Hodgson, Mr. Burke and Ms. Ford-Perkins, that Mr. Hodgson believed on reasonable grounds that there was a threat of force being made by Mr. Winsor against the others. When Mr. Hodgson went to deal with that threat, as requested by Ms. Ford-Perkins, force was applied against him by Mr. Winsor (para. 107). On this element, the trial judge specifically turned her mind to the reasonable grounds component of s. 34(1)(a) and did not adopt a solely subjective analysis. \nSecond, under s. 34(1)(b), whether the accused committed the act that constitutes the offence for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or others from the use or threat of force depends upon the accuseds subjective state of mind; if the purpose is not to defend or protect, then the whole basis of self-defence falls away. Indeed, for this second element, a failure to consider the accuseds personal purpose, a subjective inquiry which goes to the root of self-defence, would have been an error of law (Khill, at para. 59). The trial judge expressly found that there was no other reason Mr. Hodgson used the chokehold but to calm Mr. Winsor down and thereby protect himself and the others at the party from the threat being posed by Mr. Winsor (para. 111). No error has been demonstrated in respect of the trial judges treatment of this element. \nThird, s. 34(1)(c) requires that the act committed is reasonable in the circumstances, and s. 34(2) provides a list of nine non-exhaustive factors for the court to consider in making this determination. Parliament expressly structured how a decision maker ought to determine whether an act of self-defence was reasonable in the circumstances. What is called for is an assessment of the overall reasonableness of the accuseds conduct according to the statutory factors. Reasonableness is measured according to the relevant circumstances of the person, the other parties and the act (Criminal Code, s. 34(2); see also Khill, at para. 64). When a factor is relevant it becomes a mandatory consideration, as s. 34(2) provides that the fact finder shall consider all factors set out in paras. (a) to (h) that are relevant in the circumstances of the case (Khill, at para. 68). This objective determination, with its focus on what a reasonable person would have done in comparable circumstances, strikes the appropriate balance between respecting the security of the person who acts and the security of the person acted upon. It also underscores that the law of self-defence cannot rest exclusively on the accuseds perception of the need to act (Khill, at para. 2; see also paras. 62 and 65).\nGiven its reference to the consideration of what a reasonable person would have done in like circumstances, it seems most likely that the Court of Appeal took issue with the trial judges handling of s. 34(1)(c) (C.A. reasons, at para. 7). The proposition from Khill cited by the Court of Appeal about not slipping into the mind of the accused was directed towards and addressed the type of reasonableness analysis required under s. 34(1)(c). By relying on this quotation, it is likely the Court of Appeal was suggesting that the trial judge had conducted a solely subjective assessment of this element of the section, being the overall reasonableness of Mr. Hodgsons acts under s. 34(1)(c). However, even on that basis, the trial judges treatment of this element discloses no such error.\nThe trial judge discharged the obligation s. 34(2) places on the finder of fact to consider a wide range of factors in order to determine what a reasonable person would have done in a comparable situation. She separately addressed all factors that the parties argued were relevant, applicable, and worthy of consideration. Under every factor, the trial judge considered and evaluated the material evidence. She tied each relevant factor to the facts as found in the following manner:\nThe nature of the threat: Mr. Winsor was a large man who could likely harm someone and was not complying with requests to leave the house. He was quite intoxicated, tried to impose himself on Crystal Mullin, and pushed Mr. Burke into the wall. That said, he was likely not posing a threat to someones life. \nThe extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force: Mr. Winsor was not complying with requests to leave and elbowed Mr. Hodgson in the head when he tried to intervene. It did not seem to the trial judge that non-physical means were reducing the threat he posed.\nThe persons role in the incident: Mr. Hodgson was a strong man who was requested to help remove Mr. Winsor from the home.\nThe use or threatened use of a weapon: No weapons were involved.\nThe size, age, gender and physical capabilities of the parties to the incident: Mr. Hodgson was 38 years old, 6 feet tall, weighed 210 pounds, and was quite strong. Mr. Winsor was 23 years old, 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 304 pounds. The trial judge did not see a significant difference between them.\nThe nature, duration and history of any relationship between the parties to the incident and any history of interaction or communication between the parties to the incident: Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Winsor had no relationship, interaction or communication before that night, although they had spoken for a long time during the party. While Mr. Hodgson was uncomfortable with the way Mr. Winsor was talking about Crystal Mullin and treating Mr. Burke, nobody suggested that there was bad blood between the two. \nThe nature and proportionality of the persons response to the use or threat of force: A person in a threatening situation need not carefully assess the threat and thoughtfully determine the appropriate response. The situation was a sudden and upsetting one, in which a very heavy man was using violence and ignoring requests to leave. Ms. Ford-Perkins asked Mr. Hodgson to help. Mr. Hodgson observed Mr. Winsor physically resisting attempts to get him to leave. He was not able to pull him away and was hit in his attempt to do so. Given that his dominant hand was injured, many forms of potential control were likely unavailable. In all of the circumstances, a known calm down move that could be carried out from behind would have seemed proportional.\nResponse to use or threat of force that the person knew was lawful: Not applicable. \nThe trial judge then addressed the key question of whether, after assessing all the relevant factors, Mr. Hodgsons act was reasonable in the circumstances. This assessment of the s. 34(2) factors reveals no error of law. The trial judges references to Mr. Hodgson by name operated only to particularize the inquiry to the circumstances of the case at bar. This personalization did not transform the analysis into a solely subjective exercise. Indeed, the trial judges reasons make clear that she understood she was to assess whether Mr. Hodgsons actions were reasonable in the circumstances, and she repeatedly and expressly referred to the appropriate objective standard. For example, she stated:\nSimilarly, if Mr. Hodgsons evidence were believed, there is some evidence to suggest that his actions were reasonable in the circumstances . . . .\n. . .\n\tDid the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the choke hold applied by Mr. Hodgson was not reasonable in the circumstances?\n. . .\n\t. . . A known calm down move that could be executed from behind would have seemed to be proportional in all of the circumstances.\n. . .\n\t. . . the Crown has not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the choke hold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. [Emphasis added; paras. 104, 112, 120 and 122.]\nAlthough Khill was released after the trial judges reasons, she nevertheless engaged in the correct analysis. Even before Khill, prior case law consistently applied an objective approach to the aspects of the self-defence analysis that measured an accuseds actions against those of a reasonable person in similar circumstances (see, e.g., R. v. Rasberry, 2017 ABCA 135, 55 Alta. L.R. (6th) 134, at para. 12; R. v. Curran, 2019 NBCA 27, 375 C.C.C. (3d) 551, at para. 16; R. v. Berry, 2017 ONCA 17, 345 C.C.C. (3d) 32, at para. 73; R. v. Grant, 2016 ONCA 639, 351 O.A.C. 345, at para. 63; R. v. Richter, 2014 BCCA 244, 357 B.C.A.C. 305, at para. 37; R. v. Constantine, 2015 ONCA 330, 335 O.A.C. 35, at para. 30; R. v. A.A., 2019 BCCA 389, at para. 33 (CanLII); R. v. Androkovich, 2014 ABCA 418, at para. 9 (CanLII)).  \nThe trial judges reasons make clear that she correctly assessed whether Mr. Hodgsons actions were reasonable in the circumstances under s. 34(1)(c) and that she did not inappropriately focus on what Mr. Hodgson himself thought at the time of the impugned conduct. \nAccordingly, we do not see any grounds for concluding that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis or in her application of the law on self-defence. \nDisposition\nFor the reasons given, the appeal is allowed, and the acquittal is restored. \n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tRowe J.  \nI am persuaded that self-defence applies and, thus, I agree in the result. I write separately to clarify the Crowns right to appeal an acquittal. My colleagues deal with this at length, emphasizing how narrowly this is limited. However, there is an exception that warrants note. \nAt paragraph 34, my colleagues write: There are . . . situations in which a trial judges alleged shortcomings in assessing the evidence constitute an error of law giving rise to a Crown appeal of an acquittal (quoting R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at para. 24). In J.M.H., the Court identified four such situations, one being an assessment of the evidence based on a wrong legal principle (Martin and Moreau JJ.s reasons, at para. 35).\nMyths relating to sexual assault have been characterized as errors of law (R. v. Kruk, 2024 SCC 7). These are not confined to the twin myths referred to in s. 276 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. Rather, this is an open category, further myths being identified from time to time. Thus, where the Crown characterizes an aspect of a trial judges reasons as incorporating a myth, this would meet the requirement in s. 676(1)(a) that the appeal be on a question of law alone.\n\tAppeal allowed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Lacy Naster, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Trial Lawyers Association: Purser Law, Edmonton; Pringle Law, Vancouver.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the Nunavut Court of Appeal's decision and restores the acquittal of Daniel Hodgson for second-degree murder and manslaughter.\n\nThis appeal involves a challenge to the Crown's right to appeal an acquittal, specifically whether the trial judge committed errors of law in her analysis of the mens rea for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter.\n\nThe case arose from a physical altercation at a house party in Iqaluit, Nunavut, where Daniel Hodgson used a chokehold to restrain another guest, Bradley Winsor, who died as a result of the altercation. The trial judge found that Mr. Hodgson caused Mr. Winsor's death but acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter, concluding that the Crown failed to establish the requisite subjective mens rea for murder and that Mr. Hodgson's actions were reasonable in the circumstances under the self-defence provisions of the Criminal Code. The Crown appealed the acquittal to the Nunavut Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge erred in law in her analysis of the mens rea for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. Mr. Hodgson then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and restored the acquittal, holding that the trial judge did not commit any errors of law in her assessment of the evidence. The Court emphasized that the determination of criminal intent is a quintessential factual conclusion based on an assessment of the evidence by the trier of fact. The Court also held that the trial judge properly considered the objective dangerousness of the chokehold and that her conclusion that there was no intent to murder was firmly grounded in the evidence pertaining to Mr. Hodgson's subjective state of mind.\n\nWriting for the majority, Martin and Moreau JJ. held that the appeal should be allowed and the acquittal restored. The majority emphasized that the Crown's right to appeal an acquittal is narrow and limited to questions of law alone, and that the Court of Appeal failed to articulate the precise errors of law at the root of its intervention. The majority also concluded that the trial judge did not commit any errors of law in her analysis of the mens rea for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. Specifically, the majority held that the trial judge was not required to accept that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action when assessing the mens rea for murder, and that the trial judge properly considered the objective dangerousness of a chokehold in the context of self-defence. The majority also noted that the common sense inference that sane and sober individuals intend the natural and probable consequences of their actions is a permissive inference, not a presumptive one, and that the trial judge was not bound to draw it.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores  a man\u2019s acquittal because the trial judge committed no errors of law which  would allow the Crown to appeal</strong>This appeal addresses the circumstances in which the Crown can  appeal an acquittal, the accused\u2019s state of mind (or <em>mens rea</em>) required for second degree murder, and the elements  required for self-defence. Mr. Hodgson attended a house party and was asked to help  with removing another guest who refused to leave despite repeated requests to  do so. A physical altercation ensued during which Mr. Hodgson used a chokehold  to restrain the guest, who lost consciousness and died. Mr. Hodgson was charged  with second degree murder.The trial judge found that it was proven beyond a  reasonable doubt that Mr. Hodgson caused the guest\u2019s death by placing him in a  chokehold. However, based on her assessment of the evidence, she acquitted Mr.  Hodgson of second degree murder because the Crown failed to establish the  requisite subjective <em>mens rea. </em>A  second degree murder is a murder that is not planned and deliberate. She also  found Mr. Hodgson not guilty of manslaughter. Manslaughter refers to a homicide  committed as a result of a sudden provocation. The trial judge found that Mr.  Hodgson\u2019s defence of self-defence under s. 34 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>had an air of reality and that the Crown had failed  to establish that the chokehold was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal of the  acquittal and directed that a new trial be held on the basis that the trial  judge erred in law in her analysis of the <em>mens  rea</em> for murder and the application of self-defence to manslaughter. Mr.  Hodgson appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored  the acquittal.<strong>The Crown\u2019s right of appeal from an acquittal is limited to questions of  law alone.</strong>Writing jointly for the majority,  Justices Martin and Moreau noted that the Crown has a limited right of appeal  on questions of law alone when it seeks to overturn an acquittal. A question of  law is a question of legal interpretation that does not involve an evaluation  of the evidence. In this case, the Court of Appeal did not articulate the  precise errors of law at the root of its intervention and it is not a case in  which the appellate court could reach a purely legal conclusion drawn from the  evidence without calling into question the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the  evidence. Furthermore, even if the alleged errors were ones of law, the trial  judge did not commit any such errors. Justices Martin and Moreau said  that an inference that a chokehold is an inherently dangerous action is  available in some cases. However, it is not an error of law for a trial judge  to reach a different conclusion about a particular accused\u2019s <em>mens rea</em> based on the evidence. The  Justices found there was no error of law in the trial judge\u2019s assessment of the  evidence on the <em>mens rea</em>. As for self-defence, Justices  Martin and Moreau decided that the trial judge followed the framework set out  in the <em>Criminal Code</em>. That is to say,  the trial judge specifically addressed each of its three elements, correctly  stated the applicable statutory principles, applied them to the facts as found,  and expressed clear conclusions on each element."

Canada\n2024 SCC 24\nFile No.: 40346.\n2023: November 9; 2024: June 28.\nPresent: Karakatsanis, Cote, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.\non appeal from the federal court of appeal\n\tCourts  Jurisdiction  Taxation  Excise tax  GST returns  Taxpayer applying for judicial review in Federal Court and seeking declarations related to assessments disallowing input tax credits and assessing penalties  Application struck out on basis that challenge to validity of assessments was matter within exclusive jurisdiction of Tax Court of Canada  Whether application for judicial review properly struck out  Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, s. 302  Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, s. 18.5. \n\tIris Technologies Inc. filed GST returns claiming tax refunds under the Excise Tax Act (ETA). The Minister audited a reporting period, issued an assessment disallowing input tax credits, and assessed penalties. Iris applied for judicial review in Federal Court and sought declarations that the Minister failed to afford procedural fairness and opportunity to respond to the proposed adjustments contrary to published policy and a specific guarantee, that the assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the findings of fact made by the Minister and that the assessments were made for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction in a related application. The Attorney General brought a motion to strike the application for judicial review. The prothonotary dismissed the motion, holding that the application for judicial review was not bereft of any chance of success. The Federal Court dismissed the Attorney Generals appeal, but the Federal Court of Appeal allowed its subsequent appeal and struck out Iriss application for judicial review on the basis that it was, in essence, a collateral challenge to the correctness of the assessments, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: Notwithstanding the issuance of a tax assessment, the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial review of discretionary decisions delegated to the Minister by Parliament, including those that directly affect liability. However, the Ministers assessment of net tax pursuant to the ETA is not the exercise of a discretionary power; it is a non-discretionary determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute. Jurisdiction over the correctness of the assessment falls to the Tax Court under s. 302 of the ETA. In the instant case, two of the claims raised by Iris in its application for judicial review  those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation  are properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as they are best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment. Iris third claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, could, in some circumstances, be the basis for an application for judicial review, but should be struck because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if taken to be true, would give any support to this claim. In addition, the declaratory relief sought by Iris should not be issued because it would have no practical effect. \n\tA registrant under the ETA is required to file a return for each reporting period setting out the amount of net tax to be remitted. To the extent that input tax credits exceed the collectible amount of GST, a registrant may be entitled to receive a refund of net tax. A taxpayer who is dissatisfied with an assessment after having filed an objection can appeal the assessment to the Tax Court under s. 302 of the ETA. Where Parliament expressly provides for an appeal to the Tax Court, such as the express direction found in s. 302 of the ETA, s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act precludes an application for judicial review in the Federal Court. However, the rule in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act that ousts the Federal Courts jurisdiction in favour of the Tax Court does not apply where the true purpose of the application is to seek practical relief against the Ministers exercise of discretion. An application for judicial review may be brought in Federal Court if the Ministers decision is not part of the assessment and cannot be challenged before the Tax Court pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction to decide matters pertaining to the correctness of assessments. \n\tIn Okalta Oils Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1955] S.C.R. 824, the Court held that an assessment is not a discretionary act. Okalta Oils and subsequent cases that rely on a like definition of assessment stand for the proposition that when assessing tax due under the ETA, the Minister does not exercise a discretionary power. Rather, she exercises a mandatory duty imposed by statute. Fulfillment of a non-discretionary statutory responsibility cannot be an improper motive for issuing an assessment. Where the true purpose of an application is not to seek relief against the exercise of discretion but to challenge the correctness of an assessment, Parliament has ousted the Federal Courts judicial review jurisdiction. \n\tIris allegation that the Minister breached procedural fairness in the audit and assessment process is grounded in the timing of the Ministers assessments and the consequential failure to provide an opportunity to respond to proposed adjustments. On appeal to the Tax Court, Iris would have the opportunity to respond. Thus, an appeal to the Tax Court is an adequate, curative remedy. Iris allegation that the assessments were made without evidentiary foundation is precisely within the legislative mandate of the Tax Court because that court can cure evidentiary defects in the Ministers assessments through a de novo review. While the Federal Court would have jurisdiction to issue a declaration that the assessments were made for an improper purpose, this claim should be struck because Iris has failed to allege facts in its application or any particular motive or conduct of the Minister that, if true, could support its allegation that the Minister acted with an improper purpose. \n\tThe Ministers assessment of Iriss net tax was not the exercise of a discretionary power. She made a non-discretionary determination where the outcome, the assessment, did not depend on the exercise of discretion and was dictated by the non-discretionary rules of the ETA. As well, the declarations sought by Iris will have no practical effect. They are not connected to any asserted rights. It is settled law that a declaration can only be granted if it will settle a live controversy between the parties. A claim seeking declarations that have no practical utility cannot succeed. \n\tPer Karakatsanis, Cote and Rowe JJ.: While the issuance of assessments does not deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction to consider the Ministers conduct per se, in the instant case, Iris ought to have challenged the assessments by appealing to the Tax Court. In its essential nature, Iris application for judicial review is a collateral attack on the correctness of the assessments. In addition, the declarations sought would have no practical effect and could not have been issued. The Federal Court must strike an application for judicial review if it is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success; read holistically, Iris application for judicial review falls within the clearest of cases where a motion to strike will succeed. \n\tParliament has established the Tax Court as a specialized court for tax appeals, expressly excluding the Federal Courts jurisdiction where an appeal lies from an assessment and is adequate and effective in giving the relief sought by a taxpayer. The proper inquiry is whether, on a holistic view, the claims essential nature or true character is the correctness or validity of an assessment. Given that judicial review is a remedy of last resort, the Federal Court will not have jurisdiction to entertain an application for judicial review where a matter is otherwise appealable to the Tax Court. This will be the case where an appeal to the Tax Court is available, adequate and effective in giving the taxpayer the relief sought.\n\tThe reviewing court must gain a realistic appreciation of the nature of the claim and the disputed administrative action. Determining the essential nature or true character of the claim requires the court to look beyond the words used, the facts alleged and the remedy sought to ascertain whether the pleading is a disguised attempt to reach before the Federal Court a result that would otherwise be unreachable in that court. If the pleadings, read holistically and practically, disclose a reasonable basis for pursuing the claim, the application should not be struck. Conversely, if the essential nature or true character of the claim involves a matter otherwise appealable to the Tax Court, the application for judicial review would constitute a collateral attack on the validity or correctness of the assessment. Such an application is therefore doomed to fail at a preliminary stage either because the bar in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act applies or because an appeal to the Tax Court is an adequate and effective recourse. \n\tIt is well settled that applications for judicial review in tax matters should be struck where fatal flaws are found. Two fatal flaws arise from Iris application for judicial review. First, on a holistic reading, it is a collateral attack on the correctness of tax assessments. The first two declarations sought relate to flaws in the assessment process  a breach of procedural fairness and evidentiary issues  that can be remedied by an appeal to the Tax Court, and the third declaration sought relates to the motivation for issuing the assessments and is based on allegations that cannot be dissociated from the correctness of the assessments. An appeal to the Tax Court will allow the parties to present evidence and submissions on whether the assessments were correct as a matter of fact and law, including whether they are supported by the evidence and were issued by the Minister in accordance with her statutory responsibilities. A conclusion by the Tax Court that Iris is liable for the tax assessed will be dispositive of all three of Iriss allegations. Judicial review should not be used to develop a new form of incidental litigation designed to circumvent the system of tax appeals established by Parliament. \n\tSecond, the declarations sought are of no practical effect. All three declarations would be purely academic and could not be granted. There is no longer any live controversy between the parties apart from the correctness of the Ministers assessments. The Federal Court cannot vary or vacate an assessment, and issuing declarations that do not vary or vacate the assessments would serve little or no purpose.\nCases Cited\nBy Kasirer J.\n\tApplied: Okalta Oils Ltd. v.

Appeal dismissed.\n\tLeigh Somerville Taylor and Mireille Dahab, for the appellant.\n\tDaniel Bourgeois, Christa Akey and Justine Malone, for the respondent.\n\tThe judgment of Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ. was delivered by\n\tKasirer J.  \nOverview\nThis appeal, like the appeal in Dow Chemical Canada ULC v. Canada, 2024 SCC 23, which was heard by the Court on the same day, highlights the shared statutory jurisdiction in tax matters of the Tax Court of Canada and the Federal Court of Canada.\nIt brings into plain focus the divide between the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court to hear appeals relating to the correctness of tax assessments and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court to conduct judicial review in tax matters. The appeal in this case helps explain why the appeal in Dow should  as the Federal Court of Appeal held  give rise to a different outcome, based on a principled understanding of the distinct statutory foundations for the exclusive jurisdiction of these two courts established by Parliament.\nIn the result, I agree with the conclusion of my colleague Cote J. to dismiss the taxpayers appeal before our Court but, with respect, my conclusion rests on different reasons. \nIn my view, the Federal Court of Appeals reasoning is entirely well founded, including its statement that the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction where the true purpose of an application for judicial review is to seek practical relief against the exercise of a discretion by the Minister of National Revenue (2022 FCA 101, [2022] 1 F.C.R. 401, at para. 13). As Rennie J.A. observed, in the circumstance of ministerial discretion, the statutory rule ousting Federal Court jurisdiction in judicial review in favour of the Tax Court does not apply. This explains, as Rennie J.A. said for the court, why the outcome of the Federal Court of Appeals decision in Canada v. Dow Chemical Canada ULC, 2022 FCA 70, [2022] 5 C.T.C. 1 (Dow FCA), is favourable to the Federal Courts jurisdiction where the discretionary ministerial decision under s. 247(10) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (ITA), was at the centre of the jurisdictional debate.\nIn other words, the Federal Court of Appeal in this case confirmed its decision in the partner case of Dow FCA in which it recognized the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court over a ministerial discretionary decision provide for by the ITA. In this case, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court in appeals of the assessments where no such ministerial discretion was involved. Importantly, Rennie J.A. said, at para. 13 of his reasons, that the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in the two companion cases, with their apparently divergent outcomes, are entirely compatible.\nI agree with Rennie J.A.\nSignificantly, the reasoning of the Federal Court of Appeal that I propose to endorse on this point explains, jurisprudentially, the proper contours of the dividing line between the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court to review the correctness of a tax assessment by a de novo procedure on appeal and the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in tax matters. Notwithstanding the issuance of a tax assessment, the Federal Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial review over discretionary decisions delegated to the Minister by Parliament, including those that directly affect tax liability. The Ministers assessment of net tax pursuant to the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 (ETA), is not the exercise of a discretionary power. Instead, it is a non-discretionary determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute. Jurisdiction over the correctness of the assessment falls to the Tax Court under s. 302 of the ETA. \nHighlighting this distinction between ministerial discretionary decisions and the tax assessment itself, which is non-discretionary, is, I think, all-important in explaining the jurisdictional debate in our Court in Dow and in this appeal. It further explains why the Attorney General of Canada defended the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in Dow, notwithstanding the issuance of an assessment and, on the same day before this Court in this appeal, challenged the jurisdiction of the Federal Court as trenching on the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court over the correctness of the taxpayers assessment. \nWhen juxtaposed against Dow, as Rennie J.A. sought to do at para. 13 of his reasons, this case presents a further opportunity to confirm the view that it is Parliaments intention that jurisdiction in tax matters is shared between the two courts and that the Tax Court is not a one-stop judicial shop for resolving tax disputes.\nOn the specifics of the Attorney General of Canadas motion to strike the application for judicial review brought by the taxpayer, I agree with the Federal Court of Appeal that two of the claims raised by the appellant, Iris Technologies Inc., in its application  those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation  are properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court. They are best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment which is the proper subject matter of an appeal to the Tax Court under the express authority of the ETA. Since the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the correctness of assessments, the bar in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (FCA), applies to these two aspects of the application. Accordingly, the Federal Court has no jurisdiction over these aspects. This is because of an express statutory grant of jurisdiction to the Tax Court from the assessment in s. 302 of the ETA and not, as the appellant proposed in Dow, based on an extension of the Tax Courts jurisdiction by necessary implication. \nIris third claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, could, in some circumstances, be the basis for an application for judicial review. But the improper purpose claim should nevertheless be struck here because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if taken to be true, would give any support to this claim.\nI further agree with the Federal Court of Appeal that the declaratory remedy sought in the application would have no practical effect and the application should also be struck on this basis.\nBackground\nIt is useful to review, in brief compass, Iris notice of application for judicial review and the Attorney Generals motion to strike.\nIris filed Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns claiming substantial tax refunds under the ETA for a period ending in 2020. The Minister commenced an audit of the relevant reporting periods and refused to pay the refunds claimed pending the result of the audit.\nThe Minister then issued assessments disallowing input tax credits and assessed penalties to be paid by Iris.\nFollowing the issuance of the assessments, Iris brought an application for judicial review in Federal Court in respect of the assessments issued by the Minister of National Revenue . . . to disallow input tax credits claimed and assess gross negligence penalties (Notice of Application, reproduced in A.R., at p. 40). Iris sought three declarations regarding the conduct of the Minister in issuing the assessments:\na.\tthe Minister failed to afford procedural fairness in the audit of the applicant, failed to provide notice of or any opportunity to respond to any proposed adjustments, contrary to the Ministers published policy thereon and the specific guarantee of the Ministers Assistant Commissioner;\n\nb.\tthe assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the findings of fact made by the Minister as of the date thereof; and\n\nc.\tthe assessments were made for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction in the applicants application for relief in Court File No. T-425-20.\n\n(A.R., at p. 40)\nThe Attorney General brought a motion to strike Iris application for judicial review. In sum, the motion states that the essential character of Iris application is a challenge to the correctness of the assessments made by the Minister under the ETA. In accordance with s. 18.5 of the FCA, the Federal Court has no jurisdiction to review the correctness of the assessments of taxes under the ETA. Moreover, the declaratory relief sought by Iris would serve no practical purpose. They inevitably lead back to a contestation of the assessments. In any event, the Attorney General of Canada says that Iris seeks declarations of fact which are not properly the subject matter of declaratory relief in the Federal Court.\nJudicial History\nThe prothonotary in the Federal Court dismissed the motion to strike. He recognized that an appeal of an assessment is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court. However, in his view, the application engages administrative law principles, and the Federal Court can exercise administrative law jurisdiction in tax matters (para. 26, reproduced in A.R., at pp. 8-9). The prothonotary wrote that [t]he conduct of the Minister as it relates to the issuance of the assessment, not the assessment itself, is the subject matter of the application (para. 30). Given the administrative law jurisdiction of the Federal Court in tax matters and that the declarations sought all engage administrative law principles, the prothonotary held that the application was not bereft of any chance of success.\nThe Attorney General of Canadas appeal to a judge of the Federal Court was dismissed. The judge shared the view of the prothonotary that the application was not an attack on the assessment but on the procedural fairness of the assessment (2021 FC 597, [2022] 1 F.C.R. 383, at para. 32). As such, it is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. Noting that the threshold for a motion to strike is a high one, she concluded that it is not plain and obvious that the application has no chance of success.\nIn a judgment delivered from the bench, the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.\nRennie J.A. (Stratas and Laskin JJ.A. concurring) observed that in evaluating a motion to strike, courts must look beyond the administrative law language used in an application for judicial review. This is particularly so in respect of challenges to assessments under the ETA where Parliament has established a specialized court and system for tax appeals, and has expressly excluded judicial review jurisdiction of the Federal Court where an appeal lies from an assessment (para. 3, citing s. 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2, and s. 18.5 of the FCA).\nRennie J.A. considered the true essence of Iris application for judicial review. He concluded that [w]hen the grounds of review cited in this application are situated in the context of the legislative mandate of the Minister under the ETA and the respective jurisdictions of the Tax Court and the Federal Court, . . . the notice of application is, in essence, a collateral challenge to the validity of the assessments issued under the ETA, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court (para. 6). He added that the application also seeks declarations that are of no practical effect. As such, concluded Rennie J.A. for the court, the application is bereft of any possibility of success. The Attorney General of Canadas appeal was allowed and the application was struck.\nIssues\nIris raises two issues in support of its position that its application for judicial review should not have been struck as being without any possibility of success.\nFirst, it says that the essential character of its application challenges the conduct of the Minister on administrative law principles and thus is properly within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. It is mistaken, says Iris, to conclude that it challenges the correctness of the assessment when, in point of fact, it seeks to challenge the conduct of the Minister and not the product of the assessment. \nSecond, Iris says the declaratory relief it seeks is appropriate to its judicial review claim. Declaratory relief is a powerful, independent remedy available under the FCA that requires no coercive order. The order sought is, contrary to what the Federal Court of Appeal decided, of unquestionable utility.\nAnalysis\nThere is no dispute on the proper test to be applied on a motion to strike in this context. A court seized of a motion to strike assumes the allegations of fact set forth in the application to be true and an application for judicial review will be struck where it is bereft of any possibility of success (JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557, at para. 47). It is understood to be a high threshold and will only be granted in the clearest of cases (Ghazi v. Canada (National Revenue), 2019 FC 860, 70 Admin L.R. (6th) 216, at para. 10).\nI propose to consider Iris application in light of its two principal arguments: (A) that the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction over the claims made in the application; and (B) that the declarations sought do have practical utility and can, therefore, be issued by the Federal Court.\nDoes the Tax Court Have Exclusive Jurisdiction Over the Matter in Light of the Essential Nature of Iris Application for Judicial Review?\nI agree with the Attorney General of Canada that the essential nature of Iris application is an attack on the assessment which denied the tax refunds claimed.\nRennie J.A. usefully explained that the grounds of review of the application must be situated within the legislative mandate of the Minister under the ETA and the respective jurisdictions of the Tax Court and the Federal Court (para. 6).\nWhat is the legislative mandate of the Minister under the ETA as it relates the Iris application?\nAs a registrant under the ETA, Iris is required to file a return for each reporting period setting out the amount of net tax to be remitted to the government (ss. 225(1), 228(1), 238 and 278 ETA). To the extent that the amount of input tax credits claimed by a registrant exceeds the collectible amount of GST, a registrant may be entitled to receive a refund of net tax (ss. 225(1) and 229(1) ETA).\nUnder s. 296(1), the Minister may assess net tax payable as well as interest and penalties. Liability for net tax flows from the ETA and not from the assessment (s. 299(2) ETA). The assessment does not itself give rise to tax liability, but it is deemed valid and binding unless vacated on objection or appeal (s. 299(3) ETA).\nA taxpayer like Iris who is dissatisfied with an assessment after having filed an objection with the Minister can appeal the assessment to the Tax Court (ss. 301(1.1) and 302 ETA).\nWhere an express direction from Parliament provides for an appeal to the Tax Court, s. 18.5 of the FCA precludes an application for judicial review in the Federal Court:\n18.5 Despite sections 18 and 18.1, if an Act of Parliament expressly provides for an appeal to the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court Martial Appeal Court, the Tax Court of Canada, the Governor in Council or the Treasury Board from a decision or an order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal made by or in the course of proceedings before that board, commission or tribunal, that decision or order is not, to the extent that it may be so appealed, subject to review or to be restrained, prohibited, removed, set aside or otherwise dealt with, except in accordance with that Act.\nIn the present case, that express direction is found in s. 302 of the ETA:\n302 Where a person files a notice of objection to an assessment and the Minister sends to the person a notice of a reassessment or an additional assessment, in respect of any matter dealt with in the notice of objection, the person may, within ninety days after the day the notice of reassessment or additional assessment was sent by the Minister,\n\n(a) appeal therefrom to the Tax Court; or\n\n(b) where an appeal has already been instituted in respect of the matter, amend the appeal by joining thereto an appeal in respect of the reassessment or additional assessment in such manner and on such terms as the Tax Court directs.\nDoes the allegation that the Minister breached procedural fairness in the audit and assessment process mean that judicial review, rather than a challenge to the correctness of the assessment, is the true nature of Iris claim? \nI agree with Rennie J.A. that it does not. Iriss procedural fairness claim is grounded in the timing of the Ministers assessment and the consequential failure to provide the taxpayer with an opportunity to respond to any of the Ministers proposed adjustments. Iris would have the opportunity to respond in the context of an appeal of the assessment to the Tax Court under s. 302 of the ETA. Given the allegations advanced here, an appeal to the Tax Court is thus an adequate, curative remedy (JP Morgan, at para. 82; see also C.A. reasons, at paras. 8-10).\nI further agree with Rennie J.A. that Iris allegation that the assessments were made without evidentiary foundation is precisely within the legislative mandate of the Tax Court (para. 11). Here again, an appeal to the Tax Court under s. 302 of the ETA constitutes an adequate, curative remedy because the court can cure any evidentiary defects in the Ministers assessment as part of the appeal. \nWhat about Iris claim that the assessments were made for an improper purpose, specifically that of defeating Iris application to the Federal Court for judicial review to seek relief on administrative law grounds?\nIris argues that the conduct of the Minister is irrelevant to the correctness of the tax assessment. Pointing in particular to Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403, 247 D.L.R. (4th) 597, at para. 8, Iris draws a distinction between the correctness of the assessment, which is the proper province of the Tax Court, and the process by which it is established, which is susceptible of judicial review before the Federal Court. In the circumstances, the improper purpose allegation stands outside of the Tax Courts exclusive jurisdiction over the assessment itself and thus cannot be said to be bereft of possibility of success.\nIt is true that an allegation of improper purpose can, in some circumstances, sustain an application for judicial review in tax matters. By way of example, as Stratas J.A. wrote in JP Morgan, the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to set aside an assessment on the basis of reprehensible conduct by the Minister leading up to the assessment, such as abuse of power or unfairness (para. 83). Instead, jurisdiction to provide relief from reprehensible conduct of the Minister would fall to the Federal Court exercising its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review under s. 18.1 of the FCA.\nHowever, I agree with Rennie J.A. that this allegation of improper purpose should nevertheless be struck. Iris has failed to allege facts in its application that, if true, could support its allegation that the Minister acted here with an improper purpose. As Rennie J.A. noted, Iris has not pointed to any particular motive or conduct of the Minister other than to say that the Minister issued the assessments to deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction in the related Federal Court proceeding (para. 14).\nIn the course of deciding that Iris allegation that the Minister acted with an improper purpose has no basis in law, the Federal Court of Appeal provided an explanation of when a taxpayer would have a proper recourse to the Federal Court, sitting in judicial review. At paragraph 13 of his reasons, in which he refers to the Federal Court of Appeals decision in Dow FCA, Rennie J.A. explains:\n\tThe mere fact that the Minister has issued an assessment does not oust the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. Where the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the Ministers conduct or where the true purpose of the application is to seek practical relief against the exercise of a discretion, the bar in section 18.5 does not apply. That was the situation in Canada (National Revenue) v. Sifto Canada Corp., 2014 FCA 140, [2014] 5 C.T.C. 26, where a judicial review was allowed in respect of penalties issued in a reassessment: see also Canada v. Dow Chemical ULC, 2022 FCA 70, [2022] 5 C.T.C. 1.\nThis explanation, with which I agree, allows for a distinction between this appeal and that in Dow. As Rennie J.A. explained, the rule in s. 18.5 of the FCA that ousts Federal Court jurisdiction in favour of the Tax Court does not apply where the true purpose of the application is to seek practical relief against the exercise of a discretion. As he indicated, that was exactly the circumstance in Dow.\nIn Dow, the taxpayer sought to challenge the denial, by the Minister, of a request to allow a downward transfer price adjustment. This discretionary authority to grant or deny a downward transfer price adjustment is conferred on the Minister by s. 247(10) of the ITA and amounts to an exception to the non-discretionary default rule established under s. 247(2) (F. Vincent and M. Ranger, Transfer Pricing in Canada (2018), at p. 320). As it is an exception to this default rule, the Minister may make her decision under s. 247(10) before or after an assessment is issued. Sometimes, if the Minister chooses to deny a taxpayers request for a downward adjustment, no new assessment will be issued, and the Ministers decision will simply be communicated to the taxpayer through a letter (see D. Sandler and L. Watzinger, Disputing Denied Downward Transfer-Pricing Adjustments (2019), 67 Can. Tax J. 281, at p. 285). The Federal Court of Appeal held that the challenge to that discretionary decision should be brought by judicial review in Federal Court. The Ministers decision is not part of the assessment and cannot be challenged before the Tax Court pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction to decide matters pertaining to the correctness of the assessment under s. 169 of the ITA.\nRennie J.A.s exercise in drawing the distinction between the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court over the appeal relating to correctness of the tax assessment in this case and the lack of jurisdiction of the Tax Court on appeal in Dow is instructive. I recall that he sat on the panels for both cases at the Federal Court of Appeal.\nIn this case, the Ministers assessment of net tax pursuant to the ETA is not the exercise of a discretionary power. Instead, she is making a non-discretionary determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute and does not depend on the exercise of discretion (see in particular s. 296 ETA). If the Minister determines that a registrant like Iris has failed to report or remit completely the amount of net tax under the ETA, the Ministers assessment is not a discretionary decision. The word may in s. 296(1) does not change this (see JP Morgan, at para. 109).\nIn Iris case, the Minister has no discretion in determining tax liability because the outcome is dictated by the non-discretionary rules of the ETA. As Brown J. explained for the majority of this Court in a comparable context, [n]o discretion is afforded to the Minister or the Ministers agents: They are required to follow [the Act] absolutely, just as taxpayers are also required to obey it as it stands (Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins Family Trust, 2022 SCC 26, at para. 25, citing Harris v. Canada, [2000] 4 F.C. 37 (C.A.), at para. 36; see also JP Morgan, at paras. 77-78). This echoes the long-standing precedent of this Court of Okalta Oils Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1955] S.C.R. 824, which holds that an assessment is not a discretionary act: \nIt is the contention of the respondent that, construed as it should be, the word assessment, in sections 69a and 69b [of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97], means the actual amount of tax which the taxpayer is called upon to pay by the decision of the Minister, and not the method by which the assessed tax is arrived at; with the result that if no amount of tax is claimed, there being no assessment within the meaning of the sections, there is therefore no right of appeal from the decision of the Minister to the Income Tax Appeal Board.\n\nIn Commissioners for General Purposes of Income Tax for City of London and Gibbs and Others, [[1942] A.C. 402 (H.L.),] Viscount Simon L.C., in reference to the word assessment said, at page 406: \n\nThe word assessment is used in our income tax code in more than one sense. Sometimes, by assessment is meant the fixing of the sum taken to represent the actual profit for the purpose of charging tax on it, but in another context the assessment may mean the actual sum in tax which the taxpayer is liable to pay on his profits.\n\nThat the latter meaning attached to the word assessment, under the Act as it stood before the establishment of the Income Tax Appeal Board and the enactment of Part VIIIA  wherein the above sections are to be found  in substitution to Part VIII, is made clear by the wording of section 58(1) of the latter Part, reading:  \n\n58(1). Any person who objects to the amount at which he is assessed . . .\n\nUnder these provisions, there was no assessment if there was no tax claimed. Any other objection but one ultimately related to an amount claimed was lacking the object giving rise to the right of appeal from the decision of the Minister to the Board. [Underlining added; pp. 825-26.]\nOkalta Oils  like other cases that rely on a like definition of assessment  stands for the proposition that a tax assessment is a non-discretionary determination of the Minister as to the actual sum in tax which the taxpayer is liable to pay (p. 825; see also Canada v. Anchor Pointe Energy Ltd., 2007 FCA 188, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 839, at paras. 3233; Canada v. Consumers Gas Co., [1987] 2 F.C. 60, at p. 67; St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School Trust v. Canada, 2022 FCA 125, [2023] 1 C.T.C. 115, at para. 45; Canada v. 984274 Alberta Inc., 2020 FCA 125, [2020] 4 F.C.R. 384, at para. 59). When assessing tax due under the ETA, the Minister is not exercising a discretionary power than can be abused. Assessing tax is, for the Minister, not a discretionary decision but a mandatory duty imposed by statute, specifically by ss. 275 and 296 of the ETA. This very principle was recently recalled by this Court in Collins Family Trust, at para. 25 (see also JP Morgan, at paras. 77-78). Applying this same reasoning which can be traced back to Okalta Oils, Rennie J.A. rightly said, at para. 17 of his reasons, that the fulfillment of [a non-discretionary] statutory responsibility cannot be an improper motive for the Minister to issue an assessment.\nJudicial review to the Federal Court is available to control the Ministers exercise of discretion conferred by statute, as was decided in Dow FCA by the Federal Court of Appeal in respect of the discretionary decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA. However, complaints about the assessment  itself non-discretionary  are addressed by an appeal to the Tax Court, exercising its exclusive jurisdiction over the correctness of the assessment. As Rennie J.A. explained at para. 13 of his reasons in this case quoted above, where the true purpose of the application is not to seek relief against the exercise of discretion but to challenge the correctness of the assessment, Parliament has ousted the Federal Courts judicial review jurisdiction, as s. 18.5 of the FCA permits.\nRennie J.A. helpfully cited Sifto Canada Corp. v. Minister of National Revenue, 2014 FCA 140, 461 N.R. 184, in support of his view which makes plain the same principles. Sifto concerned a motion to strike an application for judicial review regarding the decision of the Minister to waive a penalty under the ITA. Writing for the court, Sharlow J.A. explained that some aspects of the imposition of a penalty are properly understood as going to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court over the correctness of the assessment, such as the non-discretionary question as to whether all the statutory conditions for the imposition of a penalty are met. However, it is equally clear, she wrote, that the Tax Court does not have the jurisdiction to determine whether the Minister properly exercised his or her discretion under subsection 220(3.1) of the Income Tax Act when deciding whether or not to waive or cancel a penalty. A challenge to such a decision can be made only by way of an application for judicial review in the Federal Court (para. 23).\nTo return to this case, Rennie J.A. further observed that the improper motive allegation made in the application in its specifics was bereft of success. There is no use in trying to separate the motivation behind a decision to assess from the correctness of the assessment itself. It is a meaningless exercise, since the assessments themselves are not discretionary (para. 17). \nAgain, this stands in stark contrast to a challenge to a discretionary decision conferred on the Minister by statute which, as Webb J.A. explained in Dow FCA, is separate from the non-discretionary exercise of fixing the assessment and, as such, stands outside of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The position taken in the two appeals by the Federal Court of Appeal is entirely coherent and follow its precedent in JP Morgan to the letter. I note in passing that Stratas J.A., the author of the courts reasons in JP Morgan, sat on the appeal before the Federal Court of Appeal in this case. It also mirrors what the Federal Court of Appeal wrote in a previous decision related to this dispute: . . . the Federal Court retains jurisdiction to consider the application of administrative law principles and obligations to the exercise of discretion by the Minister in the application of the ETA (2020 FCA 117, [2020] G.S.T.C. 25, at para. 51).\nIn this case, only one of the declarations sought falls within the Federal Courts exclusive jurisdiction, and Iris has failed to allege facts in its application that, if true, could support that declaration issuing. The application for judicial review to the Federal Court has no prospect of success.\nThe Declaratory Relief Sought by Iris\nLastly, I agree with Rennie J.A. that [t]he declarations here will have no practical effect (para. 18). The Attorney General of Canada is right to say that the declarations sought by Iris are not connected to any asserted rights.\nIt is true, as Iris argues, that a declaration can be an appropriate remedy in taxation matters before the Federal Court. As the Federal Court of Appeal has held, while it is true that the Federal Court cannot invalidate an assessment . . . the Federal Court may grant a declaration based on administrative law principles that the Minister acted unreasonably (Sifto, at para. 25).\nIn this case, however, Iriss notice of application discloses no basis on which to conclude the declarations sought could ever have any practical utility. The notice of application merely states that [t]he declaration sought will have import in the Ministers ongoing actions in relation to the applicant, including the applicants application for emergency wage subsidy (A.R., at p. 43). \nIt is settled law that [a] declaration can only be granted if it will have practical utility, that is, if it will settle a live controversy between the parties (Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2016 SCC 12, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 99, at para. 11). No such live controversy was disclosed here. Rennie J.A. observed that in this instance, [i]ssuing a declaration that does not quash or vacate the assessments would serve little or no purpose (para. 18). He added that a declaration will not be issued where there exists an adequate alternative remedy (ibid.). Declarations with no practical effect will not issue, and a claim seeking such declarations cannot therefore succeed. This is another basis for which the Federal Court of Appeal rightly struck Iris application for judicial review.\nDisposition\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\tThe reasons of Karakatsanis, Cote et Rowe JJ. were delivered by\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nThis appeal and its companion case, Dow Chemical Canada ULC v. Canada, 2024 SCC 23, released concurrently, require our Court to carefully examine the boundaries of the respective jurisdictions of the Federal Court of Canada and the Tax Court of Canada over tax disputes, as delineated by their enabling statutes.\nIn this appeal, a Canadian telecommunications company, Iris Technologies Inc., brought an application for judicial review against the Minister of National Revenue (Minister), alleging that there had been a breach of procedural fairness during the audit and assessment process and that assessments had been issued without an evidentiary foundation and for an improper purpose. In response, the Minister moved to strike the application at a preliminary stage on the basis that it was plain and obvious that Iris could not obtain the relief it sought and that the judicial review application in this case was an attempt to circumvent the comprehensive system of tax appeals established by Parliament.\nIt is trite law that the Federal Court must strike an application for judicial review where the application is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success (David Bull Laboratories (Canada) Inc. v. Pharmacia Inc., [1995] 1 F.C. 588 (C.A.), at p. 600; JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557, at para. 47; Sifto Canada Corp. v. Minister of National Revenue, 2014 FCA 140, 461 N.R. 184, at para. 17; Wenham v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 199, 429 D.L.R. (4th) 166, at para. 33). While this is a high threshold to meet, there is no doubt that if the Federal Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application, or should not entertain it on the facts of the case, the application will fall within the clearest of cases where a motion to strike will succeed.\nThe present appeal turns on whether Iriss claim, which was brought as an application for judicial review, constitutes a cognizable administrative law claim or instead constitutes a collateral attack on the correctness of the assessments issued against it. In the latter situation, the application for judicial review must be struck at the preliminary stage, as it would be bereft of any possibility of success.\nIndeed, as I have concluded in the companion case, Parliament has established the Tax Court, a specialized court for tax appeals, expressly excluding the Federal Courts jurisdiction where an appeal lies from an assessment and where such a recourse is adequate and effective in giving the taxpayer the relief sought. In Okalta Oils Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1955] S.C.R. 824, at p. 826, our Court determined that objections that were not ultimately related to an amount claimed as part of an assessment lacked the object giving rise to a right of appeal to the Income Tax Appeal Board  the Tax Courts predecessor. The corollary to that pronouncement is that when an objection is ultimately related to an amount claimed, there is no recourse before the Federal Court. The proper inquiry is whether, on a holistic view, the essential nature or true character of the claim goes to the correctness or validity of the assessment. Courts must be careful not to frustrate Parliaments intention that assessments be dealt with exclusively by the Tax Court pursuant to its appellate jurisdiction.\nMy colleague is of the view that the Federal Court of Appeal, in ruling as it did in the case at bar, sought to confirm its decision in Dow Chemical and reconcile seemingly divergent outcomes. I respectfully disagree with this interpretation. In the present case, the Federal Court of Appeal acknowledged Dow Chemical in passing only as one example of a case that supported its position, without addressing it in detail. The analysis to determine whether the Tax Court or the Federal Court has jurisdiction over a claim must always proceed on the basis that Parliament intended to give precedence to the Tax Court where an appeal is available. Judicial review in the Federal Court is a remedy of last resort in this context. The contrast between my colleagues reasoning in this appeal and his reasoning in Dow Chemical is quite surprising. In the present appeal, my colleague is of the view that a taxpayers challenge to the Ministers conduct in the audit and assessment process can be remedied by an appeal to the Tax Court, but in Dow Chemical he disagrees with this very possibility.\nFor the reasons that follow, I agree with the Federal Court of Appeal that the appellants claim, in its essential nature or true character, is a challenge to the correctness of the assessments. Since adequate and effective relief is available in the Tax Court, Iriss application should be struck at this preliminary stage.\nBackground\nRegistrants under the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 (ETA), are responsible for collecting the goods and services tax and for filing a return for each reporting period setting out the amount of net tax to be remitted (see Quebec (Revenue) v. Caisse populaire Desjardins de Montmagny, 2009 SCC 49, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 286, at para. 10). In some cases, the amount of input tax credits may exceed the tax that becomes collectible on taxable supplies, such that a registrant may be entitled to receive a net tax refund (ETA, ss. 225(1) and 229(1)).\nOn October 28, 2019, the Minister completed an audit of Iris and assessed it under the ETA for its 2017 and 2018 reporting periods. The Minister initially withheld Iriss tax refunds pending completion of the audit but subsequently agreed to release them because of the impact of the withholding on Iriss financial position. The audit did not result in any adjustments to Iriss net tax refunds.\nTwo days later, on October 30, 2019, the Minister notified Iris of a second audit, which was to be for certain 2019 reporting periods; the audit was later expanded to include all reporting periods from January 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020. The Minister once again withheld the tax refunds. Iris requested on two occasions that the associated funds be released to allow it to maintain and uphold its business operations, but the Minister denied both requests. Following the Ministers denials, Iris sought a writ of mandamus to compel the release of the funds and filed a motion for interim relief.\nOn April 9, 2020, prior to the hearing of the motion for interim relief, the Minister reassessed Iris for the January to August 2019 reporting periods and assessed it for the September to December 2019 reporting periods. In issuing the assessments, the Minister disallowed input tax credits in the amount of $98,000,000 claimed by Iris and imposed more than $24,000,000 in gross negligence penalties, with interest.\nOn April 17, 2020, the Federal Court dismissed the motion for interim relief as premature because the reasonable period for which refunds may be retained had not yet expired (2020 FC 532, [2020] G.S.T.C. 15). This decision was affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal on July 8, 2020 (2020 FCA 117, [2020] G.S.T.C. 25).\nIn response, on July 16, 2020, Iris filed an application for judicial review in the Federal Court and sought the following three declarations:\na.\tthe Minister failed to afford procedural fairness in the audit of [Iris], failed to provide notice of or any opportunity to respond to any proposed adjustments, contrary to the Ministers published policy thereon and the specific guarantee of the Ministers Assistant Commissioner;\n\nb.\tthe assessments [of the Minister] were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the findings of fact made by the Minister as of the date thereof; and\n\nc.\tthe assessments were made for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction in [Iriss application] for relief in Court File No. T-425-20.\n\n(Notice of Application, reproduced in A.R., at p. 40.)\nOn August 11, 2020, the Minister moved to strike Iriss application at a preliminary stage on the basis that it was plain and obvious that the judicial review application constituted an attempt to circumvent the comprehensive system of tax appeals and that Iris could not obtain the relief it sought (A.R., at pp. 13-14).\nJudicial History\nThe prothonotary dismissed the motion to strike the application, holding that it could not be said that the application was bereft of any possibility of success.\nOn appeal from the prothonotarys decision, the Federal Court agreed with the prothonotary that, in essence, Iris was seeking administrative law remedies (2021 FC 597, [2022] 1 F.C.R. 383). It noted that a court will strike a notice of application only where it is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success. There was no basis for the Federal Court to intervene because the prothonotary did not err in applying the law.\nThe Federal Court concluded that Iriss attack on the procedural fairness of the assessments fell within its jurisdiction, because the conduct of the Minister, not the issuance of the assessments themselves, is at the heart of the matter. In the Courts view, the allegations stated in the notice of application engaged administrative law principles, in respect of which the Federal Court retained jurisdiction.\nThe Attorney General of Canada appealed the Federal Courts decision on three grounds: (1) the Federal Court failed to recognize that the true essence of Iriss application for judicial review is an attack on the validity of the assessments; (2) the Federal Court failed to recognize that the Minister had no discretion regarding the assessments of net tax under the ETA; and (3) the declarations sought by Iris are not cognizable administrative law remedies.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal noted that cloaking grievances in administrative law language and remedies does not necessarily make them such (2022 FCA 101, [2022] 1 F.C.R. 401, at para. 3). Writing for a unanimous court, Rennie J.A. determined that the application for judicial review in this case essentially constitutes a collateral attack on the validity of the assessments, a matter that falls within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The declarations sought would be of no practical effect given that they would have no impact on the validity of the assessments. Thus, Iriss application was bereft of any possibility of success.\nRegarding the Federal Courts jurisdiction over the Ministers discretionary decisions, Rennie J.A. emphasized that the Ministers issuance of an assessment does not oust the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. Where the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction to deal with the Ministers conduct or where the true purpose of the application is to seek practical relief against an exercise of discretion, the bar provided for in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 (FCA), does not apply.\nIssues\nThe sole issue to be determined in this appeal is whether Iriss application for judicial review is bereft of any possibility of success, such that it had to be struck on a preliminary basis.\nThe Attorney General of Canada argues that this determination must be made having regard to two questions. First, what is the essential nature of Iriss application? Second, is the declaratory relief sought by Iris appropriate to its application for judicial review?\nAnalysis\nIt is well settled that, as Stratas J.A. wrote in JP Morgan, at para. 66, applications for judicial review in tax matters should be struck where any of the following obvious, fatal flaws are found:\nthe notice of application fails to state a cognizable administrative law claim which can be brought in the Federal Court;\n\nthe Federal Court is not able to deal with the administrative law claim by virtue of section 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act or some other legal principle; or\n\nthe Federal Court cannot grant the relief sought.\nI am of the view that the Federal Court of Appeal properly intervened to strike Iriss application. There are two obvious, fatal flaws striking at the root of the Federal Courts authority to entertain this application (JP Morgan, at para. 47, citing David Bull Laboratories, at p. 600; Donaldson v. Western Grain Storage By-Products, 2012 FCA 286, at para. 6 (CanLII); Rahman v. Public Service Labour Relations Board, 2013 FCA 117, at para. 7 (CanLII); Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959). This is so even if the facts pleaded are assumed to be true (R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45, at para. 17; see also Wenham, at paras. 32-33).\nFirst, on the basis of a holistic reading of Iriss application for judicial review, I find that it is a collateral attack on the correctness of the assessments. An appeal to the Tax Court is available, adequate and effective in giving Iris the relief sought with respect to its first two allegations (a breach of procedural fairness and evidentiary issues). As for Iriss third allegation of (improper purpose in making the assessments), it fails to state a cognizable administrative law claim and is in any event premature. Pursuing that claim in the Federal Court prior to doing so in the Tax Court would be premature given that such a claim could not possibly succeed in the Federal Court unless Iris had first managed to establish that the assessment was incorrect. Second, the declarations sought by Iris are of no practical effect. The Federal Court could not grant the relief sought. I therefore agree with the Federal Court of Appeal that this application was bereft of any possibility of success and had to be struck on a preliminary basis.\nI discuss each of these points in turn.\nThe Claim, In Its Essential Nature or True Character, Is a Collateral Attack on the Correctness of the Assessments\nAs I have outlined in Dow Chemical, Parliament intended to give precedence to the Tax Courts jurisdiction over tax matters where a right of appeal is expressly provided for by statute. In that case, I have concluded that s. 18.5 of the FCA bars the Federal Court from having jurisdiction over the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (ITA). Indeed, s. 247(2) and (10) of the ITA require the Minister to form an opinion as to whether a downward adjustment is appropriate when one is sought and/or established. The Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) is inextricably linked to the correctness of the resulting assessment. The scope of an appeal from a taxpayers assessment under s. 169 of the ITA extends to that discretionary decision where the objection is directed at the amount of tax owing.\nHowever, nothing in the companion case should be taken to foreclose the possibility of the Federal Court having jurisdiction where the Ministers conduct or exercise of discretion is not within the scope of an appeal from an assessment to the Tax Court.\nIt is neither necessary nor convenient to canvass the circumstances in which judicial review will be available in the Federal Court in tax matters. I agree with Stratas J.A.s observation in JP Morgan, at para. 97, that a case-by-case approach is preferable. For instance, the case law has established that the exercise of the Ministers discretion under the fairness provisions, namely ss. 152(4.2) and 220(3.1) of the ITA, may be reviewed in the Federal Court (Abraham v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FCA 266, 440 N.R. 201; Abou-Rached v. Canada (Attorney General), 2019 FC 750, 2019 DTC 5069; Ford v. Canada (Revenue Agency), 2022 FC 1077, 2022 DTC 5103). Likewise, an application for judicial review may be filed with the Federal Court to challenge the legality of measures taken by the Minister to collect taxes allegedly due (Markevich v. Canada, 2003 SCC 9, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 94; Walker v. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, 2005 FCA 393, 344 N.R. 169, at paras. 14-15; Johnson v. Minister of National Revenue, 2015 FCA 51, 469 N.R. 326, at para. 48; Libicz v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 693, 2021 DTC 5075). Clearly, where the Tax Court cannot deal with the Ministers alleged reprehensive conduct on appeal from an assessment, the Federal Court may be the appropriate forum (JP Morgan, at para. 83). In such cases, the bar in s. 18.5 of the FCA will not apply.\nIt must be kept in mind that judicial review is a remedy of last resort where an appeal from an assessment is available in the Tax Court. As our Court stated in Canada v. Addison & Leyen Ltd., 2007 SCC 33, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 793, at para. 11, this avoids frustrating Parliaments intention that assessments be dealt with exclusively by the Tax Court, a specialized court:\nThe integrity and efficacy of the system of tax assessments and appeals should be preserved. Parliament has set up a complex structure to deal with a multitude of tax-related claims and this structure relies on an independent and specialized court, the Tax Court of Canada. Judicial review should not be used to develop a new form of incidental litigation designed to circumvent the system of tax appeals established by Parliament and the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. Judicial review should remain a remedy of last resort in this context. [Emphasis added.]\nWhere a matter is otherwise appealable to the Tax Court (Addison & Leyen, at para. 8), the Federal Court will not have jurisdiction to entertain an application for judicial review. This will be the case where an appeal to the Tax Court is available, adequate and effective in giving the taxpayer the relief sought (JP Morgan, at para. 82). As a result, one way to determine whether a claim in the Federal Court is bereft of any possibility of success is to ask whether a cognizable administrative law claim could still be pursued should the taxpayer fail on appeal to the Tax Court. If no such claim could be pursued, then the application for judicial review is necessarily a collateral attack on the assessment.\nOn a motion to strike an application, a court must always determine the essential nature or true character of the claim (see Windsor (City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 617, at para. 25; Canada (Attorney General) v. British Columbia Investment Management Corp., 2019 SCC 63, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 36-37). Scrutinizing the notice of application for judicial review with this purpose in mind is especially important where an appeal from an assessment is available in the Tax Court. As Stratas J.A. wrote in JP Morgan, at para. 49, [a]rmed with sophisticated wordsmithing tools and cunning minds, skilful pleaders can make Tax Court matters sound like administrative law matters when they are nothing of the sort.\nThe reviewing court must gain a realistic appreciation of the nature of the claim and the disputed administrative action (see Domtar Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2009 FCA 218, 392 N.R. 200, at para. 28). The application in question must be read holistically and practically, without fastening onto matters of form (JP Morgan, at para. 50; Sifto at para. 25; Wenham, at para. 34). Determining the essential nature or true character of the claim requires the court to look beyond the words used, the facts alleged and the remedy sought to ascertain whether the statement of claim is a disguised attempt to reach before the Federal Court a result that would otherwise be unreachable in that court (Roitman v. Canada, 2006 FCA 266, 353 N.R. 75, at para. 16).\nWhile a statement of claim is not to be blindly read at its face meaning (Roitman, at para. 16), genuine strategic choices should not be maligned as artful pleading (Windsor (City), at para. 27). If the pleadings, read holistically, disclose a reasonable basis for pursuing the claim, the application should not be struck (British Columbia Investment Management Corp., para. 36). Conversely, if the essential nature or true character of the claim involves a matter otherwise appealable to the Tax Court, the application for judicial review would constitute a collateral attack on the validity or correctness of the assessment. Such an application is doomed to fail at a preliminary stage either because the bar in s. 18.5 of the FCA applies or because an appeal to the Tax Court is an adequate and effective recourse (Wenham, at para. 33).\nI now turn to the issue of whether Iriss application for judicial review, read holistically, falls within the clearest of cases where a motion to strike will succeed at a preliminary stage. To reiterate, Iris sought the following relief in its pleadings:\n1. \tA declaration that it was denied procedural fairness in the audit and assessment process, contrary to prior policy;\n\n2. \tA declaration that there was no evidentiary foundation upon which the assessments could be issued under the ETA; and\n\n3. \tA declaration that the assessments were issued for the improper purpose of depriving the Federal Court of jurisdiction to hear the administrative law grievances that Iris raised in its related application.\nIn my view, the application was bereft of any possibility of success because it is, in its essential nature, a collateral attack on the correctness of the assessments. The first two declarations sought by Iris relate to flaws in the underlying assessment process  a breach of procedural fairness and evidentiary issues  that can be remedied by an appeal from the assessments. The third declaration sought relates to the motivation for issuing the assessments and is based on allegations which cannot be dissociated from the issue of the correctness of the assessments.\nI agree with the Federal Court of Appeal that the mere fact that the Minister has issued a notice of assessment does not deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction to consider the Ministers conduct (para. 13). Again, where the Tax Court cannot deal with the Ministers alleged reprehensible conduct on appeal from an assessment, the Federal Court may be the proper forum and the bar in s. 18.5 of the FCA will not apply (see JP Morgan, at para. 83).\nIn my respectful view, however, the situation in Dow Chemical, where a decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA is inextricably linked to the correctness of the assessment, is one where an appeal to the Tax Court would be adequate and effective in giving the taxpayer the relief sought. In such a case, the taxpayer is not seeking practical relief against the exercise of discretion, but is rather challenging the correctness of an assessment. It is an objection ultimately related to an amount claimed as part of the assessment (Okalta Oils, at p. 826).\nIn the present case, Iris seeks declarations relating to the Ministers conduct in respect of the timing of and evidentiary basis for the issuance of the assessments, as well as the disclosure of materials. An appeal to the Tax Court would allow the parties to discover and present documentary and oral evidence, as well as to make submissions on whether the assessments were correct as a matter of fact and law, including whether the assessments are supported by the evidence and were issued by the Minister in accordance with her statutory responsibilities. If the Tax Court concludes that Iris is liable for the tax assessed by the Minister, this would be dispositive of all three allegations. Let me explain.\nFirst, with respect to allegations of procedural unfairness, it must be kept in mind that the right of appeal provided for by the ETA (and the ITA) engages procedural rights that can cure defects in the process followed by the Minister (JP Morgan, at para. 82). In such a context, if an assessment is incorrect as a matter of fact and law, it is irrelevant that the assessment process was flawed. If an assessment is correct as a matter of fact and law, it must stand even if the assessment process was flawed. As Gagne J. wrote in Ghazi v. Canada (National Revenue), 2019 FC 860, 70 Admin L.R. (6th) 216, at para. 32, [e]ven if the Tax Court cannot redress a procedural fairness breach, it does not follow that the Federal Court has this power. In matters of tax liability, tax is either payable or not, based on the facts and the law (see also Webster v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 FCA 388, 312 N.R. 235, at para. 21; Newave Consulting Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2021 FC 1203, at para. 139 (CanLII); Chad v. Canada (National Revenue), 2023 FC 1481, [2024] 1 C.T.C. 63, at para. 28).\nIris alleges a breach of procedural fairness in the Ministers failure to honour her guarantee that she would advise Iris of any proposed adjustments and would provide Iris with an opportunity to respond during the audit process (A.F., at paras. 19-20). While Iris may not have had an opportunity to respond to the proposed adjustment before the assessments were issued, it can challenge the adjustment by way of an appeal from the resulting assessments under s. 302 of the ETA.\nSecond, the question of whether the evidence supports an assessment is precisely the object of a taxpayers recourse in the Tax Court. Under s. 302 of the ETA, the Tax Court is tasked with determining the taxpayers tax liability de novo on the basis of a full evidentiary record (Johnston v. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] S.C.R. 486, cited in Hickman Motors Ltd. v. Canada, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 336, at para. 92). Iriss allegation that the assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the findings of fact made by the Minister is properly within the legislative mandate of the Tax Court and cannot be entertained by the Federal Court.\nThird, whether an allegation of improper purpose in issuing an assessment is a cognizable administrative law claim is a fact-specific inquiry that turns on the allegation made by the taxpayer. Indeed, such claims are not normally entertained by the Federal Court because the Minister generally has no discretion in the fulfillment of her statutory responsibilities (see, e.g., Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins Family Trust, 2022 SCC 26, at para. 25, citing Harris v. Canada, [2000] 4 F.C. 37 (C.A.), at para. 36). This was emphasized by Stratas J.A. in JP Morgan, at paras. 77-78:\nOn occasion in the tax context, parties have alleged that the Minister abused her discretion in making an assessment. To date, all such claims have been dismissed as not being cognizable because in assessing the tax liability of a taxpayer, the Minister generally has no discretion to exercise and, indeed, no discretion to abuse. Where the facts and the law demonstrate liability for tax, the Minister must issue an assessment: Galway v. Minister of National Revenue, [1974] 1 F.C. 600 (C.A.), at page 602 (the Minister has a statutory duty to assess the amount of tax payable on the facts as [she] finds them in accordance with the law as he understands it).\n\nIn this regard, as far as the assessments of a taxpayers own liability are concerned, the Minister does not have any discretion whatever in the way in which [she] must apply the Income Tax Act and must follow it absolutely: Ludmer v. Canada, [1995] 2 F.C. 3 (C.A.), at page 17; Harris v. Canada, [2000] 4 F.C. 37 (C.A.), at paragraph 36. This Court cannot stop the Minister from carrying out this duty: Canada Revenue Agency v. Tele-Mobile Company Partnership, 2011 FCA 89, 2011 G.T.C. 2014, at paragraph 5 (in the context of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. E-15); Ludmer, above, at page 9.\nIf the Tax Court determines that tax is owed, the Minister will have acted dutifully and the purpose for issuing the assessment cannot be said to be improper. There is no utility in trying to parse or separate the motivation behind a decision to assess from the correctness of the assessment itself (C.A. reasons, at para. 17). In any event, such a claim could not possibly succeed in the Federal Court without the taxpayer first showing that the assessment was incorrect in the Tax Court. Pursuing a claim in the Federal Court prior to an appeal to the Tax Court would necessarily be premature.\nIn the present case, Iris alleges that the assessments were issued for the improper purpose of depriving the Federal Court of jurisdiction in a related application. I agree with Rennie J.A that such an allegation fails to point to any particular motive or conduct separate from the Ministers duty to issue an assessment in accordance with the facts and the law under the ETA (para. 14). It is a collateral attack on the correctness of the assessments.\nIt is true that a party cannot object to the process or motivation underlying the issuing of an assessment on an appeal to the Tax Court (see Canada v. Consumers Gas Co., [1987] 2 F.C. 60 (C.A.); Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403, 247 D.L.R. (4th) 597, at paras. 6-8; Roitman, at para. 21; Ereiser v. Minister of National, 2013 FCA 20, 444 N.R. 64; Johnson v. Canada, 2015 FCA 52, 470 N.R. 183, at para. 4; 9162-4676 Quebec Inc. v. Canada, 2016 FCA 112, 2017 DTC 5074, at para. 2). But it is also true that such an objection will not normally succeed in the Federal Court where an appeal to the Tax Court is available, adequate and effective in giving the taxpayer the relief sought. This is a feature, not a bug, of the system of tax assessments and appeals established by Parliament.\nI reiterate that our Court has cautioned against judicial review being used to develop a new form of incidental litigation designed to circumvent the system of tax appeals established by Parliament (Addison & Leyen, at para. 11).\nIn the instant case, the prothonotary erred in law by failing to consider the respective jurisdictions of the Tax Court and the Federal Court, as delineated by each courts enabling statute. This led to an incorrect determination by the prothonotary that Iriss claim, in its essential nature, is a cognizable administrative law claim (see 744185 Ontario Inc. v. Canada, 2020 FCA 1, 441 D.L.R. (4th) 564, at para. 49; McCain Foods Limited v. J.R. Simplot Company, 2021 FCA 4, at para. 65 (CanLII)). The Federal Court of Appeal properly determined that the essential nature or true character of all three grounds, when situated in the context of the ETA, is a collateral attack on the correctness of the assessments themselves (para. 6). An assessment is a matter that falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court, a specialized court established specifically to deal with tax matters.\nI therefore conclude that, in the present case, an appeal to the Tax Court would be an adequate and effective remedy available to Iris, and, accordingly, the application was doomed to fail in the Federal Court.\nThe Declaratory Relief Sought by Iris Is of No Practical Effect\nAn application is bereft of any possibility of success where it seeks a declaration that is of no practical effect. The Federal Court cannot issue declarations of the sort.  I agree with the Federal Court of Appeal that all three declarations here would be purely academic and could not be granted (para. 18).\nThere is no longer any live controversy between the parties apart from the correctness of the Ministers assessments. It goes without saying that, because of the limitation in s. 18.5 of the FCA, the Federal Court cannot vary or vacate an assessment itself (Minister of National Revenue v. Parsons, [1984] 2 F.C. 331 (C.A.); Redeemer Foundation v. Canada (National Revenue), 2008 SCC 46, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 643, at para. 28). In the present circumstances, issuing declarations that do not vary or vacate the assessments would serve little or no purpose (see Johnson (2015 FCA 51), at para. 41). The only question which remains is whether or not the tax is owed as a matter of fact and law. Iris would still have to pursue an appeal to the Tax Court even if all three declarations were granted, and there is no guarantee that the assessments would be vacated or varied.\nAny declaration in this context would necessarily be detached from the rights of the parties or from a live controversy and could not be issued. In Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2016 SCC 12, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 99, at para. 11, this Court determined that [a] declaration can only be granted if it will have practical utility, that is, if it will settle a live controversy between the parties (see also S.A. v. Metro Vancouver Housing Corp., 2019 SCC 4, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 99, at para. 60).\nIn my view, it was open to the Federal Court of Appeal to determine that the prothonotary and the Federal Court erred in fact and law by failing to find that the declarations sought were purely factual and served no practical purpose (C.A. reasons, at paras. 15-16 and 18).\nConclusion\nWhile the issuance of assessments does not, per se, deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction to consider the Ministers conduct I find that, in the instant case, Iris ought to have challenged the assessments by appealing to the Tax Court. The application, in its essential nature, is a collateral attack on the correctness of the assessments. In any event, the declarations sought before the Federal Court would have no practical effect and could not have been issued. I therefore conclude that the application for judicial review was bereft of any possibility of success.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss Iriss appeal, with costs.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Leigh Somerville Taylor Professional Corporation, Toronto; Dahab Law, Richmond Hill, Ont.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Department of Justice Canada, BCRO Tax Litigation Section, Vancouver.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that a taxpayer should not challenge tax  assessments by applying to the Federal Court for declarations.</strong>In this appeal, the  Supreme Court dealt with a question of jurisdiction. It determined whether a  taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the validity of tax assessments was a matter within the  exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada or whether it could be brought  in the Federal Court. Iris Technologies  Inc. filed Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns claiming tax refunds under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> (\u201cETA\u201d). The Minister of  National Revenue (the Minister) began an audit of the relevant reporting  periods and refused to pay the refunds while the audit was ongoing. The  Minister then issued an assessment denying the tax refund, and assessed  penalties to be paid by Iris. Iris asked the Federal  Court to review the Minister\u2019s assessment. This kind of request is referred to  as an application for judicial review. Iris also asked the Federal Court to  declare (a) that the Minister failed to afford Iris procedural fairness in the  audit and an opportunity to respond to the proposed adjustments; (b) that the  assessments were made without evidentiary foundation and contrary to the  findings of fact made by the Minister; and (c) that the assessments were made  for the improper purpose of seeking to deprive the Federal Court of  jurisdiction in a related application. The Attorney  General of Canada brought a motion to strike Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review. The Case Management Judge dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s motion. The  Attorney General appealed that decision to the Federal Court. The Federal Court  dismissed the Attorney General\u2019s appeal, but the Federal Court of Appeal  allowed its subsequent appeal and struck out Iris\u2019 application for judicial  review on the basis that it was, in essence, a collateral challenge to the  validity of the assessments, a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the  Tax Court. Iris appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The matter  should be brought in the Tax Court of Canada.</strong><strong> </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that notwithstanding the issuance of a tax  assessment, the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial  review over discretionary decisions delegated to the Minister by Parliament,  including those that directly affect liability. However, the Minister\u2019s  assessment of net tax pursuant to the <em>ETA</em> is not the exercise of a discretionary power; it is a non-discretionary  determination where the outcome, the assessment, is dictated by statute. Jurisdiction  over the correctness of the assessment falls to the Tax Court under section 302  of the <em>ETA</em>. In the instant  case, two of the claims raised by Iris in its application for judicial review \u2014  those alleging procedural unfairness and a lack of an evidentiary foundation \u2014  are properly within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court as they are  best characterized as attacks on the correctness of the assessment. Iris\u2019 third  claim, that the Minister acted with an improper purpose, could, in some  circumstances, be the basis for an application for judicial review, but should  be struck because Iris did not allege facts in its application that, if taken  to be true, would give any support to this claim.

F-7, ss. 18.1, 18.5.\n\tDow Chemical Canada ULC, a Canadian resident corporation, entered into, as a borrower, a non-arms length revolving loan agreement with a related Swiss company as the lender. As a result of this loan agreement, Dow incurred interest expenses for its 2006 and 2007 taxation years. It also reported income for the 2006 taxation year in respect of toll manufacturing services provided to the Swiss company. Following a review of the transactions between Dow and the Swiss company, the Minister reassessed Dow for its 2006 taxation year, applying transfer pricing rules set out in s. 247(2) of the Income Tax Act (ITA). Under s. 247(2), where a taxpayer is dealing with a non-resident person with whom it is not at arms length, the amounts in a given transaction will be adjusted to reflect what would have been agreed to had the persons been dealing with one another at arms length. The application of s. 247(2) resulted in a significant increase in Dows income in the 2006 taxation year.\n\tDow believed that its income should be decreased to reflect an amount of interest that would have been paid had the parties been at arms length. Where an amount is identified that would decrease the taxpayers income, s. 247(10) of the ITA provides that a downward adjustment is not to be made unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made. Dow requested that the Minister exercise her discretion under s. 247(10) and make a downward transfer pricing adjustment, but the Minister refused. Dow sought judicial review in the Federal Court of the Ministers discretionary decision. It also objected to the reassessment for the 2006 taxation year and eventually appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court.\n\tIn the context of the appeal of the reassessment, the parties referred a question of law to the Tax Court, asking it to determine whether, where the Minister has exercised her discretion pursuant to s. 247(10) of the ITA to deny a taxpayers request for a downward transfer pricing adjustment, the decision by the Minister falls outside the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The Tax Court held that the Ministers discretionary decision under s. 247(10) is an essential component of the taxpayers assessment and goes to the correctness of that assessment, and may therefore be reviewed by the Tax Court under its exclusive appellate jurisdiction to determine the correctness of the assessment. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Ministers appeal and held that the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to judicially review discretionary decisions by the Minister under s. 247(10).\n\tHeld (Karakatsanis, Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: When the Minister has exercised her discretion under s. 247(10) of the ITA to deny a taxpayers request for a downward pricing adjustment, that decision falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in respect of an appeal of the taxpayers assessment. The Ministers discretionary decision is not part of the assessment. The meaning of assessment is settled in law, and the Ministers opinion formed under s. 247(10) is qualitatively distinct from that concept. As there is no express right of appeal to the Tax Court, the proper forum to challenge the Ministers discretionary decision under s. 247(10) is the Federal Court, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review under s. 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act. Only the Federal Court has the jurisdiction to apply the appropriate standard of review and access to an appropriate range of administrative law remedies.\n\tBoth the Federal Court and the Tax Court are creatures of statute. The Federal Court has exclusive statutory jurisdiction to grant relief in relation to federal ministerial decisions under s. 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act. Section 18.5 of that Act allows for this jurisdiction to be ousted where a federal statute expressly provides for an appeal to another body, including the Tax Court. Pursuant to s. 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act and s. 169 of the ITA, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals seeking to vary or vacate income tax assessments. This jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the correctness of assessments. As confirmed in the Courts jurisprudence, a tax assessment is a purely non-discretionary determination of the taxpayers tax liability for a particular taxation year. The amount of tax owing is the product of the process of determining tax liability and it flows from the ITA itself. In preparing an assessment, the Ministers role is simply to determine what the law requires the taxpayer to pay by applying a fixed statutory formula to taxable income. The Minister does not exercise any discretion.\n\tUnlike the non-discretionary determinations that make up an assessment, the ITA empowers the Minister to exercise discretion in some matters, including over whether to issue downward transfer pricing adjustments under s. 247(10). These discretionary decisions are not assessments nor are they part of assessments. Section 247(10) empowers the Minister to base her decision on policy considerations rather than the strict application of the law to the facts. When the Minister makes discretionary decisions, she provides her opinion, guided by policy considerations. This is a fundamentally different task than preparing an assessment. Section 247(10) must be understood alongside the non-discretionary rule in s. 247(2) that the Minister must issue an upward adjustment of income to reflect amounts that would have been determined if the parties to the transaction had been dealing at arms length. In contrast, taxpayers have no entitlement to a downward adjustment and it cannot be said that the Minister must exercise her discretion under s. 247(10) in order for tax liability to be calculated correctly. A challenge to a policy-based decision under s. 247(10) should therefore proceed separately from an appeal of the non-discretionary assessment.\n\tThe definition of assessment should not be expanded to include discretionary decisions said to be directly affected by or inextricably linked to assessments. The Ministers conduct is not at issue in an assessment and taxpayers cannot object to the underlying process or motivations for the issuing of an assessment before the Tax Court. Reviews of conduct by the executive proceed by way of judicial review before the Federal Court. If a discretionary decision made under s. 247(10) is quashed, it does not automatically follow that the tax liability is wrong and the assessment is incorrect, since it is open to the Minister to make the same decision upon reconsideration. By contrast, whenever a non-discretionary determination is found to have been made in error, the Minister has no choice but to make the correct determination. Furthermore, the fact of the Ministers opinion must not be confused with the basis for it. It is only the outcome of the Ministers exercise of discretion that may be a fact relevant to the correctness of the assessment, not the appropriateness of that outcome. A discretionary decision under s. 247(10) will not always result in an assessment being issued and decisions under s. 247(10) may be made after an assessment has been issued. It cannot be said in these circumstances that an initial assessment was incorrect. If Parliament had wished that the Minister would issue a new assessment in every circumstance that s. 247(10) discretion were exercised, it would have provided for this in the ITA. Changing the nature of the s. 247(10) decision or otherwise assimilating it to the assessment would require a legislative amendment.\n\tHolding that assessments may include decisions of the Minister pursuant to provisions like s. 247(10) by necessary implication would be inconsistent with distinct routes of appeal to the Tax Court from other decisions that are set out expressly in the ITA. Where Parliament provides for recourse from a ministerial decision to the Tax Court, it has created an express right to appeal; this shows that ministerial decisions are understood as distinct from the tax assessment even where they may directly affect it. To hold that the Tax Court could have implicit jurisdiction over the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) on an assessment appeal would be inconsistent with this established method. Nor does the jurisdiction of the former Exchequer Court of Canada support the view that decisions under s. 247(10) form part of an assessment. The Exchequer Court had a broader grant of jurisdiction and access to administrative law remedies, unlike the modern Tax Court. The historical jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court is therefore of limited relevance.\n\tTo depart from the settled meaning of assessment also has potential implications beyond the matter in issue. Moreover, adopting Dows theory would unsettle the Courts jurisprudence on the standard of review set forth in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653. When a taxpayer challenges an assessment, the Tax Court will conduct a de novo review of that assessment. If a discretionary decision under s. 247(10) were part of an assessment, it would thus be reviewed de novo. However, absent legislative direction, this would be inappropriate. Vavilov emphasized that the fact that the legislature has chosen to delegate authority justifies a default position of reasonableness review. The Federal Court is the only court that has jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision under s. 247(10) on a reasonableness standard. Further, applying appellate standards of review to a decision appealed to the Tax Court through s. 169 of the ITA would be inconsistent with the de novo standard of review before the Tax Court and it is not at all clear how the single appellate mechanism under s. 169 can provide at once for de novo review for some parts of the assessment and for appellate review of decisions that are said to be inextricably linked to that same assessment. Importing a new standard of review into an appeal to the Tax Court from an assessment would directly contradict Parliaments intent on how the Tax Court should decide if an assessment is correct. The statutory de novo review in the Tax Court does not contemplate deference other than placing an evidentiary burden of proof on the taxpayer. Holding that a standard other than reasonableness applies to exercises of the Ministers discretion under s. 247(10) would undercut the certainty and predictability that Vavilov brought.\n\tMoreover, treating the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) as part of an assessment for the purposes of an appeal to the Tax Court would result in bifurcated streams of review and give rise to issues regarding the Federal Courts jurisdiction. A decision under s. 247(10) can be made without an assessment being issued or after the time limit for objections and appeal. This might result in challenges to discretionary decisions being statute-barred. The argument that, if the Minister does not issue an assessment after she makes a discretionary decision, then the decision can be challenged by way of judicial review in the Federal Court proposes an untenable solution in which the Federal Court would retain its judicial review jurisdiction over discretionary decisions by the Minister as a general rule, but lose its jurisdiction to conduct judicial review of those same discretionary decisions if they are followed by assessments. Moreover, such an approach would enlarge the Tax Courts jurisdiction beyond the correctness of assessments to other related ministerial decisions. This is also inconsistent with the principles of statutory interpretation. Section 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act states that only an express ouster of the Federal Courts jurisdiction will have such an effect. Extending the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court by necessary implication rather than by express statutory language ought to be rejected.\n\tOnly the Federal Court can grant an appropriate remedy for a challenge to the s. 247(10) decision. If the Tax Court determines that an assessment is incorrect, it may vacate the assessment, vary it, or refer it back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment. If the Tax Court issues an order for reconsideration and reassessment, the Minister will simply be required to issue a reassessment that correctly reflects the decision that the taxpayer sought to challenge since that decision would not have been quashed. An order for reconsideration and reassessment cannot compel the Minister to reconsider her discretionary decision. If Parliament had sought to confer power to grant relief from a s. 247(10) opinion on the Tax Court, it would have to have done so by statute. The Tax Court does not have the remedial tools necessary to address a s. 247(10) decision. The Federal Court has the power to quash the Ministers discretionary decision, which would require her to reconsider it. The Tax Court may intervene only after the Federal Court has quashed the Ministers decision, after the Minister made a new decision, after that new decision results in a change in the taxpayers tax liability, and if the Minister fails to issue a reassessment to reflect a change in tax liability.\n\tParliament intentionally divided jurisdiction over tax matters between the Federal Court and the Tax Court. The Tax Court has never been a single forum for all tax litigation. Parliament has set up a complex structure to deal with a multitude of tax-related claims. Making a change to that complex structure without a thoughtful, comprehensive reform that can only be achieved by Parliament would be imprudent, particularly if doing so would directly contradict the wording of the applicable statutes and Parliaments intent. It falls to Parliament to respond to concerns about the jurisdiction of the Tax Court.\n\tDeciding that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review decisions under s. 247(10) will not enhance access to justice. This provision is relevant mainly to multinational corporate taxpayers carrying out non-arms length transactions with related entities. If the Tax Court were to have jurisdiction to review the Ministers exercise of discretion pursuant to s. 247(10), the Federal Courts ability to conduct judicial review of those decisions would be ousted under s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act but the Tax Court would have no ability to provide recourse if the Minister conducted herself unreasonably in coming to her decision because it does not have remedial power to quash the Ministers decision. Expanding the jurisdiction of the Tax Court beyond what is provided for in legislation could have far-reaching implications in respect of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court to conduct judicial review of ministerial decisions in other settings. Important aspects of tax and administrative law in Canada should not be undermined in order to pursue access to justice benefits that have not been made out.\n\tPer Karakatsanis, Cote and Rowe JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and Dows challenge regarding the Ministers discretionary decision to deny downward transfer pricing adjustments under s. 247(10) of the ITA should proceed before the Tax Court. Unlike other discretionary powers in the ITA, the power that the Minister has under s. 247(10) is not permissive. The Minister is obliged to exercise this power in order to determine a taxpayers liability. Parliament has ensured that the correctness or validity of a taxpayers assessment falls squarely within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, to the exclusion of the Federal Courts supervisory jurisdiction. Judicial review should not be used to develop a new form of incidental litigation designed to circumvent the system of tax assessments and appeals established by Parliament. Because it goes directly to the correctness of a taxpayers assessment, a decision by the Minister to deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment under s. 247(10) is within the scope of the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction. Such a decision is inextricably linked to the assessment because it directly impacts the amount of a taxpayers income and taxable income and it necessarily precedes the determination of the ultimate amount of tax owing. This conclusion is consistent with the comprehensive legislative schemes establishing the respective jurisdiction of the Federal Court and the Tax Court and with the important objectives of avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings and of promoting efficiency and access to justice.\n\tStatutory courts such as the Federal Court and the Tax Court derive their existence, jurisdiction, and powers solely from their enabling statutes. Section 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act grants the Federal Court supervisory jurisdiction over decisions of a federal board, commission or other tribunal. However, s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act ousts the Federal Courts jurisdiction to grant such remedies where a federal statute expressly provides for a right of appeal to the Tax Court. Concerns for good tax administration, access to justice and efficiency animate Parliaments choice to prioritize the Tax Courts jurisdiction in tax matters where a right of appeal is expressly provided. Pursuant to ss. 165 and 169 of the ITA, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction to review the validity and correctness of assessments.\n\tThe Ministers decision to either allow or deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment under s. 247(10) is based on whether, in her opinion, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made. Section 247(10) does not define those circumstances or provide any guidance as to what they may be. The Minister is given wide discretion to make her decision, based on her own assessment of the circumstances, policy considerations and the applicable legislation. Contrary to other provisions of the ITA that give the Minister a discretion that affects the amount of a taxpayers income or taxable income, s. 247(10) is not permissive. Although a taxpayer is not entitled to a downward adjustment in all circumstances, a taxpayer is entitled to the Ministers opinion as to whether the downward adjustment is appropriate when one is sought and/or established. Section 247(2) provides that upward and downward adjustments shall be made when the conditions prescribed in that provision are met. Section 247(10) is an exception to the general rule in s. 247(2), which mandates adjustments where necessary to reflect the amounts that would have been agreed to had the parties been dealing with each other at arms length. It places a limitation on any downward transfer pricing adjustment by subjecting such an adjustment to the Ministers discretion. Read together, s. 247(2) and 247(10) require the Minister to form an opinion as to whether a downward adjustment is appropriate when the requisite conditions are met.\n\tThe settled meaning of an assessment for the purposes of s. 169 of the ITA is not in dispute. At issue on appeal from an assessment is the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer. In this case, the question is whether a decision that the Minister must make before the amount of tax liability can be determined is within the scope of an appeal from an assessment provided for in s. 169. The Ministers exercise of discretion in this context is inextricably linked to the correctness of the assessment and is an essential component of the assessment as a matter of fact and law. The discretion under s. 247(10) is of a different character than a discretion that is entirely permissive and need not be exercised until after tax, interest and penalties have been assessed. A decision to deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment is a fact on which the application of the relevant statutory provisions necessarily rests. If the discretion is not exercised or properly exercised, the resulting assessment cannot be correct. The right of appeal provided for in s. 169 in these circumstances arises from the assessment, not from the exercise of discretion per se; the amount of tax assessed is the direct result of the Ministers decision under s. 247(10). This finding does not create any legal uncertainty, nor does it expand the settled meaning of an assessment or alter the nature of the right of appeal provided for in s. 169. Indeed, in objecting to an assessment that results from the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10), a taxpayer is concerned with the amount of tax owing, not merely with the propriety of the Ministers exercise of discretion.\n\tThe Tax Courts remedial powers under s. 171 of the ITA allow it to deal with discretionary decisions going to the correctness of an assessment. Section 171(1)(b)(iii) sets out that the Tax Court may refer the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment. These words imply that the Tax Court may, in referring the assessment back for reconsideration and reassessment, remit the matter of the downward pricing adjustment to the Minister as part of a reconsideration. In contrast, on judicial review, the Federal Court cannot deal with the assessment. An assessment remains valid and binding unless and until it is varied or vacated by the Tax Court or the Minister issues a reassessment, even where a decision under s. 247(10) has been quashed by the Federal Court. Section 171(1)(b)(iii) is better suited to the real substance of the issue to be determined, which is the correct amount of tax owing.\n\tA deferential standard of appellate review applies when the Tax Court is dealing with the Ministers discretionary decisions under s. 247(10). This is because the Tax Court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the Minister or prevent her from arriving at the same decision upon reconsideration, following a proper exercise of her discretion. It is clear from the language in s. 247(10) that Parliament intended to confer upon the Minister a broad discretion in reaching a decision regarding a downward transfer pricing adjustment. In challenging the Ministers decision under s. 247(10), a taxpayer must establish a factual foundation to support the submission that the decision was wrong in principle, ignored relevant evidence or was based on irrelevant evidence, and the focus is on whether the exercise of discretion remains a valid fact on which to rest the correctness of the assessment. The Tax Court, as a specialized court, is well placed to rule on whether the discretion under s. 247(10) was properly exercised\nCases Cited\nBy Kasirer J.\n\tApplied: Okalta Oils Ltd. v.

No. 565 (Lexis), 2022 CarswellNat 1109 (WL), setting aside a decision of Monaghan J., 2020 TCC 139, [2021] 2 C.T.C. 2063, 2021 DTC 1001, [2020] T.C.J. No. 114 (Lexis), 2020 CarswellNat 5538 (WL). Appeal dismissed, Karakatsanis, Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting.\n\tDaniel Sandler, Osnat Nemetz and Laura Jochimski, for the appellant.\n\tDaniel Bourgeois, Christa Akey and Justine Malone, for the respondent.\n\tThe judgment of Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ. was delivered by\n\tKasirer J.  \nOverview \nThis appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the Tax Court of Canada, sitting in appeal of a taxpayers assessment, to review the Minister of National Revenues decisions under s. 247(10) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (ITA). Parliament has conferred on the Minister discretionary authority to decide whether the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate to make a downward transfer pricing adjustment. A downward adjustment can only be made in accordance with the ITA where the Minister has come to the opinion that it is appropriate. When the taxpayer seeks to challenge the Ministers discretionary decision, should that challenge be brought by an appeal to the Tax Court, pursuant to that courts exclusive statutory jurisdiction to decide on the correctness of the taxpayers income tax assessment? Or should the taxpayers challenge be brought instead before the Federal Court of Canada, pursuant to that courts exclusive statutory jurisdiction over judicial review, proceeding on the presumptively applicable standard of reasonableness? \nDow Chemical Canada ULC argues that a review of the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA falls within the exclusive jurisdiction assigned to the Tax Court because that decision directly affects or is inextricably linked to the assessment of tax liability. Dow says its position advances the cause of fairness and convenience for all taxpayers, including multinational corporations like itself, that might benefit from one-stop judicial shopping in the Tax Court. Accordingly, Dow asks this Court to enlarge the statutory jurisdiction of the Tax Court on appeal by providing it with a new power to conduct what amounts to judicial review of the Ministers decision on a reasonableness standard. \nI have had the advantage of reading the reasons prepared by my colleague Cote J. in which she proposes to allow Dows appeal. I agree with her that the Federal Court has exclusive statutory jurisdiction to grant relief in relation to federal ministerial decisions under s. 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. We share the view that s. 18.5 of that Act allows for this jurisdiction to be ousted where a federal statute, such as the ITA, expressly provides for an appeal to another body, including the Tax Court. I agree as well that the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals seeking to vary or vacate income tax assessments pursuant to s. 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2, and s. 169 of the ITA. For both of us, the central question before the Court is whether the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) is part of an assessment, and thus subject to the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, or whether as a separate exercise of ministerial discretion it should be subject to judicial review, on the standard of reasonableness, before the Federal Court.\nWith the utmost respect, however, I am unable to agree with the view that the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) can be appealed as part of an assessment to the Tax Court. Allowing this matter to be heard on appeal in the Tax Court as part of an assessment would require this Court to accept Dows expansive jurisdictional theory, based not on an express provision of an act of Parliament as s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act requires, but on what Dow claims is fair and best for access to justice. In my view, ousting the Federal Courts jurisdiction in the absence of express direction by statute and enlarging the Tax Courts review function would prompt new controversy over jurisdictional boundaries, all in service of supposed benefits for access to justice that strike me as largely illusory. Parliament plainly did not intend for the Tax Court to serve as an exclusive forum for taxation matters; it expressly granted by statute some jurisdiction over taxation matters to the Federal Court, some to the Tax Court, and even some original jurisdiction in taxation matters to the Federal Court of Appeal. \nDows submissions, if accepted, would disturb settled jurisprudence, including this Courts decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, by changing rules on standard of review, in particular for the appeal before the Tax Court pursuant to s. 169(1) of the ITA. Further, Dows position would upset Parliaments choice to leave judicial review of discretionary administrative acts to the Federal Court, where an appropriate standard of reasonableness review may be applied and where the proper administrative law remedies are available. Dows theory would lead to a significant erosion of the statutory jurisdiction of the Federal Court, in tax law and potentially in other areas, where judicial review is available to supervise discretionary authority that Parliament has conferred on the executive branch of government.\nImportantly, Dow seeks to undermine Parliaments design of limiting the Tax Courts appeal jurisdiction to reviewing the correctness of assessments by changing the foundational notion of an assessment in tax law. In arguing that the s. 247(10) decision is inextricably linked to an assessment and subject to a single recourse before the Tax Court, Dow relies on a changed understanding of an assessment that is entirely out of step with settled law. Dow would transform the very foundation of the Tax Courts statutory mandate to hear appeals by departing from a long-settled precedent of this Court defining an assessment in Okalta Oils Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1955] S.C.R. 824, a leading case that Dow did not cite in its argument before us. Dows reformulation of the concept of an assessment is also inconsistent with the understanding of a tax assessment as a product and not a process, a well-established principle in the jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal (see, e.g., Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403, 247 D.L.R. (4th) 597; Canada v. Anchor Pointe Energy Ltd., 2007 FCA 188, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 839, cited in C.A. reasons, 2022 FCA 70, [2022] 5 C.T.C. 1, at paras. 72-74). As Webb J.A. explained in this case, the Ministers opinion in s. 247(10) of the ITA may directly affect a tax assessment where one is issued, but that does not make it part of the assessment. In s. 247(10), Parliament has delegated to the Minister  not to the Tax Court  the authority to make a discretionary determination about whether in the circumstances it is appropriate that the downward adjustment be made. I agree with the view that this is a separate decision that stands apart from the assessment. In order to vacate or vary the assessment on appeal in a manner that would impact a denial of a downward transfer pricing adjustment, the Tax Court would have to quash the decision and substitute its opinion for that of the Minister, authority the Tax Court does not have on an assessment appeal.\nBy empowering the Minister to weigh her opinion of whether circumstances are such that it would be appropriate to depart from the ordinary rule and permit a downward adjustment, Parliament has conferred on the Minister, by s. 247(10), a policy-based discretionary decision-making power that is distinct from an assessment. This is no less true by reason of the fact that the Ministers decision directly affects tax liability and the fact that the Ministers decision will sometimes be reflected in an assessment, although a new assessment is not always issued after the Minister makes her decision. With due regard to the essential nature of Dows claim  which questions whether the exercise of ministerial discretion was reasonable  its grievance is one of administrative law that has been reframed as an appeal to the Tax Court relating to amounts owing in the assessment. It would appear that Dow sensed this when it started this litigation in Federal Court with an application for judicial review within the applicable limitation period after the Ministers decision was made in 2013, four years before its appeal to the Tax Court following a reassessment in 2017. \nThe foundational principles of administrative law set forth by this Court in Vavilov dictate that the Ministers discretionary decision, the authorization for which was conferred by statute, is presumptively subject to judicial review on the standard of reasonableness. Dow argues that this decision can be reviewed before the Tax Court as part of an appeal from an assessment and that in this context a reasonableness standard applies. Indeed, Dow goes as far as to assert that [t]he description by this Honourable Court in Vavilov of a reasonableness review is equally apposite to the review that the Tax Court would undertake in an appeal of an assessment based on the Ministers exercise of discretion under a provision like s. 247(10) (A.F., at para. 97, citing Vavilov, at para. 15; see also transcript, at pp. 10-15). This directly contradicts the principle, made clear in Vavilov, at para. 37, that the availability of a recourse other than judicial review indicates that the legislature intends for the reasonableness standard to be displaced. In the case of appeals of assessments to the Tax Court under s. 169(1) of the ITA, Parliament has put in place a de novo review process which is in the nature of a trial, in which both sides adduce evidence and make submissions and in which the Tax Court decides factual questions on the balance of probabilities. A review of ministerial decisions for reasonableness has no place in the context of Tax Court appeals. Accepting Dows approach would give the Tax Court the power to review not just the application of tax law to the facts, but the power to review discretionary tax policy decisions of the Minister.\nIn service of its view of the Tax Courts appeal jurisdiction founded on this expanded notion of assessment, Dow advances a framework of analysis where deference to the Minister based on reasonableness or another deferential standard would apply to the s. 247(10) decision. This cannot be reconciled with the principle from Vavilov that the appeal mechanism the legislature has crafted  here the de novo process under s. 169(1) of the ITA  determines the applicable standards of review (paras. 36 et seq.). Whether the applicable standards for the review of the s. 247(10) discretionary decision are those in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, or some other appellate standard developed for reviewing administrative action by analogy to the exercise of judicial discretion raises issues of broad significance for the applicable standard of review in administrative law. The Tax Court judge also proposed a different standard from that in Vavilov and that associated with the de novo appeal proceeding under s. 169(1). She said the Minister must form her opinion judicially or properly and, if this was not done, it could be corrected by the Tax Court rather than on a reasonableness standard upon judicial review to the Federal Court (2020 TCC 139, [2021] 2 C.T.C. 2063, at paras. 142-44 and 165). I respectfully disagree with these characterizations of the applicable standard of review which I see as errors of law. \nEqually problematic is Dows position on available remedies which, in the end, invites this Court to expand the Tax Courts powers by giving guidance . . . as to whether the Tax Court has the ability to substitute its opinion . . . for that of the Minister under s. 247(10) (A.F., at para. 101). In ruling on the assessment, the Tax Court cannot quash a discretionary decision of the Minister and cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the Minister acting under her delegated statutory authority. It bears recalling too that the remedies provided for in the Federal Courts Act may only be obtained on an application for judicial review to the Federal Court.\nThese are all signs, I fear, that an embrace of Dows position would undermine basic administrative law principles on standard of review and remedy and leave the dividing line between the Federal Court and the Tax Courts respective jurisdictions in disarray. These complications are avoided if it is recognized, contrary to Dows argument, that this distinct, discretionary decision-making power of the Minister, conferred upon her by Parliament in s. 247(10) of the ITA, is subject to judicial review in the Federal Court on a reasonableness standard, where there is an appropriate set of available statutory remedies, pursuant to the Federal Courts Act.\nDows position also puts in jeopardy settled principles governing the jurisdiction of the Federal Court which, like the Tax Court, is a creature of statute. The Federal Courts exclusive jurisdiction to conduct judicial review of federal administrative action  such as the Ministers discretionary decisions under s. 247(10)  can only be excluded where there is an express statutory appeal mechanism in accordance with s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act that ousts the supervisory jurisdiction of the Federal Court. By setting the high bar that the route of appeal must be provided for expressly, Parliament ensured that exceptions to the Federal Courts jurisdiction would flow from considered legislative direction rather than ad hoc development in the courts. Dows argument that jurisdiction can be conferred on the Tax Court by necessary implication rather than by express legislative provision ought to be rejected as being plainly inconsistent with the language, context, and purpose of s. 18.5. Dows theory would lower this bar by interpreting s. 18.5 to exclude the Federal Courts jurisdiction not just where a decision is subject to an express statutory appeal, but also where it is merely captured by an appeal provision by implication. Beyond its significant encroachment on the Federal Courts jurisdiction in tax law, Dows theory is likely to provoke litigation about which discretionary decisions are caught, implicitly, by statutory appeal provisions in other settings. This does not appear consonant with the aspirations for efficient access to justice.\nDow nevertheless says it advances its theory in service of the public good of access to justice, invoking the advantages its proposed innovation would achieve for unrepresented litigants before the Tax Court. This Court must of course always be mindful of the challenges to access to justice in the matters before it. It is trite law in this field that parallel proceedings are to be avoided and that the statutory rules should, insofar as possible, be interpreted accordingly (Walker v. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, 2005 FCA 393, 344 N.R. 169, at para. 11). And judicial review is of course an avenue of last resort in our law. But as important as it is, access to justice cannot displace settled understandings of Parliaments intended division of jurisdiction between the Tax Court and the Federal Court that have meaningful purpose. Here, the proceedings challenge a decision of the Minister in a way that the Tax Court is neither charged nor equipped to undertake. One-stop shopping at the Tax Court would come at the expense of the remedies the taxpayer can find in the Federal Court based on considerations of relief available on judicial review, including quashing a ministerial decision. By proceeding to the Tax Court as a single venue, the taxpayer would find no redress and lose the opportunity to ask a competent court to supervise the Ministers exercise of statutory power to ensure that the administrative actor did not overstep their legal authority in arriving at the discretionary decision. Moreover, even on Dows expansive view of the assessment, in circumstances in which the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) leads to no assessment, the Tax Court has no power whatsoever to do the work that rightly should be done by the Federal Court. Respectfully stated, I am unmoved by Dows claim that it is before us to fight the fight of the unrepresented litigant who would benefit from the simplified procedure before the Tax Court. It is indeed those taxpayers who, in many circumstances, need the protection that judicial review and judicial review alone can provide against the wayward exercise of ministerial discretion. \nIt is plainly in the legislative branch where far-reaching considerations related to the jurisdictional divide between the Federal Court and the Tax Court should be studied and considered. It has been usefully suggested that Parliament is the proper forum for achieving certain changes to s. 247 (see D. Sandler and L. Watzinger, Disputing Denied Downward Transfer-Pricing Adjustments (2019), 67 Can. Tax J. 281, at pp. 307-8). Others have decried the ad hoc character of the development of the law in this area and have called for a comprehensive exercise of law reform (M. H. Lubetsky, The Fractured Jurisdiction of the Courts in Income Tax Disputes, in P. Mihailovich and J. Sorensen, eds., Tax Disputes in Canada: The Path Forward (2022), 63, at p. 65). The courts, including this Court, are not institutionally designed to undertake such tasks and must be mindful of unanticipated consequences of changing jurisdictional boundaries between courts. \nWhen asked at the hearing what the effect of recognizing a jurisdiction for the Tax Court to review discretionary decisions of the Minister would be, counsel for Dow acknowledged that it would be a bit of a revolution (transcript, at p. 85). But, he said, that was why Dow brought the case to the Supreme Court. In my view, this Court should decline this invitation and leave the matter to Parliament and its informed measure of the public policy implications of any such change to the Tax Courts and the Federal Courts respective jurisdictions.\nApplying the settled principles that govern the nature of a tax assessment, the divided statutory jurisdiction between the Federal Court and the Tax Court in income tax matters, and the standard of review and remedial relief associated with general principles of judicial review in administrative law, I conclude that the challenge to a decision of the Minister under s. 247(10) is outside the appellate jurisdiction of the Tax Court. It is the proper and exclusive subject matter of judicial review before the Federal Court. I would therefore propose to dismiss the appeal.\nBackground \nDows appeal to this Court follows the divergent answers provided by the Tax Court and the Federal Court of Appeal to the following question, presented under s. 58 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR/90-688a:\nWhere the Minister of National Revenue has exercised her discretion pursuant to subsection 247(10) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) to deny a taxpayers request for a downward transfer pricing adjustment, is that a decision falling outside the exclusive original jurisdiction granted to the Tax Court of Canada under section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act and section 171 of the ITA?\n\n(T.C.C. reasons, at para. 21)\nThe question came to the Tax Court as a result of a denial by the Minister for a downward pricing adjustment relating to interest paid by Dow to a related Swiss company. I take due note of the background facts summarized by the Tax Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. The material facts are listed in the Statement of Agreed Facts filed by the parties in the Tax Court.\nTransfer pricing rules are set out in s. 247 of the ITA. Where a taxpayer (in this case Dow) is dealing with a non-resident person with whom it is not at arms length (here, the related Swiss company), s. 247(2) of the ITA provides that the amounts in a given transaction will be adjusted to reflect what would have been agreed to had the persons been dealing with one another at arms length. The application of s. 247(2) resulted in a significant increase in Dows income in the 2006 taxation year.\nDow believed that its income should be decreased to reflect an amount of interest that would have been paid in the circumstances. Where an amount is identified that would decrease the taxpayers income, s. 247(10) provides that a downward adjustment is not to be made unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made:\n(10) An adjustment (other than an adjustment that results in or increases a transfer pricing capital adjustment or a transfer pricing income adjustment of a taxpayer for a taxation year) shall not be made under subsection 247(2) unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made.\nIn 2013, Dow requested that the Minister make a downward transfer pricing adjustment under s. 247(10). The Minister advised Dow by letter that she would not exercise her discretion to make the downward adjustment. Within the applicable 30-day limitation period, Dow sought judicial review in the Federal Court of the Ministers discretionary decision to deny the transfer pricing adjustment under s. 247(10). \nDow also objected to the Notice of Reassessment, dated December 12, 2012, for the 2006 taxation year. The Minister issued another reassessment for the 2006 taxation year in 2015, and again in 2017. Dow appealed the 2017 reassessment to the Tax Court, which is the proceeding in which the s. 58 question was referred to the Tax Court. Dows 2013 application for judicial review was stayed pending a determination of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court.\nJudicial History\nTax Court of Canada, 2020 TCC 139, [2021] 2 C.T.C. 2063 (Monaghan J.)\nThe Tax Court judge held that the Ministers discretionary decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA is an essential component of the taxpayers assessment and goes to the correctness of [that] assessment (para. 29). The Ministers decision may therefore be reviewed by the Tax Court under its exclusive appellate jurisdiction to determine the correctness of the assessment (i.e., whether the assessment is supported by the facts and applicable law) (ibid.). The judge declined to express a view whether the Tax Court may substitute its own decision for that of the Minister under s. 247(10).\nShe observed that the Federal Court has jurisdiction to judicially review the Minister exercising powers under statute unless an Act of Parliament expressly provides for an appeal to another court or body, citing s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act (para. 89). She wrote that the question before her was whether the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) is one from which the ITA provides for an appeal to the Tax Court (para. 94). If it does, she continued, the Federal Court has no jurisdiction (ibid.). Noting the Tax Courts jurisdiction to hear appeals from assessments is part of Parliaments objective of avoiding parallel proceedings between the two courts, the Tax Court judge stated that the issue is whether a challenge to the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) is an attack on the correctness of the resulting assessment (either in fact or law) and therefore is a matter for the Tax Court (para. 99).\nThe Tax Court judge considered jurisprudence from the former Exchequer Court of Canada, which had both appellate jurisdiction over tax assessments and judicial review jurisdiction over decisions of the Minister. She noted that, for disputes under the former Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97 (IWTA), where the taxpayers complaint about an assessment under the IWTA was grounded in the Ministers exercise of a discretion bestowed on him in the IWTA, the Exchequer Courts appellate jurisdiction under the IWTA was engaged, rather than the Exchequer Courts [judicial review] jurisdiction (para. 105). \nDrawing in part on this historical analysis, the Tax Court judge wrote that if the Minister failed to exercise her discretion under s. 247(10) judicially, or in accordance with proper legal principles, the resulting assessment would be incorrect (paras. 142 and 144). The Ministers s. 247(10) decision must be made before any assessment of taxes and in accordance with proper legal principles. Thus, on appeal of an assessment, the Tax Court is both permitted and required to review the manner in which the Minister came to her determination under subsection 247(10) (para. 144). \nShe also held that the rules on an assessment appeal do not preclude a conclusion that the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction permits it to review the Ministers decision (para. 159). In considering the remedies available in the two courts, the Tax Court judge wrote that when a taxpayer disagrees with the Ministers decision under s. 247(10), the essential character of the relief sought is the setting aside of an assessment, and that is beyond the powers of the Federal Court (para. 167). She rejected the argument that a review of the Ministers discretionary decision-making must take place in the Federal Court, holding that decisions that relate to computations of income, taxable income or tax go to the correctness of the assessment and fall within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court (para. 173).\nThe Tax Court judge concluded on an appeal of an assessment, the appeal may be allowed on the basis that the Minister did not exercise her power under subsection 247(10) correctly (para. 213). That is, [w]here the Minister did not exercise the discretion at all, or exercised it on incorrect principles, the assessment cannot be said to be correct (ibid.).\nFederal Court of Appeal, 2022 FCA 70, [2022] 5 C.T.C. 1 (Webb J.A., Rennie and Locke JJ.A. concurring)\nThe Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Tax Court. It decided that the Federal Court has exclusive jurisdiction to judicially review the discretionary decisions by the Minister under s. 247(10). \nAfter reviewing the relevant provisions of the Federal Courts Act and the ITA, Webb J.A. wrote that if the ITA does not expressly provide for an appeal of that opinion to the Tax Court, the Federal Court would retain jurisdiction to judicially review that opinion (para. 34). \nAccording to Webb J.A., the resolution of this appeal turns on the different remedies that may be granted by the Tax Court and the Federal Court (para. 64). The remedies in the Tax Court all relate to assessments. While it might be recorded in an assessment, the Ministers decision is not itself an assessment because an assessment is the product of the process of determining a taxpayers liability under the ITA and not the process itself (para. 74). \nThe Ministers opinion regarding the appropriateness of a downward adjustment will certainly have a direct impact on Dows taxable income and its tax liability (para. 75). But Webb J.A. observed that the determination of whether in the circumstances it is appropriate that the downward adjustment be made was delegated by Parliament to the Minister (ibid.). As such, it is a separate decision of the Minister that precludes the reduction of income unless the Minister is of the opinion that a downward adjustment is appropriate (ibid.). Since Parliament delegated the authority to render this opinion to the Minister, and not to the Tax Court, the validity of the opinion is more properly a matter for judicial review in the Federal Court, which has the power to quash the opinion, if appropriate (para. 83).\nWebb J.A. concluded that, [s]ince the Tax Court does not have the power to quash an opinion rendered under subsection 247(10) of the [ITA], it will remain valid, unless it is quashed by the Federal Court on judicial review (para. 84). Only after the Federal Court has quashed the decision can the Tax Court order a reassessment. For this reason, Webb J.A. observed that the remedies available to both courts may be required if Dow is to succeed (para. 91).\nIssues\nThis appeal requires this Court to answer the question of law put to the Tax Court by the parties. \nThe parties agree on many key aspects of the jurisdictional question, including the fact that both the Federal Court and the Tax Court are creatures of statute. They agree that the challenge to a decision of the Minister is of a kind that would ordinarily fall within the Federal Courts exclusive original jurisdiction under s. 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act (A.F., at para. 52; R.F., at paras. 30-31). They also agree that this exclusive jurisdiction would be ousted to the extent there is an express statutory appeal to the Tax Court from the decision, pursuant to s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act (A.F., at para. 53; R.F., at para. 39). Finally, they agree that the ITA includes an express appeal to the Tax Court to have a tax assessment vacated or varied (A.F., at para. 42; R.F., at para. 29).\nThe point of disagreement is whether the appeal to the Tax Court from the assessment should also be interpreted, by necessary implication, to include appeals from other decisions of the Minister, in particular decisions made under s. 247(10), such that the Federal Courts jurisdiction over a challenge to that discretion is ousted by s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act. \nDow advances three core submissions in support of its position that the appeal of an assessment amounts to an express statutory appeal of the Ministers decision under s. 247(10). First, it argues that the Ministers decision is inextricably linked to an assessment and may therefore be challenged as part of the assessment (A.F., at paras. 86 and 92). Second, Dow says that the Tax Court, as a court specialized in tax matters, is the only forum able to provide it with the appropriate remedy, and would do so through procedures that would be desirable from an access to justice perspective (paras. 60, 75 and 80). Third, it argues that the historical evolution of the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction demonstrates that the Tax Court can hear appeals from assessments that reflect the Ministers discretionary decision (para. 126). \nIn answer, the Crown submits three broad arguments in support of its view that only the Federal Court can provide relief in respect of the Ministers discretionary decision under s. 247(10).\nFirst, the statutory delegation of authority to the Minister signals Parliaments intention that the s. 247(10) determination be separate from the Ministers assessment of tax (R.F., at para. 65). As an assessor of tax, the Minister has no choice but to strictly adhere to the provisions of the ITA. This is a qualitatively different task from exercising discretion in measuring the appropriateness of a downward adjustment in the circumstances, pursuant to s. 247(10). The opinion of the Minister under s. 247(10) is informed by policy considerations rather than whether the assessment is well founded in fact and in law. Second, the Federal Courts exclusive jurisdiction to review the exercise of ministerial powers under s. 247(10) has not been ousted by an express statutory provision as s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act requires (para. 40). Third, the nature of an appeal from an assessment, as defined in the jurisprudence, and the limited remedies available to the Tax Court further confirm Parliaments intention to grant exclusive jurisdiction to judicially review the discretionary decision of the Minister to the Federal Court (paras. 40 and 45). The essential character of Dows claim is to challenge the Ministers discretionary decision, which results from the delegation of authority to her by statute and which must be reviewed pursuant to administrative law principles. \nAnalysis\nFor the reasons that follow, I would decline to give effect to Dows arguments, which are inconsistent with the settled meaning of assessment in law and the scope of the statutory grant of jurisdiction to the Tax Court. Challenges to discretionary decisions under s. 247(10) must instead be reviewed by the Federal Court, which is the only court that has the jurisdiction to apply the appropriate standard of review and access to the appropriate range of administrative law remedies. \nA Decision Under Section 247(10) Is Distinct From an Assessment\nA central premise of Dows argument is that the Ministers s. 247(10) discretionary decision is so inextricably linked to an assessment of tax  assuming that one is even issued following that decision  that it can be challenged through an appellate procedure that only expressly applies to assessments. \nI respectfully disagree that the Ministers discretionary decision is part of the assessment. The meaning of assessment is settled in law, and the Ministers opinion formed under s. 247(10) is qualitatively distinct from that concept. This Courts settled interpretation of assessment aligns with the internal context of the statute, which provides separate appeal routes from ministerial decisions where this is intended, and nothing in the historical jurisprudence requires us to depart therefrom. \nThe Settled Meaning of an Assessment Under the Income Tax Act\nA tax assessment is, as this Courts jurisprudence confirms, a purely non-discretionary determination by the Minister of the taxpayers tax liability for a particular taxation year (Okalta Oils, at pp. 825-26; see also C. Campbell, Administration of Income Tax 2023 (2023), at pp. 405-8 and 414; Anchor Pointe Energy, at para. 33). This definition of assessment is consonant with the ITA itself (see ss. 152(1) and 248(1)) and amply reflected in the jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal. This meaning of assessment was confirmed by this Court as recently as 2022 (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins Family Trust, 2022 SCC 26, at paras. 25-26). The amount of tax owing  the product of the process of determining a taxpayers tax liability for the relevant taxation year  flows from the Income Tax Act itself (The Queen v. Wesbrook Management Ltd., 96 DTC 6590 (F.C.A.), at p. 6591). Section 152(3) of the ITA makes explicit that tax liability is unaffected even if the assessment is incorrect, incomplete or has not been made at all. \nIn Okalta Oils, this Court did not hold that anything at all that is ultimately related to an amount claimed is part of an assessment (p. 826). Instead, Fauteux J., as he then was, wrote for the Court that an assessment is the amount of tax at issue, not the process that resulted in the determination of that amount: \nIt is the contention of the respondent that, construed as it should be, the word assessment, in sections 69a and 69b [of the IWTA], means the actual amount of tax which the taxpayer is called upon to pay by the decision of the Minister, and not the method by which the assessed tax is arrived at; with the result that if no amount of tax is claimed, there being no assessment within the meaning of the sections, there is therefore no right of appeal from the decision of the Minister to the Income Tax Appeal Board.\n\nIn Commissioners for General Purposes of Income Tax for City of London and Gibbs and Others, [[1942] A.C. 402 (H.L.),] Viscount Simon L.C., in reference to the word assessment said, at page 406: \n\nThe word assessment is used in our income tax code in more than one sense. Sometimes, by assessment is meant the fixing of the sum taken to represent the actual profit for the purpose of charging tax on it, but in another context the assessment may mean the actual sum in tax which the taxpayer is liable to pay on his profits.\n\nThat the latter meaning attached to the word assessment, under the Act as it stood before the establishment of the Income Tax Appeal Board and the enactment of Part VIIIA  wherein the above sections are to be found  in substitution to Part VIII, is made clear by the wording of section 58(1) of the latter Part, reading:  \n\n58(1). Any person who objects to the amount at which he is assessed . . .\n\nUnder these provisions, there was no assessment if there was no tax claimed. Any other objection but one ultimately related to an amount claimed was lacking the object giving rise to the right of appeal from the decision of the Minister to the Board. [Underlining added; pp. 825-26.]\nIn preparing an assessment, the Ministers role is simply to determine what the law requires the taxpayer to pay by applying a fixed statutory formula to the amount of the persons taxable income for that year, and the amount of a persons taxable income is a function of the events that occurred before the end of that year (Addison & Leyen Ltd. v. Canada, 2006 FCA 107, [2006] 4 F.C.R. 532, at para. 38, revd on other grounds 2007 SCC 33, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 793 (Addison SCC); see also Anchor Pointe Energy, at para. 33, cited by Webb J.A., at para. 74). In other words, the tax owing is understood as resulting from rules in the ITA by operation of law (see Ereiser v. Minister of National Revenue, 2013 FCA 20, 444 N.R. 64, at para. 31; Main Rehabilitation, at para. 8). This is in keeping with the Courts judgment in Okalta Oils. \nPlainly, when preparing an assessment, the Minister does not exercise any discretion. As Stratas J.A. explained, [w]here the facts and the law demonstrate liability for tax, the Minister must issue an assessment (JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557, at para. 77; see also Ludmer v. Canada, [1995] 2 F.C. 3 (C.A.), at p. 17). As Professor Annick Provencher has observed, a discretionary decision of the minister could undergo judicial review. However, assessments do not generally require such discretion (Fifty Years of Taxation at the Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court, in M. Valois et al., eds., The Federal Court of Appeal and the Federal Court: 50 Years of History (2021), 543, at p. 551). Indeed, this Court has confirmed that the Ministers preparation of an assessment is not an exercise of discretion because taxpayers should have confidence that the Minister is administering and enforcing the same tax laws in the same way for everyone (Collins Family Trust, at para. 25). While the ITA empowers the Minister to exercise discretion in some matters, including over whether to issue downward transfer pricing adjustments under s. 247(10), these discretionary decisions are not assessments nor are they part of assessments. When the Minister makes discretionary decisions, she provides her opinion, guided by policy considerations. This is a task that is fundamentally different than the non-discretionary act of preparing an assessment. Accordingly, when a court reviews the Ministers opinion reflecting these policy considerations, it should do so on the basis of reasonableness rather than the statutory standard of de novo correctness that applies to assessments. \nThe Tax Courts jurisdiction under s. 169 of the ITA is thus limited to reviewing the correctness of assessments, which as I will explain, it does through a statutory de novo review process. Since assessments are non-discretionary acts by the Minister, [i]t is trite to say . . . that [the Tax Court] is not a court of equity with jurisdiction to review the Ministers discretionary decisions (Fazal v. R., 2020 TCC 137, [2021] G.S.T.C. 5, at para. 30; see also Azzopardi v. The King, 2023 TCC 51, [2023] 4 C.T.C. 2049, at para. 33; Callahan v. The King, 2023 TCC 172, [2024] 2 C.T.C. 2001, at para. 27). The question on an appeal of an assessment to the Tax Court is not about the conduct of the Minister in preparing the assessment, but rather about the correctness of the Ministers determination of the amount of tax owing, applying the rules in the ITA to the facts as she finds them.\nThe Tax Courts jurisdiction over the correctness of assessments includes matters such as the validity of assessments and the admissibility of evidence in support of assessments. While the Tax Courts jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the correctness of the product of the assessments, certain procedural defects  those that result only in an incorrect assessment  can be cured because the Tax Court will perform a de novo review of the assessment. This led Stratas J.A. to observe that [t]o the extent the Minister ignored, disregarded, suppressed or misapprehended evidence, an appeal under the general procedure in the Tax Court is an adequate, curative remedy (JP Morgan, at para. 82). But he recalled that [t]he Tax Court does not have jurisdiction on an appeal to set aside an assessment on the basis of reprehensible conduct by the Minister leading up to the assessment, such as abuse of power or unfairness, therefore in such a circumstance, the bar in section 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act against judicial review in the Federal Court does not apply (para. 83). Stratas J.A.s view is reflected in this Courts reasons in Addison SCC, at para. 8:\nIt is not disputed that the Minister belongs to the class of persons and entities that fall within the Federal Courts jurisdiction under s. 18.5. Judicial review is available, provided the matter is not otherwise appealable. It is also available to control abuses of power, including abusive delay. Fact-specific remedies may be crafted to address the wrongs or problems raised by a particular case. [Emphasis added.]\nIn Iris Technologies Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 SCC 24, a case argued before this Court on the same day as this appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal helpfully explained that the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction where the true purpose of an application for judicial review is to seek practical relief against the exercise of a discretion by the Minister (Canada (Attorney General) v. Iris Technologies Inc., 2022 FCA 101, [2022] 1 F.C.R. 401, at para. 13). Accordingly, the Federal Court of Appeal held in Iris that in respect of the exercise of ministerial discretion, the statutory rule ousting Federal Court jurisdiction in judicial review in favour of the Tax Court does not apply. This explains, as Rennie J.A. observed, why the outcome of the Federal Court of Appeals decision in the case at bar was favourable to the Federal Courts jurisdiction where the discretionary ministerial decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA was at the centre of the jurisdictional debate (ibid.).\nUnlike the non-discretionary determinations that make up an assessment, s. 247(10) empowers the Minister to play a fundamentally different role, which does not require her to apply the facts and the law in exactly the same way to every taxpayer. Her decision is based on policy considerations rather than the strict application of the law to the facts. The character of her discretionary decision-making is, in this way, fundamentally different from the exercise of assessing tax liability.\nSection 247(10) provides that certain transfer pricing adjustments shall not be made unless in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made. The subsection makes clear that the opinion of the Minister is a condition that may be relevant to the calculation of the transfer pricing adjustment and may in turn affect tax liability. Indeed, s. 247(10) has been described as a strange statutory rule that operates to increase or decrease income based on the discretion of the government, that is, the Ministers opinion as to the appropriateness of the adjustment (N. Boidman, Recent Developments in Canadian Transfer Pricing (2003), 55 Tax Exec. 208, at p. 210; see also M. Przysuski, Transfer Pricing Legislation in Canada (2005), 7:3 Corp. Bus. Taxn Monthly 23, at p. 26; F. Vincent and I. M. Freedman, Transfer Pricing in Canada: The Arms-Length Principle and the New Rules (1997), 45 Can. Tax J. 1213, at p. 1234). \nSection 247(10) must be understood alongside the non-discretionary rule in s. 247(2) of the ITA. When the conditions of s. 247(2) are met, the Minister must issue an upward adjustment of the taxpayers income to reflect . . . the amounts that would have been determined if the parties to the transaction had been dealing at arms length (F. Vincent and M. Ranger, Transfer Pricing in Canada (2018), at p. 320). These upward adjustments are not discretionary (ibid.). By contrast, s. 247(10) allows the Minister, in her discretion, to decide whether a downward adjustment is appropriate in the circumstances, which is an exception to the mandatory character of subsection 247(2) (ibid.). The Minister may make her decision under s. 247(10) before or after an assessment is issued. In addition, the Minister might decide not to exercise her discretion under s. 247(10) at all. If the Minister refuses to exercise her discretion, there is virtually no recourse for the taxpayer, short of obtaining a writ of mandamus in the Federal Court (p. 326).\nIt cannot be said that the Minister must exercise discretion under s. 247(10) in order for tax liability to be calculated correctly under the ITA. The general non-discretionary rule, which the Crown accurately characterizes as the default position, is that a downward transfer pricing adjustment, according to the text of s. 247(10), shall not be made under s. 247(2) (R.F., at para. 112). Properly interpreted, the words shall not (in French, ne peut etre) are to be construed as prohibitive. The Court of Appeal was right to say that if s. 247(2) would result in a downward transfer pricing adjustment, the general rule in s. 247(10) provides that the adjustment is not to be made (para. 24). Only when the Minister has formed the opinion that the adjustment is appropriate will the general prohibitive rule be displaced and the downward transfer pricing adjustment be made (s. 247(10) ITA). If the Minister has not exercised the discretion afforded under s. 247(10), she is not of the opinion that an adjustment is appropriate, and the general rule therefore applies. If the Minister has been asked to exercise her discretion and has concluded that the adjustment is not appropriate, the general rule continues to apply. In my view, it would be wrong to ignore the clear statutory default rule in s. 247(10) that tax liability must be calculated without making downward transfer pricing adjustments. Section 247(10) prohibits downward adjustments, subject to the discretion of the Minister. In keeping with Parliaments design [t]axpayers have no entitlement to a downward adjustment (R.F., at para. 107). It is only when the Minister is of the opinion that the adjustment is appropriate that the default statutory rule ceases to apply. Said respectfully, the Tax Court judge therefore erred in characterizing the discretion in s. 247(10) as one that had to be exercised in order to calculate tax liability correctly (paras. 182, 196 and 199). This interpretation overlooks the default rule put in place by Parliament and imposes a new burden on the Minister to fully consider the appropriateness of downward adjustments even where no request has been made by the taxpayer. \nRecognizing this interpretive error is especially important because, according to the Tax Court judge, [a]lthough the ITA contains very few provisions that give the Minister a discretion that affects the amount of a taxpayers income or taxable income, subsection 247(10) is not the only provision of that nature (para. 192). The Tax Court judge cited examples such as ss. 91(2), 111(1.1)(c) and 125(7) of the ITA, but did not propose an exhaustive list as, she said, only s. 247(10) was at issue (para. 196). The Tax Court judge would have left additional jurisdictional questions about these similar exercises of discretion unresolved (paras. 195-96). If this Court were to adopt the Tax Court judges erroneous characterization of s. 247(10) it would be both imprudent and likely prompt future litigation about such provisions, whether in the ITA or other tax legislation.\nWith this in mind, under s. 247(10), it is for the Minister to come to the opinion that (in French, si le ministre estime que) the circumstances are appropriate for an adjustment based on policy considerations that she considers to be appropriate (see generally Vincent and Ranger, at pp. 321-22). The question put to the Tax Court itself demonstrates Dows understanding that the decision is discretionary. It states: Where the Minister of National Revenue has exercised her discretion pursuant to subsection 247(10) . . . (emphasis added). This language stands in contrast with the non-discretionary rule for transfer pricing adjustments in s. 247(2) that applies in the absence of ministerial discretion. I agree with the Crown that s. 247(10) is a delegated decision-making power that allows the Minister to come to her opinion based on policy considerations, including considerations of fairness (R.F., at para. 61). The Crown further explains that the relevant circumstances alluded to in s. 247(10) include such policy considerations as possible international double taxation, or double non-taxation based on the tax treatment in a foreign jurisdiction (para. 118; see also Vincent and Ranger, at p. 16).\nI note in passing that the interpretation of s. 247(10) advanced by the Crown is consistent with guidance produced by the Canada Revenue Agency after the Court of Appeal released its judgment in this case (TPM-03R: Downward Transfer Pricing Adjustments, June 21, 2022 (online)). Section 247(10) is said to place a limitation on any downward transfer pricing adjustment, which conditions that adjustment on the favourable opinion of the Minister (para. 7). Downward transfer pricing adjustments are only available in limited circumstances and are not intended to serve as a vehicle for taxpayers to implement retroactive tax planning (paras. 29-30). This guidance further highlights that the Ministers decision is exceptional, discretionary and based in broad considerations of tax policy (para. 9). Challenging this policy-based decision should proceed separately from an appeal of the non-discretionary assessment.\nI would respectfully decline Dows call to depart from this Courts settled jurisprudence by expanding the definition of assessment to include discretionary decisions that it claims are directly affected by or inextricably linked to assessments. With respect, under Dows theory, the meaning of assessment would be expanded well beyond discretionary decisions of the Minister. For example, challenges to the conduct of the Minister rather than the product of the assessment itself can also be said to be inextricably linked to the assessments since alleged misconduct by the Minister may impact the result of the assessment. But the jurisprudence establishes that the Ministers conduct is not at issue in an assessment and that taxpayers cannot object to the underlying process or motivations for the issuing of an assessment before the Tax Court (see Okalta Oils; Canada v. Consumers Gas Co., [1987] 2 F.C. 60 (C.A.); Main Rehabilitation, at paras. 6-8; Roitman v. Canada, 2006 FCA 266, 353 N.R. 75, at para. 21; Ereiser; Johnson v. Minister of National Revenue, 2015 FCA 52, 470 N.R. 183, at para. 4; 9162-4676 Quebec Inc. v. Canada, 2016 FCA 112, 2017 DTC 5074, at para. 2). Before the Tax Court, if the final result of the assessment is correct, the assessment will be upheld even if the process that led to the assessment was flawed or abusive (see Webster v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 FCA 388, 312 N.R. 235, at para. 21; Ghazi v. Canada (National Revenue), 2019 FC 860, 70 Admin. L.R. (6th) 216, at para. 30; Newave Consulting Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2021 FC 1203, at para. 139 (CanLII); Chad v. Canada (National Revenue), 2023 FC 1481, [2024] 1 C.T.C. 63, at para. 28). To quote Professor Provencher once more, the Tax Court does not . . . have the power to vacate assessments on the basis of the wrongdoing of the minister (p. 552). Reviews of that kind of conduct by the executive proceed by way of judicial review before the Federal Court.\nThe Ministers opinion may well be a relevant consideration informing the correct computation of tax liability under the ITA. In correctly assessing tax liability, the Minister must take into account the opinion she has come to under s. 247(10), as this affects the calculation of the transfer pricing adjustment applied by operation of law. Therefore, it is true that, if the Ministers decision is followed by an assessment, that assessment will reflect the Ministers decision. However, this cannot be the basis to conclude that the Ministers decision is itself an assessment or part of one. Dows new criterion of directly affecting or inextricably linked for redefining an assessment in law is overreach and ignores the principled basis upon which the case law has used the settled definition to fix the jurisdictional contours of an appeal before the Tax Court.\nIn my view, the inextricably linked argument loses much of its persuasive force when one considers what happens with the taxpayers assessment should a discretionary decision made under s. 247(10) be found to have been made improperly. When that decision is quashed, it does not automatically follow that the tax liability is wrong and that the assessment is incorrect, since it is open to the Minister to make the same decision upon reconsideration. By contrast, whenever a non-discretionary determination is found to have been made in error, the Minister has no choice but to make the correct determination; she cannot make the same determination that has been found to be incorrect by the Tax Court. When the rectification implies a change in the tax liability, it then automatically follows that the assessment is incorrect. In other words, as soon as a non-discretionary determination is found to have been made in error, it is possible to know whether the assessment remains correct or not. The same cannot be said when a discretionary decision is found to have been made in error. I conclude that while discretionary decisions under s. 247(10) may well directly affect the product of the assessment, they cannot be considered to be inextricably linked to it the same way as non-discretionary determinations.\nWe must be careful not to confuse the fact of the Ministers opinion with the basis for it. My conclusion does not mean that in making the assessment, the Minister must scrutinize the basis underlying the s. 247(10) opinion. It is the mere existence of the Ministers opinion that is relevant to [the] product [of] the amount of the tax owing (Anchor Pointe Energy, at para. 33). Thus, as Thorson P. wrote, [a] clear distinction must be drawn between the Ministers determination and the assessment; they are not the same (Nicholson Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1945] Ex. C.R. 191, at p. 202). I agree with the Crown that, given the statutory scheme, it is only the outcome of the Ministers exercise of discretion that may be a fact relevant to the correctness of the assessment here, not the appropriateness of that outcome (R.F., at paras. 104-5). Facts underlying the Ministers exercise of discretion are unconnected to the correctness of the assessment (para. 104). With the utmost respect, I disagree with the Tax Court judges view that an improper exercise of this discretion, or a failure to exercise this discretion, renders the assessment incorrect (T.C.C. reasons, at para. 213). This is incompatible with the statutory scheme which directs in s. 247(10) that the default statutory rule  i.e., no downward transfer pricing adjustment  applies unless the Minister comes to the opinion that an adjustment is appropriate. Whether the Ministers opinion reflects proper policy considerations is not a relevant fact that feeds into the assessment in any way. \nIndeed, when the Minister makes a discretionary decision under s. 247(10), she will not always issue an assessment to reflect her decision, as Dow readily acknowledged at the hearing (transcript, at pp. 15 and 24-25). This happens when in the opinion of the Minister it is not appropriate to adjust the taxpayers income, as there is no departure in that case from the default rule that the adjustment shall not be made. Further, decisions under s. 247(10) may be made after an assessment has been issued, such as when a taxpayer makes a request for a downward adjustment. \nWith this in mind, and said respectfully, the Tax Court judge erred in law by stating that the determination under subsection 247(10) . . . must be made before a correct assessment can be issued (para. 191 (emphasis deleted)). Indeed, the Minister will often exercise her discretion under s. 247(10) after an initial assessment is issued. As the facts of this case illustrate, taxpayers will often request downward adjustments after they have been assessed (see statement of agreed facts, at para. 17, reproduced in A.R., at p. 170). If a taxpayer asks the Minister to make a downward adjustment after an assessment has been issued  as was done in this case  it cannot be said that the initial assessment is incorrect because the Minister refused to issue a downward adjustment that was requested later. When, as in this case, the taxpayer makes a request under s. 247(10) and the Minister declines it, presumably the minister will issue a letter denying the downward adjustment request but will not issue a notice of assessment (Sandler and Watzinger, at p. 285). \nNeither party asked this Court to change the law of transfer pricing by holding that the Minister must always exercise her discretion under s. 247(10) before assessments are issued or that the Ministers decision must be recorded in an assessment even if the Minister denies the taxpayers request for a downward adjustment. On the contrary, both parties agreed at the hearing that the Minister may make her decision after an assessment is issued and that, should she deny the taxpayers request for a downward adjustment, often no assessment will be issued to reflect that (see transcript, at pp. 23 and 56-57). Dow rightly acknowledged that the only avenue to challenge the decision where there is no assessment issued is an application for judicial review in Federal Court, undercutting the one-stop shop jurisdictional argument (pp. 15 and 24-25). \nThe Ministers assessment and the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) reflect two different statutory roles that are qualitatively and practically distinct. Dows position would disrupt the settled meaning of an assessment in order to expand the Tax Courts jurisdiction far beyond what is conferred upon it by statute. If Parliament had wished that the Minister would issue a new assessment in every circumstance that s. 247(10) discretion were exercised, even in the context of a denial of a request for a downward adjustment, it would have provided for this in the ITA. To the extent it would be appropriate to change the nature of the s. 247(10) decision or otherwise assimilate it to the assessment, that would require a legislative amendment.\nThe Tax Courts Jurisdiction Cannot Be Enlarged By Necessary Implication\nDow suggests that the power of the Tax Court to hear appeals of assessments may include decisions of the Minister pursuant to provisions like s. 247(10) by necessary implication (A.F., at para. 107). With respect, this is inconsistent with the distinct routes of appeal to the Tax Court from other decisions of the Minister that are set out expressly in the ITA. \nWhere Parliament provided for recourse from a ministerial decision to the Tax Court, it did not rely on an implicit connection to the assessment, but rather created an express right to appeal that decision. Express appeal routes would not be necessary if these decisions could be appealed to the Tax Court as part of the assessment. \nFor example, if the Minister refuses to grant a taxpayer an extension of the timeline to file a notice of objection, the taxpayer may apply further to the Tax Court for an extension of time pursuant to subsection 166.2(1) of the [ITA] (Canada (National Revenue) v. ConocoPhillips Canada Resources Corp., 2017 FCA 243, 2017 DTC 5135, at para. 44). Parliament provided the Tax Court with a special set of remedies to address these challenges (s. 166.2(4)). It did not rely on the appeal of the assessment to which the objection relates for jurisdiction to challenge the Ministers refusal. \nDecisions affecting tax liability are also subject to explicit routes of appeal to the Tax Court, where appropriate. For example, the ITA provides the federal Minister of the Environment with the power to determine the fair market value of ecological gifts (s. 118.1(10.2) to (10.5)). This fair market value could affect a tax assessment through its impact on the corresponding tax benefits. Challenges to the Minister of the Environments determination is through a separate route of appeal to the Tax Court, directly from the determination of fair market value (s. 169(1.1); see Lubetsky (2022), at pp. 66-67). The Tax Court is provided with specifically tailored powers to dispose of those appeals (s. 171(1.1)). In other words, where Parliament seeks to oust Federal Court jurisdiction as s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act permits, it has done so, as that provision directs, by way of an express rule in the ITA and not by necessary implication.\nFurther, the ITA gives the Minister the power to determine a taxpayers losses in prescribed circumstances, which can bind both the Minister and the taxpayer for the purpose of calculating tax in any taxation year (s. 152(1.1) and (1.3); see Interior Savings Credit Union v. R., 2007 FCA 151, [2007] 4 C.T.C. 55, at para. 20). Parliament provides a route to challenge that determination directly to the Tax Court, on a separate and explicit statutory basis distinct from a challenge to the assessment (s. 152(1.2) and (1.3); R.F., at para. 43). The Tax Court has held that challenging the determination in later years through an appeal of the assessment is an impermissible collateral attack on the Ministers decision (M. H. Lubetsky, Income Tax Disputes Involving Loss Years: Pitfalls, Foibles, and Possible Reforms (2019), 67 Can. Tax J. 499, at pp. 516-17).\nThis statutory context shows that ministerial decisions are understood as distinct from the tax assessment even where they may directly affect it. If Parliament wishes for the Tax Court to have jurisdiction to review a Ministers decision that may impact liability under the ITA, it says so explicitly and provides the Tax Court with an appropriate range of remedies. To hold that the Tax Court could have implicit jurisdiction over the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) on an assessment appeal would be inconsistent with this established method.\nThe Historical Jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada Does Not Support Dows Position \nFinally, I disagree with Dow that the jurisdiction of the former Exchequer Court of Canada supports the view that decisions by the Minister under s. 247(10) of the ITA form part of an assessment.\nIt is true that the Exchequer Court had jurisdiction over exercises of discretion by the Minister under the former IWTA. Dow is right to say that the Exchequer Court exercised their appellate jurisdiction in appeals from assessments that involved the Ministers exercise of discretion (A.F., at para. 122) before Parliament established the modern Federal Court and the Tax Court. And it is true, as Dow notes, that the Exchequer Court had access to similar remedies as the modern Tax Court in taxation matters (at para. 125), specifically the power to dispose of appeals from assessments by vacating or varying them, or referring the assessment back to the Minister for further consideration and reassessment (see Lubetsky (2022), at p. 114).\nImportantly, however, in addition to this power, the Exchequer Court had other broad sources of jurisdiction under the IWTA that supported its review of ministerial discretion. As Dow notes, s. 66 of the former IWTA provided the Exchequer Court exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions that may arise in connection with any assessment made under this Act and in delivering judgment may make any order as to payment of any tax, interest or penalty . . . as to the said Court may seem right and proper (see A.F., at para. 119 (emphasis added)). I agree with the Crown that this grant of jurisdiction to the former Exchequer Court is broader than the grant of jurisdiction to the current Tax Court related to the assessment.\nThe Exchequer Court also had access to administrative law remedies, unlike the modern Tax Court (see, e.g., Pure Spring Co. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1946] Ex. C.R. 471, at p. 487). The Exchequer Courts jurisdiction over the ministers discretion engaged what are now often referred to as the rules of natural justice (C. Campbell and R. Raizenne, A History of Canadian Income Tax, vol. 1, The Income War Tax Act, 1917-1948 (2022), at p. 403). It is therefore unsurprising that, in the historical cases on which Dow relies, the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court was not challenged.\nFurther, as the Crown notes, the Exchequer Court cases on which Dow relies did not grapple with divided statutory grants of authority between two courts. Instead, the decisions articulate principles by which courts review ministerial discretion. I agree with the Crown that these principles have since evolved in fundamental ways. This is another reason to be cautious before applying their reasoning to the jurisdiction of the modern Tax Court.\nWhen determining whether the historical principles developed in the context of the Exchequer Court apply to the Tax Court, parallels drawn between their remedial powers must be understood in their full context. Despite having powers related to assessments that bear resemblance to those of todays Tax Court, the Exchequer Court exercised those powers as part of a broader jurisdictional grant conferring on it the ability to review ministerial discretion. I acknowledge that these Exchequer Court decisions were later followed by the Income Tax Appeal Board in its early years as a transitional matter (Lubetsky (2022), at pp. 79 and 114), but this does not change the fact that they were developed in the unique context of the historical Exchequer Court. In my respectful view, this provides no basis to apply these principles to the Tax Court, constituted decades later.\nI agree that the historical jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court is of limited relevance to the question at hand because [t]he issue in this appeal relates to the jurisdiction of the Tax Court and the Federal Court, not the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court as it related to appeals under the Income War Tax Act (C.A. reasons, at para. 50). Given the differences between the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court and the modern Tax Court, the Crown is right to say that [i]t is an overreach to apply [historical jurisprudence] to the Tax Court under modern-day legislation (R.F., at para. 97).\nAccepting Dows Call to Depart From the Settled Meaning of Assessment Would Create Significant Legal Uncertainty\nIn my view, Dows jurisdictional theory has potential implications beyond the matter in issue. In particular, it would unsettle this Courts jurisprudence on the standard of review set forth in Vavilov. It would also bring about broader uncertainty regarding the Federal Courts jurisdiction. \nAccepting Dows Theory Would Create Uncertainty in the Law Governing Standard of Review\nAs noted above, when a taxpayer challenges an assessment under s. 169 of the ITA, the Tax Court will conduct a de novo review of that assessment. The Tax Court is not limited to the record before the Minister when considering the correctness of the assessment and does not ask whether the Ministers assessment was reasonable (see generally D. Jacyk, The Dividing Line Between the Jurisdictions of the Tax Court of Canada and Other Superior Courts (2008), 56 Can. Tax J. 661, at p. 667, citing Johnston v. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] S.C.R. 486, at p. 489, and Canada (Attorney General) v. Buchanan, 2002 FCA 231, 2002 DTC 7397, at para. 18, per Rothstein J.A.). Unlike typical statutory appeals of administrative action in which courts apply the appellate standards of review and judicial review matters in which courts presumptively apply reasonableness review, an appeal to the Tax Court involves non-deferential, de novo review (Lubetsky (2022), at p. 65). The Tax Court reviews the correctness of assessments through trial[s] in which both sides adduce evidence on issues of fact and make submissions on issues of law (J. Li, J. Magee and J. S. Wilkie, Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law (10th ed. 2022), at p. 483; see also Campbell v. Minister of National Revenue, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 4; JP Morgan, at para. 82; A. Provencher and P. Dupuis, Aspects juridiques de la fiscalite canadienne des particuliers (5th ed. 2023), at pp. 180-81).\nIf a discretionary decision under s. 247(10) were part of an assessment, it would thus be reviewed de novo by the Tax Court like any other part of that same assessment. However, absent legislative direction, it would be inappropriate for the Tax Court to review the Ministers decision de novo. It is, as this Court emphasized in Vavilov, the very fact that the legislature has chosen to delegate authority which justifies a default position of reasonableness review (para. 30 (emphasis in original)). Dow seems to recognize this by arguing that rather than performing a de novo review of a discretionary decision made under s. 247(10), the Tax Court should review these decisions for reasonableness in accordance with Vavilov (A.F., at para. 74) in a way that is not more or less deferential than the standard of review that the Federal Court would apply in the same circumstances (transcript, at p. 15). Dow insists that its called judicial review when it is before the Federal Court, but that same sort of standard can be applied by [the] Tax Court (ibid.). Dow is, in effect, asking this Court to grant judicial review jurisdiction to the Tax Court. With respect, since Parliament has not created an exception to the rule that assessments are subject to de novo review in the Tax Court, Dow cannot argue, on one hand, that a discretionary decision under s. 247(10) is part of an assessment and that, on the other hand, it is not subject to de novo review. If the Ministers decision is truly part of an assessment, the only option allowed by statute would be for the Tax Court to review it de novo for correctness. The Tax Court cannot apply a deferential standard of review such as reasonableness to part of an assessment. Accordingly, the Federal Court is the only court that has jurisdiction to undertake this review on reasonableness. \nIndeed, the Tax Court does not have the jurisdiction to conduct judicial review, which is reserved for the Federal Court by ss. 18 and 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act for federal administrative actors like the Minister (see Addison SCC, at paras. 8 and 11). This Court cannot confer jurisdiction to conduct judicial review on the Tax Court; only Parliament can do this. As Dow acknowledges, the Tax Courts jurisdiction is limited to reviewing the correctness of assessments (transcript, at p. 26). But Dows argument that the Tax Court has jurisdiction is based on a claim that Parliament has ousted the judicial review jurisdiction of the Federal Court under s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act by providing a statutory appeal mechanism to the Tax Court. \nIn effect, Dow has asked this Court to extend, by judicial fiat, the jurisdiction of the Tax Court by providing it with original jurisdiction to undertake judicial review of the Ministers decision under s. 247(10). I recall that the Tax Court, like the Federal Court, is a statutory court, with its authority fixed by the legislature. Parliament has assigned original jurisdiction for judicial review against any federal board (to which the Minister is assimilated) to the Federal Court in the Federal Courts Act, not to the Tax Court (see in particular ss. 18(1), 18(3), 18.1 and 18.5). Parliament has directed, in the same statute, that the remedies under s. 18(1) can only be obtained by filing an application for judicial review in the Federal Court, which can provide the remedies necessary to provide relief for this kind of wrongful administrative conduct (s. 18.1(3)). The Tax Court has no statutory authority to undertake such a review, much less provide adequate remedies where relief is called for. I recall what this Court wrote in Vavilov, at para. 82:\nReasonableness review aims to give effect to the legislatures intent to leave certain decisions with an administrative body while fulfilling the constitutional role of judicial review to ensure that exercises of state power are subject to the rule of law: see Dunsmuir [v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190], at paras. 27-28 and 48; Catalyst Paper Corp. v. North Cowichan (District), 2012 SCC 2, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 10; Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 10.\nIf Parliament had provided a statutory appeal mechanism through which one could challenge discretionary decisions made under s. 247(10) of the ITA, the presumptive reasonableness standard in Vavilov would not apply. Instead, the Tax Court would ordinarily need to apply the appellate standards of review such as those set out in this Courts decision in Housen (see Vavilov, at para. 37; see also Yatar v. TD Insurance Meloche Monnex, 2024 SCC 8, at para. 48). This is understood to give effect to the legislatures design choices in crafting the statutory appeal mechanism at issue, and the legislature is therefore free to direct another standard of review should it intend that a different standard of review apply (Vavilov, at para. 37). \nDow cannot say, in the same breath, that a s. 247(10) discretionary decision is an assessment or part of one such that it is subject to appeal under the ITA but that it also is to be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness. To say so, in my respectful view, would be wholly inconsistent with fundamental administrative law principles settled in Vavilov. In response to direct questions about the standard of review at the hearing, Dow provided no basis to reconcile its theory with these key administrative law principles (transcript, at pp. 10-15).\nFurther, applying the appellate standards of review to a decision appealed to the Tax Court through s. 169 would be inconsistent with the settled nature of this appeal provision. Here, the parties agree that the appeal mechanism Parliament has created in s. 169 of the ITA subjects the Ministers assessment to de novo correctness review before the Tax Court, through a trial procedure, though with the burden of proof on the taxpayer to overturn the Ministers assumptions of fact. Dow rightly referred to this at the hearing as a modified de novo review, in the sense that there are assumed facts (transcript, at p. 13). This specific right of appeal from a tax assessment has consistently been interpreted as less deferential than typical statutory appeals, given that it permits the Tax Court to carry out a de novo review of the assessment through a trial procedure (see generally Campbell, at p. 4; Jacyk, at p. 667, citing Johnston, at p. 489; Buchanan, at para. 18, per Rothstein J.A.; Lubetsky (2022), at p. 65; Li, Magee and Wilkie, at p. 483; JP Morgan, at para. 82). Vavilov suggests that the nature of the statutory mechanism by which a decision is challenged is relevant to determining the legislatures intention regarding the standard of review (para. 36). It is not at all clear how the single appellate mechanism at issue here could provide at once for de novo review for some parts of the assessment and for appellate review of decisions that are said to be inextricably linked to that same assessment, nor how that bifurcation would be reconciled with Vavilov. \nI add that, to the extent it would be appropriate to apply an appellate standard of review other than those set out in Housen, I would be hesitant to rely on this Courts approach to standard of review applicable to judicial discretion. Judicial discretion and administrative discretion in transfer pricing are worlds apart; the parties did not suggest the approach to reviewing judicial discretion in cases like Canada (Transportation Safety Board) v. CarrollByrne, 2022 SCC 48, should be applied to inform the standard of review by administrative actors. CarrollByrne is not a case about the review of administrative discretion, and applying it to the review of the s. 247(10) decision, even by analogy, would in my respectful view be inappropriate. This would be equivalent to transplanting the standards associated with the appellate review of discretionary criminal sentencing undertaken by judges, or of judicial discretion in case management matters, to the review of administrative decision-makers such as the Minister opining under s. 247(10) of the ITA. I note in passing that this Court has applied the Housen standards to other decisions it describes as discretionary (see, e.g., Southwind v. Canada, 2021 SCC 28, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 450, at paras. 85 and 123). As I conclude that the s. 247(10) decision is not part of an assessment, and is therefore reviewable only in Federal Court on a reasonableness standard, I do not need to decide what principles govern the appellate standards of review where they are applicable. \nI recognize that the Tax Court judge proposed applying a novel standard, distinct from reasonableness, to the review of the discretionary ministerial decision under s. 247(10). She described a principle of law, applicable in this context, that a discretion must be exercised judicially, [meaning] fairly and honestly and in accordance with sound and fundamental [legal] principles (para. 142). If the Minister fails to do so, she has not exercised the discretion at all and the resulting assessment is not correct in law (ibid.). On this basis, the Tax Court judge reasoned that where the Minister fails to exercise her discretion judicially when denying a downward adjustment, on an appeal of the resulting assessment, . . . the Tax Court is both permitted and required to review the manner in which the Minister came to her determination under subsection 247(10) (para. 144).\nWith respect for the Tax Court judges view, I disagree with this approach. The exercise of discretion in s. 247(10) reflects an administrative decision, not a judicial one. The authority on which the Tax Court judge relies in developing this standard is a pre-Vavilov decision concluding that the failure to apply proper principles means a statutory power was not exercised at all (T.C.C. reasons, at paras. 140-41, citing Pure Spring). This is not how administrative discretion is analyzed under the Vavilov framework; courts now defer to statutory decision-makers by presumptively applying reasonableness review. The standard of review that the Tax Court judge proposed for the review of the Ministers discretionary decision departs from the presumptive standard of reasonableness in Vavilov and does not do so in the manner the Court directed for statutory appeals in para. 37 of its reasons in that case. I recall that in referencing the usually applicable standards of appellate review set out in Housen, the Court in Vavilov said that a legislature is free, by statute, to fix another standard: Of course, should a legislature intend that a different standard of review apply in a statutory appeal, it is always free to make that intention known by prescribing the applicable standard through statute (ibid.). One might well argue that, for the appeal of assessments set forth by Parliament in s. 169(1) of the ITA, Parliament has created a de novo procedure where the parties proceed to a trial of the matter and where Parliament has set rules on the burden of proof. To import a new standard of review into that appeal would, in my respectful view, directly contradict Parliaments intent on how the Tax Court should decide if the assessment is correct.\nThe statutory de novo review in the Tax Court does not contemplate deference to the assessment other than placing the evidentiary burden of proof on the taxpayer (see Provencher and Dupuis, at pp. 180-81). It requires all aspects of the assessment, fact and law, to be scrutinized for correctness. Any approach that purports to apply a deferential standard of review in this context would change the Tax Courts settled role. What applying de novo review would actually require would be for the Tax Court to substitute its opinion on the appropriateness of the downward adjustment for that of the Minister. In so doing, it would be coming to a conclusion as to appropriate tax policy, when its role has always been to apply tax law as set out by Parliament. Again, I do not have to decide whether and how de novo review would apply to the s. 247(10) decision, given it is not part of the assessment that is subject to de novo review in the first place.\nIn sum, this is not an appeal in which we are well placed to create a novel standard of review in order to avoid fundamental defects in Dows theory. Doing so in the absence of adequate argument by the parties and analysis in the courts below could give rise to unintended consequences. Parliament did not provide any basis in the ITA to depart from the presumptive standard of reasonableness (Vavilov, at para. 25), because discretionary decisions are not assessments nor part of assessments. As I have said, assessments are to be reviewed by the Tax Court de novo in accordance with the settled nature of a tax appeal. In this case, holding that any standard other than reasonableness applies to exercises of the Ministers discretion under s. 247(10) would undercut the certainty and predictability that Vavilov brought to this Courts jurisprudence on the standard of review.\nIn my view, the complication regarding the applicable standard of review flows directly from Dows attempt to challenge s. 247(10) through an appeal provision that was never intended to apply to that discretionary decision. This complication falls away completely once one accepts that these claims were intended to be heard in the Federal Court on a standard of reasonableness, consonant with Vavilov.\nDows Approach Would Cause Uncertainty Regarding the Federal Courts Jurisdiction \nTreating the Ministers decision as part of an assessment for the purposes of the appeal provision would in practice result in new bifurcated streams of review and give rise to new issues regarding the Federal Courts jurisdiction that could well provoke further litigation.\nAll agree that the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) can be made without an assessment being issued, as was done in Dows case. If this Court were to conclude that this decision is part of an assessment, this could prejudice a taxpayers ability to object to such decisions. In the case of corporations, the time limit to object to an assessment is generally 90 days from the sending of the notice of assessment (s. 165(1)(b) ITA). If the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) is made after the time limit for objections and appeals and no subsequent assessment is issued, the ability to challenge it may be statute-barred (s. 169(1) ITA).\nDow seeks to avoid this difficulty by arguing that, if the Minister does not issue an assessment after she makes a discretionary decision under s. 247(10), the Ministers decision can be challenged by way of judicial review in the Federal Court (transcript, at p. 24).\nWith respect, Dow proposes an untenable solution in which the Federal Court would retain its judicial review jurisdiction over discretionary decisions by the Minister as a general rule, but it would lose its jurisdiction to conduct judicial review of those same discretionary decisions if they are followed by assessments. Dows solution raises the difficulty of there being two different courts  applying two different standards of review  with jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions under s. 247(10), depending on whether or not an assessment is issued after the decision is made. \nMoreover, Dows approach concerns not only s. 247(10), but seeks to enlarge the Tax Courts jurisdiction beyond the correctness of assessments to other related Ministerial decisions. The Federal Court exercises jurisdiction over many taxation matters, including jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions of the Minister (see, e.g., Bozzer v. Canada (National Revenue), 2011 FCA 186, [2013] 1 F.C.R. 242; Jewett v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 187, [2021] 4 C.T.C. 1; Shaw Estate v. Canada (Attorney General), 2021 FC 576). When asked at the hearing whether Dows position is that the discretion in 247(10) of the Minister . . . is properly a matter for the Tax Court, counsel replied that he [does not] think that goes far enough because the Tax Court should have jurisdiction any time the Minister exercises a discretion (transcript, at pp. 3-4). \nDows invitation to expand the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to include judicial review of discretionary decisions under s. 247(10) may, as it conceded at the hearing, be extended to a myriad of other provisions that will impact millions of taxpayers (transcript, at p. 2). Even if this Court seeks to limit its conclusions to the downward pricing context, the expanded nature of an assessment it would embrace could have unwitting consequences in other settings. In many contexts in which the Minister exercises discretion  which, in addition to s. 247(10), includes the discretion to waive tax, interest or penalties  it can be said that her discretion will have an impact on the amount of tax owing. If, for example, the Minister decides to waive a tax, the taxpayers tax liability will change. Dows argument, if accepted, would by its own admission extend to a myriad of other contexts in which the Minister exercises discretion (ibid.). It is unclear which of these provisions will be affected and therefore the extent to which the jurisdiction of the Tax Court will be expanded at the expense of the Federal Court. \nSince the Federal Court and the Tax Court do not have concurrent jurisdiction  the jurisdiction of the Federal Court is ousted whenever the Tax Court has jurisdiction  this uncertainty will likely lead to more litigation. A challenge to the Ministers decision brought in the wrong court must be struck. A taxpayer may bring a challenge to a discretionary decision by the Minister to either the Tax Court or the Federal Court only to be faced with a jurisdictional challenge based on uncertainty created by Dows theory. If their challenge is struck in one court, they may be statute-barred from bringing a claim in the other court, unless they initiated proceedings in both courts within the applicable limitation periods. Far from improving access to justice, Dows theory would cement the need for taxpayers to initiate parallel proceedings. Large multinational corporate taxpayers like Dow may be able to bear the costs associated with navigating the jurisdictional uncertainty that its position would generate, but other taxpayers  especially the individuals and small businesses that Dow claims that it is attempting to help  will be left in a much more vulnerable position.\nI add that this could have jurisdictional consequences even outside the confines of the ITA. I recall that the jurisdictional dispute turns around s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act, which excludes the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court over this type of claim where a federal statute expressly provides for an appeal to other courts. By accepting Dows position that an express appeal provision that permits an appeal from one decision also, implicitly, allows an appeal from distinct but related decisions, this Court would be opening the door to jurisdictional controversy in other statutory contexts where s. 18.5 is also at issue. Rather than insisting on Parliament expressly providing for an appeal to deprive the Federal Court of jurisdiction, we would be interpreting s. 18.5 to cover decisions that are only implicitly captured by statutory appeal provisions. This raises questions about which decisions are sufficiently connected to the decisions that are expressly subject to an appeal to benefit from this expanded notion of s. 18.5. \nThe imprecise definition of which discretionary decisions are inextricably linked to assessments is exemplified by the shifting terminology in Dows written and oral arguments. It is described variously as requiring that the decision directly affects or directly impacts that assessment (A.F., at para. 107; transcript, at p. 6), forms an essential componen[t] of the amount of tax payable (A.F., at para. 92), or is reflect[ed] in the assessment (A.F., at paras. 95 and 99; transcript, at p. 4). \nMoreover, Dows proposed approach to s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act is inconsistent with the principles of statutory interpretation. The modern approach requires courts to [read] the words of an Act . . . in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, cited with approval in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26). This approach focusses on the text, context, and purpose of the statutory provision (Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21, at para. 69). And as this Court held recently in the taxation context, [w]here the words of a statute are precise and unequivocal, their ordinary meaning will play a dominant role (Canada v. Loblaw Financial Holdings Inc., 2021 SCC 51, at para. 41, citing Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10). Professors Pierre-Andre Cote and Mathieu Devinat observed that this Courts jurisprudence indicates that [translation] legislative purpose alone cannot justify a departure from the express language of a provision (Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at para. 1366). While purpose is an important factor in statutory interpretation, its [translation] weight may vary, particularly when it is at odds with the text itself (para. 1345). Section 18.5 states that only an express ouster of the Federal Courts jurisdiction will have such an effect. Dows call to extend the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, by necessary implication rather than by express statutory language ought to be rejected. The Ministers decision may well feed into the tax assessment. But the relevant provisions of the Federal Courts Act and the ITA, when interpreted with a view to their text, context and purpose, do not support the ouster of the Federal Courts jurisdiction.\nChallenges to the Ministers Discretionary Decisions Must Be Heard in the Federal Court\nDow argues that the Tax Court is the superior venue in which to challenge the s. 247(10) decision, given its remedial powers and procedural particularities. I respectfully disagree. In my view, only the Federal Court can grant an appropriate remedy for a challenge to the s. 247(10) decision. Moreover, the Tax Court has never been, and was never intended by Parliament to be, an exclusive forum for taxation matters. Attempting to achieve that result without a comprehensive reform that only Parliament can bring about would not enhance access to justice as Dow claims. \nOnly the Federal Court Can Provide the Remedy Sought\nIt is true that, in form, Dow is seeking an order for reconsideration and reassessment from the Tax Court. Dow rightly recalls that [i]n Windsor [(City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 617], this Honourable Court held that the first step in considering a jurisdictional dispute is to determine the essential nature or character of that claim (A.F., at para. 69). While it is relevant to consider the remedies sought when determining the essential nature of the claim, I disagree with Dow that the Appellant seeks a remedy that may be provided only by the Tax Court  the referral of an assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment (para. 70). \nIf the Tax Court determines that an assessment is incorrect, Dow is right to say that the Tax Court may vacate the assessment, vary it, or refer it back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment. However, Dow argues that, as part of its power to refer the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment, the Tax Court can order the Minister to reconsider the decision to deny the downward adjustment under s. 247(10) (A.F., at para. 64).\nI respectfully disagree. As I have emphasized, it is only the Ministers opinion that the downward transfer pricing adjustment is appropriate under s. 247(10) that is relevant to the correctness of an assessment, not the facts that underlie that opinion. If the Tax Court issues an order for reconsideration and reassessment, the Minister will simply be required to issue a reassessment that correctly reflects the very decision that the taxpayer sought to challenge since that decision would not have been quashed. Moreover, an order for reconsideration and reassessment cannot compel the Minister to reconsider her discretionary decision under s. 247(10) because such a decision is not an assessment nor part of one. I agree with Webb J.A. that the remedies granted to the Tax Court . . . do not extend to the power to vary the opinion of the Minister rendered under subsection 247(10) of the ITA or to quash this opinion (para. 77). I recall that where Parliament has created express recourse to the Tax Court from decisions of the Minister, it has also prescribed powers allowing that court to effectively dispose of those matters (see, e.g., s. 166.2(4) ITA). If Parliament had sought to confer power to grant relief from the s. 247(10) opinion on the Tax Court, it would have to have done so by statute. One could argue that such powers could be a suitable consideration in comprehensive legislative reform addressing the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. For example, author Lubetsky has suggested that [t]o preserve the independence and effectiveness of the Tax Court, the court should have a broader equitable jurisdiction to revise discretionary ministerial decisions de novo, potentially similar to the jurisdiction set out in . . . section 166.2 (with regard to the late-filing of objections) (Lubetsky (2022), at p. 112). Given the language of the current ITA, however, Webb J.A. is right to say the Tax Court does not have the remedial tools necessary to address the s. 247(10) decision.\nAs Webb J.A. correctly observed, the Federal Court has the power to quash the Ministers discretionary decision, which would require her to reconsider it (para. 77). While the Federal Court is not allowed to vary, set aside or vacate assessments (JP Morgan, at para. 93), it has access to administrative law remedies that are appropriate for discretionary decisions by the Minister, which as I have emphasized, are not assessments. I recall that while it is true that the Federal Court cannot invalidate an assessment . . . the Federal Court may grant a declaration based on administrative law principles in tax matters (Sifto Canada Corp. v. Minister of National Revenue, 2014 FCA 140, 461 N.R. 184, at para. 25; see also Maverick Oilfield Services Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 1728, [2024] 2 C.T.C. 67). In this context, should the Federal Court quash a decision made under s. 247(10) on administrative law grounds and the Minister issue a new decision that affects the amount of tax owing, the assessment will be incorrect if it does not accurately reflect the new opinion. At that point, the Tax Court may intervene, but only after the Federal Court has quashed the Ministers decision, after the Minister made a new decision, after that new decision results in a change in the taxpayers tax liability, and if the Minister fails to issue a reassessment to reflect a change in tax liability. \nIn this light, Webb J.A. correctly observed that [s]ince the Tax Court does not have the power to quash an opinion rendered under subsection 247(10) of the [ITA], it will remain valid, unless it is quashed by the Federal Court on judicial review (para. 84). If the Federal Court quashes the Ministers decision under s. 247(10), the Minister will have the opportunity to reconsider it, which may result in the issuance of a reassessment. At that point  if the reassessment is alleged to be incorrect  the taxpayer may challenge it by way of an appeal to the Tax Court. Therefore, I respectfully disagree with Dow that [a]n application for judicial review to the Federal Court cannot achieve a reassessment (A.F., at para. 70). Of course, because the decision is discretionary, it is possible that the Minister arrives at the same opinion following the quashing of her previous decision, in which case the tax liability would not change and no reassessment would issue.\nIn sum, I agree that reconsideration and reassessment is not an appropriate remedy. Since the Tax Court cannot avail itself of administrative law remedies, and since the Federal Court does not have jurisdiction to hear appeals of the correctness of assessments, Webb J.A. was right to conclude that the remedies available to both courts may be required if Dow is to succeed (para. 91). \nThe Tax Court Is Not an Exclusive Forum for Tax Litigation \nDow argues that the Tax Court should have jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions of the Minister because the Tax Court is meant to provide an accessible and credible forum for taxpayers to resolve disputes with the government over their tax liabilities and provide[s] a convenient method for taxpayers to obtain judicial decisions in disputed income tax matters (A.F., at paras. 33 and 75). According to Dow, arbitrary fetters [have been] placed on the Tax Court over the years by judicial decisions relating to assessments that are based on the exercise of Ministerial discretion [that] have prevented the Tax Court from fulfilling its mission (para. 79).\nI agree that Parliament created the Tax Court to provide an accessible forum for taxpayers to challenge the correctness of assessments. But Parliament intentionally divided jurisdiction over tax matters between the Federal Court and the Tax Court. The Tax Court has never been a single forum for all tax litigation (see Sifto, at para. 26). Indeed, several provisions of the ITA expressly provide jurisdiction to the Federal Court or the Federal Court of Appeal over tax matters (see ss. 172(3), 204.81(9), 222 to 223 and 231), including provisions that provide jurisdiction to the Minister to make discretionary decisions (see ss. 220(3.1), 220(3.2) and 152(4.2)).\nThe parties agree that s. 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act provides jurisdiction to the Federal Court to conduct judicial review of decisions made by federal administrative actors, including the Minister of National Revenue (Addison SCC, at para. 8). Judicial review of federal administrative action sits at the core of the mandate of the Federal Court. According to Prof. Craig Forcese, judicial supervision of administrative action is anchored in the Federal Court (The Trials and Tribulations of the Federal Courts Jurisdiction, in Valois et al., eds., 73, at p. 79). As the administrative apparatus of government had grown enormously, Parliament granted exclusive original jurisdiction in administrative law proceedings against federal [administrative actors] to the Federal Court in 1970 (ibid.). Parliament has provided [translation] a single court with the power to review the legality of acts of the federal public administration to ensure that there is a consistent and uniform body of case law across the country that provides a framework for federal government action (B. Letarte et al., Recours et procedure devant les Cours federales (2013), at pp. 43-44). \nSpecifically, the Federal Court retains exclusive jurisdiction over the Ministers decisions that are not subject to an appeal to the Tax Court. As Professor Provencher observed, [a] Canada Revenue Agency assessment is a decision of a federal board and could be subject to judicial review under [section 18.1] if not for section 18.5 (pp. 548-49). Stratas J.A. explained helpfully that [t]here are areas, well recognized in the case law, where judicial review may potentially be had in tax matters. Examples include discretionary decisions under the fairness provisions [and] assessments that are purely discretionary (JP Morgan, at para. 96). \nSome have suggested that the shared jurisdiction over tax matters between the Tax Court and the Federal Court raises a significant policy issue because there seems little justification for bifurcating the tax jurisdiction and that Parliament should therefore expand the jurisdiction of the Tax Court by statutory grant (Campbell, at p. 618). In fact, some have argued that s. 247(11) of the ITA should be amended in order to ensure that the Tax Court will have jurisdiction over decisions made under s. 247(10) (see Sandler and Watzinger, at p. 307). It has also been suggested that Parliaments grant of jurisdiction to the Tax Court in s. 166.2 of the ITA may be a model for further amendments that would expand the Tax Courts jurisdiction to include the jurisdiction to conduct judicial review in taxation matters. In doing so, Parliament would provide the Tax Court with statutory guidelines for decision making or a broader, equitable jurisdiction that would be appropriate if it were to have jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions (Lubetsky (2022), at p. 66). Indeed, if todays jurisdictional difficulties are primarily the result of ad hoc, unplanned, organic evolution over the last 75 years and the appropriate solution is a comprehensive review and overhaul of jurisdiction among the Tax Court, the Federal Court, and the superior courts with respect to income tax matters, it falls to Parliament to conduct such a review (pp. 65 and 115). As this Court has recognized, Parliament has set up a complex structure to deal with a multitude of tax-related claims (Addison SCC, at para. 11). Making a change to that complex structure  which divides jurisdiction over taxation matters between three different federal courts  without a thoughtful, comprehensive reform that can only be achieved by Parliament would be imprudent, particularly if doing so would directly contradict the wording of the applicable statutes and Parliaments intent. A patchwork judicial solution to this complex matter could increase uncertainty, cause further litigation over jurisdictional issues, and ultimately undermine access to justice. \nParliament has turned its mind to the difficulties that arise from the fractured jurisdiction of the Tax Court and the Federal Court over tax matters. After doing so, it did not act to expand the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. For example, in 1997, the Auditor General recommended that the Federal Court and the Tax Court be merged. The Auditor General observed that members of the tax bar and several Tax Court judges noted that certain current procedural difficulties would be eliminated by having taxation issues dealt with by judges of a superior court (Report on the Federal Court of Canada and the Tax Court of Canada, at para. 209). Nevertheless, the Auditor General reported that [t]he majority of judges of the Tax Court are strongly opposed to a merger of the courts (para. 205). In the end, as Lubetsky notes, Parliament elected not to merge the Tax Court and Federal Court but, rather, to merge their registry services and to make no changes to the actual jurisdiction of the Tax Court (Lubetsky (2022), at pp. 107-8). In 2011, when presented with a proposal to expand the jurisdiction of the Tax Court to include all tax matters, the Minister of Justice declined to propose amendments to the relevant legislation (see p. 110). \nIn my view, it falls to Parliament to respond, if appropriate, to the concerns of those who suggest that the jurisdiction of the Tax Court should be rethought to include the jurisdiction to conduct judicial review in taxation matters. \nDows Approach Will Not Enhance Access to Justice \nDow encourages this Court to consider the jurisdiction of the Tax Court from an access to justice perspective, noting that small taxpayers or self-represented litigants are disadvantaged when forced to commence an application for judicial review in the Federal Court with respect to a discretionary decision (A.F., at para. 80). Dow points to procedural rules that are currently in place in the Tax Court that make the Tax Court more accessible to disadvantaged taxpayers, such as the informal procedure, that are not currently available in the Federal Court (paras. 75-80). Moreover, Dow argues that if the FCA Decision is correct, taxpayers may be required to commence parallel proceedings in the Tax Court and the Federal Court in order to obtain certain types of relief (para. 59).\nI disagree that access to justice will be enhanced for millions of taxpayers (transcript, at p. 2) by this Court deciding that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions of the Minister under s. 247(10). This provision is relevant mainly to multinational corporate taxpayers carrying out non-arms length transactions with related entities. \nNor would access to justice be enhanced for large multinational corporate taxpayers such as Dow. If the Tax Court were to have jurisdiction to review the Ministers exercise of discretion pursuant to s. 247(10), the Federal Courts ability to conduct judicial review of those decisions would be ousted under s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act. When the s. 247(10) decision is followed by an assessment, the Tax Court would have exclusive jurisdiction to review the Ministers exercise of discretion, but no ability to provide recourse if the Minister conducted herself unreasonably in coming to her decision. This is because the Tax Court does not have remedial power to quash the Ministers decision. If the quantum is correct, the Tax Court must confirm the Ministers assessment regardless of whether her decision under s. 247(10) is reasonable; so long as assessments are correct, they must stand even if the objection process was flawed (Webster, at para. 21; Ereiser, at para. 31; Main Rehabilitation, at para. 8; see also Chad, at para. 28).\nDows plea to expand the jurisdiction of the Tax Court beyond what is provided for in legislation for the purpose of enhancing access to justice is ultimately unconvincing. Not only will Dows proposed approach not enhance access to justice, but it is likely to have broad unintended consequences that reach far beyond the taxation context. Dow ostensibly asks the Court to adopt a wholly novel interpretation of an assessment under the ITA in order to provide the Tax Court with implicit jurisdiction that would oust judicial review before the Federal Court. As explained above, this could have far-reaching implications in respect of the jurisdiction of the Federal Court to conduct judicial review of ministerial decisions in other settings, pursuant to ss. 18, 18.1, and 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act. \nDow has pleaded this as a tax case without due regard to the broader implications in administrative law and without proper consideration for judicial review of ministerial discretion by the Federal Court in other areas. This Court should not undermine important aspects of tax and administrative law in Canada in order to pursue access to justice benefits that have not been made out. \nConclusion\nIn answer to the question posed under s. 58, I conclude that when the Minister has exercised her discretion under s. 247(10) of the ITA to deny a taxpayers request for a downward pricing adjustment, that decision falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in respect of an appeal, under statute, of the taxpayers assessment. As there is no express right of appeal from this decision to the Tax Court, the proper forum to challenge the Ministers decision is the Federal Court, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review under its home statute. The Federal Court of Appeal was therefore right to allow the appeal from the Tax Court, to set aside the order granted by that court and, in granting the order the Tax Court should have issued, to answer the question in the affirmative.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\tThe reasons of Karakatsanis, Cote and Rowe JJ. were delivered by\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nAt the heart of this appeal lies a question of jurisdiction over tax matters. The core issue is whether it is the Tax Court of Canada or the Federal Court of Canada that has jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision of the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) to deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment under s. 247(10) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (ITA).\nThe confusion concerning the jurisdictional boundaries between the Tax Court and the Federal Court in respect of tax matters has resulted in a lack of predictability, certainty and fairness in an area of the law where these principles are most important. Indeed, the shortcomings of the Tax Courts jurisdiction and the need for reform to reduce the number of jurisdictional disputes in tax matters are well recognized (see D. Jacyk, The Dividing Line Between the Jurisdictions of the Tax Court of Canada and Other Superior Courts (2008), 56 Can. Tax J. 661; D. Jacyk, The Jurisdiction of the Tax Court: A Tax Practitioners Guide to the Jurisdictional Galaxy of Constitutional Challenges (2012), 60 Can. Tax J. 55; G. Du Pont and M. H. Lubetsky, The Power To Audit Is the Power To Destroy: Judicial Supervision of the Exercise of Audit Powers (2013), 61 (Supp.) Can. Tax J. 103; M. H. Lubetsky, The Fractured Jurisdiction of the Courts in Income Tax Disputes, in P. Mihailovich and J. Sorensen, eds., Tax Disputes in Canada: The Path Forward (2022), 63).\nAlthough the scope of the appellants submissions in the present case is broad enough to allow our Court to resolve some of the jurisdictional issues plaguing good tax administration, the present appeal is limited to the context of s. 247(10) of the ITA. Indeed, the appellant invites us to determine whether all exercises of ministerial discretion affecting tax liability, interest or penalties fall within the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction over an assessment made against a taxpayer, to the exclusion of the Federal Courts supervisory jurisdiction. In this case, neither the Tax Court nor the Federal Court ruled on the matter.\nIn my view, there is no need to rule on all exercises of ministerial discretion to dispose of the present appeal. The issue here is whether a decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA, which the Minister must make in certain circumstances in order for the amount of tax owing to be determined, is within the scope of an appeal from an assessment. Unlike other discretionary powers that the Minister has under the ITA, the power that the Minister has under s. 247(10) is not permissive. As I explain in these reasons, the Minister is obliged to exercise this power in order to determine a taxpayers liability.\nTherefore, the scope of the present appeal is quite narrow. Our Court must determine whether Parliament intended the review of the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) to fall within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court or of the Federal Court, in particular when a downward adjustment is sought and/or established. This question must be resolved first and foremost through an examination of each courts enabling statute, having regard to the particular circumstances of this appeal.\nIn circumstances such as those of the present case, the exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) involves two elements that are relevant to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and of the Tax Court, respectively: the exercise of ministerial discretion to deny a taxpayers request for a downward transfer pricing adjustment and an assessment. While the provisions of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, give the Federal Court exclusive supervisory jurisdiction over decisions of federal boards, commissions or other tribunals, Parliament has ensured that the correctness or validity of a taxpayers assessment is a matter that falls squarely within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court pursuant to s. 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-2 (TCCA), and s. 169 of the ITA.\nImportantly, the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction over an assessment has been granted by Parliament to the exclusion of the Federal Courts supervisory jurisdiction (Federal Courts Act, s. 18.5). In Canada v. Addison & Leyen Ltd., 2007 SCC 33, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 793, at para. 11, our Court cautioned against judicial review being used to develop a new form of incidental litigation designed to circumvent the system of tax assessments and appeals established by Parliament:\nThe integrity and efficacy of the system of tax assessments and appeals should be preserved. Parliament has set up a complex structure to deal with a multitude of tax-related claims and this structure relies on an independent and specialized court, the Tax Court of Canada. Judicial review should not be used to develop a new form of incidental litigation designed to circumvent the system of tax appeals established by Parliament and the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. Judicial review should remain a remedy of last resort in this context. [Emphasis added.]\nThe issue is therefore whether a decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA, which the Minister must make to determine the amount of tax owing when a downward adjustment is sought and/or established, is within the scope of an appeal from an assessment. Although our Court has said that the Minister generally has no discretion in fulfilling her statutory duty to make an assessment, it has never had to decide whether a discretionary power that the Minister must exercise for the amount of tax owing to be determined is subject to the right of appeal provided for in s. 169 of the ITA (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Collins Family Trust, 2022 SCC 26, at paras. 25-26).\nFor the reasons that follow, I am of the view that since it goes directly to the correctness of a taxpayers assessment, a decision by the Minister to deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment under s. 247(10) is within the scope of the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction over an assessment under s. 169 of the ITA. With all due respect for the opposite view, the Ministers opinion under s. 247(10) cannot be seen as separate from the assessment. While the Minister generally has no discretion in determining a taxpayers liability, s. 247(10) of the ITA creates an exception. Unlike other discretionary powers that the Minister has under the ITA, the exercise of the power the Minister has under s. 247(10) is not permissive when a downward adjustment is sought and/or established. This power must be exercised in order to determine the amount of tax liability. Since a decision under s. 247(10) directly impacts the amount of income and taxable income and precedes the determination of the ultimate amount of tax owing, such a decision is inextricably linked to the assessment. Therefore, in its essential nature, a taxpayers objection to the Ministers decision to deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment pertains to the amount of tax owing.\nThe remedies available in the Federal Court and the Tax Court further support the conclusion that a taxpayers objection regarding the denial of a downward transfer pricing adjustment is concerned with the correctness of an assessment, i.e., the amount of tax owing, the determination of which involves the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10). Only the Tax Court has the appropriate remedial powers to deal with such decisions. In allowing an appeal from an assessment, the Tax Court may, under s. 171(1)(b) of the ITA, (i) vacate the assessment, (ii) vary the assessment or (iii) refer the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment. Under s. 171(1)(b)(iii), the Tax Court can order the Minister to reconsider the decision to deny the downward adjustment under s. 247(10) as reflected in the assessment under appeal, and to reassess. The Federal Court does not have the same remedial powers to vacate or vary an assessment.\nThis conclusion is consistent with the comprehensive legislative schemes establishing the respective jurisdiction of each court and with the important objectives of avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings and of promoting efficiency and access to justice. While it is true, as my colleague Kasirer J. says, that in this case this question of statutory interpretation arises as part of a claim brought forward by a multinational corporation, this should have no bearing on, and is irrelevant to, the interpretive exercise. That Dow Chemicals argument serves only to benefit a small number of corporate taxpayers is not at all determinative of the issue before the Court.\nBackground\nThe appellant, Dow Chemical Canada ULC (Dow Chemical), a Canadian resident corporation, entered into, as borrower, a non-arms length revolving loan agreement dated February 17, 2009, effective January 1, 2004, with Dow Europe GmbH (DowEur), a Swiss company, as lender. As a result of this loan agreement, Dow Chemical incurred interest expenses in the amounts of $15,279,034 and $6,694,341 for the 2006 and 2007 taxation years, respectively. Incidentally, for the 2006 taxation year, Dow Chemical also reported $5,930,155 in income in respect of toll manufacturing services provided to DowEur.\nFollowing a review of the transactions between Dow Chemical and DowEur, the Minister reassessed Dow Chemical for its 2006 taxation year and issued a notice to that effect on December 14, 2011.\nThe reassessment was made pursuant to the transfer pricing rules set out in s. 247 of the ITA. This provision appears in Part XVI.1 of the ITA, directly after Part XVI, which establishes anti-avoidance rules. Similarly, the purpose of s. 247 is to prevent the avoidance of tax resulting from price distortions which can arise in the context of non-arms length relationships by reason of the community of interest shared by related parties (Minister of National Revenue v. General Electric Capital Canada Inc., 2010 FCA 344, 414 N.R. 304, at para. 55). By enacting the transfer pricing rules in s. 247, Parliament has chosen to indirectly address the issue of a Canadian taxpayer shifting profits to a non-arms length person located in another jurisdiction (Canada v. Cameco Corporation, 2020 FCA 112, [2020] 4 F.C.R. 104, at para. 81).\nAccordingly, under s. 247(2) of the ITA, the income of a taxpayer resulting from transactions between the taxpayer and a non-arms length non-resident must be adjusted by the Minister where the terms and conditions of those transactions differ from those that would have been agreed to by parties dealing at arms length (see, e.g., Canada v. GlaxoSmithKline Inc., 2012 SCC 52, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 2). The adjustment to the taxpayers income may be upward (where the taxpayer benefited from the transaction) or downward (to reduce the taxpayers income or increase the taxpayers loss or expenditures), resulting in a corresponding increase or decrease in tax liability.\nIt is not disputed that in this case the Minister determined that the transactions between Dow Chemical and DowEur were non-arms length transactions. As directed by s. 247(2) of the ITA, the Minister made an upward adjustment in respect of Dow Chemicals manufacturing services by increasing its 2006 income, adding $307,234,104 to its total.\nThe Ministers reassessment did not include a downward adjustment relating to the interest expenses Dow Chemical would have incurred had the parties been dealing at arms length. Although s. 247(2) contemplates downward adjustments pertaining to non-arms length transactions, s. 247(10) expressly precludes any downward adjustment unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made. As I explain below, these two provisions interact with one another where a downward adjustment is sought and/or established.\nFollowing two objections to the reassessments and extensive correspondence over the course of several years, Dow Chemical was reassessed for its 2006 taxation year on December 14, 2015, and again on April 13, 2017. Although Dow Chemicals grievances regarding the upward adjustment were resolved, neither of the reassessments included the downward adjustment requested by Dow Chemical, which remains in dispute.\nDow Chemical appealed the reassessment dated April 13, 2017, to the Tax Court, challenging the Ministers decision to deny the downward adjustment under s. 247(10). However, given that the proper forum for the review of that decision  the Tax Court or the Federal Court  was unclear, the parties submitted a question of law to the Tax Court to have the jurisdictional issue determined before the hearing of the appeal.\nJudicial History\nAt first instance, the Tax Court judge determined that the Tax Court has jurisdiction over a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) since such a decision goes directly to the correctness of a taxpayers assessment (2020 TCC 139, [2021] 2 C.T.C. 2063). At its core, a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) determines a taxpayers income for a given year and serves as an essential component of the assessment (para. 29). While no standalone right of appeal to the Tax Court exists for a decision made under s. 247(10), a reading of s. 247(2) and (10) of the ITA together with s. 12(1) of the TCCA and s. 169(1) of the ITA leads to the conclusion that such a decision is subject to an express statutory right of appeal. By virtue of s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act, it is the Tax Court and not the Federal Court that has jurisdiction.\nThroughout her reasons, the Tax Court judge emphasized the fact that s. 247(10) imposes an obligation on the Minister to determine whether a downward transfer pricing adjustment, once established, is appropriate in the circumstances. The Tax Court judge accepted the view that such a discretionary power, in circumstances such as those in the present case, must be exercised before income and resulting tax liability can be assessed and that an assessment can be issued only after the Ministers opinion is formed. Where the Minister did not exercise the discretionary power at all, or exercised it on incorrect principles, the assessment cannot be said to be correct.\nDespite this reasoning, the Tax Court judge cautioned that her reasons should not be interpreted as granting taxpayers a right of appeal to challenge other types of discretionary decisions the Minister may make. In other words, the power conferred by s. 247(10) is unlike other discretionary powers granted to the Minister under the ITA in that it is not permissive and is directly related to the computation of income or taxable income.\nThe Tax Court judge also did not opine as to whether the Tax Court is permitted to substitute its own decision for that of the Minister when reviewing a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10). Rather, she emphasized that this determination must be made in light of our Courts ruling in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653.\nThe Tax Court judges opinion on the question of law was appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal, which rejected the Tax Court judges approach regarding whether a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) of the ITA falls within the scope of an appeal under s. 12 of the TCCA (2022 FCA 70, [2022] 5 C.T.C. 1). The Court of Appeal reasoned that, given that the ITA does not expressly exclude the Federal Courts jurisdiction by providing for a right of appeal, as specified in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act, the Federal Court has jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions made under s. 247(10) of the ITA.\nIn the Court of Appeals view, the resolution of the issue turned on the remedies available to the Tax Court and the Federal Court. Writing for the court, Webb J.A. noted that varying an assessment following a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) necessarily varies the decision itself, which is part of the process of determining a taxpayers liability. A decision by the Tax Court to vary the assessment would therefore require it to quash the Ministers decision or make an order in the nature of mandamus  powers that are granted only to the Federal Court under ss. 18.1(3) and 18(1)(a), respectively, of the Federal Courts Act.\nPursuant to ss. 169 and 171 of the ITA, the Tax Courts statutory powers on appeal relate to the assessment, which is a product of the process; that product is separate from the process leading to the assessment. The process of issuing the assessment is not part of the assessment. Thus, the remedial measures available to the Tax Court under the ITA do not include an ability to vary or quash the Ministers decision. Again, such powers belong solely to the Federal Court. The Ministers decision is reviewable by the Federal Court only.\nIssue\nUnder s. 58 of the Tax Court of Canada Rules (General Procedure), SOR/90-688a, the parties sought an order for the determination of the following question of law:\nWhere the Minister of National Revenue has exercised her discretion pursuant to subsection 247(10) of the Income Tax Act (ITA) to deny a taxpayers request for a downward transfer pricing adjustment, is that a decision falling outside the exclusive original jurisdiction granted to the Tax Court of Canada under section 12 of the Tax Court of Canada Act and section 171 of the ITA?\n\n(T.C.C. reasons, at para. 21)\nAnalysis\nIn my view, on a proper interpretation of the comprehensive legislative scheme established by Parliament for determining whether the Federal Court or the Tax Court has jurisdiction over a given tax dispute, and on a review of the factual circumstances of this case, Dow Chemicals challenge to the Ministers exercise of discretion should proceed before the Tax Court as part of the appeal from the assessment. Indeed, on appeal from an assessment, the Tax Court has the jurisdiction to review the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) when it results in an assessment (as in the present case). This exercise of discretion is inextricably linked to a taxpayers assessment, and the taxpayers challenge is directed at the assessment itself, not merely at the manner in which the Minister exercised her discretion. An assessment is correct where the amount of tax assessed is properly based on the applicable provisions of the ITA (Ereiser v. Minister of National Revenue, 2013 FCA 20, 444 N.R. 64, at para. 21).\nThe Respective Jurisdictions of the Federal Court and The Tax Court\nTo answer the question at the heart of this appeal, our Court must pay close attention to the contours of each courts jurisdiction as outlined in its enabling statute. It is thus necessary to briefly describe the jurisdiction of both the Federal Court and the Tax Court.\nUnder s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867, Parliament has the authority to provide for the constitution of statutory courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada. Unlike courts with inherent jurisdiction, such as the provincial superior courts (see Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 17-18), statutory courts derive their existence, jurisdiction and powers solely from their enabling statute.\nIn Windsor (City) v. Canadian Transit Co., 2016 SCC 54, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 617, at para. 33, our Court held that the Federal Court has only the jurisdiction conferred upon it by statute; it is without any inherent jurisdiction, unlike the provincial superior courts. The Federal Court can act only within the confines of its statutory powers. The language found in the Federal Courts Act is completely determinative of the scope of the Federal Courts jurisdiction (see Roberts v. Canada, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 322, at p. 331). The same is true of the Tax Court, which has, under s. 12 of the TCCA, exclusive jurisdiction over matters in respect of which a reference or appeal to it is provided for. Any issue regarding the jurisdictional boundaries of the Federal Court and the Tax Court in respect of tax matters must therefore be resolved in accordance with each courts enabling statute. In this respect, the words of each statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26).\nThe Federal Courts Act establishes a comprehensive statutory scheme for determining whether the Federal Court has jurisdiction over a given matter. The analysis begins with s. 18(1) of the Federal Courts Act, which grants the Federal Court supervisory jurisdiction over decisions of a federal board, commission or other tribunal. For the purposes of this provision, it is well established that the Minister is considered a federal board (see Addison & Leyen, at para. 8; Canada (Attorney General) v. TeleZone Inc., 2010 SCC 62, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 585, at paras. 3 and 50). Under the Federal Courts Act, the Federal Court has exclusive original jurisdiction to grant certain remedies on an application for judicial review of a federal administrative decision (ss. 18(1), 18(3) and 18.1). The following remedies are within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Federal Court:\n18 (1) Subject to section 28, the Federal Court has exclusive original jurisdiction\n\n(a) to issue an injunction, writ of certiorari, writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo warranto, or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board, commission or other tribunal; and\n\n(b) to hear and determine any application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney General of Canada, to obtain relief against a federal board, commission or other tribunal.\nHowever, s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act limits and ousts the Federal Courts exclusive original jurisdiction to grant such remedies where a federal statute expressly provides for a right of appeal to the Tax Court:\n18.5 Despite sections 18 and 18.1, if an Act of Parliament expressly provides for an appeal to the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court Martial Appeal Court, the Tax Court of Canada, the Governor in Council or the Treasury Board from a decision or an order of a federal board, commission or other tribunal made by or in the course of proceedings before that board, commission or tribunal, that decision or order is not, to the extent that it may be so appealed, subject to review or to be restrained, prohibited, removed, set aside or otherwise dealt with, except in accordance with that Act.\nThe purpose of the limitation set out in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act has been interpreted as being to prevent parallel proceedings in the Federal Court and the Tax Court in respect of tax matters. In Walker v. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, 2005 FCA 393, 344 N.R. 169, at para. 13, the Federal Court of Appeal made this clear when it found that s. 18.5 should be interpreted as far as possible, to preclude parallel proceedings in the Federal Court and the Tax Court of Canada in respect of substantially the same underlying issue. Likewise, in Addison & Leyen, our Court emphasized that judicial review should not be used to circumvent the system of tax assessments and appeals established by Parliament.\nConcerns for good tax administration, access to justice and efficiency underlie Parliaments choice to prioritize the Tax Courts jurisdiction over the Federal Courts supervisory jurisdiction where a right of appeal is expressly provided for. Indeed, Parliament established the Tax Court and its predecessors to deal specifically with taxation matters, providing an accessible and credible forum for taxpayers to resolve disputes with the government (see G. Bourgard and R. McMechan, Tax Court Practice (loose-leaf), at pp. 22-7 and 22-8). In the same spirit, Parliament established simplified procedures for taxpayer appeals in which the amount of tax in dispute falls under an enumerated threshold (Tax Court of Canada Rules (Informal Procedure), SOR/90-688b). Courts must be careful not to frustrate Parliaments intention to have the Tax Court deal with tax matters that fall within its exclusive jurisdiction.\nGiven this clear limitation on the Federal Courts jurisdiction, the relevant question for the purposes of this appeal becomes whether an express right of appeal provided for by Parliament precludes the Federal Court from having jurisdiction over a discretionary decision by the Minister under s. 247(10). In answering this question, it is important to bear in mind, as the Tax Court judge did at first instance, the historical evolution of the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction, which is a direct continuation of the appellate jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court, the Income Tax Appeal Board and the Tax Appeal Board.\nSections 165 and 169, found in Divisions I and J, respectively, of Part I of the ITA, provide for appeals to the Tax Court. In JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc. v. Canada (National Revenue), 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557, the Federal Court of Appeal wrote that, under ss. 165 and 169 of the ITA, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction to review the validity and correctness of assessments. Writing for a unanimous court, Stratas J.A. held that these provisions constitute a complete appeal procedure that allows taxpayers to raise in the Tax Court all issues relating to the correctness of the assessments, i.e. whether the assessment is supported by the facts of the case and the applicable law (para. 82).\nSection 169(1) of the ITA provides taxpayers with a right of appeal to have an assessment vacated or varied:\n169 (1) Where a taxpayer has served notice of objection to an assessment under section 165, the taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court of Canada to have the assessment vacated or varied after either\n\n(a) the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed, or\n\n(b) 90 days have elapsed after service of the notice of objection and the Minister has not notified the taxpayer that the Minister has vacated or confirmed the assessment or reassessed,\n\nbut no appeal under this section may be instituted after the expiration of 90 days from the day notice has been sent to the taxpayer under section 165 that the Minister has confirmed the assessment or reassessed.\nOnce an objection to an assessment has been raised in the manner and within the timeframe specified in s. 165(1) of the ITA and the conditions in s. 169 have been met, an appeal is instituted. Proceedings before the Tax Court differ from ordinary appeals in that the hearings are in the nature of a trial in which both parties are entitled to call evidence (Campbell v. Minister of National Revenue, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 4). Under s. 169 of the ITA, the Tax Court is tasked with determining the taxpayers tax liability de novo, regardless of whether the evidence adduced before the court was properly before the Minister at the time of the assessment. The scope of the appeal with respect to factual matters is determined by the pleadings, and especially by the assumptions of fact relied on by the Minister in making the assessment. Under both the informal procedure and the general procedure, the parties can lead evidence to support findings of fact different than those on which the assessment was based, and the burden of proof is on the party alleging different or new facts, on a balance of probabilities (Johnston v. Minister of National Revenue, [1948] S.C.R. 486; see also Jacyk (2008), at p. 667).\nGiven the Tax Courts exclusive jurisdiction over the validity and correctness of an assessment under s. 169 of the ITA, the question at the heart of this appeal is whether the scope of the express right of appeal provided for by Parliament extends to the review of the Ministers decision under s. 247(10), thereby precluding the Federal Court from having jurisdiction under s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act.\nThe Scope of the Right of Appeal Under Section 169 Extends to Decisions Under Section 247(10) Resulting in an Assessment\nIn oral argument before our Court, counsel for Dow Chemical contended that the Tax Court should be recognized as having jurisdiction over any exercise of ministerial discretion that relates to an assessment. In this respect, he likened s. 247(10) to other provisions of the ITA under which the Minister has discretion to waive the tax, interest or penalties assessed. However, in its written submissions, Dow Chemical conceded that neither the Tax Court nor the Federal Court of Appeal below ruled on such other discretionary provisions (A.F., at para. 105). While doing so might be salutary from the perspective of access to justice, it is not for the courts to remedy the shortcomings that exist in the Tax Courts jurisdiction. Parliament is free to amend the relevant statutes as it deems necessary.\nIn my view, and to reiterate, the question is whether the scope of the express right of appeal from an assessment provided for in s. 169 of the ITA extends to the review of a discretionary decision by the Minister to deny a taxpayers request for a downward transfer pricing adjustment. To answer this question, it is necessary to determine the nature of the objections Parliament intended to place within the Tax Courts jurisdiction on appeal from an assessment under s. 169 of the ITA.\nTherefore, it is essential that the circumstances in which the appeal arises first be clearly defined. The decision we are concerned with is the Ministers decision to either allow or deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment under s. 247(10) based on whether, in her opinion, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made. Section 247(10) does not define those circumstances or provide any guidance as to what they may be. The Minister is given wide discretion to make her decision based on her own assessment of the circumstances, policy considerations (as discussed later in these reasons) and the applicable legislation. The Ministers decision to allow or deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment will usually be reflected in the taxpayers assessment, as it affects the amount of income or taxable income and, consequently, the amount of tax owing.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency has indicated that a downward transfer pricing adjustment involving either a treaty or non-treaty country can be the result of:\nA. A taxpayer request independent of a transfer pricing audit;\n\nB. A taxpayer request as a result of an upward adjustment initiated by a foreign tax authority;\n\nC. A taxpayer request during the course of a transfer pricing audit; or\n\nD. An adjustment initiated by a CRA auditor during the course of a transfer pricing audit.\n\n(TPM-03R: Downward Transfer Pricing Adjustments, June 21, 2022 (online), at para. 9; see also D. Sandler and L. Watzinger, Disputing Denied Downward Transfer-Pricing Adjustments (2019), 67 Can. Tax J. 281, at pp. 284-86.)\nContrary to other provisions that give the Minister a discretion that affects the amount of a taxpayers income or taxable income, like ss. 91(2), 111(1.1)(c) and 125(7) of the ITA, s. 247(10) is not permissive.\nIt is not disputed that s. 247(10) is an exception to the general rule in s. 247(2), which mandates upward and downward adjustments where necessary to reflect the amounts that would have been agreed to had the parties been dealing with each other at arms length (F. Vincent and M. Ranger, Transfer Pricing in Canada (2018), at p. 320; TPM-03R, at paras. 5-6). However, s. 247(10) places a limitation on any downward transfer pricing adjustment by subjecting such an adjustment to the Ministers discretion (TPM-03R, at para. 7).\nAlthough, because of s. 247(10), a taxpayer is not entitled to a downward adjustment in all circumstances, I am of the view that a taxpayer is entitled to the Ministers opinion as to whether a downward adjustment is appropriate in the circumstances. This is because, as noted by both the Tax Court judge and the Federal Court of Appeal, s. 247(2) does not differentiate between upward and downward adjustments (T.C.C. reasons, at paras. 7-10; C.A. reasons, at paras. 23-24). Parliaments drafting choice here is important. Section 247(2) provides that upward and downward adjustments shall be made when the conditions prescribed in that provision are met. The expression shall not be made . . . unless, found in s. 247(10), creates a narrow exception that must be read together with s. 247(2). Read together, ss. 247(2) and 247(10) require the Minister to form an opinion as to whether a downward adjustment is appropriate when one is sought and/or established. Either the Minister will be of the opinion that the downward adjustment is appropriate under the circumstances and will allow it, or she will be of the opinion that it is not appropriate and will deny it. The Tax Court judge was correct to determine that these provisions establish a rule that must be applied to compute income or taxable income and thus tax under Part I of the ITA (para. 10).\nAdopting the view that s. 247(10) can be ignored even when a downward adjustment is sought and/or established, as the Crown invites us to do, would insulate the Minister from any oversight (R.F., at para. 112). This interpretation would, for example, allow the Minister to never exercise her discretion as an indirect way of denying a downward adjustment, instead of actually denying it. It would lead to the conclusion that Parliament intended taxpayers to seek a writ of mandamus before the Federal Court every time a downward adjustment is sought and/or established in order to ensure that the Minister exercises her discretion under s. 247(10). As Vincent and Ranger point out, this is surely not what Parliament intended (see p. 324). And I add that it is doubtful, on the basis of such an interpretation, that a writ of mandamus could be granted, leaving the taxpayer without any recourse.\nThis is not to say that the Minister has a general duty to consider the appropriateness of downward adjustments before making an assessment. However, when s. 247(2) is engaged, the Minister is obliged to form an opinion as to a downward adjustment. Such a duty may arise in the circumstances described in para. 164 of these reasons (although I would be careful not to limit this duty to these circumstances). In the present case, the Minister acknowledged that s. 247(2) was engaged and that it would be natural, given her audit position, to allow a downward adjustment; but the Minister nonetheless declined to do so, which resulted in the reassessment under appeal. The Tax Court judges conclusion that s. 247(10) is not permissive must be understood in light of these circumstances (paras. 182, 191, 196 and 199).\nMy colleague states that the right of appeal provided for in s. 169 of the ITA cannot extend to discretionary decisions under s. 247(10) resulting in an assessment because such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the settled meaning of assessment for the purposes of s. 169 of the ITA. He relies primarily on this Courts decision in Okalta Oils Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1955] S.C.R. 824.\nNo one disputes that Okalta Oils remains a binding precedent of our Court as to the meaning of assessment. In that case, a corporation had originally received an assessment in the amount of $1,000 for a given taxation year. The corporation served a notice of objection to the assessment, and the Minister, upon reconsideration, reassessed the corporation at nil dollars. On appeal from the reassessment, the corporation argued that it had the right to claim further deductions with respect to drilling and exploration costs. Fauteux J., as he then was, determined that, under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97 (IWTA), there was no assessment if no tax had been claimed: Any other objection but one ultimately related to an amount claimed was lacking the object giving rise to the right of appeal from the decision of the Minister to the Board (p. 826 (emphasis added)).\nIn Canada v. Consumers Gas Co., [1987] 2 F.C. 60, the Federal Court of Appeal adopted a similar interpretation of the word assessment in the context of the right of appeal provided for in the ITA, reaffirming the principle that a taxpayer cannot appeal from a nil assessment:\nWhat is put in issue on an appeal to the courts under the Income Tax Act is the Ministers assessment. While the word assessment can bear two constructions, as being either the process by which tax is assessed or the product of that assessment, it seems to me clear, from a reading of sections 152 to 177 of the Income Tax Act, that the word is there employed in the second sense only. This conclusion flows in particular from subsection 165(1) and from the well established principle that a taxpayer can neither object to nor appeal from a nil assessment. [Emphasis added; p. 67.]\nThis reasoning was relied upon in Main Rehabilitation Co. v. Canada, 2004 FCA 403, 247 D.L.R. (4th) 597, at para. 8, and Canada v. Anchor Pointe Energy Ltd., 2007 FCA 188, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 839, at paras. 32-33, for the proposition that an appeal under s. 169 pertains to an objection as to the amount of tax owing. It is worth noting that neither of these cases cited or placed any reliance on Okalta Oils. These decisions cannot and should not be read as departing from our Courts pronouncement in that case that the right of appeal under s. 169 of the ITA is ultimately related to an amount claimed. In fact, in Main Rehabilitation, the Federal Court of Appeal similarly held that the question on appeal from an assessment is whether the amounts assessed can be shown to be properly owing (para. 8). In my view, the distinction established in these decisions simply means that what is at issue on appeal from an assessment is the amount of tax owed by the taxpayer, and not merely the conduct of the Minister in making the assessment or the purpose for which she made it. This is consistent with the text of s. 169, which provides that a taxpayer may appeal to the Tax Court to have the assessment vacated or varied.\nIn the present case, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the right of appeal from an assessment provided for in s. 169 does not extend the Tax Courts jurisdiction to the Ministers discretionary decisions under s. 247(10) of the ITA. That conclusion was premised in great part on the limited remedial powers of the Tax Court. In the view of Webb J.A., decisions under s. 247(10) are part of the process of determining a taxpayers liability and, accordingly, do not fall within the scope of the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction over an assessment or within its remedial powers (paras. 62 and 72-77). My colleague is of the same view.\nWhile I recognize the jurisprudence upon which the Federal Court of Appeals reasoning is based, in the instant case this Court is concerned not with a nil assessment or with allegations pertaining to the underlying process, but rather with a quantum directly affected by a discretion the Minister is required to exercise. No one is disputing that the amount of tax liability arises from the application of the relevant statutory provisions to the facts, nor is anyone suggesting that the Minister generally has any discretion in fulfilling her statutory duty to assess. These reasons should not be read as stating that any discretionary decision that the Minister may make in tax matters  such as the ones contemplated by the fairness provisions  falls within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court. This notion was expressly rejected at first instance, since provisions that provide for a waiver or cancellation of tax otherwise payable only are activated once the tax liability is established (para. 190 (emphasis added), citing Hunt v. The Queen, 2018 TCC 193, 2018 DTC 1139, at para. 29).\nAt issue is whether a decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA, which the Minister must make before the amount of tax liability can be determined, is within the scope of an appeal from an assessment. This is not a permissive provision; rather, it mandates the Minister to form an opinion as to whether the taxpayer should be assessed with or without the benefit of that adjustment (T.C.C. reasons, at para. 210 (emphasis added)). The question is whether, as a result, challenges to the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) can properly be characterized as being ultimately related to an amount claimed as part of an assessment so as to fall within the right of appeal provided for in s. 169 of the ITA.\nIn the ITA, Parliament has expressly placed some limitations on a taxpayers right to object to and appeal from assessments resulting from certain discretionary decisions made by the Minister (see ss. 165(1.1) and 169(1)). It is noteworthy that no such provision precludes an appeal from an assessment resulting from a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) of the ITA. I would therefore be careful not to narrowly construe the scope of s. 169 of the ITA by reference to other provisions that Parliament has used to broaden the Tax Courts jurisdiction (see, e.g., ss. 152(1.2), 152(1.3), 166.2(2) and 169(1.1)).\nThe scope of s. 169 of the ITA must now be examined. I note at the outset that considerations regarding the applicable standard of review are irrelevant to the determination of which court has jurisdiction when the correctness of an assessment is in issue. These considerations are relevant only once jurisdiction has been established. In my view, the right of appeal provided for in s. 169 of the ITA extends to the Ministers decisions under s. 247(10) of the ITA. A taxpayers objection to a decision of the Minister under s. 247(10), which must be made before an assessment can be issued, is directed at the amount of tax owing. The Ministers exercise of discretion in this context is inextricably linked to the correctness of the assessment (T.C.C. reasons, at paras. 171-73). An objection to that decision is ultimately related to an amount claimed (Okalta Oils, at p. 826). Let me explain.\nThree steps must be taken for the purposes of issuing an assessment. First, in our self-reporting system of taxation, the Minister must make certain assumptions of fact. Second, the Minister has to interpret the provisions of the relevant legislation and apply them to the assumed facts. Third, under the transfer pricing provisions, the Minister has to determine whether or not a downward adjustment is appropriate in the circumstances, a determination that directly impacts the amount of income and taxable income. Each of these steps affects the amount of tax payable and is directly reflected in the amount of a taxpayers liability. They are inextricably linked to the correctness of the assessment.\nSince s. 169 of the ITA grants the Tax Court exclusive jurisdiction over the correctness of the assessment, the same court must also have jurisdiction to review each of these three steps, as part of a de novo review process. The outcome of the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) is a fact inextricably linked to the correctness of the resulting assessment. What places the matter before the Tax Court is the question of whether the Ministers exercise of discretion is an essential component of the assessment as a matter of fact and law. This is not an expansion of the Tax Courts jurisdiction by necessary implication, but merely an application of s. 169 of the ITA.\nIt is helpful to keep in mind that, as I explained above, s. 247(2) of the ITA requires the Minister to adjust transfer prices where necessary to ensure that they reflect the prices that would have been determined if the parties had been dealing at arms length. This particular provision concerns the correctness of transfer prices and, as a result, the correctness of the computation of a taxpayers income and taxable income. However, s. 247(10) requires that a downward adjustment be made only where, in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made. In this respect, I fully agree with the Tax Court judges finding that the Ministers discretion under s. 247(10), being one that must (not may) be exercised before income and resulting tax liability can be assessed in compliance with the transfer pricing provisions, is of a different character than a discretion that is entirely permissive and need not be exercised until after tax, interest and penalties have been assessed in accordance with the provisions of the ITA (para. 196 (first emphasis added; second and third emphases in original)).\nI also agree with the Tax Court judge that while the Minister generally has no discretion to exercise in assessing a taxpayers tax liability, the discretion granted under s. 247(10) is an exception. It is one that the Minister must exercise where s. 247(2) is engaged, i.e., when a downward adjustment is established in the course of a transfer pricing audit or when a taxpayer requests a downward adjustment (para. 199).\nThe Ministers decision to deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment that would otherwise be mandated by s. 247(2) is inextricably linked to the correctness of the resulting assessment. That decision relates to the computation of a taxpayers income or taxable income and directly affects the amount of tax payable for a taxation year. It is a fact on which the application of the relevant statutory provisions necessarily rests and which results in the assessment. In circumstances such as those in the instant appeal, it is clear that the amount of tax assessed as being payable can be determined only once the Minister has made her decision regarding the requested downward pricing adjustment.\nAs a result, if the discretion under s. 247(10) is not exercised or not properly exercised, the resulting assessment cannot be correct, because the decision necessarily has an impact on the computation of tax liability (T.C.C. reasons, at paras. 197 and 213). In such a situation, the Minister has not fulfilled her statutory responsibilities; the resulting assessment is incorrect because of an improper exercise of discretion. As Thorson P. wrote in Nicholson Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1945] Ex. C.R. 191, at p. 205, if the Minister has not acted properly in exercising her discretion, [s]he has not exercised the discretion required by the section at all, and if h[er] determination so made is included in an assessment[,] the assessment is, to such extent, incorrect. On appeal from an assessment that results from a decision made under s. 247(10), the interference by the Court is not really interference with the exercise of the discretion, but rather a finding that it has not been exercised (p. 208; see also Pure Spring Co. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1946] Ex. C.R. 471, at pp. 503-4).\nIn other words, the fact that the Minister initially exercised her discretion improperly, but later reached the same conclusion by exercising her discretion properly after having been ordered to reconsider and reassess, does not mean that the Tax Courts intervention was not justified in the first place. Instead, the initial assessment would be incorrect as matter of fact and law because of an improper exercise of discretion; the new assessment would be correct and no objection on this basis could be raised. An objection to the assessment resulting from such a decision gives rise to a right of appeal. Such an objection is ultimately related to an amount claimed as part of an assessment, which Parliament has placed within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tax Court under s. 169 of the ITA (Okalta Oils, at p. 826).\nThe foregoing is also consistent with the general principle that deciding whether a court has jurisdiction over a claim requires a determination of the essential nature or true character of the claim (Windsor (City), at para. 25; Canada (Attorney General) v. British Columbia Investment Management Corp., 2019 SCC 63, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 36-37; Domtar Inc. v. Canada, 2009 FCA 218, [2009] 6 C.T.C. 61, at para. 28; JP Morgan, at para. 50; Sifto Canada Corp. v. Minister of National Revenue, 2014 FCA 140, 461 N.R. 184, at para. 25; Wenham v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 199, 429 D.L.R. (4th) 166; International Air Transport Association v. Canadian Transportation Agency, 2022 FCA 211, at para. 26 (CanLII)). This is especially true in tax matters so as to not frustrate Parliaments intention that assessments be dealt with exclusively by the Tax Court, a specialized court (Addison & Leyen, at para. 11). In objecting to an assessment that results from the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10), a taxpayer is concerned with the amount of tax owing, not merely with the propriety of the Ministers exercise of discretion.\nThe right of appeal provided for in s. 169 of the ITA extends to the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA. Again, that right of appeal arises from the assessment, not from the exercise of discretion per se; the amount of tax assessed must be the direct result of the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) in order for a right of appeal to arise. There is no right of appeal to the Tax Court to challenge purely administrative decisions or other decisions that the Minister may make relating to an amount after tax liability has been established, as was determined by the Tax Court judge (paras. 168-91). Where the result was a nil assessment or where the exercise of discretion by the Minister under s. 247(10) had no impact on the amount of tax liability for the taxation year under appeal (requiring, for example, the taxpayer to wait until a taxation year in which the amount is relevant), such an exercise of discretion cannot be challenged before the Tax Court.\nI fully agree with the Tax Court judges finding that in the present case, the Ministers decision to deny the downward adjustment under s. 247(10) is an essential component of [an income tax] assessment, goes to the correctness of the assessment, and accordingly may be reviewed by the Tax Court under its exclusive appellate jurisdiction to determine the correctness of the assessment (para. 29). In my view, this finding does not create any legal uncertainty, nor does it expand the settled meaning of assessment or alter the nature of the right of appeal provided for in s. 169 of the ITA.\nIt is not disputed that when the application of s. 247(2) results in an upward adjustment to a taxpayers income and the Minister assesses the taxpayer accordingly, the taxpayer has a right to appeal that assessment to the Tax Court (see, e.g., Cameco). I agree with Dow Chemical that the same right of appeal to the Tax Court should exist where the application of s. 247(2) results in a downward adjustment to the taxpayers income, but the Minister makes a decision under s. 247(10) to deny the downward adjustment and assesses the tax payable accordingly (A.F., at para. 130). To conclude otherwise would lead to absurd results. For example, a taxpayer objecting to an assessment that reflects both upward and downward adjustments would have to go before the Federal Court to challenge the Ministers decision to deny the downward adjustment, all the while appealing to the Tax Court to challenge the upward adjustment.\nWith respect, I am of the view that the Federal Court of Appeal erred in holding that the Ministers decisions under s. 247(10) are not within the Tax Courts exclusive appellate jurisdiction over assessments. The scope of the right of appeal provided for in s. 169 extends to a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) since this decision goes to the correctness of an assessment. In this respect, I agree with the Tax Court judge that [b]ecause the exercise of ministerial discretion under [s.] 247(10) is subject to appeal to the Tax Court, it is not subject to judicial review by the Federal Court, although the Tax Courts decision on the appeal of the assessment may be appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal (para. 215).\nThe Tax Courts Remedial Powers Under Section 171 of the ITA Allow It to Deal With Discretionary Decisions Going to the Correctness of an Assessment\nThe core of the case that the Crown has made against the Tax Courts jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions by the Minister under s. 247(10) lies in the remedies that may be granted in disposing of an appeal from an assessment under s. 171 of the ITA. Given that it is a statutory court, the Tax Court may only grant remedies in accordance with the powers conferred by its enabling statute, which are construed to include not only those expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers which are practically necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the statutory regime (R. v. Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 19; ATCO Gas and Pipelines Ltd. v. Alberta (Energy and Utilities Board), 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, at para. 51).\nAccording to the Federal Court of Appeal below, the Tax Court does not have the authority to review the Ministers discretionary decisions under s. 247(10) since only an assessment can be vacated, varied or referred back to the Minister, not a decision that leads to an assessment (para. 77). The Federal Court of Appeals determination was premised on the notion that a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10)  as part of the process of determining the amount of a taxpayers liability  is necessarily distinct from the assessment itself, as opposed to inextricably linked to it.\nWith great respect, I am of the view that this premise does not withstand scrutiny. As explained above, the express right of appeal provided for in s. 169 of the ITA extends to the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) because this exercise of discretion goes to the correctness of a taxpayers assessment for the purposes of the ITA. The Ministers decision is thus inextricably linked to the assessment.\nThe Crown argues that even if it is assumed that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) as part of an appeal from an assessment, no adequate remedies are available to the Tax Court given that it lacks the power to vary the Ministers opinion or substitute its own opinion for that of the Minister. Therefore, says the Crown, the limitation on the Federal Courts jurisdiction found in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act should not apply (R.F., at para. 52).\nI acknowledge that parallel proceedings may be inevitable for a taxpayer seeking to obtain a reassessment reflecting a downward adjustment if the Tax Court has no appropriate remedial powers to deal with such decisions by the Minister. However, s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act states that where a statute expressly provides for a right of appeal from a decision or order, that decision or order is not, to the extent that it may be so appealed, subject to review or to be restrained, prohibited, removed, set aside or otherwise dealt with, except in accordance with that statute. A decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) of the ITA  because it goes to the correctness of an assessment  is subject to the Tax Courts appellate jurisdiction over an assessment under s. 169 of the ITA. Such a decision must first and foremost be dealt with under s. 171 of the ITA, not through the exercise of the Federal Courts remedial powers.\nSection 171 of the ITA outlines the Tax Courts ability to dispose of an appeal from an assessment as follows:\nI acknowledge that s. 171 of the ITA refers to the assessment in delineating the Tax Courts powers, and not expressly to a decision of the Minister. As I explained above, however, it must be kept in mind that the scope of an appeal from an assessment under s. 169 of the ITA extends to the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) because it is inextricably linked to the assessment.\nIt is true that, as the Federal Court of Appeal concluded, the Tax Court cannot deal with a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) by granting either of the first two remedies available to it when an appeal is allowed. Vacating the entire assessment under s. 171(1)(b)(i) would not be an adequate remedy where the only issue is the Ministers exercise of discretion to deny a downward pricing adjustment. Moreover, varying the assessment under s. 171(1)(b)(ii) would necessarily involve varying the Ministers decision under s. 247(10), but the Tax Court does not have the power to substitute its opinion for that of the Minister. However, this does not lead to the conclusion that the Tax Court has no remedial powers under s. 171 of the ITA to deal with such a decision.\nIn fact, on a careful reading of s. 171(1)(b)(iii) of the ITA, I reach the opposite conclusion, namely that s. 171 does indeed provide the Tax Court with powers to deal with such a decision. Under this provision, the Tax Court can order the Minister to reconsider a decision to deny a downward adjustment under s. 247(10) and to reassess  in French, to carry out a nouvel examen et nouvelle cotisation. The reassessment may or may not reflect a change in the Ministers decision under s. 247(10). What these words imply is that the Tax Court may, in referring the assessment back for reconsideration and reassessment, remit the matter of the downward pricing adjustment to the Minister as part of a reconsideration, or nouvel examen.\nThis power is necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended to be secured by the complete appeal procedure established by Parliament under ss. 165 and 169 of the ITA, namely to allow taxpayers to raise in the Tax Court, a specialized court, all issues relating to the correctness of an assessment. I reiterate that a discretionary decision under s. 247(10) is inextricably linked to an assessment. The Tax Courts order obliges the Minister to reconsider the assessment or reassessment under appeal, including her decision under s. 247(10). Again, the question of which remedies could be available in the Federal Court is irrelevant when the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) can be reviewed in the context of an appeal under s. 169 of the ITA, to the exclusion of the Federal Courts jurisdiction (Federal Courts Act, s. 18.5).\nGiven my finding on this point, it is not necessary to engage in a lengthy discussion of the line of cases under the IWTA, supporting the view that, as part of its appellate jurisdiction, the Tax Court has an implied jurisdiction to remit discretionary decisions of the Minister that are inextricably linked to an assessment (see H. H. Stikeman, Taxation Law: 1923-1947 (1948), 26 Can. Bar Rev. 308, at pp. 328-30; Sandler and Watzinger, at pp. 302-5; Lubetsky, at pp. 78-81 and 113-15). However, I would like to make a few remarks about this.\nIt is true that the Exchequer Courts jurisdiction was stated in broader terms under s. 66 of the IWTA than the Tax Courts jurisdiction is under s. 169 of the ITA  a fact that, I hasten to add, has no bearing on the scope of the Tax Courts current remedial powers. It is nonetheless helpful to keep in mind that, under the IWTA, the Exchequer Court had, as part of its appellate jurisdiction over assessments, precisely the same remedial powers to dispose of appeals that the Tax Court currently does under s. 171 of the ITA  powers limited to vacating the assessment, varying the assessment or referring the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment (IWTA, Sch. 4, s. 3(4) (added by S.C. 1946, c. 55, s. 22)).\nPrior to 1949, the Exchequer Court regularly reviewed the exercise of the Ministers discretionary powers as part of its appellate jurisdiction over assessments. At the time, numerous provisions of the IWTA required the Minister to exercise discretion in the computation of a taxpayers income and therefore in the determination of the taxpayers liability (Lubetsky, at p. 76). In Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners, Ld. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1940] A.C. 127 (P.C.), and Minister of National Revenue v. Wrights Canadian Ropes, Ld., [1947] A.C. 109 (P.C.), the Ministers exercise of discretion under such provisions was reviewed on appeal. The decisions of the Privy Council in these cases suggest that the Exchequer Courts powers to dispose of an appeal from an assessment included, at the very least, the authority to remit the matter for reconsideration and reassessment.\nAs part of the reform of the IWTA and its transformation into the ITA in 1948, almost all of the provisions setting out the Ministers discretionary powers in the determination of tax were repealed and replaced by provisions that set out standards (see, e.g., s. 67 of the ITA, which replaced s. 6(2) of the IWTA; see also Lubetsky, at p. 79). However, on a transitional basis, the newly constituted Income Tax Appeal Board continued to review, for appeals related to taxation years before 1948, the Ministers discretionary decisions on the same principles (ibid.; see, e.g., Anger v. M.N.R., 49 DTC 65; MacDonald Estate v. M.N.R., 50 DTC 109; Buehler v. M.N.R., 50 DTC 119; Williamson v. M.N.R., 50 DTC 147).\nIt must be emphasized that in both Pioneer Laundry and Wrights Canadian Ropes, the remedy granted on appeal from the assessment was to refer the matter, including the discretionary decision and the resulting assessment, back to the Minister. While the taxation years at issue in those cases preceded the enactment of s. 3(4) of the 4th Schedule of the IWTA, there is no suggestion that s. 3(4) altered the scope of the Exchequer Courts remedial powers on appeal from an assessment (Lubetsky, at p. 76). In fact, Parliament must have intended to confirm the powers that had previously been deemed to be implicitly granted. The only purpose for the Tax Courts power to refer an assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment is to deal with decisions that are inextricably linked to the assessment.\nThere is no reason to think that Parliament intended to reduce the scope of the Tax Courts remedial powers while granting it, under s. 171 of the ITA, precisely the same powers to dispose of appeals from assessments as those held by the Exchequer Court, the Income Tax Appeal Board and later the Tax Appeal Board. On the contrary, one must have regard to the fact that Parliament has granted the Tax Court the same power to refer an assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment. Like its predecessors, the Tax Court has the power to remit a decision that is inextricably linked to an assessment, as part of its power to refer the assessment back for reconsideration and reassessment under s. 171(1)(b)(iii). The Tax Courts action in referring the matter back to the Minister on the ground that she exercised her discretion improperly cannot be regarded as interference with that discretion, for it is no such thing (Pure Spring, at pp. 503-4; see also Nicholson, at p. 205). In my respectful view, the Federal Court of Appeal could not disregard this body of case law after acknowledging that it would appear to support the Tax Court judges finding at first instance (para. 50).\nI add that the remedies available to both courts support the conclusion that the Federal Court is not the proper forum to hear a taxpayers objection to a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) of the ITA. A taxpayer seeking a reassessment that will reflect a downward transfer pricing adjustment is concerned with the amount of tax owing, not merely with the propriety of the Ministers exercise of discretion. Because of the limitation in s. 18.5 of the Federal Courts Act, only the Tax Court can vacate the assessment, vary the assessment or refer the assessment back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment under s. 171 of the ITA. On judicial review, the Federal Court cannot deal with the assessment (Minister of National Revenue v. Parsons, [1984] 2 F.C. 331 (C.A.); Redeemer Foundation v. Canada (National Revenue), 2008 SCC 46, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 643, at para. 28).\nIn this context, the only remedy that could be granted by the Federal Court would be an order quashing the decision (it is not clear that mandamus would be an appropriate remedy). Yet an assessment remains valid and binding on the taxpayer unless and until it is varied or vacated by the Tax Court or the Minister issues a reassessment (ITA, s. 152(8)). This continues to be the case even where a decision under s. 247(10) has been quashed by the Federal Court. Section 171(1)(b)(iii) of the ITA  which allows the matter to be referred back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment  is better suited to the real substance of the issue to be determined, i.e., the correct amount of tax owing.\nOn appeal from an assessment, the Tax Court must address all challenges to the correctness of the assessment, including an allegation that the assessment is incorrect because the Minister did not properly exercise her discretion under s. 247(10). Referral back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment is an adequate remedy for taxpayers challenging the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) of the ITA as part of an appeal from an assessment. Indeed, the Tax Courts conclusion in this case regarding the validity of the decision to deny the downward adjustment necessarily means that the Minister must either reconsider the decision under s. 247(10) or appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. It must be emphasized that in remitting the matter for reconsideration and reassessment, the Tax Court cannot substitute its own decision for that of the Minister.\nStandard of Review in the Tax Court\nHaving reached this conclusion, this leaves only the delicate question of the appropriate standard of review to be applied when the Tax Court, dealing with a challenge to the Ministers exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) of the ITA as part of an appeal from an assessment, has to decide whether it will refer the matter back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment. The Tax Court judge did not rule on this question, although she did refer to Vavilov (T.C.C. reasons, at para. 30).\nNothing in these reasons should be taken as circumventing or modifying the system of administrative law as outlined in Vavilov. While our Court indicated in that case that the presumptive standard of review is reasonableness, it also determined that where there is a right of appeal from an administrative decision, it can be inferred that the legislature instead intended the appellate standard of review to apply (paras. 30 and 37). Indeed, the presumption of reasonableness review is clearly rebutted where the legislature provides a right of appeal (para. 17). As explained above, the right of appeal under s. 169 of the ITA extends to the exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) where that decision results in an assessment. The standard applicable to the review of the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) must therefore be determined with reference to the nature of the question and to our Courts jurisprudence on appellate standards of review (para. 37). This Courts decision in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, is an essential part of this jurisprudence. But it must also be recognized that the appellate standards of review identified in that case are ill suited to deal with discretionary decisions in general, such as those contemplated by s. 247(10).\nIt is clear from the language of s. 247(10) that Parliament intended to confer upon the Minister a broad discretion in reaching a decision regarding a downward transfer pricing adjustment. By providing that the Minister can allow or deny a transfer pricing adjustment based on the circumstances and not on specific considerations, Parliament gave the Minister a wide discretion to decide whether or not to allow a downward adjustment. To the extent that the Minister comes to a decision and that her decision considers the circumstances, the Minister is acting within the discretion Parliament conferred upon her. In exercising her discretion under this provision, the Minister is not simply applying the law to the facts to determine the correct amount payable under the ITA, but is in fact exercising a policy function.\nIn Pure Spring, Thorson P. wrote the following regarding the Ministers discretion to disallow excessive expenses under s. 6(2) of the IWTA:\nWhen the Minister makes his discretionary determination that an expense is to be disallowed as excessive he does an administrative act, but, in my view, his determination is more than that. He is acting in respect of a policy which Parliament has indicated but not defined. It has left the limits of the field in which he is to operate to be defined by him in his discretion; the Ministers determination is thus really a definition of policy. The effect is that his determination renders the expense which he disallows subject to tax, which otherwise would be deductible and free from tax. Parliament has thus, in effect, conferred a power of tax imposition upon the Minister. This makes his determination not only an administrative act but also a quasi-legislative one. This must not be overlooked in considering the Courts duty of supervision over it. [p. 479]\nThis rationale holds true for the downward pricing adjustments contemplated by s. 247(10) of the ITA. It is clear that the Minister, in determining whether the circumstances are such that it would be appropriate that the adjustment be made, can consider factors that are extraneous to, and distinct from, the computation of a taxpayers income. As the Crown points out, the relevant circumstances can include considerations such as tax treatment in a foreign jurisdiction, domestic tax avoidance and domestic compliance (R.F., at para. 64). Regarding tax treatment in a foreign jurisdiction, the Minister may want to avoid a situation where the failure to recognize a downward adjustment or the possibility of a corresponding upward adjustment in a foreign jurisdiction would result in either double taxation or double non-taxation. With respect to domestic tax avoidance, the Minister may want to ensure that a downward adjustment will not facilitate improper retroactive tax planning. As to domestic compliance, the Minister may simply not be able to reliably verify the amount of the proposed downward adjustment.\nI should add, however, that such a policy function has no bearing on whether a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) resulting in an assessment can be reviewed in the Tax Court, contrary to the Crowns argument (R.F., at para. 61). It informs only the manner in which the review can be conducted.\nLikewise, the de novo nature of an appeal in the Tax Court is not determinative of the standard of review, nor does it constitute one. Instead, the remedies available under s. 171 shed light on how the Tax Court must conduct its review of the decision under appeal. It cannot be said that the only option allowed under the ITA is for the Tax Court to review the decision itself for correctness. In fact, the statute precludes such an approach. The question on appeal is whether the assessment is incorrect because the Minister exercised her discretion improperly. If a decision to deny a downward transfer pricing adjustment results from an improper exercise of discretion, the assessment is incorrect as a matter of fact and law. The appropriate remedy for dealing with an assessment that is incorrect because of an improper exercise of discretion under s. 247(10) is to refer the matter back to the Minister for reconsideration and reassessment under s. 171(1)(b)(iii).\nThe Minister, in exercising her broad discretion under s. 247(10) of the ITA, is therefore entitled to considerable deference from the Tax Court. However, as Rand J. noted in Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121, at p. 140, there is no such thing as absolute and untrammelled discretion (see also Vavilov, at para. 108). Under appellate standards of review, the exercise of discretion has always attracted a high degree of deference: appellate reviewers must defer, unless of course the discretion has been exercised on a wrong principle, or on the basis of irrelevant or erroneous considerations, or unless the decision fails to set out the reasoning process leading to the result or does not reflect a proper consideration of the main relevant factors (J. Sopinka, M. A. Gelowitz and W. D. Rankin, Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin on the Conduct of an Appeal (5th ed. 2022), at 2.70-2.73; see also Reza v. Canada, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394, at p. 404; Canada (Attorney General) v. Fontaine, 2017 SCC 47, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 205, at para. 36; Canada (Transportation Safety Board) v. Carroll-Byrne, 2022 SCC 48, at para. 41). In my view, the same approach is applicable to the review of discretionary decisions under s. 247(10).\nThe de novo nature of an appeal to the Tax Court is consistent with a review of a decision by the Minister under s. 247(10) of the ITA. On appeal to the Tax Court, either party can raise new grounds or new facts to challenge the factual basis for an assessment, including the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA. The Tax Court is not limited to the facts relied upon by the Minister in exercising her discretion (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Jencan Ltd., [1998] 1 F.C. 187 (C.A.), at para. 42). This type of evidence would not normally be available to the Federal Court on judicial review (Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency, 2012 FCA 22, 428 N.R. 297, at para. 17; Delios v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 117, 100 Admin. L.R. (5th) 301, at para. 42; Namgis First Nation v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans), 2019 FCA 149, at para. 7 (CanLII)).\nIn challenging the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA, a taxpayer must establish a factual foundation to support the submission that the decision was wrong in principle, that it ignored relevant evidence or that it was based on irrelevant evidence. The focus is not necessarily on whether the exercise of discretion was reasonable at the time the Minister formed her opinion (as would be the case on judicial review), but rather on whether the exercise of discretion remains a valid fact on which to rest the correctness of the assessment in view of the evidence before the Tax Court. For example, there may be new evidence presented by the taxpayer (such as a subsequent tax assessment by a foreign jurisdiction) or by the Minister (such as evidence that tax was not assessed in the foreign jurisdiction). Or the interpretation of the provisions of Canadas tax treaties on the basis of which the Minister made her decision may be in dispute.\nThere is no suggestion that the Tax Court is institutionally ill-equipped to deal with such matters. This much was conceded by the Crown during the hearing before our Court (transcript, at p. 74). Indeed, ruling on these matters is perfectly in line with the task and jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The Tax Court, as a specialized court, is well placed to rule on the proper application of the transfer pricing provisions, including whether the discretion under s. 247(10) was properly exercised.\nA deferential standard of appellate review applies when the Tax Court is dealing with the Ministers discretionary decisions under s. 247(10) on appeal from an assessment. The Tax Court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the Minister or prevent her from arriving at the same decision, upon reconsideration, following a proper exercise of her discretion. That being said, this deference should apply only to the discretionary portion of the assessment. Again, I want to reiterate the following, as stated by the Tax Court judge: [b]ecause the exercise of ministerial discretion under [s.] 247(10) is subject to appeal to the Tax Court, it is not subject to judicial review by the Federal Court, although the Tax Courts decision on the appeal of the assessment may be appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal (para. 215).\nConclusion\nThe Ministers decision to deny the downward pricing adjustment requested by Dow Chemical resulted in reassessments for the 2006 taxation year. Dow Chemical objected to those reassessments and appealed the latest reassessment to the Tax Court. In my view, the Ministers decision was inextricably linked to the correctness of that reassessment. The amount of tax owing could only be determined once the Minister made the decision to allow or deny the downward pricing adjustment. Dow Chemical had the right to challenge the Ministers decision in an appeal to the Tax Court.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeal, with costs. The stated question is answered as follows: Dow Chemicals challenge regarding the Ministers decision under s. 247(10) of the ITA should proceed before the Tax Court.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs, Karakatsanis, Cote and Rowe JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: EY Law, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Department of Justice Canada, NCR Tax Litigation Section, Ottawa.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to a discretionary decision by the Minister of  National Revenue should be brought in Federal Court. </strong>This appeal addressed  whether the Tax Court of Canada had jurisdiction to consider a company\u2019s challenge  to a decision by the Minister of National Revenue. The Minister refused to reduce the company\u2019s taxable income by adjusting the value of a  \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d transaction that the company had concluded with a foreign  lender. This procedure is called a downward transfer pricing adjustment. A \u201cnon-arm\u2019s length\u201d  transaction is one in which the parties are related to each other. They can  also be between unrelated individuals, partnerships or corporations, depending  on the circumstances. In contrast, an arm\u2019s length transaction is one in which  both parties act in their separate interests. In the tax context, this  distinction is important because when evaluating a transaction between two  companies that are not at arm\u2019s length, meaning they are associated in some  way, the revenue agency wants to ensure it is still collecting tax on the  transaction at the fair market value. The Canadian  company in question, Dow\u00a0Chemical Canada ULC, concluded a non\u2011arm\u2019s length  loan agreement to borrow money from a related Swiss company. As a result of  this loan agreement, Dow incurred interest expenses for its 2006 and 2007  taxation years. It also reported income for the 2006 taxation year in respect  of manufacturing services provided to the Swiss company. Following a review  of the transactions between Dow and the Swiss company, the Minister reassessed  Dow for its 2006 taxation year, applying transfer pricing rules set out in section  247(2) of the <em>Income Tax Act</em> (\u201c<em>ITA</em>\u201d). Under section 247(2), where a  taxpayer is dealing with a non-resident person with whom it is not at arm\u2019s  length \u2013 in this case, the Swiss company \u2013 the amounts in a given transaction  will be adjusted to reflect what would have been agreed to had the persons been  dealing with one another at arm\u2019s length. The application of section 247(2)  resulted in a significant increase in Dow\u2019s income in the 2006 taxation year,  meaning it would need to pay more tax on that income.Dow believed that  its income should be decreased. Where an amount is identified that would  decrease the taxpayer\u2019s income, section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> says that a downward adjustment cannot be made unless approved  by the Minister. Dow asked the Minister to allow a downward transfer pricing  adjustment, but the Minister exercised her discretion to refuse Dow\u2019s request. Dow then asked the  Federal Court to review the Minister\u2019s decision. This process is called a  \u201cjudicial review\u201d. Dow also objected to the reassessment for the 2006 taxation  year and eventually appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court.Dow\u2019s appeal asked  whether the Minister\u2019s denial of the request for a downward transfer pricing  adjustment fell outside the exclusive original jurisdiction of the Tax Court. The  Tax Court said that the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is an essential component of the taxpayer\u2019s assessment and goes to the  correctness of that assessment, and may therefore be reviewed by the Tax Court  under its exclusive jurisdiction to determine, on appeal, the correctness of  the assessment. The Minister disagreed and appealed to the Federal Court of  Appeal. The Federal Court  of Appeal allowed the Minister\u2019s appeal and held that the Federal Court has  exclusive jurisdiction to conduct a judicial review of the Minister\u2019s discretionary  decisions under section 247(10). Dow appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court  dismissed the appeal.<strong>The Tax Court did not have jurisdiction to  review the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Kasirer held that when the Minister has exercised her  discretion under section 247(10) of the <em>ITA</em> to deny a taxpayer\u2019s request for a downward pricing adjustment, that decision  falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Tax Court in respect of an appeal of  the taxpayer\u2019s assessment. The Minister\u2019s discretionary decision is not part of  the assessment. The meaning of \u201cassessment\u201d is settled in law, and the  Minister\u2019s opinion formed under section 247(10) is qualitatively distinct from  that concept. As there is no express right of appeal to the Tax Court, the  proper forum to challenge the Minister\u2019s discretionary decision under section 247(10)  is the Federal Court, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction in judicial review  under section 18(1) of the <em>Federal Courts  Act</em>. Only the Federal Court has the jurisdiction to apply the appropriate  standard of review and access to the appropriate range of administrative law  remedies."

The school principal, who had been made aware of the log, entered the classroom of one of the teachers and, in her absence, touched the mousepad of her board laptop, saw the log that opened on the screen, read what was visible, then scrolled through the document and took screenshots with his cellphone. These communications then formed the basis for the school board to issue written reprimands. The teachers union grieved the discipline, claiming that the search violated the teachers right to privacy at work. No Charter breach was alleged. A labour arbitrator, appointed pursuant to the collective agreement, dismissed the grievance. Applying the arbitral balancing of interests framework, the arbitrator found there was no breach of the teachers reasonable expectation of privacy when balanced against the school boards interest in managing the workplace.\n\tOn judicial review, the majority of the Divisional Court upheld the reasonableness of the arbitrators decision. The majority held that no Charter issues arose from the search because an employee does not have the right under s. 8 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure in a workplace environment, unlike in a criminal context. The dissent found that the Charter applied and the arbitrators decision was unreasonable because she misunderstood the nature of the s. 8 right. The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the unions appeal and quashed the arbitrators decision. It held that the majority of the Divisional Court erred in concluding that s. 8 did not apply. The Court of Appeal conducted a correctness review of the arbitrators decision and held that the search was unreasonable under s. 8 of the Charter. \n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Cote, Rowe, Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: Ontario public school board teachers are protected by s. 8 of the Charter in the workplace, as these boards are inherently governmental for the purposes of s. 32 of the Charter. Consequently, the grievance at issue implicated an alleged violation of a Charter right, and s. 8 of the Charter was a legal constraint bearing on the arbitrators analysis. On review, applying the correctness standard, the arbitrator erred by limiting her inquiry to the arbitral framework without regard for the legal framework under s. 8 that, as a matter of law, she was required to respect. This error is fatal and the arbitrators decision should be set aside. \n\tSection 32 of the Constitution Act, 1982 sets out the scope of the Charters application. The Court in Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, established a two-branch framework to determine when the Charter applies to an entity. Under the first branch of the Eldridge framework, it may be determined that an entity is itself government for the purposes of s. 32 where, by (1) its very nature or (2) the degree of governmental control exercised over it, the entity is akin to a government. Under this branch, where the entity is found to be government, the Charter applies to all its actions.\n\tA review of Ontarios Education Act confirms that Ontario public school boards are government by nature and therefore are subject to the Charter under Eldridges first branch. They are, in effect, an arm of government, in that they exercise powers conferred on them by the provincial legislature, powers and functions which the legislature would otherwise have to perform itself. Public education is inherently a governmental function. It has a unique constitutional quality, as exemplified by s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and by s. 23 of the Charter. All actions carried on by Ontario public school boards are subject to Charter scrutiny, including the principals actions in the instant case, as he acted in his official capacity as an agent of the board, a statutory delegate, and not in his personal capacity. \n\tAdministrative tribunals are competent to and tasked with the work of adjudicating Charter questions where they arise. Administrative tribunals with the power to decide questions of law, and from whom constitutional jurisdiction has not been clearly withdrawn, have the authority to resolve constitutional questions that are linked to matters properly before them and must act consistently with the Charter and its values when exercising its statutory function. The principles governing remedial jurisdiction under the Charter apply to both courts and administrative tribunals. Tribunals should play a primary role in the determination of Charter issues falling within their specialized jurisdiction. This is in part an access to justice issue: there are practical advantages and a constitutional basis for allowing Canadians to assert their Charter rights in the most accessible forum available. Charter rights can be effectively vindicated through the exercise of statutory powers and processes, meaning that claimants do not need to have separate recourse to the courts for their Charter rights to be vindicated. Where a Charter right applies, an administrative decision-maker should therefore perform an analysis that is consistent with the relevant Charter provision. \n\tThe arbitrator in the instant case is broadly empowered, by Ontarios Labour Relations Act, 1995, to answer questions regarding all differences between the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the collective agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable. Thus, the arbitrator has the power to decide questions of law, and was therefore required to decide the grievance consistent with the requirements of s. 8 of the Charter. This would properly entail drawing on both the relevant body of arbitral decisions and the s. 8 jurisprudence. However, the arbitrator approached her task differently, conducting an analysis by reference to management rights versus privacy interests of employees. When a Charter right applies, it is not sufficient that the arbitrator made some references to the Charter jurisprudence. There must be clear acknowledgment of and analysis of that right. While administrative justice may not always take the form of judicial justice, nowhere in the arbitrators reasons, read functionally and holistically, did it indicate s. 8 Charter rights were being considered. \n\tWhile the Court of Appeal properly applied a correctness standard of review to the question of whether the teachers had a reasonable expectation of privacy, the court erred in deriving the standard of review from R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, dealing with an appellate standard of review. Where a court reviews a decision of an administrative tribunal, the standard of review must be determined on the basis of administrative law principles. Accordingly, this appeal is governed by Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653. Correctness applies because the issue of constitutionality on judicial review  of whether a Charter right arises, the scope of its protection, and the appropriate framework of the analysis  is a constitutional question that requires a final and determinate answer from the courts and therefore falls within the rule of law exception. Vavilov does not restrict the scope of constitutional questions to only issues of federalism and the constitutional delegation of state power to administrative decision-makers; it used non-exhaustive language in articulating the constitutional questions category, including within it other constitutional matters. This category should not be unduly narrowed.\n\tPer Karakatsanis and Martin JJ.: There is agreement with the majority that the Charter applies to Ontario public school boards. However, there is disagreement as to how the majority reviews the arbitrators decision. Reviewing the arbitrators decision on the correctness standard overshoots the ambit of the correctness exceptions laid down in Vavilov. The issue before the arbitrator was whether the teachers privacy rights had been breached, an application and assessment which heavily depended on the specific factual and statutory context. As a result, the presumption of reasonableness review applies. Reviewing the arbitrators reasons on that standard, the arbitrators reasoning is not consistent with the principle of content neutrality, which lies at the heart of s. 8s normative approach to privacy, and therefore her decision is unreasonable. \n\t\tVavilov was intended to provide a stable framework for determining and applying the standard of review and to encourage parties to focus instead on the merits. The Court affirmed a broad presumption of reasonableness review. The correctness exception for constitutional questions is justified by the need for consistency, finality, and determinate answers; but, importantly, Vavilov was clear that constitutional matters not requiring courts to supply final and determinate answers fall outside the exception to the presumption of reasonableness review. Accordingly, individualized decisions involving the application of the Charter that are intrinsically linked to a specific factual and statutory context will generally not engage the same rule of law concern about potential inconsistency as that which motivated the correctness exception for constitutional questions in Vavilov. Courts do not possess a monopoly over the adjudication of Charter-related issues in the administrative context.\n\tAlthough the arbitrators decision in the instant case is unreasonable, there is disagreement with the majority that it must be quashed because the arbitrator did not expressly state that s. 8 of the Charter applied or that she conducted her analysis without regard to the legal framework under s. 8. That conclusion seizes on form, contrary to Vavilovs teachings. Administrative decisions are to be considered functionally, with an eye to substance, not form. The Courts s. 8 Charter jurisprudence was specifically argued by the parties, and the arbitrators reasons clearly demonstrate she appreciated that the s. 8 privacy framework constrained her decision. The arbitrators reasons demonstrate she was reviewing the challenged conduct using the s. 8 Charter framework as a touchstone. The arbitrator understood that administrative decision-makers must act consistently with the Charter and its values when exercising statutory functions. Reading the arbitrators decision as a whole as Vavilov instructs, and with sensitivity to the institutional and procedural context in which it was made, she plainly understood that the Charter and s. 8 jurisprudence bore on the grievance. \nCases Cited\nBy Rowe J.\n\tApplied: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

These communications then formed the basis for the school board to issue written reprimands. The teachers union grieved the discipline, claiming that the search violated the teachers right to privacy at work. No Charter breach was alleged. A labour arbitrator, appointed pursuant to the collective agreement, dismissed the grievance. Applying the arbitral balancing of interests framework, the arbitrator found there was no breach of the teachers reasonable expectation of privacy when balanced against the school boards interest in managing the workplace, set out in s. 265 of the Education Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2.\nOn judicial review, the majority of the Divisional Court upheld the reasonableness of the arbitrators decision. The majority held that no Charter issues arose from the search because an employee does not have a s. 8 Charter right in a workplace environment, unlike in a criminal context. The dissent found that the Charter applied and the arbitrators decision was unreasonable because she misunderstood the nature of the s. 8 right. The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed the arbitrators decision. It held that the majority of the Divisional Court erred in concluding that s. 8 did not apply. The Court of Appeal conducted a correctness review and held that the search was unreasonable under s. 8 of the Charter.\nI would dismiss the appeal, although my reasoning follows a different pathway than that of the Court of Appeal. Teachers are protected by s. 8 of the Charter in the workplace, as Ontario public school boards are inherently governmental for the purposes of s. 32 of the Charter. Consequently, the grievance at issue implicated an alleged violation of a Charter right, and s. 8 of the Charter was a legal constraint bearing on the arbitrators analysis.\nThe arbitrator erred by limiting her inquiry to the arbitral framework without regard for the legal framework under s. 8 that, as a matter of law, she was required to respect. The effect of my conclusion on this point is not to displace existing arbitral jurisprudence, but to supplement it in order to ensure the protection of constitutional rights in the workplace. The s. 8 framework being contextual, it must be adapted to account for the circumstances in which the Charter right is asserted.\nFactual Context \nThe arbitrator made findings of fact in her decision. They are summarized below. \nIn the 2014-15 school year, two teachers, Ms. Shen and Ms. Rai (Grievors), were newly employed to teach at a public school, which was part of the York Region District School Board. The events in question took place during that academic year. \nShortly after the school year began, problems arose within the group of Grade 2 teachers. The Grievors felt that one of the teachers was not effective and was receiving preferential treatment from the principal. They were concerned about how these interpersonal issues might impact their performance reviews. Ms. Shen contacted an Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario (Union) representative; she was told to keep notes about her concerns. \nFollowing the Unions advice, Ms. Shen started a private log using her personal Gmail account. Ms. Shen authorized Ms. Rai to have access to the log through Ms. Rais personal Gmail account. The log was accessible and could be edited by both Grievors. \nThe log was not saved on a workplace drive or on the Board laptop. Rather, it was stored in the cloud as a private Google Docs document, through a private internet account unrelated to the Board. Some others at the school were aware that the Grievors were maintaining the log.\nThe principal was told by staff members that the Grievors were keeping a log and that there were concerns about the workplace  which the arbitrator described as toxic (paras. 7-8, 28, 46, 79, 87 and 97). The principal discussed this with the Board superintendent, Human Resources, and IT Services. An IT search was conducted, but no log was found on any of the Boards data storage drives. \nOn December 16, 2014, the principal entered Ms. Shens classroom to return some teaching materials after classes had ended. Ms. Shen was not present. The principal saw that the Board laptop used by Ms. Shen was open and touched its mousepad. A document called Log Google Docs opened on the screen. The principal read what was visible on the screen and then scrolled through the document. He used his cellphone to take screenshots of the document. When the principal had finished taking photos, he shut down the laptop.\nThe principal informed the Board superintendent via email that he had obtained contents of the log and that there was much nastiness all the way through it (para. 26). The principal and the Board superintendent agreed they should seize the laptop as it was a Board computer; a school caretaker did so on their behalf. The principal forwarded the photos of the log to the Board for investigation. Ms. Rais Board laptop was seized as well. Her laptop was closed when taken.\nOn January 23, 2015, the Grievors were given written reprimands by the Board arising from these events, for failing to conduct themselves in accordance with the Ontario College of Teachers Standards of Practice. \nOn February 6, 2015, the Union grieved the written reprimands. By way of remedy, the Union sought to have the written reprimands rescinded and asked that each Grievor be awarded $15,000 in damages for the Boards breach of their privacy. The Union claimed that the Board violated the Grievors right to privacy without reasonable cause and used that information as the basis to discipline the Grievors.\nOn January 22, 2018, pursuant to a sunset clause under the collective agreement, the written reprimands were removed from the Grievors records.\nJudicial History\nArbitrators Decision (2018), 294 L.A.C. (4th) 341 (G. Misra)\nBetween September 16, 2016, and June 5, 2018, labour arbitrator Gail Misra held hearings on the grievance.\nThe arbitrator considered whether the Grievors had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their log, such that the searches by the principal and the Board were breaches of their privacy. Notably, the arbitrator was not asked to consider whether s. 8 of the Charter had been infringed; however, principles derived from s. 8 Charter jurisprudence were considered.\nThe Union alleged three breaches of the Grievors privacy: (1) the Boards search of its IT platforms; (2) the principals search of Ms. Shens Board classroom laptop; and (3) the searches conducted after the Board seized both of the Grievors Board classroom laptops.\nOn August 7, 2018, the arbitrator released her decision. She concluded that there was no breach of the Grievors diminished reasonable expectation of privacy in the log when balanced against the Boards legitimate interest in addressing the issue of the toxic work environment allegedly caused by the Grievors (paras. 262-63). Thus, the arbitrator dismissed the grievance.\nShe drew on this Courts decision in R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, as authoritative and of assistance in understanding what may amount to a privacy breach, and the limits to an expectation of privacy in the context of school board cases (para. 198). The arbitrator also considered arbitral jurisprudence with respect to balancing employee privacy rights against the employers interests and management rights. She drew the following conclusions:\nThe subject matter of the search was the Grievors log, which the principal thought was on a Board classroom laptop;\n\nThe Grievors had a privacy interest in their log: only they could access the log and make contributions to it;\n\nThe Grievors set up their log to operate privately: it was password- protected and not stored on the Boards laptop or data storage. Thus, they had a subjective expectation of privacy in their log; and\n\nThe Grievors subjective expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable, as they had taken steps to keep their log private and out of reach of the employer, but it was diminished because they made the content of the log known prior to its discovery, and, as well, Ms. Shen left the log open and freely accessible by anyone using the Boards computer. The arbitrator also found that the log was left in plain view.\nHaving concluded that the Grievors had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the log, the arbitrator then turned to the three breaches alleged by the Union. She conducted her analysis by applying the arbitral framework of balancing of the personal privacy interests of an employee with an employers right to manage its enterprise and in each instance, she found the balance favours the Board in this case (para. 223). She proceeded to analyze the three breaches.\nFirst Alleged Breach\nThe first alleged breach was the Boards search of its data files. The arbitrator found that s. 265 of the Education Act authorized the principal to conduct reasonable searches and seizures without prior judicial authorization. In balancing employees personal privacy interests with the employers right to manage their enterprises, the arbitrator concluded that the Board had reasonable cause to conduct the search. The search of the IT platforms did not breach the Grievors privacy.\nThe principal had reasonable cause for concern about the work and teaching environment and the level of cooperation and coordination of effort within the Grade 2 teaching team. It was his duty to maintain order and discipline in the school. The arbitrator found that there was reasonable cause for the Board to conduct a search of the Grievors online Board data files.\nSecond Alleged Breach\nThe second alleged breach was the principals search of Ms. Shens Board classroom computer. The Union pointed to four distinct acts by the principal: (1) touching the mouse pad to activate the screen; (2) viewing the log; (3) scrolling through the entire log; and (4) taking photographs of the entire log with his cell phone.\nThe arbitrator found that the principals actions were reasonable. She wrote:\nAgain applying the Supreme Courts test in M. (M.R.)[, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 393], [the principal] had the right, pursuant to s. 265 of the Education Act, and in the context of maintaining order in his school, to ensure that the laptop had been turned off at the end of the school day. He also had an obligation to take steps to ensure that the Grade 2 teachers were working well together, and that there were no toxic or destabilizing elements at work in the group. I have already outlined the bases upon which I accept that [the principal] had reasonable cause to be searching for the log. [para. 230]\nThe arbitrator found that Ms. Shen left the log in plain view  open and accessible without password protection where it could be viewed by anyone using the Board computer (para. 236). She concluded that once the principal found the log, it was reasonable for the Board to think that it was stored on the laptop and to search the laptop. She found nothing nefarious in the manner the principal found and accessed the log (para. 240).\nIn balancing the Grievors diminished privacy interest against the Boards interests as employer, she concluded that the principals happenstance discovery and the subsequent seizure of the computer did not breach the Grievors workplace privacy (para. 240). The principal had a legitimate reason to be in Ms. Shens classroom, had the right to use that Board laptop, and the log contained information that he felt may be contributing to a toxic work environment at the school (paras. 231 and 252). \nMeanwhile, the Grievors privacy interest was reduced because Ms. Shens leaving the log open on the Boards classroom laptop diminished her reasonable expectation of privacy (para. 242). Furthermore, the arbitrator found that the information contained in the log was not personal or intimate, nor did it reveal the Grievors views about their colleagues, and thus concluded that it did not touch on [their] biographical core (para. 246).\nThird Alleged Breach\nThe third alleged breach was the forensic search of Ms. Shens and Ms. Rais computers, including the seizure of the two computers, and the Boards search of them. The arbitrator dismissed this alleged breach as well.\nOnce the principal had found the log on Ms. Shens Board classroom laptop, it was reasonable for the Board to think that it may have found the location of the log and to therefore conduct a search for it on the computer. The arbitrator further concluded that it is not necessary to consider whether there were other alternatives that the employer should have considered before it conducted an IT search (para. 261).\nOntario Superior Court of Justice (Divisional Court), 2020 ONSC 3685, 316 L.A.C. (4th) 1 (Kiteley and OBonsawin JJ., Sachs J. Dissenting)\nThe Union sought judicial review in the Divisional Court. The parties proceeded on the basis that the arbitration decision (referred to as an award) was subject to review on a reasonableness standard.\nThe case was heard at Divisional Court in November 2019. The only issue on judicial review concerned the arbitrators conclusion that the Grievors reasonable expectation of privacy had not been breached by the employers actions. The court concluded that the issue was not moot by virtue of the removal of the written reprimand from the Grievors records. The court exercised its discretion to hear the judicial review. Following the oral hearing, the court invited further submissions from the parties on the standard of review following release of this Courts decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653. \nThe Majority Opinion (OBonsawin J., Kiteley J. Concurring)\nIn June 2020, the Divisional Court issued a split decision; the majority dismissed the application for judicial review. OBonsawin J. (as she then was), Kiteley J. concurring, applied a reasonableness standard of review. The majority concluded that the arbitrators reasoning demonstrated justification, transparency, and intelligibility, and the decision she reached was within a range of acceptable outcomes.\nThe majority concluded that the arbitrators finding that the principal had a duty to maintain order and discipline in the school in accordance with s. 265 of the Education Act was reasonable, given the apparently toxic work environment within the Grade 2 teaching team (para. 76). The majority noted that the arbitrator recognized that the search had no criminal element, but it was undertaken within the course of [the principals] duties . . . to develop co-operation and co-ordination of effort among the members of the staff of the school pursuant to s. 265 of the Education Act (para. 79). The majority stated that the arbitrators conclusion that the legal duties of a principal under the Education Act could extend to such situations was reasonable (para. 79). \nThe majority further concluded that the arbitrator interpreted and applied privacy jurisprudence reasonably. With regard to the search by IT Services of the Boards data storage system, the majority held there was no reason for the employer to consider other alternatives before having its corporate IT Services conduct a search of its own systems (para. 88). It was also not reasonable to expect the principal to consider other alternatives before searching Ms. Shens laptop as [the principals] search occurred by happenstance because Ms. Shen had left the laptop on (para. 89).\nAs well, the majority held that it was reasonable for the arbitrator to conclude that the log was not close enough to the Grievors biographical core because the entries were not in the nature of emails between spouses, and were not related to medical, banking, or other intimate personal matters (para. 94). As the arbitrator found that none of the searches impacted the Grievors reasonable expectation of privacy, the majority concluded that there was no cumulative aspect of the search to consider (para. 101).\nFinally, the majority responded to the dissent. The majority disagreed with the Charter framework applied by Sachs J. as they concluded that no Charter issues arose from the principals conduct in the case at bar:\n[Justice Sachs] approaches her analysis as a balance between the Grievors rights under s. 8 of the Charter against the statutory objectives that the Principal was seeking to enforce. I disagree with that analytical framework. Unlike in a criminal context, in a workplace environment, an employee does not have a s. 8 right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. The Arbitrator reasonably concluded the Grievors had a reasonable expectation of privacy that was diminished. The Arbitrator was required and did balance that diminished expectation of privacy against the duty of the employer to manage the workplace and the Arbitrator arrived at a reasonable conclusion. [Emphasis added; para. 103.]\nThus, the majority agreed with the arbitrator that the framework for analysis was not s. 8 of the Charter, but rather the rights of employers and employees under the collective agreement.\nThe Dissenting Opinion (Sachs J.)\nJustice Sachs, dissenting, concluded that the arbitrators decision was unreasonable as the arbitrators reasons disclose a failure of rationality internal to the reasoning process and further, [t]he result is also untenable given the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it (para. 109). \nJustice Sachs found that employees have a s. 8 Charter right in the workplace, and the actions of the principal came within Charter scrutiny because the Board was a state actor (para. 127). \nAs such, whether the Grievors Charter rights had been infringed comes within the category of constitutional questions reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (paras. 114-15, citing Vavilov, at para. 57).\nFurther, the framework under Dore v. Barreau du Quebec, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395, applied as these [Charter] rights must be balanced against the statutory objectives of the Education Act. Justice Sachs further noted that while not directly referencing Dore, it is the framework that the Arbitrator used (para. 121). \nThe dissenting judge concluded that the arbitrator made three significant errors in the application of s. 8 jurisprudence; this rendered the decision unreasonable. In brief, because the arbitrator misunderstood the nature of s. 8, she was not able to proportionately balance s. 8 Charter values with the statutory objectives (paras. 143-45). \nFirst, the Arbitrator used the fruits of the search to justify the privacy violation, which is contrary to this Courts jurisprudence in R. v. Marakah, 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, and R. v. Wong, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36 (Div. Ct. reasons, at para. 147). The principals incidental finding of the log did not entitle him to search the log further (para. 148).\nSecond, the arbitrator erred in finding that the contents of the log did not touch on the Grievors biographical core. This finding contradicts her earlier finding that the Grievors subjective expectation of privacy in the contents of the log was objectively reasonable under Cole (Div. Ct. reasons, at para. 149). The dissent continued, the Arbitrators finding that the Grievors subjective expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable was tantamount to an acceptance that the information in the diary was close to the biographical core of personal information as that term is understood in the case law (para. 151).\nThird, the arbitrator misapplied the plain view doctrine to justify the search. The dissent held that even if the concept of plain view could justify the Principals touching of the mouse pad, it could not justify his scrolling through the log thereafter (para. 154). Here, however, the Arbitrator sought to use the doctrine to justify an exploratory search (not seizure) where the Principal was intentionally searching for the item in question. The law is clear that the doctrine cannot be used in these circumstances (para. 156 (emphasis in original)).\nJustice Sachs concluded that it was unreasonable for the arbitrator to find that the Principals scrolling through the log and taking pictures of its contents was in any way justified by the statutory objectives of the Education Act (para. 176).\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario, 2022 ONCA 476, 340 L.A.C. (4th) 365 (Doherty, Benotto and Huscroft JJ.A.)\nJustice Huscroft, writing for a unanimous panel, allowed the appeal and quashed the arbitrators decision. He held that the arbitrator erred in interpreting and applying s. 8; and reached an unreasonable decision in dismissing the grievance. Thus, the Divisional Court erred in upholding the arbitrators decision. The Court of Appeal stated that [a]lthough the Arbitrator did not specifically reference s. 8 of the Charter, her analysis clearly relied on s. 8 case law (para. 36). \nThe Court of Appeal stated that the factual findings of the arbitrator were entitled to deference. By contrast, whether the Grievors had a reasonable expectation of privacy is a question of law that is subject to review for correctness (para. 37, citing R. v. Shepherd, 2009 SCC 35, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 527, at para. 20). The Court of Appeal proceeded by stepping into the shoes of the Divisional Court, in effect conducting a de novo judicial review of the arbitrators decision (Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 45-46; Longueepee v. University of Waterloo, 2020 ONCA 830, 153 O.R. (3d) 641, at paras. 47-48).\nRegarding the application of the Charter to school boards, the Court of Appeal made the same assumptions accepted by the Supreme Court in M. (M.R.) and Cole (para. 41). The Court of Appeal concluded that it was not necessary to determine under which branch of Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, the Charter applies (because school boards are governmental in nature or because they perform governmental activities): It is enough to say that s. 8 applies to the actions of the Principal and the school board (para. 41).\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that (1) s. 8 of the Charter applied to the actions of the principal and the school board; (2) the Grievors had a reasonable expectation of privacy; (3) the arbitrator erred in interpreting and applying the law concerning the Grievors s. 8 Charter right; and (4) the arbitrator reached an unreasonable decision (paras. 41 and 71).\nIssues\nThe appeal at bar raises three questions: \nDoes the Charter apply to public school boards in Ontario?\nWhat is the appropriate standard of review?\nShould the arbitrators award be set aside for failing to conduct an analysis under s. 8 of the Charter?\nSubmissions\nYork Region District School Board\nThe appellant York Region District School Board submits that the award is reasonable and should be restored, and that the Court of Appeal erred (1) in applying the correctness standard of review; (2) in concluding that the Charter applies to the Board; and (3) in applying the s. 8 jurisprudence and concluding that the Grievors s. 8 rights were breached.\nThe appellant submits that since the issue of the Charters application to the Board was never before the arbitrator, [a] reviewing court should not be permitted to undermine [any] reasonable decision by subjecting it to analyses and facts not advanced by the parties (A.F., at para. 66). \nMoreover, the appellant argues that the Court of Appeal erred by simply assuming the Charter applies to Ontario public school boards, without conducting an Eldridge analysis (A.F., at para. 76). The appellant submits that it is not government under the first branch, because it does not issue legislative enactments or exercise government authority. Nor does [the second branch] apply to this case because the Board was in essence acting as an employer. On these facts, the Board was not implementing a delegated government activity or carrying out an act that was truly governmental in nature (A.F., at para. 103).\nThe appellant finally submits that the Court of Appeal erred in its interpretation of s. 8. First, the Court of Appeal erred in its assessment of the Grievors conduct and whether the Grievors subjective expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable. The Grievors, by failing to turn off the computer and by leaving the log open on a public workplace computer, diminished a reasonable expectation of privacy (A.F., at para. 117). Second, the arbitrators analysis of the biological core concept was consistent with relevant jurisprudence; she found that the log was far from the Grievors biographical core, and then weighed that factor in the balance (A.F., at para. 120). Third, the Court of Appeal erred by failing to consider workplace issues and context in its assessment, and instead viewed the series of events through its own narrow and incorrect view of an employers legitimate interests (A.F., para. 128).\nElementary Teachers Federation of Ontario\nThe respondent Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario submits that the Grievors rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated, and that the arbitrator erred in four respects: . . . (1) she failed to take a content neutral approach to assessing the privacy interest in the log; (2) she misconstrued the very concept of the biographical core; (3) she misapplied the concept of plain view; (4) she failed to address [the second Grievor, Ms. Rais,] distinct privacy interest in the log (R.F., at paras. 160-85).\nThe respondent argues that the standard of review for the application of the Charter to the Board is correctness for both constitutional questions, namely whether the Charter applies to the principals conduct and whether that conduct violated s. 8. Additionally, the respondent submits that the standard of review for the arbitrators award itself is reasonableness (R.F., at para. 42). \nThe respondent submits that the Charter applies to the Board, as Ontario public school boards are inherently governmental. The criteria laid out by La Forest J. in Godbout v. Longueuil (City), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844, at para. 51, which led him to conclude that municipalities are inherently governmental, are also met when considering school boards (R.F., at paras. 73-74). In the alternative, if the boards are not inherently governmental, then the Board was engaged in governmental action and thus comes within the second branch of Eldridge (R.F., at para. 107). \nFinally, the respondent submits that s. 8 of the Charter was breached. The principal lacked the necessary grounds to conduct the search of the log, and the impact of the search outweighed the principals interest in conducting it. The respondent notes that the jurisprudence of this Court, i.e., M. (M.R.) and Cole, pertaining to searches of schools, is not entirely applicable outside the criminal law context and that this Court must construe the scope of the search powers under s. 265 of the Education Act, as informed by the second step of the Collins framework (R.F., at paras. 115-48; R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 26). \nAnalysis\nStandard of Review\nThe correctness standard applies to the determination of whether the Charter applies to school boards pursuant to s. 32(1) of the Charter as this is a constitutional question that requires a final and determinate answer by the courts (Vavilov, at para. 55), one that will apply generally and is not dependent on the particular circumstances of the case.\nThe correctness standard also applies to review the arbitrators decision. I would quash the award because the arbitrator erred in failing to appreciate that a Charter right arose from the facts before her. The issue of constitutionality on judicial review  of whether a Charter right arises, the scope of its protection, and the appropriate framework of analysis  is a constitutional questio[n] that requires a final and determinate answer from the courts (Vavilov, at paras. 53 and 55). \nThe determination of constitutionality calls on the court to exercise its unique role as the interpreter and guardian of the Constitution. Courts must provide the last word on the issue because the delimitation of the scope of constitutional guarantees that Canadians enjoy cannot vary depending on how the state has chosen to delegate and wield its power (Law Society of British Columbia v. Trinity Western University, 2018 SCC 32, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 293, at para. 116, per McLachlin C.J.). The presumptive standard of reasonableness is, thus, rebutted and correctness applies.\nVavilov does not restrict the scope of constitutional questions to only issues of federalism and the constitutional delegation of state power to administrative decision-makers (A.F., at para. 57; see also I.F., Attorney General of Canada, at para. 17). Notably, Vavilov used non-exhaustive language in articulating the constitutional questions category, including within it other constitutional matters (para. 55 (emphasis added)). This category should not be unduly narrowed.\nPost-Vavilov, there is a developing line of jurisprudence to support the application of correctness review in this context (Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Ferrier, 2019 ONCA 1025, 148 O.R. (3d) 705, at para. 35; Societe des casinos du Quebec inc. v. Association des cadres de la Societe des casinos du Quebec, 2024 SCC 13, at para. 92; and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Canada (Parole Board), 2023 FCA 166, 429 C.C.C. (3d) 69, at paras. 32-33). Academics have similarly interpreted that the scope of constitutional rights demand[s] a uniform answer and is therefore reviewable on the correctness standard (P. Daly, Big Bang Theory: Vavilovs New Framework for Substantive Review, in C. M. Flood and P. Daly, eds., Administrative Law in Context (4th ed. 2022), 327, at p. 347; P. Daly, A Culture of Justification: Vavilov and the Future of Administrative Law (2023), at pp. 141 and 161-62; M. Mancini, The Conceptual Gap Between Dore and Vavilov (2020), 43 Dal. L.J. 793, at pp. 824-26. \nI would also like to clarify that while the Court of Appeal for Ontario applied a correctness standard to examine whether the teachers had a reasonable expectation of privacy (C.A. reasons, at para. 37), the court, respectfully, erred in deriving the standard of review from this Courts decision in Shepherd, at para. 20, dealing with an appellate standard of review. As this Court held in Mouvement laique quebecois v. Saguenay (City), 2015 SCC 16, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 38, where a court reviews a decision of an administrative tribunal, the standard of review must be determined on the basis of administrative law principles. Vavilov governs this appeal. Correctness applies because the question of constitutionality on this appeal falls within the rule of law exception.\nOntario public school teachers are protected from unreasonable search and seizure in their place of employment under s. 8 of the Charter. Despite their apparent functional resemblance, a right to a reasonable expectation of privacy that is entrenched in the Constitution is distinct in source and nature from an arbitral right to privacy. For one, state actors cannot disavow their constitutional obligations no matter the terms of the collective agreement. At its core, the arbitrators reasons disclosed a fundamental error because she had the wrong right in mind. The arbitrator ought to have applied the Charter, but failed to do so. Once she failed to appreciate the constitutional dimension of the searches conducted by the principal, there was no intelligible way for her to continue the analysis while fully engaging with the gravity of the alleged violations of the Charter right at issue. Courts cannot dilute the sacrosanct nature of Charter rights by accepting a different substitute. Nor can courts supplant the reasons proffered by the decision-maker and read the reasons as if it applied a Charter right when in fact it applied a different right (Vavilov, at para. 96).\n The arbitrator failed to recognize that the teachers s. 8 Charter right applied. I disagree with my colleagues that the standard of reasonableness applies to review the arbitrators reasons (Karakatsanis and Martin JJ.s reasons, at para. 112). This appeal can and should be disposed of because of this fatal error.\nIn Vavilov, this Court held that:\nIn our view, respect for the rule of law requires courts to apply the standard of correctness for certain types of legal questions: constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies. The application of the correctness standard for such questions respects the unique role of the judiciary in interpreting the Constitution and ensures that courts are able to provide the last word on questions for which the rule of law requires consistency and for which a final and determinate answer is necessary: Dunsmuir [v. New Brunswick, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190], at para. 58. [Emphasis added; para. 53.]\nIn light of the above, the appropriate standard of review in this case is correctness. \nThe Charter Applies to Ontario Public School Boards Under the First Branch of Eldridge\nSection 32 of the Constitution Act, 1982, sets out the scope of the Charters application:\n32 (1) This Charter applies\n\n(a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and\n\n(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\nIn this regard, the landmark ruling is Eldridge, in which this Court established a two-branch framework:\nFirst, it may be determined that the entity is itself government for the purposes of s. 32. This involves an inquiry into whether the entity whose actions have given rise to the alleged Charter breach can, either by its very nature or in virtue of the degree of governmental control exercised over it, properly be characterized as government within the meaning of s. 32(1). In such cases, all of the activities of the entity will be subject to the Charter, regardless of whether the activity in which it is engaged could, if performed by a non-governmental actor, correctly be described as private. Second, an entity may be found to attract Charter scrutiny with respect to a particular activity that can be ascribed to government. This demands an investigation not into the nature of the entity whose activity is impugned but rather into the nature of the activity itself. In such cases, in other words, one must scrutinize the quality of the act at issue, rather than the quality of the actor. [para. 44]\nUntil now, this Court has made no definitive statement as to whether the Charter applies to school boards. While this Court has assumed that the Charter applies to school boards (see Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys, 2006 SCC 6, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 256), it has done so without addressing the Eldridge framework, save as noted below.\nIn Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36, 2002 SCC 86, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 710, Gonthier J., dissenting (Bastarache J. concurring), examined this issue, which the majority found unnecessary to consider, at length. He held that there was no doubt that a school board was subject to the Charter under the first branch of Eldridge (para. 121). Subsequent to Chamberlain, this Court has accepted the Crowns concession in cases before it that the Charter applies to the actions of school officials and proceeded on that basis (see Cole, at para. 38).\nLower courts have analyzed whether the Charter applies to school boards, and have drawn different conclusions. Some have followed Gonthier J.s reasons in Chamberlain and applied the Charter to school boards (see British Columbia Public School Employers Assn. v. B.C.T.F., 2005 BCCA 393, 257 D.L.R. (4th) 385; and Gillies (Litigation Guardian of) v. Toronto District School Board, 2015 ONSC 1038, 125 O.R. (3d) 17). Others have distinguished Gonthier J.s reasons and held that the Charter does not apply to school boards (see Calgary Roman Catholic Separate School District No. 1 v. OMalley, 2007 ABQB 574, 81 Alta. L.R. (4th) 261; and Hamilton v. Rocky View School Division No. 41, 2009 ABQB 225, 192 C.R.R. (2d) 22).\nThe time has come to determine whether the Charter applies to Ontario public school boards and, if so, whether they come under the first or second branch of Eldridge. This is a constitutional question that requires a final and determinate answer from the courts, thus a standard of correctness applies, as per Vavilov (para. 55).\nUnder the first branch of the Eldridge framework, it may be determined that the entity is itself government for the purposes of s. 32 (para. 44). This is so where, by (1) its very nature or (2) the degree of governmental control exercised over it (Eldridge, at para. 44), the entity is akin to a government. Under this branch, where the entity is found to be government, the Charter applies to all its actions. This includes those that would otherwise be described as private, were they carried out by a non-governmental actor.\nA review of the Education Act confirms that Ontario public school boards are government by nature. The section of the Act entitled Purpose highlights the role that school boards play in the education system; s. 8 of the Act provides for extensive powers of the Minister of Education with respect to boards. Ontario public school boards are, in effect, an arm of government, in that they exercise powers conferred on them by provincial legislatures, powers and functions which they would otherwise have to perform themselves (Chamberlain, at para. 121, quoting Godbout, at para. 51).\n In Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students  British Columbia Component, 2009 SCC 31, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 295, at paras. 15-16, the Court further clarified that governmental action as part of a public function may be sufficient to bring that activity within the purview of government and attract Charter scrutiny (UAlberta Pro-Life v. Governors of the University of Alberta, 2020 ABCA 1, 98 Alta. L.R. (6th) 252, at para. 128). The Alberta Court of Appeal, for example, has described Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority as a starting point for applying Eldridge as follows: . . . the test for s 32 resides in the analysis in Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority and rests on the ability to identify an area of government policy and objectives that the [entity] can be said to be implementing for the state more broadly and not just for internal . . . objectives (UAlberta Pro-Life, at para. 139). \nPublic education is inherently a governmental function. It has a unique constitutional quality, as exemplified by s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and by s. 23 of the Charter. Ontario public school boards are manifestations of government and, thus, they are subject to the Charter under Eldridges first branch.\nOntario public school boards do not fit under the second branch of Eldridge. They are not private entities carrying out a governmental activity. All actions carried on by Ontario public school boards are subject to Charter scrutiny, including the principals actions, in this case, as he acted in his official capacity as an agent of the Board, a statutory delegate, and not in his personal capacity (Gillies, at para. 40). \nThe purpose of the Eldridge framework is to interpret s. 32(1) so as to ensure that the federal and provincial governments do not evade their constitutional responsibilities under the Charter by delegating governmental functions to non-governmental entities, for example private enterprises (para. 40).\nThe analysis above relates specifically to Ontario public school boards. I leave for another day the question of the applicability of the Charter to public schools in other provinces, or to the operation of private schools.\nThe Arbitrator Erred by Applying the Wrong Analytical Framework\nWhen the Charter was proclaimed in 1982, its relationship with administrative tribunals was, in Abella J.s formulation, a tabula rasa (R. v. Conway, 2010 SCC 22, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 765, at para. 3). I rely on Conway for the proposition that administrative tribunals  and therefore, the arbitrator in this particular instance  are competent to and tasked with the work of adjudicating Charter questions where they arise.\nIt was determined in Conway that there was no need to bifurcate proceedings where a Charter question arose (para. 22). Further, the principles governing remedial jurisdiction apply in both arenas: there was not a Charter for the courts and another for administrative tribunals (para. 20, citing Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, at para. 70, per McLachlin J., dissenting). \nIn determining whether to attribute Charter jurisdiction to a tribunal, this Court must ask itself whether the tribunal has the power to decide questions of law (Conway, at para. 22). If so, it can determine Charter questions. The arbitrator in this case meets that criteria, as it is broadly empowered to answer questions regarding all differences between the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration or alleged violation of the agreement, including any question as to whether a matter is arbitrable (Labour Relations Act, 1995, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sched. A, s. 48(1)). \nFurther, administrative tribunals with the power to decide questions of law, and from whom constitutional jurisdiction has not been clearly withdrawn:\nhave the authority to resolve constitutional questions that are linked to matters properly before them; and\nmust act consistently with the Charter and its values when exercising its statutory function (Conway, at para. 78).\nThe principles governing remedial jurisdiction under the Charter apply to both courts and administrative tribunals. Tribunals should play a primary role in the determination of Charter issues falling within their specialized jurisdiction (i.e., where the essential factual character of the matter falls within the tribunals specialized statutory jurisdiction). In exercising their statutory discretion, tribunals must comply with the Charter (Conway, at paras. 20-21 and 78-81).\nThis is, in part, an access to justice issue. There are practical advantages and a constitutional basis for allowing Canadians to assert their Charter rights in the most accessible forum available (Conway, at para. 79). Charter rights can be effectively vindicated through the exercise of statutory powers and processes, meaning that claimants do not need to have separate recourse to the courts for their Charter rights to be vindicated (Conway, at para. 103). \nWhere a Charter right applies, an administrative decision-maker should perform an analysis that is consistent with the relevant Charter provision. Administrative tribunals are empowered  and, for the effective administration of justice, called upon  to conduct an analysis consistent with the Charter where a claimants constitutional rights apply (Conway, at paras. 78-81; R. v. Bird, 2019 SCC 7, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 409, at para. 52). It was therefore incumbent on the arbitrator to proactively address the s. 8 issue that manifested itself on the facts of the grievance. It is insufficient to revert to a separate well developed arbitral common law privacy right framework, or to another framework, as the arbitrator did in this instance (A.F., at para. 13). As I have explained, the Charter and relevant s. 8 jurisprudence were legal constraints that applied to the arbitrators decision (Vavilov, at para. 101). In other words, the arbitrator was required to decide the grievance consistent with the requirements of s. 8. This would properly entail drawing on both the relevant body of arbitral decisions and the s. 8 jurisprudence. \nThe arbitrator approached her task differently. She conducted an analysis by reference to management rights versus the privacy interests of employees. However, arbitrators cannot disregard the Charters requirements where it applies by applying another analytical framework, even by consent.\nThat said, s. 8 engages a highly contextual analysis, in that it contains internal limits. To give effect to these internal limits, arbitrators can properly have regard to the employment context, including the collective agreement. But they still must conduct an analysis consistent with s. 8.\nThe appellant and my colleagues suggest that while the arbitrator did not say that she was doing a s. 8 analysis, that is what, in effect, she did. This is not persuasive. First and foremost, under the Vavilov framework, I am required to have regard to the justification for the decision actually given by the decision-maker, and not the justification that the decision-maker might have, but did not, provide. When a Charter right applies, it is not sufficient that the arbitrator made some references to the Charter jurisprudence. Any administrative action must, as a matter of course, always comply with the Constitution (Vavilov, at para. 56). However, when a Charter right applies, there must be clear acknowledgment of and analysis of that right. While I recognize that administrative justice may not always take the form of judicial justice, nowhere in the arbitrators reasons, read functionally and holistically, did she indicate that she was considering the Grievors s. 8 Charter right. This is so because she failed to appreciate that s. 8 right was directly at stake and instead proceeded to conduct her analysis entirely within the arbitral framework and examined the Grievors privacy right solely through the common law lens. This error is fatal. In addition to applying the wrong framework, the arbitrators error was compounded by her misapprehension of the content neutral approach, the concept of the biographical core and the doctrine of plain view under s. 8 jurisprudence, as observed by the dissenting judge of the Divisional Court as well as the Court of Appeal. In sum, the arbitrator did not do what, as a matter of law, she was required to do, that is to apply the s. 8 Charter right.\nHaving concluded that the arbitrators decision erred in law, the proper remedy is to set aside the arbitrators decision and to send the matter back for consideration by the arbitrator. However, as the matter is now moot, I would simply set aside the arbitrators decision and leave matters there.\nThat said, this Court has received extensive submissions regarding s. 8 and the privacy of school employees more broadly. As well, this was dealt with at length by the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. In light of this and of the practical utility of providing general guidance on such matters, I set out the following in obiter.\nPublic School Teachers Have a Section 8 Charter Right Against Unreasonable Search and Seizure in the Workplace\nAs noted, Ontario public school boards are government for the purpose of s. 32 of the Charter; thus, school board employees, including teachers, enjoy rights under s. 8 of the Charter against unreasonable search and seizure in the workplace. This Court has recognized s. 8 Charter protection beyond the criminal and quasi-criminal context (see R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 627 (s. 8 applies to production of documents under the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)); Comite paritaire de lindustrie de la chemise v. Potash, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 406 (s. 8 applies to labour inspections under provincial legislation)).\nThis Courts criminal decisions, such as in R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, and particularly in the school context, such as in Cole, can assist in determining the existence and scope of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the employment context. However, courts should be cautious in adapting the s. 8 framework from the criminal law context to the employment context. The criminal law context cannot readily be analogized to the context surrounding a principal performing their tasks in accordance with their statutorily mandated role of maintaining order in a school. Criminal law thresholds  and considerations related to exigency and law enforcement objectives  should not be the starting point for analysis in the employment context. Rather, in that context, the employers operational realities, policies and procedures can be relevant in determining the reasonableness of an employees expectation of privacy (Cole, at para. 54). \nCriminal law jurisprudence should not be indiscriminately imported into non-criminal matters. The analysis under s. 8, being contextual, needs to be adapted to occupational realities. For instance, this Court has eschewed the requirement of prior authorization by a warrant to conduct searches of students by a school authority. In M. (M.R.), Cory J., for the majority, reasoned that such a criminal law requirement was not feasible in this context because school administrators must be able to respond quickly and effectively to problems that arise in their school (para. 45). \nIn adapting the analysis to the workplace, for example, I agree with the Attorney General of Ontario that workplaces vary in terms of the level of regulation and that the consequences for discipline in the employment context are less severe as compared to penal liability in the criminal context (see I.F., at paras. 19-23).\nDetermining the Reasonable Expectation of Privacy\nWhether in criminal or other contexts, s. 8 analysis proceeds in two steps: courts must determine, first, whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and, second, whether the search and seizure is reasonable (R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at para. 18, citing R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, at p. 293).\nWhether or not state action has interfered with a reasonable expectation of privacy is to be determined based on the totality of the circumstances. This is dispositive of both the existence and the extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy. Four lines of inquiry serve as a guide:\nan examination of the subject matter of the search;\n\na determination as to whether the claimant had a direct interest in the subject matter;\n\nan inquiry into whether the claimant had a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter; and\n\nan assessment as to whether this subjective expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable \n\n(Tessling, at paras. 31-32; R. v. Gomboc, 2010 SCC 55, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 211, at paras. 18 and 78; Cole, at para. 40; R. v. Patrick, 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 27).\nInevitably, the reasonable expectation of privacy takes its colour from context. Thus, the employers operational realities, policies and procedures may affect the reasonableness of an employees expectation of privacy (Cole, at para. 54). For example, in Cole, this Court recognized that the storing of personal information on a computer owned by the employer and the existence of a policy stating that data so stored belongs to the employer would tend to diminish the reasonable expectation of privacy (para. 52). On the other hand, permitting employees to use work laptops for personal purposes would weigh in favour of the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy (para. 54). \nDetermining the Reasonableness of a Search\nIn the criminal context, a search or seizure is reasonable if (1) it is authorized by law; (2) the law itself is reasonable; and (3) the manner in which the search or seizure was carried out is reasonable (Collins, at p. 278). Similar to the first step of a s. 8 analysis, the Collins framework also calls for a contextual assessment. [Searches that] may be reasonable in the regulatory or civil context may not be reasonable in a criminal or quasi-criminal context (Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425, at pp. 495-96 (per Wilson J., dissenting)). In M. (M.R.), this Court implicitly adapted the Collins test to determine whether a search conducted by a teacher or principal in the school environment was reasonable (para. 54).\nI hasten to add that what may be considered proportionate in a criminal context, where penal liability is at stake, may look different in a labour relations context where the consequence, albeit serious, does not threaten liberty. In evaluating the reasonableness of the impugned search at the second step of a s. 8 analysis, arbitrators should have regard to employment relations under the terms of the collective agreements. The existing arbitral jurisprudence on the balancing of interests, including the consideration of management rights under the terms of the collective agreement, may properly inform the balanced analysis. There exists a considerable body of arbitral decisions regarding privacy in the context of collective agreements that arbitrators may properly have regard to in conducting a s. 8 analysis (see, e.g., Doman Forest Products Ltd. and I.W.A., Loc. 1-357, Re (1990), 13 L.A.C. (4th) 275 (B.C.); Toronto Transit Commission and A.T.U., Loc. 113 (Belsito) (Re) (1999), 95 L.A.C. (4th) 402 (Ont.)). \nThe effect of this decision is not to displace existing arbitral jurisprudence, but rather to ensure that it respects Charter rights. Arbitral jurisprudence now encompasses a considerable body of decisions that reflect a great breadth of experience; this will continue to play an important role in resolving grievances arising under collective agreements. However, such decisions should also be taken in accordance with the direction in Conway to analyze Charter rights when they apply. This must inform their decision as to the grievance under the collective agreement.\nConclusion\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs. There is no need to return the matter for further arbitral consideration, as the issue of the reprimand is moot. \n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tKarakatsanis and Martin JJ.  \nIntroduction \nWe agree with the parties and Rowe J. that the issue of whether the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to Ontario public school boards is one that must be correctly determined by this Court. We further agree that under the first branch of Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 624, the Charter applies to Ontario public school boards and all their activities (para. 44). However, we do not agree with how our colleague reviews the arbitrators decision. \nThe arbitrator was asked to determine whether the privacy rights of two teachers (the Grievors) were violated and, as a result, whether the collective agreement was breached. The Grievors sought remedies under their collective agreement; no Charter remedies were sought. This Courts s. 8 Charter jurisprudence was specifically argued by the parties, and the arbitrators reasons clearly demonstrate she appreciated that the s. 8 privacy framework applied and constrained her decision. The issue in this appeal is whether she used that framework reasonably in the circumstances of this case. We conclude, like Sachs J., in dissent at the Divisional Court, that the arbitrators reasoning is not consistent with the principle of content neutrality, which lies at the heart of s. 8s normative approach to privacy, and therefore her decision is unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the appeal.  \nStandard of Review and Proper Analytical Framework \nOur colleague faults the arbitrator for applying the wrong analytical framework and failing to appreciate that a Charter right arose from the facts before her (paras. 63, 68-69, 85 and 94-95). Relying on the constitutional questions exception to the presumption of reasonableness review from Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, he explains that the issue of constitutionality on judicial review  of whether a Charter right arises, the scope of its protection, and the appropriate framework of analysis, is a constitutional question requiring a single, determinate answer from this Court (para. 63). Accordingly, he concludes the correctness standard applies to the review of the arbitrators decision because she did not appreciate that the Charter applied to the decision she was tasked to make. \nWe do not agree with this broad statement of the constitutional questions exception or the characterization of the inquiry at the heart of this appeal. Clearly, whether or not teachers have a privacy right in their workplace is an issue that deserves to be correctly determined for all. We agree that they do. \nWhile we also agree with our colleague that any analysis had to be consistent with the Charter framework, the arbitrators reasons demonstrate she was reviewing the challenged conduct using the s. 8 Charter framework as a touchstone. However, focusing on whether the arbitrator asked the right question and reviewing the arbitrators decision on the correctness standard overshoots the ambit of the correctness exceptions laid down in Vavilov. The issue before the arbitrator was whether the Grievors privacy rights had been breached  an application and assessment which heavily depended on the specific factual and statutory context. As a result, the presumption of reasonableness review applies.\nThe Arbitrator Recognized That Section 8 of the Charter Constrained Her Decision \nThe case was argued before the arbitrator as a labour grievance, with the parties focusing on the facts of the case and on whether the appellant Boards investigation, which led to discipline, breached the collective agreement. The arbitrator was tasked with determining whether the Grievors privacy rights were violated and, as part of that inquiry, she recognized that the Charter and s. 8 jurisprudence were relevant constraints.\nThe arbitrator understood that administrative decision-makers must act consistently with the Charter and its values when exercising statutory functions (R. v. Conway, 2010 SCC 22, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 765, at para. 78; R. v. Bird, 2019 SCC 7, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 409, at para. 52). This Courts jurisprudence recognizes that Charter rights can be effectively vindicated through the exercise of statutory powers and processes (Conway, at para. 103; see also para. 5; Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at pp. 1077-78, adopted in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, at p. 875; Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at paras. 53-56).\nConsistency with s. 8 of the Charter, however, looks different in different contexts (see generally N. Hasan et al., Search and Seizure (2021), at pp. 294-97; R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 627, at pp. 644-46; Comite paritaire de lindustrie de la chemise v. Potash, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 406, at pp. 445-47; R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at pp. 224-27, per Cory J.; see also 2022 ONCA 476, 340 L.A.C. (4th) 365, at paras. 3 and 42). While the s. 8 principles governing administrative powers of search and seizure may be analytically distinct from their operation in criminal investigations, the Charter and the s. 8 jurisprudence were legal constraints bearing on the grievance within the meaning of Vavilov, at para. 105.\nVavilov instructs that administrative decisions are to be considered functionally  with an eye to substance, not form. Administrative decisions must be read as a whole and in light of the institutional context and history of the proceedings (paras. 91, 94 and 99). Administrators cannot always be expected to deploy the same array of legal techniques that might be expected of a lawyer or judge, and this reality impacts the form and content of reasons (para. 92). That the reasons given for a decision do not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred is not on its own a basis to set the decision aside (para. 91, quoting Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses Union v. Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 2011 SCC 62, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 708, at para. 16). In sum, reviewing courts must remain cognizant of the fact that [a]dministrative justice will not always look like judicial justice (para. 92).  \nReading the arbitrators decision as a whole as Vavilov instructs, and with sensitivity to the institutional and procedural context in which it was made, she plainly understood that the Charter arose and s. 8 jurisprudence bore on the grievance. Both the Board and the respondent Union relied on s. 8 case law before her (see arbitrators reasons: (2018), 294 L.A.C. (4th) 341, at paras. 171 and 179). As the Union notes, the arbitrator cited s. 8 case law and expressly recognized that this case law was applying s. 8 of the Charter (see C.A. reasons, at para. 36; see also R.F., at paras. 31-33). The arbitrator engaged with the concepts of reasonable expectation of privacy, diminished reasonable expectation of privacy, plain view, and biographical core. \nThus, we cannot agree that the decision must be quashed because the arbitrator did not expressly state that s. 8 of the Charter applied or because she conducted her analysis without regard to the legal framework under s. 8 (Rowe J.s reasons, at paras. 5, 69 and 94). That conclusion seizes on form, contrary to Vavilovs teachings. In our view, the arbitrator directed herself to the relevant legal constraints on her decision making.\nNo Basis To Depart From the Presumption of Reasonableness Review \nVavilov was intended to provide a stable framework for determining and applying the standard of review and to encourage parties to focus instead on the merits (para. 69; see also Mason v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21, at para. 7). This Court affirmed a broad presumption of reasonableness review and discouraged reviewing courts from parsing sub-issues and assigning them different standards of review by articulating a limited number of exceptions where correctness review is warranted (Vavilov, at paras. 23, 33-64 and 69).\nCorrectness exceptions from Vavilov based on the rule of law are united by the need for courts to provide the last word on questions for which the rule of law requires consistency and for which a final and determinate answer is necessary (Vavilov, at para. 53; see also P. Daly, Big Bang Theory: Vavilovs New Framework for Substantive Review, in C. M. Flood and P. Daly, eds., Administrative Law in Context (4th ed. 2022), 327, at pp. 346-47). Within this category, the correctness exception for constitutional questions is similarly justified by the need for consistency, finality, and determinate answers:\nQuestions regarding the division of powers between Parliament and the provinces, the relationship between the legislature and the other branches of the state, the scope of Aboriginal and treaty rights under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and other constitutional matters require a final and determinate answer from the courts. Therefore, the standard of correctness must continue to be applied in reviewing such questions. [Emphasis added; citations omitted.] \n\n(Vavilov, at para. 55)\nImportantly, Vavilov was equally clear that constitutional matters not requiring courts to supply final and determinate answers fall outside the exception to the presumption of reasonableness review. Pre-Vavilov jurisprudence did not support correctness review for all cases involving the Charter, and that remains true today. This Court in Vavilov expressly drew a distinction between cases in which it is alleged that the effect of the administrative decision being reviewed is to unjustifiably limit rights under the [Charter] and those in which the issue on review is whether a provision of the decision makers enabling statute violates the Charter (para. 57; see also para. 55; Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique, section locale 1108 v. CHU de Quebec  Universite Laval, 2020 QCCA 857, at paras. 29-33 (CanLII)). Only the latter situation requires courts to provide a final and determinate answer and, therefore, correctness review. \nAccordingly, individualized decisions involving the application of the Charter that are intrinsically linked to a specific factual and statutory context will generally not engage the same rule of law concern about potential inconsistency as that which motivated the correctness exception for constitutional questions in Vavilov. As Professor Daly explains, variations between individualized decisions about the appropriate application of the Charter in a particular regulatory setting do not compromise the integrity of the legal system: different balances may perfectly legitimately be struck in different areas of regulation between individual rights and the public interest (p. 347). This explanation reflects the conceptual underpinnings of reasonableness review, with its overall policy of deference and the recognition that courts do not possess a monopoly over the adjudication of Charter-related issues in the administrative context. Administrative decision-makers are empowered and required to consider the Charter in exercising their statutory functions (Conway, at para. 78).\nDetermining the engagement and scope of Charter rights will sometimes entail a highly context specific exercise, which this case exemplifies. Not only will a search in an employment setting differ from a search executed by police officers in the course of a criminal investigation, the questions the arbitrator had to answer were heavily interconnected and dependent on the particular factual and statutory context (see I.F., Attorney General of Canada, at para. 20). For instance, did the principal interfere with the Grievors reasonable expectation of privacy such that a search within the meaning of s. 8 occurred? Was the search reasonable in that it was authorized by law and conducted reasonably? In answering these questions, the arbitrator had to consider workplace realities in an educational setting, the interpretation of the Education Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2, and the authority it confers to conduct workplace searches in schools, and the reasonableness of the principals exercise of authority at a particular place and time. Deference should be afforded to the arbitrators understanding of this critical, case-specific context, one in which there is no pressing need for judicially imposed uniformity (see P. Daly, Unresolved Issues after Vavilov (2022), 85 Sask. L. Rev. 89, at pp. 106-7). \nIn our view, the cases cited by our colleague, at para. 66, are distinguishable from the circumstances of this appeal and do not support correctness review for how administrators should assess a Charter right in a particular factual context. \nIn our view, Societe des casinos du Quebec inc. v. Association des cadres de la Societe des casinos du Quebec, 2024 SCC 13, is not analogous to this case. It involved a Charter challenge to the constitutionality of a statutory provision. We do not read this case as purporting to erase the important distinction this Court drew in Vavilov between the constitutionality of a statute and an administrative decisions effect on Charter rights. \nOur colleague also relies on Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Ferrier, 2019 ONCA 1025, 148 O.R. (3d) 705, and a case citing it. Ferrier was not considered by this Court on an appeal, and we make no comment on its conclusions. We accept that administrative decisions affecting Charter rights can involve a question requiring a final and determinate answer within the meaning of Vavilov (para. 55). As we have said, we agree that the issue of whether the Charter applies to Ontario public school boards must be answered correctly. Respectfully, we do not think that the principle requiring correctness for constitutional matters governs review of whether the privacy right was infringed in these circumstances.\nNor do we accept that the cases referred to by the majority qualify as a line of developing authority that requires correctness review for whether a Charter right arises on the facts or for questions about the scope of a Charter right. Such an approach introduces uncertainty on what it means for a Charter right to be engaged, appl[y] to, or aris[e] from the facts (Rowe J.s reasons, at paras. 63 and 69). It undercuts Vavilovs careful recalibration of the standard of review framework, which makes plain that not all cases of constitutional interpretation require correctness review. Under Vavilovs terms, questions about the engagement and scope of a Charter right will only sometimes require a final and determinate answer. As we have explained, the arbitrators decision and interpretive exercise were highly fact-specific, depended on a particular statutory context, and concerned the application of legal principles to the particular grievance presented. \nIn sum, while we agree that whether the Charter applies to Ontario public school boards at all would be a constitutional issue attracting the correctness standard, in our view, our colleagues articulation of the breadth of the constitutional questions category does not align with Vavilovs limited exceptions to reasonableness review. The issue in this case is one of application: Were the Grievors privacy rights breached in the context of the specific searches in issue? As a result, there is no basis to rebut Vavilovs presumption that reasonableness review governs this appeal.  \nReasonableness Review of the Arbitrators Decision \nReviewing the arbitrators reasons, we conclude that the decision is not reasonable in light of the constraints bearing on it. The arbitrator relied on the specific contents of the Grievors log in calibrating the privacy interest engaged and in determining the reasonableness of the search. This reasoning is inconsistent with the broad and content-neutral approach required by the normative nature of the s. 8 framework. \nThe Arbitrators Reasons  \nBefore the arbitrator, the Union submitted that the Grievors had an expectation of privacy in the log, which was violated in three separate ways. The Board submitted there was no privacy violation because there was no expectation of privacy engaged in the circumstances and, in any event, the principal had reasonable cause for the investigation and the search was reasonable. \nThe arbitrator identified that the issue in dispute was whether the Grievors privacy rights were violated by the search. She further identified that, in order to establish a privacy violation, it must first be established that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy engaged in the circumstances. \nThe arbitrator reviewed the entirety of the evidence, which consisted of will-say statements and affidavits, as well as some cross-examination evidence, and she analyzed the expectation of privacy asserted by the Union. Then, she set out the legal principles that animate s. 8 and arbitral jurisprudence, to the extent of their consistency (see, e.g., para. 259), before applying those principles to the circumstances before her. Dismissing the grievance, the arbitrator found that there had been no breach of the Grievors reasonable expectation of privacy. \nFirst, the arbitrator agreed with the Union that the Grievors had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances. She identified the subject matter of the search (the log), and she concluded that the Grievors had a direct interest and subjective expectation of privacy in that subject matter. As for objective reasonableness, the arbitrator reviewed the totality of the circumstances  control over the log, the place of the search, the private nature of the logs content, ownership of the laptop, and the applicable policies in place in the school environment (paras. 199, 202-3 and 208-14). This led her to conclude that the Grievors had a reasonable expectation of privacy but that this expectation of privacy was diminished because one of the Grievors had left the log open on the laptop in the classroom. \nTurning to the asserted violations, the arbitrator reviewed the principals conduct in touching the mousepad of the laptop, scrolling through the log, and taking screenshots of the logs content. She considered the specific administrative action taken by the principal and the general school context in which the challenged action was taken. She identified the interest furthered by the search  cooperation and the maintenance of order in the school environment  and concluded that the search was authorized by law under s. 265 of the Education Act (paras. 224, 230 and 247). \nThe arbitrator then assessed the reasonableness of the search, focusing on what was known to the principal at the time. Much of her assessment was trained on the principals investigation into the alleged workplace misconduct in the school setting, in light of the Education Act objectives he was furthering through the search. The arbitrator examined the contents of the log, noting that it did not reveal personal or intimate information. In particular, she found the log had a judgmental quality, and she concluded that it did not reveal personal or intimate information about either of [the Grievors] (para. 246). Consequently, the arbitrator concluded that it was not close enough to their biographical core (at paras. 246-47), the search itself was reasonable, and, therefore, there was no breach of the Grievors privacy.\nThe Arbitrators Decision Was Unreasonable \nThe parties raise several issues relating to the arbitrators privacy analysis. Read functionally, much of the arbitrators reasoning is sound. She was sensitive to the application of s. 8 in the administrative context before her, and she reasonably distinguished the leading authorities. The arbitrator identified R. v. M. (M.R.), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 393, and said it was similar to this case in the sense that the search under review was authorized by s. 265 of the Education Act. But she distinguished M. (M.R.) on the basis that, in that case, the search furthered a criminal investigation, which implicates different s. 8 concerns. She identified similarities and distinctions between this case and R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, which, like M. (M.R.), also involved a search by school officials and a related criminal investigation. \nA key issue discussed by the courts below was the arbitrators treatment of the contents of the log (C.A. reasons, at paras. 53-57 and 69-70; 2020 ONSC 3685, 316 L.A.C. (4th) 1, at paras. 90-99 and 147-53). The respondent Union asserts that the arbitrator examined the Grievors privacy interest in the log based on what it revealed and then concluded that what was revealed lay far from the Grievors biographical core (arbitrators reasons, at paras. 245-47). This reasoning is incompatible with the demands of content neutrality, a principle which animates the s. 8 framework. The appellant Board says there was no such error. \nWe agree with the Union. While administrative and regulatory investigations may engage different interests from criminal investigations and may therefore import a different constitutional calculus than their criminal law analogues (Hasan et al., at p. 294), the principle of content neutrality lies at the heart of the normative nature of privacy. \nUnder the body of law that constrained the arbitrators decision, the actual contents of the Grievors log could not reasonably be relevant to the question she was required to answer. The s. 8 jurisprudence makes clear that the assessment of the Grievors reasonable expectation of privacy did not depend on what the log actually contained (see Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 160; R. v. Wong, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, at pp. 49-50; R. v. Marakah, 2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, at paras. 31-32; R. v. Patrick, 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 32). Rather, as the Court of Appeal accurately identified, what mattered was the potential for the search to reveal information touching on the Grievors biographical core. \nIn order for s. 8 to fulfill its promise of being preventative, it must be approached in broad and neutral terms. As this Court stated in Cole, the information contained on Internet-connected devices, normatively, tends to reveal ones specific interests, likes, and propensities, and as such it is at the very heart of the biographical core protected by s. 8 (paras. 47-48, quoting R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at para. 105; see also R. v. Reeves, 2018 SCC 56, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 531, at paras. 33-34). The arbitrators conclusion to the contrary  that the log was insufficiently close to the Grievors biographical core  is untenable in light of this proposition. The arbitrators reasoning on this point was not reasonably reflective of privacys normative aspirations.  \nIt is not necessary to consider the other issues raised by the parties or identified by the Court of Appeal, whose analysis employed the standard of correctness, to conclude that the decision was unreasonable. We are satisfied that the arbitrators reliance on the contents of the log is central and significant, rendering the decision as a whole unreasonable (Vavilov, at para. 100). \nConclusion \nAs the dissenting judge at the Divisional Court recognized, this case should not be remitted for further arbitral proceedings given that the events took place almost 10 years ago, there have been significant proceedings to date, and remitting in these circumstances raises concerns about the efficient use of public resources (see Vavilov, at para. 142). The Union sought clarity on whether teachers had s. 8 privacy rights in the workplace; and they seek dismissal of the appeal. As a result, the Union has this Courts reasons that s. 8 of the Charter applies to Ontario public school boards and the Court of Appeals determination that there was a breach of the Grievors privacy rights.\nFor these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Hicks Morley Hamilton Stewart Storie, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Goldblatt Partners, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada: Department of Justice Canada  British Columbia Regional Office, Vancouver; Department of Justice Canada  Ontario Regional Office, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario  Constitutional Law Branch, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Ministere de la Justice du Quebec  Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, Quebec.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association: Olthuis van Ert, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Teachers Federation: British Columbia Teachers Federation, Vancouver; Michael Sobkin Barrister & Solicitor, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Centre for Free Expression: Ryder Wright Holmes Bryden Nam, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Ontario College of Teachers: McCarthy Tetrault, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Power Workers Union and the Society of United Professionals: Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto; Wright Henry, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the National Police Federation: Nelligan OBrien Payne, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Ontario Principals Council: Jones Pearce, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Counsel to Employers: Baker & McKenzie, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Egale Canada: Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Calgary; Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Toronto; Egale Canada, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights: Ursel Philips Fellows Hopkinson, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Stockwoods, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener Centrale des syndicats du Quebec: Barabe Morin  Les services juridiques de la CSQ, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Queens Prison Law Clinic: Jared Will & Associates, Toronto.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the arbitrator's decision, holding that Ontario public school boards are subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that teachers have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the workplace.\n\nThis appeal concerns the application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to Ontario public school boards, specifically whether teachers have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their workplace under section 8 of the Charter.\n\nTwo teachers, Ms. Shen and Ms. Rai, employed by the York Region District School Board in Ontario, recorded their private communications regarding workplace concerns on a shared, password-protected electronic log.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules  that Ontario public school board teachers are protected from unreasonable  search and seizure in the workplace under the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms.</strong>This appeal dealt with the  question of whether the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms </em>(the <em>Charter</em>)  applies to Ontario public school boards. Two teachers employed  by an Ontario public school board recorded their private communications  regarding workplace concerns on a shared personal, password-protected log stored  in the cloud. The school principal, who had been made aware of the log, entered the  classroom of one of the teachers to return some teaching materials after  classes had ended. The teacher was not present. The principal noticed that the Board laptop used by the teacher  was open and touched its mousepad. He saw the log that opened on the screen,  read what was visible, then scrolled through the document and took screenshots  with his cellphone. These communications then formed the basis for the school  board to issue written reprimands. \u00a0 The teachers\u2019 union filed a  grievance against the written reprimands issued to the teachers, claiming that  the search violated the teachers\u2019 right to privacy at work. They did not allege  any breach of the <em>Charter</em>. A labour  arbitrator, appointed pursuant to the collective agreement, dismissed the  grievance. The arbitrator found there was no breach of the teachers\u2019 reasonable  expectation of privacy when balanced against the school board\u2019s interest in  managing the workplace.The teachers\u2019 union asked the Divisional  Court to review the arbitrator\u2019s decision. A majority of the Divisional Court held  that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was reasonable. It said that the school  principal\u2019s search did not raise any <em>Charter </em>issues because, unlike in a criminal context, an employee does not have the  right under section of the <em>Charter</em> to  be secure against unreasonable search or seizure in a workplace environment. The teachers\u2019 union appealed to  the Ontario Court of Appeal, which unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed  the arbitrator\u2019s decision. It held that the majority of the Divisional Court made  a mistake in concluding that section 8 of the <em>Charter</em> did not apply. The Court of Appeal held that  school boards are subject to the <em>Charter</em> and that the school principal\u2019s search was unreasonable under section 8. The school  board then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The  Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.<strong>The <em>Charter </em>applies to Ontario public  school boards. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe said Ontario public school board teachers are protected by section 8 of  the <em>Charter</em> in the workplace, as  these boards are inherently governmental for the purposes of section 32 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 32 identifies certain  entities that are bound by the <em>Charter</em>,  including federal and provincial legislatures and governments, as well as  entities that are controlled by a government or that perform governmental  functions. Consequently, the grievance at issue implicated an alleged violation  of a <em>Charter </em>right, and section 8 of  the<em> Charter</em> was a legal constraint  bearing on the arbitrator\u2019s analysis. On review, applying the correctness  standard, the arbitrator erred by limiting her inquiry to the arbitral  framework without regard for the legal framework under section that, as a  matter of law, she was required to respect. This error was fatal and the  arbitrator\u2019s decision should be set aside. For these reasons, Justice Rowe dismissed  the appeal. "

They brought a motion for a stay of proceedings based in part on abusive state conduct related to the laying of the charges. Because the persons informer status was at the centre of the relevant factual framework and the parties arguments, the judge dealing with the motion ordered that it be heard in camera. No notice was given to the media, since the judge was of the view that revealing anything about the motion, including its existence, would be likely to compromise the persons anonymity. The motion, its content and the exhibits and transcripts submitted to the judge remained confidential and were not listed in any docket. The motion was dismissed in a written judgment, which had no file number and was not public.\n\tThe person was subsequently convicted and appealed the conviction. The appeal was heard in camera, and no notice was given to the media. The Court of Appeal allowed the persons appeal, stayed the conviction and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of abuse of process by the state. The Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a version of its judgment in which the following information was redacted: the persons name; the identity of the court and the judge who heard the motion; the judicial district in which the proceeding was held; the identity of the prosecutor, counsel for the prosecution on appeal and counsel for the person; the identity of the police force and the police officers involved; the nature of the crime with which the person was charged and the circumstances of its commission. In that judgment, the Court of Appeal denounced the holding of a secret trial, which alarmed the public and the media. It also expressed its disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for the persons trial.\n\tA number of media organizations, the Attorney General of Quebec and the Chief Judge of the Court of Quebec then asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in the persons case. In a second judgment, the Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all information that might tend to identify the person. In its view, there was no possibility of disclosing any information that might tend to identify the person, at the risk of endangering them  it was therefore not possible to reveal their personal information, the nature, dates and circumstances of the offences with which they were charged, and the identity of the judge, the trial court, the judicial district, the prosecutor and counsel for the prosecution, counsel for the person and the police force involved. The Court of Appeal also refused to partially unseal the appeal record by redacting the same information as in the public version of its judgment. The media organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec appealed that second judgment to the Court.\n\tHeld: The appeals should be allowed in part.\n\tNo secret trial was held in this case. The magnitude of the controversy that arose after the Court of Appeals first judgment was released could have been limited if that court had not used the expression secret trial to describe what were actually in camera hearings held in a proceeding that began and initially moved forward publicly. When a court proceeds in camera, it is important that it rigorously apply the guiding rule from Named Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 253, requiring it to protect informer privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open court principle. In this case, the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the motions for disclosure of the information that had been kept confidential up to that time, but it erred in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. The case is remanded to the Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction.\n\tUnder the open court principle, every person, as a general rule, has the right to access the courts, to attend hearings, to consult court records and to report on their content. Court openness supports an administration of justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and all of its participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity. Because of the fundamental importance of court openness, confidentiality orders limiting it can be made by the courts only in rare circumstances. These exceptions are predicated on the idea that openness cannot prevail if the ends of justice, or the interests that openness is meant to protect, would be better served in some other way.\n\tOne of these exceptions is informer privilege, which is a rule that protects from revelation in public or in court of the identity of those who give information related to criminal matters in confidence. The privilege is not limited simply to the informers name, but rather extends to any information that might lead to identification. It applies whenever it is established that the police have received information under a promise of confidentiality, whether implicit or explicit. Informer privilege is non-discretionary. Once informer status is established, courts are not permitted to weigh the maintenance or scope of the privilege on a case-by-case basis in light of the circumstances of the case and competing legitimate interests, such as the level of risk faced by the informer, the pursuit of truth or the preservation of public confidence in the administration of justice. Recognition of the non-discretionary and thus virtually absolute nature of informer privilege means that the interests protected by the open court principle yield to those protected by the privilege. The social justification for this privilege is found in the need to ensure performance of the policing function and maintenance of law and order. The ban on revealing the informers identity has dual objectives: to protect the informer from possible retribution and to encourage other people to cooperate with the police in the future by sending them a signal that their identity too will be protected.\n\tIn Vancouver Sun, the Court addressed the relationship between the openness of court proceedings and informer privilege. It proposed a procedure to be applied when informer privilege is claimed, a procedure that is both flexible and malleable. This procedure has a single guiding rule: giving full effect to the requirements of this extremely broad and powerful privilege, under which a complete and total bar on any disclosure of the informers identity applies, while limiting, as much as possible, any impairment of the open court principle. The procedure is divided into two stages. First, the court must verify the existence of the privilege. At this stage, evidence that a person is a police informer automatically engages the privilege. This is a rule of public order. Second, having established the existence of informer privilege, the judge is charged with carrying on the proceedings without violating the privilege while at the same time accommodating, to the greatest extent possible, the open court principle, the right to be heard and the adversarial nature of the proceedings. It is at this stage that the court will determine the appropriate measures to protect the privilege. For the purposes of this determination, it may be helpful  and even generally desirable  for the court to allow third parties to make submissions on the confidentiality orders that would be appropriate to protect the informers anonymity while limiting any impairment of the open court principle. In lieu of or in addition to submissions from interested third parties, the court may consider it advisable to appoint an amicus curiae to provide it with guidance on the matter.\n\tIn order for a police informers anonymity to be protected, it is necessary and desirable that judges have the discretion to determine whether it is in the interests of justice to issue a notice to interested third parties advising them that the privilege has been claimed and that confidentiality orders are being contemplated. The existence of a discretion to issue a notice provides the court with the flexibility needed to ensure that, in each case, justice is served by adopting a procedure that is as consistent as possible with court openness without risking a breach of informer privilege. Well-settled jurisprudence unequivocally recognizes the importance of preserving this discretion, and there is no reason to depart from these precedents.\n\tNor is there any reason to depart from the current state of the law, under which as much information as possible should be disclosed to interested third parties, but never any information that might compromise the police informers anonymity. It is not appropriate for information directly identifying the informer to be protected differently than information that is seemingly innocuous but may indirectly identify the informer. The disclosure of such privileged information to interested third parties or their representatives, even subject to undertakings of confidentiality, would unduly expand the circle of privilege, thus undermining the dual objectives of the informer privilege rule.\n\tWhere an informer is on trial, the informer asserts their status in a proceeding that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose their status, and the informer-police relationship is central to the proceedings, the appropriate way to protect the informers anonymity will generally be to proceed totally in camera. But even in these most confidential of cases, it is possible and even essential to protect the informers anonymity while still favouring confidentiality orders that do not entirely or indefinitely conceal the existence of the in camera hearing and of any decision rendered as a result. This may require some creativity and perhaps some administrative arrangements, but at least one approach can be taken. This approach involves creating a parallel proceeding that is completely separate from the public proceeding in which informer privilege is initially invoked. The record for the parallel proceeding thereby created, though sealed, will have its own record number. Subject to the redaction of information that might tend to reveal the informers identity, it will generally be possible for the proceeding to be on the courts docket and hearing roll and for a public judgment to be released. This solution makes it possible to disclose at least a minimum amount of information to interested third parties, including the news media, that wish to file a motion for review of the confidentiality orders.\n\tIn this case, first of all, the person was not convicted following a secret criminal proceeding. The criminal proceeding against the person began and moved forward publicly until they filed a motion for a stay of proceedings. The Court of Appeal should not have used the expression secret trial, which could have suggested that the person had been convicted following a secret criminal proceeding. In addition to being inaccurate, this expression is needlessly alarming and has no basis in Canadian law. The very concept of secret trial does not exist in Canada, and any comparison of hearings held totally in camera to a secret trial is wrong.\n\tNext, having confirmed the persons informer status, the judge hearing the motion for a stay of proceedings correctly found that it had to be heard in camera, and his discretionary decision not to give notice to interested third parties was justified. However, there was no need for the motion for a stay of proceedings to be left off the courts docket and hearing roll and for no formal number to be assigned to it. In retrospect, after finding that it was necessary to proceed in camera, the trial judge should have made an order to that effect while creating a parallel proceeding completely separate from the criminal proceeding in which the person had been appearing publicly until that time. Subject to the redaction of information that might link the parallel proceeding to the public proceeding and thus reveal the persons identity, the new proceeding thereby created could have been on the courts docket and hearing roll, and a redacted version of the judgment on the motion could have been released. As for the Court of Appeal, it had no choice but to redact its judgments as heavily as it did. However, it erred in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. It should have made public a version of the trial judgment that was redacted in such a way as to protect the persons anonymity. This was an entirely feasible undertaking that would have accommodated the open court principle and given a certain materiality to the confidential proceedings in issue.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Named Person v.

The open court principle allows a society to guard against such risks, which erode the very foundations of democracy. By ensuring the accountability of the judiciary, court openness supports an administration of justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and its participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity. Court openness is therefore of paramount importance to our democracy  an importance that is also reflected in the constitutional protection afforded to it in Canada.\nIn this context, it is therefore hardly surprising that this case concerning Named Person, a police informer who, according to the Court of Appeal, was convicted following a secret trial, has provoked both concern and indignation among the public. The very idea that secret trials  that is, criminal proceedings of which no trace exists  may be conducted in our liberal democracy is indeed an intolerable one. Such proceedings go against the democratic ideals that Canadians hold dear.\nThe controversy, which arose after the Court of Appeal released a judgment in March 2022 in which it misguidedly denounced the holding of a secret trial, was largely due to the gap between what the public knew and what it did not know, combined with the effect of the unfortunate expression used by the Court of Appeal. That expression could in fact have suggested that Named Person had been convicted following a secret criminal proceeding. That state of affairs alarmed the public and the media. It also jeopardized public confidence in the justice system. But to be clear, no secret trial was held in this case. As can be seen from the Court of Appeals second decision in July 2022, the criminal proceeding against Named Person began and moved forward publicly until Named Person filed a motion for a stay of proceedings based in part on the states abusive conduct toward them as a police informer.\nIn fact, the very concept of secret trial does not exist in Canada. This Court has long since delineated how the cardinal principle of court openness may be tempered where the circumstances of a case so require. Various confidentiality orders may be made during the proceeding for certain portions thereof, up to and including an order that all hearings be held in camera, that is, with all members of the public excluded for their entire duration. But it is well established that secret trials, those that leave no trace, are not part of the range of possible measures. In this context, any comparison of hearings held totally in camera to a secret trial is wrong and needlessly alarming.\nThese appeals therefore provide this Court with an opportunity to set the record straight, to reassure the public and to reaffirm the importance of ensuring that justice is administered openly and transparently. First, the appeals allow the Court to reiterate the relevance of the procedure set out in Named Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 253, and its guiding rule that a court must protect informer privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open court principle.\nSecond, the appeals illustrate the excesses that may occur when the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun is not rigorously applied at the stage of conducting in camera proceedings. The appeals highlight the importance of reviewing how this rule should be applied, for the benefit of trial judges who, as in this case, determine that a police informers identity can be protected only by proceeding totally in camera. Indeed, if the principles enunciated by this Court had been rigorously applied by the trial judge in dealing with the motion for a stay of proceedings, he would have created a parallel proceeding separate from the one in which Named Person had invoked informer privilege. This approach would have made the public aware of at least the existence of any in camera hearing held at trial and of any decision rendered as a result. The record for the parallel proceeding thereby created, though sealed, would have had its own number. Moreover, subject to the redaction of information that could link that new record to the proceeding that began publicly, the parallel proceeding could have been on the courts docket and hearing roll, and a redacted public judgment could have been released.\nProcedural and Judicial History\nNamed Person, a police informer, was charged with criminal offences. As their only defence, Named Person brought a motion for a stay of proceedings based both on the infringement of their right to be protected from any abusive state conduct that had the effect of undermining the integrity of the justice system and on the infringement of their right to be tried within a reasonable time.\nA first in camera hearing was held to verify Named Persons status as a police informer. Following that hearing, there was no doubt in the mind of the judge hearing the motion that Named Person had acted as an informer for a police force. Because informer status was at the centre of the relevant factual framework and the parties arguments, the judge ordered that the motion for a stay of proceedings be heard in camera. No notice was given to the media at that time, since the judge was of the view that revealing anything about the motion, including its existence, would be likely to compromise Named Persons anonymity. The motion, its content and the exhibits and transcripts submitted to the judge remained confidential and were not listed in any docket.\nJudgment at Trial Dismissing the Motion for a Stay of Proceedings\nThe motion for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. In the trial judges view, it could not be concluded from the record that the state had acted abusively in laying charges against Named Person or that a stay of proceedings was warranted on the basis of unreasonable delay. That judgment had no file number and, like its existence and content, was not public.\nNamed Person was subsequently convicted. They decided to appeal the conviction on the ground that the trial judge had erred in declining to find that the state had acted abusively in laying charges. Their appeal did not concern the part of the judgment ruling on the infringement of their right to be tried within a reasonable time. Nor did the appeal relate to the existence of informer privilege or to the confidentiality orders made at trial to protect their anonymity.\nJudgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal of March 23, 2022, Entering a Stay of Proceedings for Abuse of Process, 2022 QCCA 406, 424 C.C.C. (3d) 322 (Bich, Vauclair and Healy JJ.A.)\nOn appeal, the parties asked that the proceedings remain in camera. The Court of Appeal agreed to their request while referring the question of whether the proceedings should be made public to the panel that was to hear the merits of the case. The appeal was therefore heard in camera and, as at trial, no notice was given to the media.\nOn February 28, 2022, in a unanimous judgment, the Court of Appeal allowed Named Persons appeal, stayed the conviction and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of abuse of process by the state. The Court of Appeal condemned the [translation] casual approach that had been taken in recruiting Named Person as an informer (para. 148). Specifically, it criticized the police force that had recruited Named Person for not adequately informing Named Person before they began cooperating so that they would understand [translation] the limits of the protection offered [to them] and the possible consequences of [their] anticipated revelations (para. 150). The failure to adequately inform Named Person, including the vagueness surrounding the parameters of their cooperation with the police force, had led Named Person to believe that they [translation] had to admit all of the facts even if this implicated [them] in a crime, that nothing would be held against [them], and that the investigation was not interested in what [they] may have done (para. 146). The court expressed the view that it was [translation] plainly offensive for the state to turn against Named Person and lay charges on the basis of incriminating revelations (at para. 153) after implying to Named Person that they had to be transparent and that [they] would not be prosecuted for past crimes (para. 147). Such state conduct compromised the fairness of the trial and undermined the integrity of the judicial process, in addition to discouraging [translation] persons [from] provid[ing] information to the police (para. 148).\nIt should be noted that this conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal did not concern the question of in camera proceedings  a question that was not before it and that it addressed through preliminary remarks. In those remarks, the Court of Appeal expressed its disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for Named Persons [translation] trial (para. 11). It found that, as important as informer privilege may be, it cannot justify holding a trial of which [translation] no trace . . . exists, except in the memories of the individuals involved (para. 11). In the courts view, [translation] this manner of proceeding was exaggerated and contrary to the fundamental principles governing our legal system (para. 14). A procedure that is [translation] [so] secretive . . . is absolutely contrary to modern criminal law that respects the constitutional rights not only of the accused, but also of the media. It is also inconsistent with the values of a liberal democracy (para. 15). Although the protection of informer privilege is of fundamental importance in our society, the fact remains that [translation] the trial itself must be public, subject to specific non-publication orders or partial in camera orders (para. 16). For this reason, the Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a redacted version of its judgment of February 28, 2022.\nConsequently, on March 23, 2022, after consulting the prosecutor and Named Person, the Court of Appeal released a version of its judgment in which the following information was redacted: Named Persons name; the identity of the trial court and judge; the judicial district in which the proceeding was held; the identity of the prosecutor, counsel for the prosecution on appeal and counsel for Named Person; the identity of the police force and the police officers involved; the nature of the crime with which Named Person was charged and the circumstances of its commission. The nature of the redacted information was, however, indicated in brackets following each redacted passage.\nThat decision, and more specifically the [translation] [p]reliminary remarks on the secret trial, did not go unnoticed (para. 6). The public understood them as revealing the conduct of a secret criminal proceeding that had led to Named Persons conviction. The idea that criminal proceedings of which no trace exists may be conducted in our democracy was inevitably met with shock and widespread incomprehension.\nThat was the context in which, in early April 2022, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, La Presse inc., Cooperative nationale de linformation independante (CN2i), Canadian Press Enterprises Inc., MediaQMI inc., Groupe TVA inc. (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al.) and the Attorney General of Quebec (AGQ) (collectively referred to as appellants), along with the intervener the Honourable Lucie Rondeau, then Chief Judge of the Court of Quebec, asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in Named Persons case by both the trial court and the Court of Appeal. More specifically, they requested that the orders be lifted in whole or in part or at least that limited access be given to the information that remained confidential.\nJudgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal of July 20, 2022, Dismissing the Motions for Review of the Confidentiality Orders, 2022 QCCA 984 (Bich, Vauclair and Healy JJ.A.)\nOn July 20, 2022, in a carefully crafted judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed the motions brought by the appellants and the intervener Rondeau for review of the confidentiality orders and upheld the sealing of all information that might tend to identify Named Person. This is the judgment under appeal, on which this Court must rule.\nFirst, the Court of Appeal considered and denied the appellants requests to set aside or vary the confidentiality orders it had itself made. The court began by noting that it was [translation] indisputable that Named Person was a police informer and was entitled to the privilege attaching to that status (at para. 103 (CanLII)), something that the appellants and the intervener Rondeau did not contest. This meant that there was no possibility [translation] of disclosing any information that might tend to identify Named Person, at the risk of endangering them, including any information that would make it possible for the people informed on by Named Person, their accomplices and associates or other members of the circle to which Named Person belonged or still belongs to identify them (paras. 104-5). Therefore, while it was obviously not possible to reveal Named Persons personal information (e.g., name, gender, address, employment, city of residence), it was also impermissible in this case to reveal [translation] the nature, dates and circumstances of the offences with which Named Person was charged, because that information could compromise informer privilege (para. 106). In the courts view, the same was true  as unusual as this may have seemed  of the identity of the judge, the trial court, the judicial district, the prosecutor and counsel for the prosecution, counsel for Named Person and the police force involved. The reason for this was that, given the information known to the public about this case, these details, together or separately, might tend to identify Named Person.\nThe Court of Appeal also rejected the alternative argument that it should have partially unsealed the appeal record by redacting the same information as in the public version of the judgment of March 23, 2022. It viewed such partial unsealing as a task that was [translation] impracticable in light of the duty to preserve informer privilege (para. 139). Even though [translation] the record is not very lengthy, this partial unsealing would require a particularly careful and keen eye so as not to overlook details that might be revelatory (para. 139). Given the complexity, sensitivity and high risk of error involved in such redaction, the Court of Appeal concluded that undertaking it was not appropriate.\nSecond, the Court of Appeal considered the requests to set aside the confidentiality orders made by the trial court and denied them on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to set the orders aside. It explained that a court of appeal, unlike a superior court, has no inherent jurisdiction and that, as this Court held in Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Manitoba, 2021 SCC 33 (C.B.C. v. Manitoba), while a court of appeal can manage access to its records and review its own confidentiality orders, it cannot review orders made by another court unless they are before it on appeal, because [translation] [i]t has no sovereign or inherent power in this regard (para. 144). The Court of Appeal added that [translation] the fact that, in its judgment on the appeal, [a court of appeal] criticized the manner of proceeding at trial (without being asked to rule on this question, which emerged on its own) does not mean that it acquired jurisdiction to correct or vary the trial judges orders (para. 144). Finally, the court concluded, the fact that this situation put the appellants [translation] in a position where it was impossible to act could not give the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to review the confidentiality orders made by the trial court (para. 146). This aspect of the Court of Appeals analysis, which concerned its lack of jurisdiction to set aside the confidentiality orders made by the trial court, is not being appealed by the parties.\nIt is important to note here that, in this second decision, the Court of Appeal implicitly recognized that it had been wrong in using the expression secret trial in its preliminary remarks and that the expression had caused undue concern among the public. Although it did not explain why, it ceased referring to the erroneous concept of secret trial, which had alarmed the public because it could reasonably suggest that Named Person had been convicted following a secret proceeding. The Court of Appeal not only took care to avoid using the expression secret trial but now also clearly linked the in camera proceedings ordered without notice to the media, as well as the other confidentiality measures taken at trial, to the motion for a stay of proceedings.\nIssues\nThe appeals raise the following questions:\nShould the procedure set out in Vancouver Sun be modified to make it more consistent with the open court principle?\nHow is the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun to be applied when proceeding in camera?\nDid the Court of Appeal err in refusing to vary or set aside its confidentiality orders?\nWe are of the view that the procedure proposed in Vancouver Sun should not be modified. In addition to departing from well-settled jurisprudence, the changes proposed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. are not necessary or even desirable.\nFurthermore, we are of the view that the application of the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun  whereby full effect must be given to the requirements of informer privilege, which is broad and powerful, while minimizing any impairment of the open court principle  will necessarily ensure that, at a minimum, the existence of an in camera hearing and of any judgment rendered as a result will be made public. To this end, and in accordance with the circumstances of each case, it may be necessary to create a parallel proceeding that is completely separate from the public proceeding in which informer privilege is initially invoked. The record for the parallel proceeding thereby created, though sealed, will then have its own record number. Moreover, subject to the redaction of information that might tend to reveal the informers identity, it will generally be possible for the proceeding to be on the courts docket and hearing roll and for a public judgment to be released. This is how the case before us should have moved forward at trial.\nLastly, we are of the view that the Court of Appeal, in its redacted reasons, did not shield non-confidential information from public view. The combination of circumstances in this case meant that the Court of Appeal had no choice but to redact its reasons as heavily as it did. That being said, the Court of Appeal erred in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. It should have made a redacted version of the trial judgment public.\nAnalysis\nIt will be helpful to begin the analysis by reviewing the importance of the open court principle and the rules surrounding informer privilege.\nCourt Openness: A Pillar of Our Free and Democratic Society\nThis Court has repeatedly affirmed that the open court principle, which is protected by the constitutionally entrenched right of freedom of expression, is a pillar of our free and democratic society (Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 75, at paras. 1 and 30; C.B.C. v. Manitoba, at para. 78; Endean v. British Columbia, 2016 SCC 42, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 162, at paras. 66 and 84; Vancouver Sun (Re), 2004 SCC 43, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 332, at paras. 23-26; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480 (C.B.C. v. N.B.), at para. 23).\nThe open court principle has two aspects: first, the public nature of hearings and court records, and second, the right to report on court proceedings. Under this principle, every person, as a general rule, has the right to access the courts, to attend hearings, to consult court records and to report on their content (see Sherman, at paras. 1-2; Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, at pp. 1338-40; S. Menetrey, Levolution des fondements de la publicite des procedures judiciaires internes et son impact sur certaines procedures arbitrales internationales (2008), 40 Ottawa L. Rev. 117, at p. 120, quoting A. Popovici, Rapport sur le secret et la procedure en droit canadien, in Travaux de lAssociation Henri Capitant, vol. 25, Le secret et le droit (Journees Libanaises) (1974), 735, at p. 742).\nCoupled with the existence of free, robust and independent news media, the open court principle performs a number of important social and democratic functions. Among other things, it allows for informed debates and conversations in civil society about the courts and their workings, which helps ensure the accountability of the judiciary. As a result, this principle promotes both judicial independence and an administration of justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. Open justice also facilitates the publics understanding of the administration of justice and enhances public confidence in the integrity of the justice system and all of its participants (see Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. MacIntyre, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 175, at pp. 183 and 185; Edmonton Journal, at pp. 1337-40; C.B.C. v. N.B., at para. 23; Vancouver Sun (Re), at paras. 23-25; Vancouver Sun, at para. 32; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 2, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 19 (C.B.C. v. Canada), at para. 28; Denis v. Cote, 2019 SCC 44, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 482, at para. 45; Menetrey, at pp. 124-27).\nBailey and Burkell eloquently describe some of the important functions of open and transparent justice, including in maintaining the legitimacy of the justice system:\n\tThe very legitimacy of the legal system depends on public acceptance of process and outcome, and the open court system promotes this acceptance by ensuring the accountability of the justice system. . . .\n\t. . .\n\tIt is not just judges who are presumably held to account by the open court principle. The principle is also said to support positive results with respect to other justice system players and functions outside of the courtroom, including police officers and warrants. The openness of trials has been held to be an expression of the judges confidence that what happens in the courtroom is beyond reproach. Transparency in the processes of justice is not only thought to act as a powerful disinfectant for exposing and remedying abuses; by acting in public view, the courts can demonstrate that fair trials (rather than show trials where conviction is a foregone conclusion) are still happening.\n\tThe open court principle, therefore, can clearly be understood to be a means of assuring the public accountability of the court system and its key actors, particularly judges. [Footnotes omitted.]\n\t(J. Bailey and J. Burkell, Revisiting the Open Court Principle in an Era of Online Publication: Questioning Presumptive Public Access to Parties and Witnesses Personal Information (2016), 48 Ottawa L. Rev. 143, at pp. 152-53)\nTheir comments clearly underscore how court openness helps to maintain and enhance public confidence in, and serves in a way as a guarantee of, the integrity of the justice system, including all of its participants (C.B.C. v. Canada, at para. 28).\nWhen it comes to the social and democratic functions of the open court principle, the key role played by the news media cannot be overemphasized. Indeed, without free, robust and independent news media to inform the Canadian public of what is happening in courtrooms, and in the justice system more broadly, open justice is of only limited social and democratic utility. The reason for this is that, in the vast majority of cases, it is the media that serve as the eyes and ears of a wider public which would be absolutely entitled to attend [proceedings under way] but for purely practical reasons cannot do so (Sherman, at para. 30, quoting Khuja v. Times Newspapers Ltd., [2017] UKSC 49, [2019] A.C. 161, at para. 16; see also Edmonton Journal, at pp. 1339-40). As Cory J. wrote in Edmonton Journal, [i]t is only through the press that most individuals can really learn of what is transpiring in the courts (p. 1340). It is only the presence of free, robust and independent news media that actually enables the public to understand and form an opinion on the justice system, to hold it accountable and to have confidence in it (see Edmonton Journal, at p. 1340, quoted in C.B.C. v. N.B., at para. 23).\nBecause of the fundamental importance of court openness, confidentiality orders limiting it can be made by the courts only in rare circumstances. These exceptions, which may be either statutory or judicial in nature, are predicated on the idea that openness cannot prevail if the ends of justice, or the interests that openness is meant to protect, would be better served in some other way (see Scott v. Scott, [1913] A.C. 417 (H.L.); MacIntyre; Edmonton Journal; C.B.C. v. N.B.; see also Menetrey, at p. 126). One of these exceptions is informer privilege, which is the one in question in this case.\nInformer Privilege\nInformer privilege is a judicially created rule of public policy designed to further the ends of law enforcement (R. W. Hubbard and K. Doherty, The Law of Privilege in Canada (loose-leaf), at  2:22). It is a rule . . . which protects from revelation in public or in court of the identity of those who give information related to criminal matters in confidence (Vancouver Sun, at para. 16). It applies whenever it is established that the police have received information under a promise of confidentiality, whether implicit or explicit (R. v. Brassington, 2018 SCC 37, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 616, at para. 34; R. v. Named Person B, 2013 SCC 9, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 405, at paras. 1-4 and 18, quoting R. v. Barros, 2011 SCC 51, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 368, at para. 31).\nIt will be helpful to briefly explain (1) the rationale for this privilege, (2) how it forms an exception to the open court principle and (3) its broad scope.\nRationale for Informer Privilege\nThis Court has had many occasions to emphasize the crucial role played by informer privilege in furthering the effectiveness of criminal investigations, the maintenance of public order and the protection of the public. For example, in R. v. Durham Regional Crime Stoppers Inc., 2017 SCC 45, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 157, Moldaver J. eloquently explained the rationale for informer privilege and the reason why it ultimately serves the public interest:\n\tAs with all privileges, informer privilege is granted in the public interest. Informers pass on useful information to the police which may otherwise be difficult or even impossible to obtain. They thus play a critical role in the investigation of crime and the apprehension of criminals. The police and the criminal justice system rely on informers  and society as a whole benefits from their assistance: see R. v. Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281, at para. 9; R. v. Barros, 2011 SCC 51, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 368, at para. 30. In fulfilling this important role, informers often face the risk of retribution from those involved in criminal activity: Leipert, at para. 9. Accordingly, informer privilege was developed to protect the identity of citizens who provide information to law enforcement: ibid. By protecting those who assist the police in this manner  and encouraging others to do the same  the privilege furthers the interests of justice and the maintenance of public order: see R. v. Hiscock (1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 303 (Que. C.A.), at p. 328, leave to appeal refused, [1993] 1 S.C.R. vi. [Emphasis added; para. 12.]\n\t(See also Brassington, at para. 35.)\nSimilarly, in Vancouver Sun, LeBel J., dissenting but not on this point, aptly noted that the social justification for this privilege [is] found in the need to ensure performance of the policing function and maintenance of law and order and that this protection is ultimately granted not in the interest of the informer, but in the interest of more effective law enforcement (para. 111, citing R. v. Hiscock (1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 303 (Que. C.A.), and quoted in Durham, at para. 12).\nThe Interests Protected by the Open Court Principle Yield to Those Protected by Informer Privilege\nInformer privilege is of such importance that it has repeatedly been characterized as absolute or near absolute. This characterization can be explained by the fact that the privilege is non-discretionary, in the sense that its recognition does not depend on any balancing of interests. This means that once informer status is established, courts are not permitted to weigh the maintenance or scope of the privilege on a case-by-case basis in light of the circumstances of the case and competing legitimate interests, such as the level of risk faced by the informer, the pursuit of truth or the preservation of public confidence in the administration of justice (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 4, 22, 26 and 55; R. v. Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281, at paras. 12 and 14; R. v. Basi, 2009 SCC 52, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 389, at paras. 22 and 37; R. v. National Post, 2010 SCC 16, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 477, at para. 42; Barros, at paras. 1, 30 and 35; Durham, at paras. 1, 11 and 14-15; Brassington, at para. 36; Canada (Transportation Safety Board) v. Carroll-Byrne, 2022 SCC 48, at paras. 6 and 8; J. Fournier, Les privileges en droit de la preuve: un necessaire retour aux sources (2019), 53 R.J.T.U.M. 461, at pp. 489, 491-92 and 495).\nThe informer privilege rule applies in civil, administrative and criminal proceedings and admits but one exception, under the criminal law, in cases where this is necessary to establish innocence in a criminal trial (Vancouver Sun, at para. 27). The exception is a narrow one that is distinct from the broader right of an accused to make full answer and defence (see Basi, at paras. 22, 37 and 43; Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60, at pp. 93 and 107; Barros, at paras. 28 and 34; Durham, at para. 14; Brassington, at para. 36; Vancouver Sun, at para. 26; Hubbard and Doherty, at  2:7 and 2:13).\nThis privilege belongs both to the Crown and to the informer and neither can waive it without the consent of the other (Durham, at para. 11, citing Vancouver Sun, at para. 25). As long as its application has not been validly waived, the police, the Crown and the courts have a duty to keep the identity of informers confidential. These three actors are part of the very limited circle of privilege, which the courts have refused to widen to include, for example, defence counsel or the syndic of the Barreau du Quebec (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 21 and 25-26; Basi, at paras. 44-45; Barros, at para. 37; Bilodeau v. Directeur des poursuites criminelles et penales, 2020 QCCA 1267; D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 334).\nIn the case of the courts, the duty to keep a police informers identity confidential means that they do not have any discretion to disclose . . . information [that might tend to identify the informer] in any proceeding (Vancouver Sun, at para. 30), even where limiting the scope of the privilege in a particular case would allow more complete justice to be done (Bisaillon, at p. 102). The application of the privilege is not subject to any formal requirement, and judges must even ensure respect for it of their own motion (see Bisaillon, at p. 93). Therefore, contrary to the arguments made by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. (A.F., at paras. 68 and 79), the test developed in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, and R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, and reformulated in Sherman is of no assistance, because a judge has no discretion once it is shown that informer privilege applies (Vancouver Sun, at paras. 34-37).\nAs the Court of Appeal correctly pointed out, non-discretionary privileges must [translation] take precedence over any other consideration, even of public order or public interest, with some limited exceptions (2022 QCCA 984, at para. 53). Relying on this Courts decision in National Post (at para. 42) and quoting Beetz J. in Bisaillon (at pp. 97-98), the Court of Appeal then made the following comments, which are worth reproducing:\n\t[translation] It is a privilege that produces its effects without regard to the particulars of the situation (thus without regard to the facts of each case) and without it being necessary to establish harm, which is in fact presumed, or an increase in the risk of harm. Indeed, this is how it differs from privilege recognized on a case-by-case basis, which calls for such a balancing of the interests of those who claim confidentiality and must show that it is necessary against the interests of those who oppose it or seek access to information. As Beetz J. explained in Bisaillon, comparing Crown privilege and informer privilege:\n\tThis procedure, designed to implement Crown privilege, is pointless in the case of secrecy regarding a police informer. In this case, the law gives the Minister, and the Court after him, no power of weighing or evaluating various aspects of the public interest which are in conflict, since it has already resolved the conflict itself. It has decided once and for all, subject to the law being changed, that information regarding police informers identity will be, because of its content, a class of information which it is in the public interest to keep secret, and that this interest will prevail over the need to ensure the highest possible standard of justice. [Bold added; para. 53.]\nIn short, recognition of the non-discretionary and thus virtually absolute nature of informer privilege means that the interests protected by the open court principle yield to those protected by informer privilege. This is a difficult societal choice in the sense that it may, in some circumstances, prevail over other very important public interest objectives  for example, promoting the accountability of the judiciary through open justice, favouring adversarial proceedings and ensuring the pursuit of truth  but it is a choice that is essential in guaranteeing the effectiveness of police investigations, the maintenance of public order and the protection of the Canadian public.\nScope of Informer Privilege\nIt should be emphasized that informer privilege is extremely broad in its application. It applies to the identity of every informer: it applies where the informer is not present, where the informer is present, and even where the informer himself or herself is a witness, and it applies to both documentary evidence and oral testimony (Vancouver Sun, at para. 26). It is not limited simply to the informers name, but rather extends to any information that might lead to identification (para. 26 (emphasis added); see also Leipert, at para. 18; Durham, at para. 11; Brassington, at para. 48).\nIn practical terms, the fact that the privilege covers all information that might lead to the identification of the police informer means that the courts must always be guided by a principle of caution: any information  even the smallest detail  that may lead directly or indirectly to the identification of the informer must be kept confidential (see Leipert, at para. 18; Vancouver Sun, at paras. 26 and 30; Durham, at para. 11; Brassington, at para. 48). Furthermore, the sensitivity of information, in relation to the preservation of the informers anonymity, must be assessed in light of the circumstances of each case, having regard to the perspective of the informers accomplices and the members of the criminal circle to which the informer belongs. This can easily be explained by the dual objectives which underlie the informer privilege rule[: n]ot only does the ban on revealing the informers identity protect that informer from possible retribution, it also sends a signal to potential informers that their identity, too, will be protected (Vancouver Sun, at para. 18).\nThis is of particular importance in the so-called usual scenarios. In the context of a criminal proceeding, the informer is generally not themself an accused but rather a third party who has provided the police with information in order to facilitate their investigation and the gathering of incriminating evidence. The question of informer privilege thus arises indirectly in the proceeding, for example at the stage of Crown disclosure or when a police officer being questioned about what led them to take a certain step invokes this privilege (see Vancouver Sun, at para. 24). In such situations, only the accused incriminated by the tipster may know what details narrow the pool of potential informants, which means that [t]he tiniest and most seemingly innocuous of details could reveal the identity of an informer, and which also provides further justification for the principle of caution based on the perspective of those in the same criminal circle as the informer (Hubbard and Doherty, at  2:6; see also R. v. Omar, 2007 ONCA 117, 218 C.C.C. (3d) 242, at paras. 43-44; R. v. A.B., 2024 ONCA 111, at para. 38 (CanLII)).\nTherefore, all details  even those that would seem the most innocuous to a person outside the police informers network  must be kept confidential to the extent that their disclosure risks jeopardizing the informers safety. In case of doubt, where it is difficult or impossible to identify the information that might compromise the informers anonymity, the principle of caution requires that the information provided by the informer be kept confidential (see Leipert, at para. 32; M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2023 (30th ed. 2023), at paras. 43.36-43.37).\nProcedure Proposed in Vancouver Sun\nIn Vancouver Sun, this Court addressed the relationship between the openness of court proceedings and informer privilege. It proposed a procedure to be applied when informer privilege is claimed, a procedure that is both flexible and malleable. This procedure has a single guiding rule: giving full effect to the requirements of this privilege which is extremely broad and powerful, under which a complete and total bar on any disclosure of the informers identity applies, while limiting, as much as possible, any impairment of the open court principle (para. 30; see also paras. 40-41, 44 and 55).\nThis Court has since applied the procedure in various decisions (see, e.g., Basi; Durham). It is divided into two stages. First, the court must verify the existence of the privilege. For this purpose, it will hold an in camera hearing that, if necessary, will be ex parte (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 46 and 49; Basi, at paras. 41-44; Durham, at paras. 36-37). At this first stage, even the claim of informer privilege must not be disclosed (Vancouver Sun, at para. 47). Generally, only the police informer and the Crown  that is, the holders of the privilege  may attend the hearing (Vancouver Sun, at para. 46; Durham, at para. 35). Exceptionally, the hearing may also be attended by those who are in the circle of privilege, such as a police officer called to testify about the existence of the privilege. In addition, an amicus curiae may be present in those unusual situations in which the judge finds this to be necessary because the non-adversarial nature of the proceeding gives cause for concern (Vancouver Sun, at paras. 47-49; see also Basi, at para. 38; Brassington, at para. 38). This stage requires the greatest caution to be exercised: no third party  which is to say no one outside the circle of privilege  may attend the hearing (Vancouver Sun, at para. 49; see also paras. 46-47; Basi, at para. 44; Durham, at para. 35). The judges responsibility at this stage is to demand from the parties some evidence which satisfies the judge, on balance, that the person is a confidential informer (Vancouver Sun, at para. 47). We emphasize that, at this stage, evidence that a person is a police informer automatically engages the privilege (at para. 47); the judge has no discretion in this regard (Barros, at para. 1). This is a rule of public order (Leipert, at para. 13, quoting Bisaillon, at p. 93).\nAt the second stage, having established the existence of informer privilege, the judge is charged with carrying on the proceedings without violating the privilege while at the same time accommodating, to the greatest extent possible, the open court principle, the right to be heard and the adversarial nature of the proceedings (Vancouver Sun, at paras. 50-51). At this stage, the court will determine the appropriate measures to protect informer privilege. For the purposes of this determination, it may be helpful  and even generally desirable  for the court to allow third parties to make submissions on the confidentiality orders that would be appropriate to protect the informers anonymity while limiting any impairment of the open court principle. In lieu of or in addition to submissions from interested third parties, the court may consider it advisable to appoint an amicus curiae to provide it with guidance on the matter. The reason for opting for this solution is that, in most cases, the court does not have the benefit of adversarial debate on the matter  given that, with some exceptions, it is in the interest of both the Crown and the police informer to argue strenuously in favour of non-disclosure of all the information in issue. Regardless of the approach chosen, the court should, while exercising great vigilance, disclose as much information as possible to the third parties or the amicus curiae to help ensure that that their submissions are helpful. No information, even the smallest detail, that might compromise the informers anonymity can be disclosed to them (paras. 51 and 58).\nIf the court decides to issue a public notice inviting interested third parties to make submissions on confidentiality orders, or if interested third parties learn in some other way that arguments are to be made on confidentiality orders, the judge will then have to hear their submissions in order to determine what confidentiality orders are appropriate. It is at this point that the media is granted standing to present arguments on how informer privilege can be respected with minimal effect on the open court principle (Vancouver Sun, at para. 54; see also para. 56).\nIt should be noted that the appropriate confidentiality orders will vary with the circumstances of each case. As the Court of Appeal pointed out, echoing Bastarache J.s remarks in Vancouver Sun, it will be necessary in some cases to proceed totally or partially in camera and to seal the court record in whole or in part, while in other cases it may be sufficient to protect only a few documents or the informers name, and there is a wide range of situations possible between these two extremes. Everything depends on the unique circumstances of each case  and first and foremost on the nature and extent of the informers participation in the proceeding. If this individual is involved as an informer in a third partys trial, which is the most common scenario, the protection required may vary based, among other things, on whether or not they testify. Similarly, the confidentiality orders needed to protect this individuals anonymity will vary according to whether their role in the proceeding is secondary or whether, on the contrary, the individual and their informer status are at the centre of the case, as here (see Vancouver Sun, at para. 56; 2022 QCCA 984, at para. 65).\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. argue that it is time to modify this second stage of the Vancouver Sun procedure to make it more consistent with the open court principle. In their opinion, the present case and a similar one from British Columbia, the existence of which was kept from the public, reveal the shortcomings of this stage (A.F., at paras. 11, 14 and 78, citing R. v. Bacon, 2020 BCCA 140, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 256). They submit that these cases demonstrate the need to limit or even eliminate the judges discretion and also to ease restrictions on the disclosure of information that might tend to identify a police informer to interested third parties wishing to make submissions on confidentiality orders.\nSpecifically, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. first ask that this Court transform what has so far been the judges discretion to hear interested third parties on confidentiality orders into a duty to do so. They suggest that a duty be imposed on the presiding judge to issue a notice to interested third parties, and principally the media, advising them that informer privilege has been claimed and that arguments will soon be made on the appropriate measures to protect it (A.F., at paras. 76-84). In their opinion, transforming the judges discretion into a duty in this manner is the only way to ensure that a case is never again [translation] removed from the view of the public (para. 14; see also transcript, at pp. 27, 31 and 41-46). In addition, to enable interested third parties to make detailed submissions and to ensure that there is an informed adversarial debate on confidentiality orders, they take the view that all information that does not directly identify the informer should be disclosed to interested third parties, or at least to their counsel, possibly with undertakings of confidentiality given in return. In the alternative, if the disclosure of this information is not possible, they suggest that interested third parties, or only their counsel, be apprised of the nature of the information sought to be shielded from public view and the reason for keeping the information confidential so that they can make arguments in this regard (A.F., at paras. 85, 87-90, 96 and 98).\nWith respect, we disagree. In addition to departing from well-settled jurisprudence, the changes called for are not necessary or even desirable.\nJudges Must Retain the Discretion to Issue a Notice to Interested Third Parties\nSince there are many circumstances in which informer privilege is claimed, it is imperative that judges have the discretion to determine whether it is in the interests of justice to issue a notice to interested third parties advising them that the privilege has been claimed and that arguments will soon be made on the appropriate confidentiality orders (Vancouver Sun, at paras. 52-54). While it can be presumed that issuing a notice will generally be in the interests of justice, it is always possible that doing so will not be appropriate in a particular case, such as where the holder of the privilege is present and plays an active role in court (para. 54).\nIn Vancouver Sun, a majority of this Court considered and rejected the idea that issuing a notice to interested third parties becomes mandatory where the making of confidentiality orders is being contemplated to protect a police informers anonymity. The Court explained that this discretion is justified on the basis that no one has a constitutional right to be informed of all situations in which informer privilege is claimed:\n\tThe decision to post a public notice regarding the existence of the proceeding is a matter of discretion on the part of the judge. In other words, no one has a right, constitutional or otherwise, to be informed of all situations in which informer privilege is claimed. The reason for this is simply practical: there is no real difference  vis-a-vis the open court principle  between a situation in which informer privilege exists and any other situation in which some part of a proceeding takes place in camera  be it a situation of a child sexual assault victim, or a situation involving solicitor-client privilege. It would be unworkable and unreasonable to expect that literally every time an in camera proceeding is taking place, a judge has the obligation to publicize its existence and invite submissions from all comers on whether that proceeding should be held in camera. Nor should a judge choose worthy interveners. [Emphasis added; para. 53.]\nSimilarly, the importance of maintaining discretion in issuing such a notice was recently reiterated by the majority in C.B.C. v. Manitoba in the context of discretionary confidentiality orders:\n\tTo be clear, limits on court openness, such as a publication ban, can be made without prior notice to the media. Given the importance of the open court principle and the role of the media in informing the public about the activities of courts, it may generally be appropriate to give prior notice to the media, in addition to those persons who would be directly affected by the publication ban or sealing order, when seeking a limit on court openness (see Jane Doe v. Manitoba, 2005 MBCA 57, 192 Man. R. (2d) 309, at para. 24; M. (A.) v. Toronto Police Service, 2015 ONSC 5684, 127 O.R. (3d) 382 (Div. Ct.), at para. 6). But whether and when this notice should be given is ultimately a matter within the discretion of the relevant court (Dagenais, at p. 869; M. (A.), at para. 5). I agree with the submissions of the attorneys general of British Columbia and Ontario that the circumstances in which orders limiting court openness are made vary and that courts have the requisite discretionary authority to ensure justice is served in each individual case. [Emphasis added; para. 51.]\nThere is no reason to depart from these precedents. Anecdotal examples of the misapplication of the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun cannot on their own justify altering well-settled jurisprudence, which unequivocally recognizes the importance of preserving the courts discretion to issue a public notice when they are about to make orders limiting court openness. Such cases do not suffice to show that one of our precedents can be overturned either because it is unworkable and undermines one of the purposes of stare decisis (see, e.g., R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at paras. 42-44; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at paras. 18-22; Nishi v. Rascal Trucking Ltd., 2013 SCC 33, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 438, at paras. 24-28; R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at paras. 32 and 38; Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, at pp. 817-18 and 824-25) or because its foundations have been eroded (see, e.g., Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1219, at pp. 1243-46; Hamstra (Guardian ad litem of) v. British Columbia Rugby Union, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1092, at paras. 15-17, 19, 23 and 25).\nFurthermore, we agree with the attorneys general of Canada and Ontario that it is necessary and desirable for the courts to have the discretion to decide whether issuing a notice to interested third parties is in the interests of justice where confidentiality orders are being contemplated to protect a police informers anonymity (I.F., Attorney General of Canada, at paras. 15-18; I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at paras. 18-23). We take this view because one cannot exclude the possibility that a rigid rule would prevent an informers anonymity from being preserved in a particular case. For this reason, the existence of a discretion to issue a notice  rather than an absolute duty to do so  provides the court with the flexibility needed to ensure that, in each case, justice is served by adopting a procedure that is as consistent as possible with the open court principle without risking a breach of informer privilege. Finally, when the court is considering whether it is appropriate to issue a notice to interested third parties, the court must still bear in mind that it is only exceptionally that the best interests of justice will require that no notice be given to the public (see C.B.C. v. Manitoba, at para. 51, citing, among others, M. (A.) v. Toronto Police Service, 2015 ONSC 5684, 127 O.R. (3d) 382 (Div. Ct.), at para. 6).\nThe Disclosure of Privileged Information to Interested Third Parties or Their Representatives Would Unduly Expand the Circle of Privilege\nThis Court is also unable to accept the argument of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. that any information that does not directly identify the informer should be disclosed to interested third parties. The possibility of disclosing such information only to counsel for the interested third parties, subject to certain undertakings of confidentiality, changes nothing in this regard.\nSuch a position ignores the principle reiterated time and again by this Court that all information  even the most innocuous  that might tend to directly or indirectly identify the informer must be kept confidential. If this position were accepted, it would be tantamount to saying that it is appropriate for information directly identifying the informer to be protected differently than information that is seemingly innocuous but may indirectly identify the informer. Yet the creation of such a hierarchy for these two types of information has been rejected in our jurisprudence (see Leipert, at para. 18; Vancouver Sun, at paras. 26 and 30; Durham, at para. 11; Brassington, at para. 48).\nAs Bastarache J. wrote in Vancouver Sun, a judge must be extremely careful when considering what information to disclose to interested third parties wishing to make submissions on confidentiality orders (para. 58). The information disclosed must be limited to non-identifying information . . .; no identifying information can be given to the media under any circumstances (para. 58). The reason is simple: the disclosure of such privileged information, even subject to undertakings of confidentiality, would unduly expand the circle of privilege, thus undermining the dual objectives of the informer privilege rule, that is, protecting the anonymity of present informers and encouraging other people to cooperate with the police in the future (Leipert, at para. 9; Vancouver Sun, at para. 18; Durham, at para. 12; Brassington, at para. 35).\nFurthermore, the position stated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. conflicts not only with this Courts pronouncements in Vancouver Sun but also with those in Basi. In the latter case, the Court held that informer privilege cannot be lifted in favour of defence counsel merely because they are bound by orders and undertakings of confidentiality, even if such disclosure might support an accuseds constitutional right to make full answer and defence (see paras. 42-46; see also Lizotte v. Aviva Insurance Company of Canada, 2016 SCC 52, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 521, at para. 51; Brassington, at paras. 41-46). This principle must, a fortiori, apply to disclosure to interested third parties or their representatives, persons who do not face criminal charges.\nIn short, we are not convinced that there is any reason to depart from the current state of the law, under which as much information as possible should be disclosed to interested third parties, but never any information that might compromise the police informers anonymity. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. may consider this rule imperfect or insufficient, insofar as the submissions made by interested third parties might be even more relevant if they had access to more information, but it is a rule that must be reiterated because it has the advantage of ensuring that the dual objectives underlying the informer privilege rule are achieved while at the same time maximizing the helpfulness of the submissions made by interested third parties.\nLastly, we are also not convinced of the merits of the alternative solution proposed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. They argue that if information that might tend to indirectly identify the informer cannot be disclosed to interested third parties, then these parties should at least be systematically apprised of both the nature of the information sought to be shielded from public view and the concrete reason for not disclosing the information to them so that they can make arguments in this regard. We agree with the Attorney General of Ontario that, in addition to endangering the protection of the informers anonymity, this position seems to overlook the fact that the rationale for confidentiality orders in such cases  to protect informer privilege  leaves no room for a balancing of competing interests (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 34-37; I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at paras. 17 and 22). To be clear, this does not mean that disclosing this information will never be appropriate. However, turning such disclosure into a systematic and inflexible rule might unduly tie the courts hands and, ultimately, limit their ability to render justice in each case.\nReview of How the Guiding Rule From Vancouver Sun Should Be Applied When Proceeding In Camera\nHaving found that the procedure set out in Vancouver Sun should not be modified, we will now explain what the application of the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun requires when proceeding in camera. More specifically, we will review how this rule should be applied in order to ensure that judges in circumstances analogous to those in the present case will adopt a procedure that, while protecting the informers identity, accommodates the open court principle to the greatest extent possible. Before doing so, however, we want to reiterate that Named Person was not convicted following a secret proceeding.\nNamed Person Was Not Convicted Following a Secret Proceeding\nThe redacted reasons released by the Court of Appeal on March 23, 2022, in which it criticized the fact that there was no trace of Named Persons trial (at para. 11), led the public to believe that Named Person had been convicted following a secret criminal proceeding, the existence of which would have been concealed indefinitely from the public had it not been for the appeal to the Court of Appeal. Public concern and indignation were further fuelled by the use of the erroneous expression secret trial, which was repeated by the news media in a great many articles and stories.\nHowever, nothing of the sort occurred. Named Person was not convicted following a secret criminal proceeding. This fact is implicit in the Court of Appeals reasons of July 20, 2022, in which it backtracked and not only took care to avoid using the expression secret trial but now also clearly linked the in camera proceedings without notice to the media, as well as the other confidentiality measures, to the motion for a stay of proceedings (see paras. 18-19, 126, 131 and 136). It can also be inferred from the application of the Vancouver Sun procedure at trial. Under this procedure, the claim to informer status is made in a proceeding that begins publicly through the filing of a criminal prosecution and that then generally moves forward publicly (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 6 and 46). This remains true even in rare and unusual cases like the one before us where the accused is prosecuted for crimes that do not cause them to lose their informer status, and in respect of which they provided information to a police force. One reason for this is that the Crown, in fulfilling its absolute duty to keep the accuseds informer status confidential, cannot presume when it initiates criminal proceedings against the accused that the accused will agree to reveal their informer status to their counsel and will raise a defence related to that status (see Hubbard and Doherty, at  2:22).\nThe proceeding against Named Person therefore began publicly through the filing of a criminal prosecution. It moved forward publicly until Named Person decided to bring a motion for a stay of proceedings based on the states abusive conduct toward them as a police informer. The proceeding then continued in accordance with the two-stage procedure set out in Vancouver Sun. First, as he was required to do, the judge held an in camera hearing to verify Named Persons status as an informer (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 46-47 and 49). Second, having confirmed Named Persons informer status, the judge correctly found that the motion for a stay of proceedings had to be heard in camera, given that Named Persons status as a police informer was central to the parties arguments and the evidence adduced in support of the motion (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 55-56). At this second stage, the judge decided that it was not appropriate to give notice to interested third parties  a discretionary decision that was his to make and that was justified in this case (see Vancouver Sun, at para. 54).\nAt all times, the judge and the justice system participants involved acted with honesty, integrity and a sincere desire to protect Named Persons anonymity. However, when it came to proceeding in camera, the judge mistakenly thought that the only approach to be taken in the unusual circumstances of this case was to completely conceal the existence of any in camera hearing related to Named Persons status as a police informer and of any decision rendered as a result. Yet there was no need for the motion for a stay of proceedings to be left off the courts docket and hearing roll and for no formal number to be assigned to it. There was a procedure that would have better accommodated the open court principle and been equally respectful of informer privilege. We will explain this procedure in the next section.\nHow the Guiding Rule From Vancouver Sun Should Be Applied\nWhere, as in this case, an informer asserts their status in a proceeding that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose their status, and the informer-police relationship is central to the proceedings, the situation is particularly delicate. The appropriate way to protect the informers anonymity will generally be to proceed totally in camera. Indeed, the fact that such a degree of confidentiality may be required in exceptional cases like the present one was expressly contemplated by Bastarache J. in Vancouver Sun, at para. 56 (see also J. Rossiter, Law of Publication Bans, Private Hearings and Sealing Orders (loose-leaf), at  2:29, citing, among others, John Doe v. Halifax (Regional Municipality), 2017 NSSC 17, 7 C.P.C. (8th) 164; see also R. v. B. (A.), 2015 ONSC 5541, 24 C.R. (7th) 191).\nOnce it is found to be necessary to proceed in camera, the application of the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun requires the presiding judge to do so in a manner that is as consistent as possible with the open court principle. In this regard, we note that even in the most confidential of cases, it is possible  and we would go so far as to say essential  to protect the informers anonymity while still favouring confidentiality orders that do not entirely or indefinitely keep the existence of a hearing or judgment from the public. Although this may require some creativity and perhaps some administrative arrangements, what is in issue is compliance with the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun and the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice.\nIndeed, the rigorous application of the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun will necessarily ensure that, at a minimum, the existence of the in camera hearing and of any decision rendered as a result will be made public. Of course, it may well be that a range of information, including the reason for proceeding in camera, will have to be kept confidential. It is also possible, in an extreme case, that the existence of the in camera hearing will not be made public until after the fact, for example once a judgment has been released. Similarly, it is possible that, exceptionally, a judgment rendered following an in camera hearing must be kept under seal. But we have difficulty imagining a single scenario in which revealing the mere existence of an in camera hearing and of any decision rendered as a result is incompatible with the protection of an informers anonymity, such that their existence must remain confidential indefinitely. Such a minimum threshold for openness also has added importance in enabling interested third parties to file a motion for review of the confidentiality orders and thus to prevent the judiciary from avoiding any form of accountability (C.B.C. v. Manitoba, at para. 52).\nIn a case like this one, at least one approach can be taken to ensure that the existence of an in camera hearing and of any decision rendered as a result is not kept from the public entirely or indefinitely.\nThis approach involves creating a parallel proceeding that is completely separate from the public proceeding in which informer privilege is initially invoked. The record for the parallel proceeding thereby created, though sealed, will have its own record number. Moreover, subject to the redaction of information that might tend to reveal the informers identity, it will generally be possible for the proceeding to be on the courts docket and hearing roll and for a public judgment to be released. As an illustration of what such a public judgment might look like, consider what was done in B. (A.). In that case, arguments on the accuseds guilt and on a motion for a stay of proceedings based on an allegation of abuse of process by the state against the accused, who had acted as a police informer, were made at hearings held entirely in camera, and a redacted public judgment on these matters was then released. The presiding judge described the measures put in place to protect informer privilege as follows:\n\tThe accused, AB, is charged with some of the most serious drug related offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. AB had been a confidential informant with the Z Police Service (ABCPF) for a number of years prior to his/her arrest. He/she had been deemed a reliable informant. His/her defence and an abuse of process application arise out of his/her role as a confidential informant. It is because of this that throughout these Reasons I will be using pseudonyms for all of the individuals who played any role in the evidence as it unfolded during the trial. It is for the same reason that these Reasons will not identify when or where the events transpired, nor will my Reasons identify the type of drug involved. The trial, in its entirety, was held in camera. My Reasons will also refer to AB as he/she so as not to reveal his/her sex and thereby further protect his/her identity. Only in this way can ABs identity as a confidential informant be protected. An unedited version of my Reasons disclosing the names of all of the witnesses and his/her related information will be given to counsel and one copy will be filed with the court that will be sealed, to be opened only by order of this Court. The version of these Reasons that becomes public will have been reviewed with counsel to ensure that ABs identity has been fully protected. [para. 4]\nAt the time of creating a parallel proceeding, the presiding judge must consider what information has to remain confidential in the context of that new proceeding in order to prevent the two proceedings from being linked to each other. The judge must therefore exercise the greatest caution so as not to compromise the police informers anonymity. There may be cases in which several pieces of information must remain confidential because of the particular features of the proceeding that began publicly. For example, the protection of informer privilege may require that one or more of the following details be kept confidential: the judges identity, the identity of the parties counsel, the prosecutors identity, the judicial district or the date of a proceeding or judgment (see, e.g., Her Majesty the Queen v. Named Person A, 2017 ABQB 552, at paras. 7-8 (CanLII); R. v. X and Y, 2012 BCSC 325). The reason for this is that, in some contexts, the disclosure of one or more of these details may significantly increase the risk of an informers identity being revealed indirectly simply through the linking of data.\nWhere information of this kind is identified, the judge must then ask whether measures can be contemplated to accommodate the open court principle, in keeping with the guiding rule set out in Vancouver Sun. For example, the measures contemplated might involve a change of judge or prosecution counsel, if this would not cause undue delay or other prejudice to the accused, or the hearing of the application in another judicial district. However, if the circumstances do not allow for measures that interfere less with court openness, the judge must order that this information be kept confidential. The information will not appear in the public record for the parallel proceeding, thereby preventing the identification of the police informer.\nIn addition, where a decision is rendered in the parallel proceeding following an in camera hearing, the presiding judge must consider whether the decision can be made public, subject to the redaction of confidential information. While this can generally be expected to be the case, it is always possible that exceptional cases may arise in which the protection of a police informers identity will require that a judgment rendered following an in camera hearing be kept under seal, despite the creation of a parallel proceeding separate from the initial proceeding in which privilege was claimed.\nIn every scenario, however, the creation of a parallel proceeding makes it possible to disclose, at a minimum, the existence of the in camera hearing and of any decision rendered as a result. The public can learn of their existence through the courts docket or hearing roll and, in appropriate circumstances, through notice that a sealed judgment has been delivered. Further, with rare exceptions, the creation of a parallel proceeding has the advantage of making the public aware of the decisions rendered at trial and, where applicable, on appeal, decisions that inform the public of at least the nature of the issues ruled on by the court and the reason for proceeding in camera.\nThis approach has the advantage of not excluding the possibility, in cases where the interests of justice so require, of providing public notice of a proceeding in which an accused invokes informer privilege and of the courts intention to proceed in camera, so that interested third parties can make submissions on how the open court principle can best be accommodated in the circumstances (see Vancouver Sun, at paras. 52-54). We note in this regard that, even in the context of a parallel proceeding, the presiding judge, before allowing interested third parties to make their submissions, may have to take special measures to prevent the proceedings from being linked to each other.\nFinally, this solution makes it possible to disclose at least a minimum amount of information to interested third parties, including the news media, that wish to file a motion for review of the confidentiality orders. This lessens the risk of the unfortunate occurrence where a news outlet that has become aware of the in camera hearing is unable to make helpful submissions because it is impossible for the court to provide it with a minimum amount of information, including the nature of the privilege invoked (see Postmedia Network Inc. v. Named Persons, 2022 BCCA 431, 476 D.L.R. (4th) 747).\nIn the present case, after finding that it was necessary to proceed in camera, the trial judge could and, in retrospect, should have made an order to that effect while creating a parallel proceeding completely separate from the criminal proceeding in which Named Person had been appearing publicly until that time. That parallel proceeding would have had its own record number. Moreover, subject to the redaction of information that might link the parallel proceeding to the public proceeding and thus reveal Named Persons identity, the new proceeding thereby created could have been on the courts docket and hearing roll, and a redacted version of the judgment on the motion could have been released. Although this Court is not, strictly speaking, hearing an appeal from the confidentiality orders made at trial, we are of the view that it is important to emphasize this to ensure that this type of situation does not occur again in the future.\nHaving made these clarifications, we will now address the Court of Appeals decision to dismiss the appellants motions for review of its confidentiality orders and to uphold the sealing of all information that might tend to identify Named Person.\nConfidentiality Orders Made by the Court of Appeal\nThe Court of Appeals decision to open a record in the court office and to make public a redacted version of its judgment of February 28, 2022, allowing Named Persons appeal, staying the conviction and entering a stay of proceedings was correct. These measures were necessary both to accommodate the open court principle and to promote the democratic ideals that define it. While the decision made public by the Court of Appeal is heavily redacted and the record created is sealed, the decision has the merit of disclosing to the public the existence of in camera proceedings as well as the abuse of process committed against Named Person in the course of a criminal prosecution.\nThat being said, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. are challenging the Court of Appeals refusal to lift its confidentiality orders in whole or in part. They are asking this Court to ensure that the redaction undertaken by the Court of Appeal in its two judgments to protect Named Persons anonymity is justified and that it impairs the open court principle as little as possible (A.F., at para. 102). In addition, like the AGQ, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. argue that the Court of Appeals repeated refusal to partially unseal the appeal record is unjustified. In their opinion, the Court of Appeal should, at a minimum, have unsealed the appeal record in a manner that corresponded to the redaction of the public version of its judgment of February 28, 2022, in which, among other things, it publicly disclosed excerpts from the trial judgment and from the transcript of the police officers out-of-court examinations that were in the appeal record (A.F., AGQ, at paras. 11, 28 and 30-33; A.F., Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al., at paras. 49 and 54).\nIn our view, only one aspect of the confidentiality orders reviewed and upheld by the Court of Appeal is problematic in relation to the open court principle, namely the courts decision not to partially unseal the appeal record in order to make a redacted version of the trial judgment public.\nFirst of all, with regard to the extent of the redaction done by the Court of Appeal in its two judgments, that court did not unduly shield information in those judgments from public view. In the circumstances of this case, the Court of Appeal had no choice but to redact its judgments as heavily as it did. These circumstances include, of course, the fact that Named Person initially appeared in a public criminal proceeding and that the informer-police relationship was central to Named Persons motion for a stay of proceedings, but there are also other particular and unusual circumstances, which, however, must remain confidential so as not to risk compromising Named Persons anonymity. We are therefore of the opinion that the Court of Appeal had a duty to keep confidential Named Persons name, the identity of the trial court and judge, the judicial district in which the proceeding was held, the identity of the prosecutor and the prosecution counsel involved in the case, the identity of counsel for Named Person, the identity of the police force and the police officers involved, the nature of the crime with which Named Person was charged and the circumstances of its commission. Otherwise, there would have been a real risk in this case of compromising Named Persons identity.\nSecond, with regard to the Court of Appeals decision to uphold the order to seal the entire appeal record, we are of the view that it erred in refusing to make public a version of the trial judgment that was redacted in such a way as to protect Named Persons anonymity. It is apparent from reading that judgment that this was an entirely feasible undertaking that would have accommodated the open court principle and given a certain materiality to the confidential proceedings in issue. As for the rest of the appeal record, we agree with the Court of Appeal that partial unsealing carried with it too high a risk of error in this case given the number of details that had to be kept confidential to preserve Named Persons anonymity. The Court of Appeal did not err in refusing to undertake such an unsealing exercise. The principle of caution that must guide the courts in protecting Named Persons anonymity required that the rest of the appeal record be kept under seal.\nConclusion\nNamed Person was not convicted following a secret criminal proceeding. The controversy that arose after the release in March 2022 of the Court of Appeals judgment in which it denounced the holding of a secret trial is unfortunate and could have been avoided. First and foremost, it could have been avoided if the trial judge had proceeded in camera by creating a parallel proceeding completely separate from the criminal proceeding in which Named Person had been appearing publicly until that time. The magnitude of the controversy could also have been limited if the Court of Appeal had not used the expression secret trial to describe what were actually in camera hearings held in a proceeding that began and initially moved forward publicly. In addition to being inaccurate, this expression is needlessly alarming and has no basis in Canadian law.\nMoreover, we want to reiterate the relevance of the Vancouver Sun procedure and the importance of rigorously applying its guiding rule requiring a court to protect informer privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open court principle. For this purpose, the courts must be flexible and creative. What is in issue is the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice and respect for the rule of law.\nIn fairness to the Court of Appeal, it was in a difficult position, as it had before it an appeal that did not relate in any way to the trial judges confidentiality orders. In this context, we can only commend its decision to proactively champion the open court principle and the democratic ideals underlying it by opening a record at its court office and making public a redacted version of its judgment of February 28, 2022. Given the particular circumstances of this case, the Court of Appeal had no choice but to redact its judgments as heavily as it did. It was therefore correct to dismiss the motions for total or partial disclosure of the information that had been kept confidential up to that time. However, it erred in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. It should have made public a redacted version of the trial judgment, because redacting that decision was an entirely feasible undertaking that did not compromise Named Persons anonymity and that accommodated the open court principle.\nIn closing, even though errors were made, there is no doubt that all of the justice system participants involved were in good faith and acted with integrity. They were all motivated by a sincere desire to protect Named Persons anonymity, as was their duty. We believe that this decision will be helpful and will guide trial judges who must proceed in camera, in order to ensure that they accommodate the open court principle to the greatest extent possible.\nDisposition\nFor these reasons, the Court allows the appeals in part and remands the case to the Quebec Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting the respondents on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction.\n\tAppeals allowed in part.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, La Presse inc., Cooperative nationale de linformation independante (CN2i), Canadian Press Enterprises Inc., MediaQMI inc. and Groupe TVA inc.: Fasken Martineau DuMoulin, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant the Attorney General of Quebec: Bernard, Roy (Justice-Quebec), Montreal; Sous-ministeriat des affaires juridiques (SMAJ), Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada: Department of Justice Canada, Quebec Regional Office, Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario, Crown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Attorney General of Alberta, Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Lucie Rondeau, in her capacity as Chief Judge of the Court of Quebec: Desjardins Riverin, Quebec; Roy & Charbonneau, Quebec.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Muslim Lawyers Association: Foda Law, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Advocates Society: LCM Avocats inc., Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener Barreau du Quebec: Barreau du Quebec, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners Association quebecoise des avocats et avocates de la defense and Association des avocats de la defense de Montreal-Laval-Longueuil: Mairi Springate, Laval; Boro Frigon Gordon Jones, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Centre for Free Expression: St. Lawrence Barristers PC, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: McCarthy Tetrault, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners Ad IDEM/Canadian Media Lawyers Association, Postmedia Network Inc., Global News, a division of Corus Television Limited Partnership, Torstar Corporation and Glacier Media Inc.: Farris, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Lawyers Association (Ontario): Kapoor Barristers, Toronto; Stockwoods, Toronto.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the Quebec Court of Appeal's order sealing the entire appeal record in a case involving a police informer.\n\nThis appeal revolves around the delicate balance between the open court principle and informer privilege in the context of a criminal proceeding, specifically whether the Quebec Court of Appeal erred in upholding confidentiality orders that sealed information related to a police informer's identity.\n\nA police informer, referred to as \"Named Person,\" was charged with criminal offenses under the Criminal Code. The accused brought a motion for a stay of proceedings based on abusive state conduct, which was heard in camera to protect the accused's anonymity. The trial judge dismissed the motion, and Named Person was subsequently convicted. On appeal, the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, stayed the conviction, and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of abuse of process by the state. However, the Court of Appeal's decision to seal the entire appeal record, including the trial judgment, was challenged by media organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada heard appeals from the Quebec Court of Appeal's decision to uphold the confidentiality orders. The appellants argued that the Court of Appeal erred in refusing to partially unseal the appeal record and make a redacted version of the trial judgment public. The Supreme Court considered the importance of the open court principle, the scope of informer privilege, and the guiding rule from Named Person v. Vancouver Sun. The Court ultimately allowed the appeals in part, remanding the case to the Quebec Court of Appeal to make public a redacted version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that when proceeding in camera to protect a police informer's identity, courts must apply the guiding rule from Vancouver Sun, which requires them to minimize impairment of the open court principle, and consider creating a parallel proceeding to disclose at least a minimum amount of information to interested third parties, while ensuring the informer's anonymity is protected.\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice held that the appeals should be allowed in part. The Court found that no secret trial was held in the case, and the magnitude of the controversy that arose could have been limited if the Court of Appeal had not used the expression \"secret trial\" to describe what were actually in camera hearings held in a proceeding that began and initially moved forward publicly. The Court emphasized the importance of rigorously applying the guiding rule from Named Person v. Vancouver Sun, requiring a court to protect informer privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open court principle. The Court's decision highlights the need for a balanced approach in protecting both the anonymity of police informers and the open court principle, ensuring that justice is administered openly and transparently while safeguarding the interests of all parties involved.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms that no secret trial  was held in a case involving a person with police informer status.</strong>A person who acted as an informer  for a police force was charged with criminal offences. The person brought a  motion for a stay of proceedings based in part on abusive state conduct related  to the laying of the charges. Because the person\u2019s informer status was at the  centre of the relevant factual context and the parties\u2019 arguments, the judge  dealing with the motion ordered that it be heard <em>in\u00a0camera</em>, that is, in private. No notice was given to the  media, since the judge was of the view that revealing anything about the  motion, including its existence, would be likely to compromise the person\u2019s  anonymity. The motion, its content and the exhibits and transcripts submitted  to the judge remained confidential and were not in any court record. The motion  was dismissed in a written judgment, which had no file number and could not be  consulted by the public.The person was subsequently  convicted and appealed the conviction. The appeal was heard <em>in\u00a0camera</em>, and no notice was given  to the media. The Court of Appeal allowed the person\u2019s appeal, stayed the  conviction and entered a stay of the criminal proceedings on the ground of  abuse of process by the state. The Court of Appeal decided to open a record at its  court office, accompanied by a sealing order, and to make public a version of  its decision in which certain information was redacted, that is, blacked out.  In that decision, the Court of Appeal denounced the holding of a \u201csecret  trial\u201d, which alarmed the public and the media. It also expressed its  disagreement with the scope of the confidentiality measures put in place for  the person\u2019s trial.A number of media organizations,  the Attorney General of Quebec and the Chief Judge of the Court of Qu\u00e9bec then  asked the Court of Appeal to review the confidentiality orders made in this  case. In a second decision, the Court of Appeal upheld the sealing of all  information that might tend to identify the person. The Court of Appeal also  refused to partially unseal, or open up, the appeal record by redacting the  same information as in the public version of its decision. The media  organizations and the Attorney General of Quebec appealed that second decision  to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has allowed  their appeals in part.<strong>Court openness is a cardinal principle of the Canadian justice system. Any exception to this principle must be limited.</strong>In a unanimous judgment, the  Court confirmed that no secret trial was held in this case. The Court in fact specified  that \u201cthe very concept of \u2018secret trial\u2019 does not exist in Canada.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  [T]he  cardinal principle of court openness may be tempered where the circumstances of  a case so require. Various confidentiality orders may be made\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.,  up to and including an order that all hearings be held <em>in\u00a0camera</em>\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. But it is well established that  \u2018secret trials\u2019, those that leave no trace, are not part of the range of  possible measures.\u201d According to the Supreme Court,  the magnitude of the controversy that arose after the Court of Appeal\u2019s first decision  was released could have been limited if that court had not used the expression  \u201csecret trial\u201d to describe what were actually <em>in\u00a0camera</em> hearings held in a proceeding that began and  initially moved forward publicly.Where, as in this case, an informer asserts their status in a proceeding  that began publicly in which they face charges that do not cause them to lose  their status, and the informer\u2011police relationship is central to the  proceedings, the appropriate way to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity will  generally be to proceed totally <em>in\u00a0camera</em>.  Even in these most confidential of cases, it is still possible \u2014 and even  essential \u2014 to protect the informer\u2019s anonymity while favouring confidentiality  orders that do not entirely or indefinitely keep the existence of a hearing or  judgment from the public. What is in issue is the maintenance of public  confidence in the administration of justice and compliance with the guiding  rule from <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2384/index.do\">Named  Person v. Vancouver Sun, 2007 SCC 43</a></em>, which requires a court to protect informer  privilege while minimizing, as much as possible, any impairment of the open  court principle.As the Supreme Court noted, when  justice is rendered in secret, without leaving any trace, respect for the rule  of law is jeopardized and public confidence in the administration of justice  may be shaken. The open court principle allows a society to guard against such  risks, which erode the very foundations of democracy. By ensuring the  accountability of the judiciary, court openness supports an administration of  justice that is impartial, fair and in accordance with the rule of law. It also  helps the public gain a better understanding of the justice system and its  participants, which can only enhance public confidence in their integrity.  Court openness is therefore of paramount importance to our democracy \u2014 an  importance that is also reflected in the constitutional protection afforded to  it in Canada. In this case, the Supreme Court found  that the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the motions for disclosure of  the information that had been kept confidential up to that time but that it erred  in upholding its order that the entire appeal record be sealed. The case is  therefore remanded to the Court of Appeal so that it can make public a redacted  version of the trial judgment included in the appeal record, after consulting  the parties concerned on a proposal for partial unsealing and redaction."

The buyer contacted the seller, a topsoil provider, to obtain topsoil with a specified composition. The seller provided the buyer with laboratory reports from different topsoil samples taken about six weeks prior, and warned against purchasing the topsoil without updated test results. However, the buyer had already missed project deadlines and urgently wanted delivery of the topsoil so as to avoid the imposition of liquidated damages. The buyer therefore waived its right to test the soil and insisted on immediate delivery. The buyer and seller agreed to add two exclusion clauses to the standard purchase order, which stated that the buyer had the right to test and approve the material before it was shipped, and that if the buyer waived those rights, the seller would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its facility. After the topsoil was delivered and placed on the project site, water ponding was noted. Testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the topsoil than the test results had indicated, and the buyer had to remove and replace the topsoil. The buyer sued the seller for damages, alleging that it did not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been indicated in the test results.\n\tThe trial judge dismissed the buyers action. He found that the contract was for a sale of goods by description within the meaning of s. 14 of Ontarios Sale of Goods Act (SGA), which sets out an implied condition that goods must correspond with their description. He further found that the buyer did not get the topsoil it bargained for, because of the variation between the topsoil that was promised and the topsoil that was delivered. However, he found that the exclusion clauses were an express agreement, pursuant to s. 53 of the SGA, to contract out of the implied condition under s. 14 of the SGA, despite the fact that the exclusion clauses did not explicitly mention that they were to oust statutorily implied terms and conditions. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred on three extricable questions of law, by: (1) failing to account for how the implied condition in s. 14 of the SGA relates to the goods identity (or description) and not their quality; (2) failing to properly interpret the requirement for explicit, clear and direct language to exclude a statutory condition; and (3) considering the contracts factual matrix beyond its permissible use in interpreting the exclusion clauses. The Court of Appeal held that the term quality cannot include identity and that the reference in the exclusion clauses to quality was not a reference to the implied condition in s. 14 relating to the goods identity. In the courts view, because the exclusion clauses did not contain words that explicitly, clearly and directly covered the identity of the topsoil, they were insufficient to oust liability under s. 14 of the SGA. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring the seller to pay damages.\n\tHeld (Cote J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the trial judges judgment restored.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: To be sufficient for the purposes of s. 53 of the SGA, an express agreement must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be expressly set forth within the parties contract. The determination as to what qualifies as an express agreement must also be informed by principles of contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, and the paramount consideration must be the objective intention of the parties. In the instant case, the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties express agreement is that the buyer accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it knew was an organic and changing substance. \n\tThe law governing the sale of goods is subject to various legal rules from different sources. While subject to a host of statutory provisions in the SGA or other such statutes across the country, a sale is also an agreement that sits within the general common law of contracts and the SGA mandates that it be interpreted in conjunction with current contract law principles. Sale of goods statutes were never intended to be exhaustive or comprehensive codes; they ought not to be applied too rigidly or to the exclusion of the freedom of parties to contract within the general limits of the law. Statutory rules stemming from sale of goods legislation must be related to the law of contract as a whole and such legislation must be interpreted in light of the common law as it stands from time to time and in the present day. In particular, the principles in Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, and Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways), 2010 SCC 4, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 69, which give priority to the parties intentions, apply to the contracts subject to the SGA. \n\tThe SGA provides statutory protections to contracting parties by implying various rights, duties and liabilities into contracts for the sale of goods, including conditions and warranties. When goods are sold by description, s. 14 of the SGA provides an implied condition that the goods correspond with their description. By deeming this to be a condition, the SGA provides that correspondence with description is fundamental to the purpose of a contract. When this implied condition is in play, it becomes very important to determine what aspects of the goods form part of the goods description, which is a fact-specific determination. Not every statement made about the goods is a protected part of its description under s. 14: description is tied to the identity and only protects those terms which identify the subject-matter of the sale. The case law has distinguished between traits that go to the identity of the goods (which pertains to description), and those which go to the quality of the goods (which pertains to merchantability and fitness for purpose). The identity of a good should be limited to words whose purpose is to state or identify an essential part of the description of the goods. The question to be asked for the purpose of s. 14 is whether the buyer could fairly and reasonably refuse to accept the physical goods proffered to them on the ground that the failure of the goods to correspond with that part of what was said about them in the contract makes them goods of a different kind from those the buyer had agreed to buy. \n\tDespite the importance of implied statutory conditions, parties remain free to take their contracts outside the presumptive provisions of the SGA. Section 53 permits parties to vary or negative obligations imposed by the SGA, including by express agreement. To qualify under the express agreement branch of s. 53, there must be both an agreement to vary or negative a liability under a contract of sale, and that agreement must be express. An agreement will be express if made in distinct and explicit terms and not left to inference. The parties must have expressly and unambiguously used language that signals their intention to override the SGA. Despite the requirement for an express agreement, s. 53 does not require express language; there is no requirement for particular magic words. It cannot be said that s. 53 is only satisfied if parties who agreed to an exclusion clause use the words condition and identity to oust the implied condition of correspondence to description. Applicable case law mandates a shift away from a method of contractual interpretation dominated by technical rules of construction and requires that words be understood in their factual matrix, with the paramount goal of ascertaining the parties objective intention.\n\tThe agreement part of s. 53 is often the crux of the matter and it requires a meeting of the minds about what rights, duties or obligations are being changed and how they are being varied or negatived. The terms of that agreement must also be certain and mutually agreed upon. The existence, extent and meaning of the statutory term agreement will be determined by reference to the common law principles concerning the formation, interpretation and enforcement of contracts. In Sattva, the Court stated how agreements should be interpreted and reviewed, and explained how the jurisprudence has shifted towards a more flexible, practical, and common-sense approach with a view to ascertain the objective intention of the parties. When seeking the meaning of a document, the focus of the court is properly on what the parties objectively intended and what they reasonably understood their words to mean. The meaning of the words of a contract can be derived from reference to various contextual factors from its surrounding circumstances, which are often referred to as the factual matrix.\n\tExclusion clauses, such as those under s. 53 of the SGA, are subject to their own set of legal rules because they raise distinct policy considerations. Tercon sets out three steps to help assess the enforceability of an exclusion clause. First, the court must determine whether an exclusion clause even applies in the circumstances, which necessarily depends on an assessment of the intention of the parties. It is at this step where a court should determine whether there is an express agreement between the parties that is sufficient to meet the requirements of s. 53. If the exclusion clause is found to be valid at the first step, the second step requires a court to consider whether the exclusion clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made. Third, even if not unconscionable, a court may consider if there is some overriding public policy consideration that outweighs the strong public interest in the enforcement of contracts and if there is, the court may refuse to enforce the otherwise valid exclusion clause. The modern contractual interpretation principles from Sattva apply to contracts containing exclusion clauses, especially at the first step of the Tercon test. Sattvas direction to consider the surrounding circumstances when interpreting the terms of a contract means exclusion clauses must be analyzed in light of their purposes and commercial context.\n\tIn the instant case, the exclusion clauses exempt the seller from any statutorily imposed liability under s. 14 of the SGA. The word quality in the exclusion clauses must be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the surrounding circumstances. The buyer was a commercial purchaser with years of experience in buying large quantities of topsoil. Both parties were aware of the changing nature of topsoil and that the existing test results were dated. The parties were free to negotiate and allocate the risk of not testing the topsoil. The buyer was in a rush to receive the topsoil, given the looming threat of liquidated damages. The buyer deliberately assumed the risk through its own conscious strategic decision. The parties came to an express agreement about the allocation of risk, by using direct, clear and express language in their contract, which demonstrated that their objective intention was for the buyer to waive its right to pursue the seller for any liability relating to the topsoil. The trial judge made no error in making such findings.\n\tPer Cote J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The exclusion clauses are not an express agreement within the meaning of s. 53 of the SGA to exclude the sellers liability for a breach of the implied condition in s. 14 that goods sold by description will correspond with their description. An exclusion clause it not an express agreement under s. 53 with regard to a particular implied condition if it requires deviating from the text of the contract to determine what the surrounding circumstances would deem the parties to have written, instead of interpreting the meaning of the words actually used by the parties. The clear and direct language chosen by the parties in the exclusion clauses limited the exclusion of liability to defects in quality within the meaning of s. 15 of the SGA, and could not be expanded to cover any defects relating to the identity of the soil.\n\tThe SGA protects buyers by implying certain conditions into each contract for the sale of goods, such as the statutory conditions that the goods will correspond with their description (s. 14), will be fit for their purpose (s. 15 para. 1), and will be of merchantable quality (s. 15 para. 2). Each of these statutory conditions is distinct, and it is important not to conflate them. Section 14 sets out an implied condition that the goods delivered under a contract for the sale of goods by description will correspond with their description. Establishing a breach of s. 14 involves a two-step analysis. It is first necessary to determine whether the contract is a sale by description within the meaning of s. 14. If so, it is then necessary to determine whether the goods delivered corresponded with their agreed-upon description. This is a fact-specific determination that turns on whether a statement describing the goods being sold was made and reasonably relied upon. Section 14 is to be distinguished from s. 15, which is broadly directed at the quality of goods. In particular, s. 15 para. 1 sets out an implied condition of fitness for purpose, and s. 15 para. 2 sets out an implied condition of merchantable quality.\n\tThe SGA does not restrict the parties common law freedom to shape their agreement as they see fit. They are free to contract out of implied terms, and s. 53 precisely delineates the manner in which they may demonstrate their intention to do so. One route for ousting liability arising in the context of the SGA is that the parties are free to structure their own contract as they see fit by express agreement. As set out by the Court in Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 426, clear, direct, and unambiguous language is required to oust a statutory protection by express agreement. Any intention to exclude liabilities arising from the SGA must be expressed in language inconsistent with the specific content of the terms implied by the statute. Reference to a different legal duty will not suffice. Parties are not required to use magic words; rather, they must use language that is clearly and directly aimed at excluding the content of the conditions they purport to vary. Where only a particular duty is excluded by the parties language, all other duties remain. Should the parties fail to use language that unambiguously encompasses the implied condition or warranty in question, no express agreement can be said to have been concluded. An attempted exclusion of liability may fail because the words used by the parties are directed at excluding liability with respect to the quality of the goods when the defect is instead related to their description.\n\tIn the sale of goods context, the exercise of contractual interpretation must proceed on the assumption that the parties objectively intended to accept the rights, duties, and liabilities arising under the SGA, unless the parties have clearly expressed their intention otherwise. Such an approach reflects the policy choice, enshrined in s. 53, to give primacy to legislative purposes, unless the parties have clearly expressed their intention for a different private ordering of their rights and obligations. The SGA represents the legislatures understanding of commercial efficacy or common sense in the sale of goods context, and its provisions are designed to promote certainty and predictability. There is nothing unfair or unrealistic in assuming that the parties knew their respective legal positions in entering into the contract. Given that the parties are taken to know their legal positions in entering into a contract of sale, they must also be presumed to intend the legal consequences of the words they use. Although interpreting the words used in an exclusion clause may require reference to the whole contract or the surrounding circumstances, the legislature has indicated that the rights, duties, and liabilities arising under the SGA must be considered a vital part of the setting in which parties contract. The exercise of contractual interpretation cannot be conducted in a manner that disregards the law governing the contract.\n\tIn the instant case, it was open to the trial judge to find that the parties contract was a sale by description, and it was also open to the trial judge to find that the description of the topsoil for the purposes of s. 14 of the SGA included the composition established in the test results. However, the fact that the trial judge found that the composition of the topsoil went to the identity of the goods, while it could also be relevant to the fitness of the topsoil for a particular purpose, does not mean that the parties objectively intended to shield the seller from any and all liability. The parties chose to put down their agreement in writing. The courts task is to determine what they meant by agreeing to exclude liability in relation to the quality of the material. The exclusion clauses did not actually state that the seller would not be liable for any defects, including defects in the composition of the topsoil. Rather, the parties agreed that the seller would not be responsible for the quality of the material. The ordinary and grammatical meaning of these words relates to the fitness for purpose of a good, within the meaning of s. 15 para. 1 of the SGA. The express agreement excludes liability only in relation to quality. In the present circumstances, the meaning of the word quality cannot be expanded to cover any defects relating to the identity or description of the topsoil; therefore, the language of the exclusion clauses does not express an objective intention to exclude the condition of correspondence with description in s. 14 of the SGA.\nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\n\tApplied: Sattva Capital Corp. v.

S.1 (SGA). The buyer, Pine Valley Enterprises Inc., claims that the purchased topsoil involved a sale by description and seeks damages because the soil did not correspond to that description. The seller, Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., says there was no breach of any statutory condition, arguing that the goods not only complied with their description, but also that the parties specifically excluded any such obligation by express written agreement. The SGA, like other such statutes across the country, provides that parties may contract out of any right, duty or liability that would otherwise arise by implication of law in a contract of sale (s. 53). The parties contract contained a clause stipulating that if the buyer chose to waive its right to test the goods, then the seller would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its facilities (A.R., at p. 201). Because the buyer chose to waive its right to test and approve the goods before they were shipped, the seller claims this clause operates to exclude any statutory condition that the goods must meet certain compositional specifications.\nThe Courts main task in this case is to set out the proper way to interpret exclusion clauses in contracts for the sale of goods. This involves determining what qualifies as an express agreement under s. 53 of the SGA, as informed by recent cases on the interpretation of contracts and the legal operation of exclusion clauses. The principles in Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, and Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways), 2010 SCC 4, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 69, apply to the contracts subject to the SGA. These recent restatements of contract law principles give priority to the parties intentions in a manner that modifies and relaxes some of the stricter and more technical approaches which found expression in certain prior cases. As this Court stated in Sattva, the interpretation of contracts has evolved towards a practical, common-sense approach not dominated by technical rules of construction. The overriding concern is to determine the intent of the parties and the scope of their understanding (para. 47, citing Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada v. Guardian Insurance Co. of Canada, 2006 SCC 21, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 744, at para. 27). All contract terms, including exclusion clauses, should be given their natural and true construction so that the meaning and effect of the exclusion clause the parties agreed to at the time the contract was entered into is fully understood and appreciated (Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 426, at p. 510). Ultimately, when courts are faced with applying a combination of s. 53, the principles of contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, it is the objective intention of the parties that must be the paramount consideration. \nI conclude that the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion clauses at issue in the case at bar. In the commercial circumstances of this case, the objective meaning of the parties express agreement is that the buyer accepted the risk that the soil would not meet the previously supplied compositional specifications if it failed to test what it knew was an organic and changing substance. The appeal is allowed and Earthco has no liability to Pine Valley. \nFactual Background\nPine Valley, a municipal parks contractor, was hired in 2011 by the City of Toronto to address basement flooding in a residential area of North York. The remediation effort, called the Moore Park Project, included the removal and replacement of the existing topsoil with another topsoil more conducive to proper water drainage. While Pine Valley was responsible for the purchase and laying of the topsoil, the Citys hired project consultant and construction supervisor, CH2M Hill (City Consultant), assisted in the selection of a suitable topsoil.\nThe construction contract between the City and Pine Valley called for a substantial performance date of August 19, 2011. If that date was not met, Pine Valley would be required to pay liquidated damages of $500 per working day until the Project was completed. For various reasons, Pine Valley missed the deadline and requested a series of extensions. The City extended the substantial performance date to October 3, 2011, after which liquidated damages would be imposed. Meanwhile, despite Pine Valleys efforts to secure a suitable topsoil from various suppliers, the City Consultant did not approve any of the samples it obtained. The substantial performance date of October 3, 2011 also passed without any topsoil having been purchased, delivered, spread or graded on the Project site. The City made one further and final concession and gave notice that as of October 15, 2011, it would enforce the liquidated damages clause.\nOn October 3, 2011, Pine Valley contacted Earthco, a large custom topsoil provider, to request information about providing them with a topsoil with a specified range of composition percentages. The City required that the topsoil be 45 percent to 70 percent sand, 1 percent to 35 percent silt, and 14 percent to 20 percent clay. Earthcos Sales Manager, Richard Outred, provided Pine Valleys Project Manager, Rick Serrao, with laboratory reports from three different topsoil samples received in August of 2011. The City Consultant reviewed the reports and informed Mr. Outred that two of the proposed topsoil mixes would be acceptable with certain modifications: R Topsoil 2P1 would be acceptable if the chloride was less than 100 ppm and peat could be added to increase the organics, and R Topsoil would be acceptable if peat could be added to increase the organics. \nTo the knowledge of all concerned, the samples on which the reports were based were about six weeks old at the time the reports were sent to Mr. Serrao and reviewed by the City Consultant. Earthco and Pine Valleys agent discussed, on numerous occasions, the need to further test the soil before delivery to Pine Valley to accurately ascertain its properties at the time of sale. As topsoil is an organic substance with properties that may change over time, Earthco typically only sold its topsoil after a multi-stage process over a four- to six-week period. In the normal course, when Earthco would first receive an order with certain soil specifications, it would review soil test reports with these specifications in mind. Earthco would then send the relevant test reports to the customer, who would either accept or reject them. If the customer approved of a particular soil, Earthco would batch the soil from very large piles. Ten samples would then be taken from the soil piles and mixed together into one combined sample, which was sent to an independent third party laboratory for testing. Customers would receive these test results and decide whether their desired soil specifications were still being met and whether they would place an order. Generally, Earthco would deliver soil to a customer only after the batch was specifically approved as acceptable, often on the advice of a landscape architect. \nBy contrast, because Pine Valley urgently wanted delivery of the soil, the process Earthco followed with Pine Valley was atypical. Before any contract of sale was signed, Mr. Outred confirmed that a chloride test would take five to seven business days to perform. He also warned against taking delivery before the updated test results were available to ensure the product delivered matched the desired specifications. On October 5, 2011, he told Pine Valley: I think you should wait until the test is done but if you would like to start shipping at your own risk please let me know (A.R., at p. 136). \nDespite this advice, later that day, Pine Valleys agent signed a contract for 3,678 cubic yards of what was described as Screened topsoil with extra Organics added (Contract) (A.R., at p. 201). The original Contract price was $66,168, and Pine Valley insisted on immediate delivery. Mr. Outred, who handled the negotiations for Earthco, personally prepared the Contract and added two specific clauses to the standard purchase order to reflect the discussions and agreement with Pine Valley in respect of the testing and delivery of the goods:\n6) [Pine Valley] has the right to test and approve the material at its own expense at our facility before it is shipped and placed. Please contact Richard Outred to arrange.\n\n7) If [Pine Valley] waives its right to test and approve the material before it is shipped, Earthco Soils Inc. will not be responsible for the quality of the material once it leaves our facility.\n\n(A.R., at p. 201)\nDelivery began on October 7, 2011 and Pine Valley requested that as many trucks as possible be available because [w]e cannot have delays in [the] process (A.R., at p. 167). By October 19, 2011, all of the R Topsoil had been placed on the Project site. \nIn November 2011, water ponding was noted at the Project site. Testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the soil delivered in October than the August test results of the R Topsoil had indicated. The City was not satisfied with the construction on the Project, and eventually directed Pine Valley to remove and replace the topsoil it had purchased from Earthco. The Project was finally finished on July 27, 2012, and the City claimed liquidated damages from Pine Valley as of October 15, 2011.\nPine Valley sued Earthco and initially filed a broadly worded statement of claim that raised various claims in contract and tort. Ultimately, Pine Valley sought damages of approximately $700,000 from Earthco for breach of contract. Overall, Pine Valley alleged that they did not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been indicated in the August test results and that Earthco was therefore liable for the loss they had incurred.\nJudicial History\nOntario Superior Court of Justice, 2020 ONSC 601\nThe core legal issue at trial was whether clauses 6 and 7 of the Contract were sufficient to oust the implied term of correspondence with description under s. 14 of the SGA such that Earthco was exempted from liability. Despite the wide wording of the statement of claim and the presence of other statutory conditions concerning the merchantability of the goods and their fitness for purpose, Pine Valley specifically argued only that the topsoil had failed to meet the implied condition in s. 14 that, in a sale of goods by description, the goods will correspond with the description given. It further argued that clauses 6 and 7 were not sufficiently clear to oust or negative the implied statutory condition of correspondence with description. For its part, Earthco argued that there was no breach of s. 14 and that, in any event, the parties had negotiated the risk associated with the composition of the soil by shielding Earthco from any liability should Pine Valley choose not to test it.\nIn resolving this core issue, the trial judge heard much competing evidence from both parties. His clear findings of fact, including his findings in relation to credibility and reliability, are not challenged in this appeal. \nThe trial judge rejected the testimony of Rocky Bova, the President, Director, and sole shareholder of Pine Valley. Mr. Bova had maintained at trial that his only intention under the Contract had been to waive testing specifically for chlorides, and not all testing, when he instructed Earthco to ship the soil. The trial judge found Mr. Bovas testimony on this point to be internally inconsistent and implausible. He also found that it conflicted with the testimony of Pine Valleys Project Manager, Mr. Serrao, whom, by comparison, he found to be credible and reliable. \nThe trial judge accepted Mr. Serraos evidence that he knew it is generally unlikely for soil composition to remain static because soil is subject to change depending on the weather, when it is loaded onto the truck and when it is spread on the ground. Mr. Serrao also agreed that soil testing is recommended before soil is shipped, that it would be reasonable and prudent to perform testing in this case because soil is not a static good and that, in this case, the August test results would be old by October, which is when the soil was scheduled to be delivered. Further, Mr. Serrao testified that, in his view, Mr. Bova was aware of Earthcos position on the risk of not testing (i.e., that Pine Valley would be assuming the soil at its own risk), but that Mr. Bova made a business decision to have the soil shipped right away so as not to further delay the Project. The trial judge found Mr. Serraos account overall to be plausible and consistent with the available documentary evidence, and rejected the idea that testing was limited to testing for chlorides, as this issue did not affect the topsoil ultimately chosen by the City Consultant. The trial judge also accepted the evidence of Mr. Outred, Earthcos Sales Manager, and Orazio Valente, Earthcos Vice-President of Sales, which overall aligned with Mr. Serraos account of events. \nBased on the whole of the evidence, the trial judge ultimately found that Mr. Bova understood that, on behalf of Pine Valley, in his capacity as the President, Director and sole shareholder of the company, he was waiving all testing of the soil and that he also understood the risk Pine Valley was taking by accepting the clear exclusion clause. Pine Valley did not want to incur the delay that soil testing would cause for economic reasons: it was under pressure from the City due to the delay in the Projects completion, and it risked incurring liquidated damages if it could not secure the product in time. As a result, the trial judge found that Mr. Bova was willing to have Pine Valley accept the untested soil in the circumstances. \nApplying these findings of fact to the core issue, first, the trial judge found this was a sale by description within the meaning of s. 14 of the SGA. Earthco was promising to sell the R Topsoil with the qualities set out in [the] test results and not simply any soil with any composition (para. 100 (CanLII)). The trial judge also found it was clear Pine Valley did not get the soil it bargained for, because there was a significant compositional variation between the soil that was promised and the soil that was delivered (para. 103). Thus, there was a breach of the implied condition under s. 14 of the SGA that the goods must correspond with their description (para. 103). \nTurning to s. 53 of the SGA, the trial judge found that in order to oust a statutory entitlement under the SGA, contractual language needs to be clear and unambiguous (para. 112), as s. 53 requires an express agreement to contract out of implied terms. In this case, the other statutorily available methods under s. 53 for contracting out of implied terms, namely by the course of dealing between the parties or by usage, were not applicable. Despite the fact that the Contract did not explicitly mention statutorily imposed conditions or terms, relying on the surrounding circumstances of the Contracts formation, the trial judge found that clauses 6 and 7 of the Contract were nevertheless clear and unambiguous and served to negative Earthcos liability under s. 14.  \nThe trial judge found that Pine Valley was in a rush to receive the topsoil and, as a result, it waived its right to test it. Pine Valley was an experienced purchaser of soil; it knew the test results for the soil were dated, and it was aware of the fact that soil composition can change over time. The only purpose of testing the soil would have been to ensure it met the Citys requirements, and there was a plain and obvious risk that the soil delivered would not have the same composition as that of the dated test results. Thus, the trial judge found that Pine Valleys waiver of testing meant it deliberately assumed the risk that the soil would not meet the required specifications. The trial judge ultimately found that the very purpose of clauses 6 and 7 was to avoid the exact situation that transpired: where a customer failed to test soil purchased from Earthco, and then attempted to hold Earthco responsible for a loss due to unsatisfactory soil composition (para. 126).\nAccordingly, the trial judge dismissed Pine Valleys action. Had damages been warranted, he would have quantified them at $350,386.23. \nCourt of Appeal for Ontario, 2022 ONCA 265, 161 O.R. (3d) 103\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the trial judgment, and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco to pay damages to Pine Valley of $350,386.23, as assessed by the trial judge. \nThe only issue argued before the Court of Appeal was whether clauses 6 and 7 had been intended by the parties to protect Earthco from liability associated with delivering goods that failed to correspond with their description. The Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that this was a sale by description and there was a breach of s. 14 of the SGA, and that the legal question involved exclusion clauses invoked to cloak a seller from what would otherwise be a breach of an implied statutory condition. It asked whether the trial judge erred by finding the exclusion clauses were an express agreement composed of explicit, clear and direct language sufficient to oust liability for breach of the implied condition in s. 14 of the [SGA] that the topsoil supplied correspon[d] to the contractual description (para. 7). \nThe Court of Appeal concluded that three extricable questions of law arose from the trial judges interpretation of the Contract and that the trial judge erred on all of these extricable questions. Thus, no deference was owed and the standard of correctness applies (paras. 34-36). First, when interpreting the exclusion clauses, the trial judge failed to take into account the nature of the implied condition in s. 14, which relates to the identity of the goods rather than to their quality. Second, the trial judge failed to properly interpret the meaning of the requirement that explicit, clear and direct language must be used to exclude a statutory condition; as a result, he did not give proper effect to the exclusion clauses failure to refer to the identity of the goods or to statutory conditions. Third, the trial judge erred by reading the language of the exclusion clauses in broader terms than their actual words and, in doing so, considered the Contracts factual matrix, also known as the surrounding circumstances, beyond its permissible use. \nThe Court of Appeal held that in drafting s. 14, the legislature made a policy choice to imply the condition into all contracts involving sales by description without any requirement that purchasers negotiate for its inclusion or that the seller agree to it. In turn, the Court of Appeal articulated the standard for ousting such a condition as requiring the parties to explicitly, clearly and directly agree to its exclusion (para. 67). In this case, this high standard was not met. The Court of Appeal emphasized that the implied condition in s. 14 relates to the identity of the goods sold, and not to their quality. This was a pivotal distinction in this case, as there was no language in the exclusion clauses that explicitly, clearly and directly referred to any statutory conditions or to the identity of what was being sold; the language of the Contracts exclusion clauses only disclaimed liability for the quality of the soil. Because clauses 6 and 7 did not contain words that explicitly, clearly and directly covered the identity of the soil, they were insufficient to oust liability under s. 14 of the SGA. \nIssues\nThe primary issue on this appeal is what the legal requirements are for excluding an implied condition pursuant to s. 53 of the SGA. \nAnalysis\nThe Applicable Standard of Review\nThis Courts jurisprudence firmly establishes that questions of contractual interpretation, which involve questions of mixed fact and law, are ordinarily afforded deference on appellate review. The exception set out in Sattva is for errors on extricable questions of law, which are reviewable on the more exacting correctness standard. It was the purported errors on extricable questions of law identified by the Court of Appeal that enabled it to apply a standard of review of correctness. As I will explain below, the Court of Appeal erred in identifying these as extricable questions of law. \nIn Sattva, this Court established that contractual interpretation involves issues of mixed fact and law as it is an exercise in which the principles of contractual interpretation are applied to the words of the written contract, considered in light of the factual matrix (para. 50). Accordingly, deference is owed to the trial judge, who is best placed to make findings as to the nature of the factual matrix, and the predominantly applicable standard of review is palpable and overriding error (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 21). The search for an extricable question of law is, in my view, not consistent with Sattvas holding that the interpretation of contracts and agreements are mixed questions of law and fact and that extricable questions of law will be rare and uncommon (para. 55; Corner Brook (City) v. Bailey, 2021 SCC 29, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 540, at para. 44). Housen expressly admonished that courts should be cautious in identifying extricable questions of law in disputes over contractual interpretation because ascertaining the objective intention of the parties, which is the prevailing goal of contractual interpretation, is an inherently fact specific exercise (Sattva, at paras. 54-55, citing Housen, at para. 36). The subsequent tendency of some appellate courts to use Sattva to elevate the standard of review, when it was intended to do the opposite, is to be resisted (the Hon. D. Brown, Has Sattva spawned an era of less appellate deference? (2023), 41:4 Adv. J. 26, at p. 27).\nAlthough this Court in Ledcor Construction Ltd. v. Northbridge Indemnity Insurance Co., 2016 SCC 37, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 23, held that standard form contracts are an exception to Sattvas ruling that contractual interpretation is generally a question of mixed fact and law, it was nevertheless acknowledged that even in that context, a court can look to the parties reasonable expectations in order to ascertain the true meaning of a contractual term (para. 95). Consequently, the implication from Ledcor is that where meaningful evidence of the factual matrix does exist and where there is a contract of utter particularity due to a unique set of circumstances, the modern contractual interpretation approach from Sattva continues to apply (para. 42, citing Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, at para. 37).\nThe facts of this case establish that the contract in question was one of utter particularity  indeed, the exclusion clauses at the centre of this appeal were drafted by the seller in response to the buyers particular demand for speedy delivery of the goods without additional testing: because the buyer wanted to avoid incurring liquidated damages. Moreover, there were no errors on extricable questions of law. As I explain in greater detail below, the Court of Appeal read Hunter Engineering as requiring certain formalities not set out in s. 53 of the SGA and which are at odds with contemporary principles of contractual interpretation. By classifying the perceived deficiencies as errors of law, the Court of Appeal sought to create general principles of law that would govern the interpretation of all exclusion clauses ousting implied conditions in a contract of sale, while also diminishing the role of the factual matrix in giving meaning to exclusion clauses.  \nThis derogation from the principles of appellate review laid down by this Court in Housen and Sattva was in error. The question of whether contracting parties came to an express agreement under the SGA involves a statutory component; however, where the parties contract is in writing, as in this case, it will largely be based on the consideration of the specific written agreement between the parties, the words expressly employed to oust the liability and the surrounding circumstances. Accordingly, an express agreement capable of satisfying s. 53 might not look the same for different sets of parties and is likely to vary depending on who the contracting parties are and what their circumstances are. The inevitable variation between parties circumstances means it would be of no use to prescribe a rigidly uniform description of what an express agreement must contain in every instance. This also means that findings by triers of first instance with respect to the factual matrix against which a given contract is struck will continue to be significant when a clause ousting a statutory condition is at issue. \nFurther, the mere fact that the contractual interpretation in this case involves a consideration of a statutory provision does not automatically mean that a review must be on a correctness standard. While it is the statute that prescribes the requirement for an express agreement, it is still the common law of contracts that informs what an express agreement must look like for a specific set of parties. As a result, the interpretive approach must be flexible enough to account for the parties varying commercial circumstances and it follows that the appropriate standard of review must be that of palpable and overriding error, even where the analysis necessarily implicates s. 53 and implied statutory conditions. Thus, it was both the substance of the Court of Appeals statements with respect to the perceived deficiencies in the trial reasons and how the Court of Appeal elevated those statements into binding legal requirements in all cases that, in my respectful view, led it into error.\nIn conclusion, the standard of review for appellate courts concerning the express agreement requirement under s. 53 does not deviate from the general rule set down by this Court in Sattva  questions of mixed fact and law remain susceptible to a deferential standard of review, even where the analysis necessarily implicates implied statutory conditions. While errors on extricable questions of law, if properly identified, can be the basis for correctness review, reviewing courts should approach the task of identifying such errors cautiously, and with an eye towards the relative competencies of trial and appellate courts. However, as I explain below, the Court of Appeal did not identify errors on extricable questions of law that justified the application of the standard of review of correctness. \nThe Sale of Goods Act\nA sale of goods is a particular type of contract in which the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in the goods to the buyer in exchange for monetary consideration (s. 2(1) of the SGA). Not only are they crucial to commerce, they are common, as many people buy and/or sell goods on a daily basis. Sales cover all types of goods, involve different amounts, may be a one-time purchase or a long-term arrangement and are agreed to by parties of varying degrees of knowledge and sophistication. \nAll provinces and territories, except Quebec, have a sale of goods Act modelled on the United Kingdoms Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893 (U.K.), 56 & 57 Vict., c. 71, which was itself a codification of the historical common law of sale established by the English courts during the 19th century. These Acts contain a variety of statutory provisions dealing with many aspects of a sale transaction, including price, delivery and the transfer of ownership. Of particular importance to this appeal are three implied obligations that certain sellers may owe to buyers in relation to the characteristics or properties of the goods sold: fitness for purpose, merchantability and correspondence with description (ss. 14 and 15 paras. 1 and 2 of the SGA). The introduction of these legislated protections was likely intended to reverse the negative effects that arose when caveat emptor reigned and buyers were saddled with all of the risks associated with the state of the goods, except when expressly agreed by the contracting parties.\nThe SGA further protects buyers by elevating these statutory protections to the status of implied conditions. Both the SGA and the common law draw a legal distinction between contract terms that constitute a condition, and those that constitute a warranty (see s. 1(1) of the SGA; G. R. Hall, Canadian Contractual Interpretation Law (4th ed. 2020), at p. 166). A term is a condition if its performance is fundamental to the contract, whereas a warranty is collateral to the main purpose of the contract. While the breach of a warranty gives rise to a claim for damages, but not to a right to reject the goods and to treat the contract as repudiated, the breach of a condition is so serious that the innocent party also has the option either to treat the contract as repudiated, or to treat the breach of the condition as a breach of warranty and claim damages.\nThese three implied conditions have separate areas of application, play distinct roles and protect different interests. Together, they provide important protections, but they are not mandatory provisions that apply in all cases. Each implied condition has its own set of internal requirements before the seller is affixed with that particular legal responsibility, meaning that the legislature did not choose to imply conditions concerning the state of the goods into every contract of sale  the SGA is much more selective. For example, the implied condition of fitness for purpose in s. 15 para. 1 makes its application contingent on three factors: 1) the course of the sellers business; 2) knowledge on the part of the seller of the buyers intended purpose for the goods; and 3) the buyers reliance on the sellers skill or judgment (G. H. L. Fridman, Sale of Goods in Canada (6th ed. 2013), at p. 160).  \nImportantly, s. 14 of the SGA, the one implied condition at issue in this case, applies only to those contracts in which goods are sold by description. When this implied condition is in play, it becomes very important to determine what aspects of the goods form part of their description, which is a fact-specific determination. The SGA, like the Imperial Act on which it was modelled, was not meant to provoke metaphysical discussions as to the nature of what is delivered, in comparison with what is sold (Ashington Piggeries Ltd. v. Christopher Hill Ltd., [1972] A.C. 441 (H.L.), at p. 489). Not every statement made about a good is a protected part of its description under s. 14, and case law shows just how narrow that protected description is. Description is tied to identity and only protects those terms which identify the subject matter of the sale (see Ashington Piggeries, at pp. 467, 470, 486 and 503; see also E. McKendrick, Sale of Goods, in P. Birks, ed., English Private Law, vol. II (2000), 223, at para. 10.30; Bakker v. Bowness Auto Parts Co. Ltd. (1976), 68 D.L.R. (3d) 173 (Alta. S.C. (App. Div.)), at p. 178; Bailey v. Croft (1931), 40 Man. R. 146 (C.A.), at p. 152; Rahtjen v. Stern GMC Trucks (1969) Ltd. (1976), 66 D.L.R. (3d) 566 (Man. C.A.), at pp. 568-69; Coast Hotels Ltd. v. Royal Doulton Canada Ltd., 2000 BCSC 857, 76 B.C.L.R. (3d) 341, at paras. 32-34; Joubarne v. Loodu, 2005 BCSC 1340, at para. 33 (CanLII); Thoms v. Louisville Sales & Service Inc., 2006 SKQB 447, 286 Sask. R. 90, at paras. 52-53; Baron v. Caragata, 2004 SKQB 43, 245 Sask. R. 208, at paras. 16-17; Total Petroleum (N.A.) Ltd. v. AMF Tuboscope Inc. (1987), 54 Alta. L.R. (2d) 13 (Q.B.), at p. 32; Palin v. Assie Industries Ltd., 2003 SKQB 57, 230 Sask. R. 234, at paras. 7-9; Clayton v. North Shore Driving School, 2017 BCPC 198, 70 B.L.R. (5th) 49, at paras. 84-86). \nAs the Court of Appeal correctly observed, the case law has thus distinguished between traits that go to the identity of the goods (which pertains to description), and those which go to the quality of the goods (which pertains to merchantability and fitness for purpose). The identity of a good should not be conflated with all the words used as descriptors and instead should be limited to words whose purpose is to state or identify an essential part of the description of the goods (C. Twigg-Flesner, R. Canavan and H. MacQueen, Atiyah and Adams Sale of Goods (13th ed. 2016), at p. 128 (emphasis added)). While the quality of the goods amounts to a term of the contract, the identity of the goods connotes something that is an essential part of the goods themselves. Words in the contract that merely point out the goods being sold while not actually constituting a substantial ingredient of them do not form part of their identity (p. 128; M. Bridge, ed., Benjamins Sale of Goods (12th ed. 2024), vol. 1, at pp. 570-71). The question to be asked for the purpose of s. 14, therefore, is whether the buyer could fairly and reasonably refuse to accept the physical goods proffered to [them] on the ground that [the] failure [of the goods] to correspond with that part of what was said about them in the contract makes them goods of a different kind from those [the buyer] had agreed to buy (Fridman, at p. 157, citing Ashington Piggeries, at pp. 503-4 (emphasis added)).\nDespite the importance of implied statutory conditions, parties remain free to take their contracts outside the presumptive provisions of the sale of goods legislation. While the legislature made a policy choice that the starting point is that buyers should receive these statutory protections, by enacting s. 53, the legislature also expressly allowed parties to contract out of certain provisions of the SGA. Section 53 is clear, expansive, and lies at the core of the case at bar:\n\tWhere any right, duty or liability would arise under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage, if the usage is such as to bind both parties to the contract.\nA similar provision appears in all of the common law provincial and territorial equivalents of the SGA, and it clearly shows that the Act was never designed to be comprehensive and inward-looking; rather, it establishes a framework of rules that in many cases are optional, subject to exclusion by the parties themselves (M. G. Bridge, The Sale of Goods (4th ed. 2019), at p. 7). \nThe co-existence of implied conditions and s. 53 demonstrates that in enacting the SGA, the legislature did not have a singular purpose in mind  but rather, dual purposes of both protecting buyers and safeguarding freedom of contract. If the parties are silent on the issue, a statutory condition like s. 14 will be implied into their dealings, but if the parties wish, they may allocate their risk accordingly and contract out of whichever presumptive provisions they so choose. These dual purposes are to be balanced and should be approached more like a rebuttable presumption than a general rule with a limited exception. In the final analysis, if any primacy is to be given, the legislature has privileged private ordering over statutory prescription. \nIn assessing what qualifies as an express agreement under s. 53, the scope of exclusion clauses  like clauses 6 and 7, and the impact of such clauses on otherwise legally enforceable obligations, one must first understand how the law governing the sale of goods is subject to various legal rules from different sources. While subject to a host of statutory provisions in the SGA, a sale of goods is also an agreement that sits within the general common law of contracts. Section 57(1) of the SGA expressly provides that except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of [the] Act, [t]he rules of the common law, including the law merchant, . . . continue to apply to contracts for the sale of goods. For example, general common law principles about contractual interpretation, offer and acceptance, agency, the legal treatment of exclusion clauses, unconscionability and other limits or doctrines grounded in equity, continue to apply to a contract of sale. Thus, on its own terms and as a general rule, the SGA mandates that it be interpreted in conjunction with current contract law principles.\nAccordingly, sale of goods law is best seen as a specialized branch of the general law of contract from which statutory prescriptions are not sealed off (Bridge (2019), at p. 1). Sale of goods Acts were never intended to be exhaustive or comprehensive codes; they ought not to be applied too rigidly or to the exclusion of the freedom of parties to contract within the general limits of the law (pp. 7-8; see also K. C. T. Sutton, The Reform of the Law of Sales (1969), 7 Alta. L. Rev. 130, at p. 130). As a result, the sale of goods cannot be studied in isolation from the rest of contract law and the statutory rules stemming from sale of goods legislation must be related to the law of contract as a whole (K. P. McGuinness, Sale & Supply of Goods (2nd ed. 2010), at 1.17). Such legislation must be interpreted in light of the common law as it stands from time to time and in the present day (Koubi v. Mazda Canada Inc., 2012 BCCA 310, 352 D.L.R. (4th) 245, at para. 72; see also McGuinness, at 1.14). \nThus, to determine whether Earthco was exempted from liability in relation to its sale of soil to Pine Valley by express agreement under s. 53, this Court must consider not only the relevant provisions of the SGA but also the current common law relating to contracts, including the modern principles of contractual interpretation and the legal treatment of exclusion clauses. \nSection 53 and Express Agreements \nAt the centre of this appeal is the following question: just how express does an agreement need to be to oust an implied statutory condition? As a contract with the added dimension of falling under the purview of the SGA, a contract for the sale of goods is a contract lying beside a statutory obligation which represents [the legislatures] policy statement (see Armak Chemicals Ltd. v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 17; see also Hall, at pp. 179-80 and 336-37). Does the fact that the state has provided buyers with presumptive statutory protections also mean there are special rules of law that govern the interpretation of exclusion clauses under s. 53? Is a more express agreement, with specific language over and above that which may otherwise meet the standards set out in s. 53, Sattva and Tercon, required? \nThe Court of Appeal answered those questions in the affirmative by mandating, as a matter of law, the use of explicit, clear and direct language to expressly negative liability for a condition that involved the identity of the goods. It performed an exacting review of the language used and held that a simple reference to a different legal obligation, namely quality, is not sufficient to oust the liability implied by s. 14 (para. 56). The Court of Appeal not only distinguished between conditions and warranties, it applied the same reasoning to the distinction between a goods identity and qualities: because the exclusion of implied warranties does not exclude implied conditions, excluding responsibility for the quality of the goods does not exclude an implied statutory condition for its identity (para. 59). The Court of Appeal thus says, based on fine legal distinctions drawn in often complex Commonwealth case law, the term quality cannot capture identity and parties must expressly state they are negativing implied statutory conditions.\nBefore this Court, Pine Valley argues that the Court of Appeal was correct to require explicit, clear and direct language and to conclude that clauses 6 and 7 did not exclude liability for conditions and the identity of the soil. Earthco argues this approach to the interpretation of an express exclusion clause is rigid, narrow, legalistic and technical to the point of requiring magic words to yield particular legal results (A.F, at p. 21). They argue it strains s. 53 and is antithetical to Sattvas practical, common-sense approach and Tercons emphasis on the intention of the parties. \nWhile the law draws distinctions between conditions and warranties, and the quality of goods under ss. 13 and 15 and their identity under s. 14, I do not accept that s. 53 is only satisfied if parties who agreed to an exclusion clause use the words condition and identity to oust the implied condition of correspondence with description. Applicable case law mandates a shift away from a method of contractual interpretation dominated by technical rules of construction and requires that words be understood in their factual matrix, with the paramount goal of ascertaining the parties objective intention (Sattva, at para. 47; cf. C.A. reasons, at para. 55). \nIn this next section, I articulate what amounts to an express agreement under s. 53, address the various propositions argued before us, and comment on the opinions expressed by the Court of Appeal. In the final section of the judgment, I apply the relevant principles to clauses 6 and 7 of the sales Contract at issue.\nSection 53 of the Sale of Goods Act\nSection 53 of the SGA permits parties to vary or negative statutorily imposed obligations. To ascertain what words or actions take the parties outside of the SGA involves a question of statutory interpretation. This calls for a reading of the text of s. 53 in [its] entire context and in [its] grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the [SGA], the object of the [SGA], and the intention of [the legislature] (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, citing E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87). \nThe text of s. 53 is broad and permissive: it provides that any right, duty or liability arising by implication of law may be altered by the parties. This includes s. 14 and the other implied conditions concerning the state or condition of the goods. It also expressly contemplates that the parties may not only vary any right, duty or liability, for example by adding to them, but that they may also negative or exclude them entirely. The ability of the parties to bargain away the presumptive protections in the implied conditions under the SGA represents an explicit policy choice by the legislature and can be compared with certain consumer protection legislation, in which selected implied conditions have been elevated to the status of mandatory provisions. In Ontario, for example, in a consumer contract, any term purporting to negate or vary any implied condition or warranty under either sale of goods or consumer protection legislation is deemed void (Consumer Protection Act, 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 30, Sch. A, s. 9(3); see also Schnarr v. Blue Mountain Resorts Ltd., 2018 ONCA 313, 140 O.R. (3d) 241, at paras. 75-81; Consumer Protection Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. C-26.3, s. 2(1); Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, S.B.C. 2004, c. 2, s. 3). \nThus, among the circumstances s. 53 was intended to address was the exact scenario of parties wanting to remove the presumptive statutory protections given to buyers. There are no surprises here  the legislature definitely understood that some parties may want to contract out of the implied conditions and bargain accordingly. The text, scheme and objectives of the SGA all illustrate that the legislature not only specifically contemplated this scenario but that it unmistakably permitted parties to do so.\nSection 53 also specifies how parties may exempt themselves from statutory liability: . . . by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage . . . . These three separate routes to exemption illustrate the intended breadth of s. 53 and convey that, at its core, s. 53 is concerned with the parties intention to remove themselves from the application of certain SGA provisions  however that intention is conveyed. The parties are free to contract out of any such obligations, whether by words, conduct or usage; not only can their intention be communicated in multiple ways, the latter two are based on actions, conduct and commercial custom. According to recognized principles of statutory interpretation, these three clauses inform each other (see Rizzo, at paras. 21 and 36; see also British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200, 482 D.L.R. (4th) 20, at para. 160). Given this inter-relationship, when assessing what qualifies as an express agreement, it is important to remember that s. 53 permits parties to contract out of the SGA in ways that are not tied to language at all.\nTo qualify under the express agreement branch of s. 53, there must be both an agreement to vary or negative a right, duty or liability under a contract of sale, and that agreement must be express. These two elements, though referenced together as part of a composite phrase, are conceptually distinct and necessarily involve different considerations. \nSome confusion has arisen about what it means for an agreement to be express under s. 53. Some think express speaks to specific language that must be used to remove the parties from the SGA. I do not think that is the correct approach. The term express qualifies the word agreement and is directed to how that agreement must be made. Express does not define what the agreement must say or the required level of clarity of specific contractual clauses. Because s. 53 requires an express agreement, and not the use of express language, it does not constitute, let alone call for, a qualitative requirement about the specificity of language that is needed to vary or negative an otherwise applicable legal liability. While s. 53 insists that the agreement must be express, it imposes no prerequisite about the precision of the words used to manifest such an agreement. The clarity of the language will, however, guide the interpretation of the agreement.\nIn terms of how the agreement is made, it will be express if it is made in distinct and explicit terms and not left to inference. In contrast with the other available avenues to oust the SGA contemplated by s. 53, an express agreement cannot be implied, inferred or imputed from conduct. Neither silence nor omission will suffice. The agreement must be clearly communicated: for the purposes of s. 53 of the SGA, something that is express must be declared in terms and set forth in words (Blacks Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990), at p. 580; see also Blacks Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), at p. 726). The parties must make their mutual intention unmistakably evident. The parties must not be ambiguous or dubious and should be clear, definite, plain and direct. Thus, the express component of an express agreement means that the exclusion clause must be plainly laid out and contemplated within the agreement at issue. It must have been specifically mentioned (G. H. L. Fridman, The Law of Contract in Canada (6th ed. 2011), at p. 433). \nThe agreement part of s. 53 is often the crux of the matter and it requires a meeting of the minds about what rights, duties or liabilities are being changed and how they are being varied or negatived. The terms of that agreement must also be certain and mutually agreed upon.\nThe existence, extent and meaning of the statutory term agreement will also be determined by reference to the common law principles concerning the formation, interpretation and enforcement of contracts. While this Court is required to interpret s. 53 according to the rules of statutory interpretation, the statute itself also calls upon us to interpret s. 53 with reference to the common law of contracts. By choosing the word agreement, a term left undefined in the SGA yet widely known in the law, the legislature reinforces the relevance of the common law principles of contract and invites their use. In addition, the statutory term agreement must be read harmoniously and in the context of the statute as a whole. This includes s. 57(1) which clearly states that, unless inconsistent with the express provisions of [the] Act, the rules of the common law as they exist from time to time apply to contracts for the sale of goods. Section 53 does not, by express provision or otherwise, preclude recourse to the common law to give meaning to the term express agreement. Interpreting s. 53 against the backdrop of contemporary contract law jurisprudence is also consistent with the general purpose and scheme of the SGA, which is built upon an inter-relationship between the SGA and the common law of contracts and which situates the former squarely within the latter. \nIn Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers, [1891] A.C. 107 (H.L.), Lord Herschell set out the proper approach for the interpretation of a codifying statute (pp. 144-45), and while the essence of this approach significantly curtailed the ability of courts to go outside the code to resolve interpretative difficulties, the approach was not literally followed by the courts (McKendrick, at para. 10.01). Professor McKendrick notes that examples can be found of cases where the courts have had regard to pre-1893 case law when interpreting the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 and that, in more recent times, the courts have been more creative or liberal in their interpretation of the legislation and refused to allow it to fossilize the law: see, for example, Ashington Piggeries (para. 10.01, fn. 3 (emphasis added)). \nBased on these principles of statutory interpretation, the common law pertaining to agreements, contractual interpretation and exclusion clauses does not serve to fill gaps in the statute but, instead, is better viewed as being purposefully incorporated into the SGA. No improper conflation between the interpretative approaches to legislation or contracts arises when, as here, the statute calls for reliance upon governing common law principles. Such principles include the modern approach to contractual interpretation and, if the parties intended to exclude or negative something like an implied statutory condition, the three-step approach to exclusion clauses in Tercon will also apply. According to the terms of s. 53 and these cases, the objective intention of the parties will be the paramount consideration, which will be determined by the words used and the surrounding circumstances. \nThe Modern Principles of Contractual Interpretation \nThe principles governing the interpretation of contracts, including the enforceability of exclusion clauses, have undergone significant change over the years, and the SGA requires the use of common law principles as they exist from time to time. Technical and legalistic formulations and complex doctrines have been softened in favour of an interpretive approach that focuses on the objective intention of the parties, how the words used were reasonably understood by the parties, and how, subject to limits such as unconscionability, the parties sought to allocate contractual risk.\nIn Sattva, which concerned a dispute over an agreement to pay a finders fee, this Court clearly stated how agreements should be interpreted and reviewed. The Court explained how the jurisprudence has shifted towards a more flexible, practical, common-sense approach to contractual interpretation and has retreated from an archaic approach dominated by technical rules of construction (para. 47). Such changes reflect and reinforce the overriding concern of contractual interpretation, which is to determine the parties intention and the scope of their understanding (para. 47, citing Jesuit Fathers, at para. 27). \nThe actual words chosen are central to the analysis because this is how the parties chose to capture and convey their contractual objectives. To determine their true intent, decision-makers must read the contract as a whole, giving the words used their ordinary and grammatical meaning, consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of formation of the contract (Sattva, at para. 47). While [t]he facts surrounding the formation of a contract are relevant to its interpretation (Corner Brook, at para. 19), they must never be allowed to overwhelm the words of that agreement or cause courts to create brand new agreements (para. 20; Sattva, at para. 57; see also D. Bertolini, Unmixing the Mixed Questions: A Framework for Distinguishing Between Questions of Fact and Questions of Law in Contractual Interpretation (2019), 52 U.B.C. L. Rev. 345, at pp. 402-3; D. Bertolini, Releasing the Unknown: Theoretical and Evidentiary Challenges in Interpreting the Release of Unanticipated Claims (2023), 48:2 Queens L.J. 61, at p. 65; D. Bertolini, Unpacking Entire Agreement Clauses: On the (Elusive) Search for Contractually Induced Formalism in Contractual Adjudication (2021), 66 McGill L.J. 465, at p. 500). \nWhile the language used is central, courts recognize that words are not ends in themselves: they are a means to demonstrate, discern and determine the true intention of the parties. The jurisprudence seeks certainty but acknowledges the limits of language. This Court recognized how words alone do not have an immutable or absolute meaning and cannot, by themselves, convey the commercial purpose of a contract (Sattva, at para. 47). When seeking the meaning of a document, the focus of the court is properly on what the parties objectively intended and what they reasonably understood their words to mean. This is because the meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean (Sattva, at para. 48, citing Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. v. West Bromwich Building Society, [1998] 1 All E.R. 98 (H.L.), at p. 115). \nCourts are therefore directed to have regard for the surrounding circumstances of the contract  often referred to as the factual matrix  when interpreting a written contract (Sattva, at para. 46). The meaning of the words of a contract can be derived from reference to various contextual factors, which include the purpose of the agreement and the nature of the relationship created by the agreement (para. 48). Sattva allows courts to interpret contractual terms in light of the contract as a whole and with reference to objective evidence that illustrates what was within the parties knowledge at or before the time of their contracts formation (para. 58). Ultimately, ascertaining the objective intent of the parties involves not only a consideration of the actual words used in a contract but also a consideration of the factual matrix surrounding the contract. \nThe Legal Treatment of Exclusion Clauses\nWhen parties seek to limit or negative any right, duty or liability by an express agreement under s. 53 of the SGA, they are effectively attempting to insert an exclusion clause into their sale of goods contract. Clauses that exclude legal liabilities, including implied statutory conditions, are subject to their own set of legal rules because they raise distinct policy considerations. Such clauses can be used to both uphold and challenge the principle of freedom of contract. While they allow parties to allocate risk and bargain for desired terms, they may also be used by stronger parties, in circumstances of unequal bargaining power, to secure an unfair or unreasonable advantage. \nFor this reason, the case law on exclusion clauses has undergone various transformations over the years in an attempt to balance freedom of contract, commercial certainty and contractual fairness. The course of this transformation can be traced by reference in part to the doctrine of fundamental breach, which has evolved towards an approach that gives primacy to the objective intention of the contracting parties. \nThe doctrine of fundamental breach arose in the English courts during the 1950s as a rule of common law that operated where a defendant had so seriously breached the contract that the plaintiff was denied substantially the whole of the contracts benefit (Hall, at p. 367). While the doctrine was introduced to address certain injustices, there has been a full retreat from it as it had a questionable conceptual basis, reflected an inherent hostility to [exclusion] clauses that was not justified and undercut the parties intention by rendering exclusion clauses inapplicable even if they were unobjectionable from a policy perspective (Hall, at pp. 367-68).\nIn Hunter Engineering, this Court was evenly divided on whether the doctrine of fundamental breach should continue in its then current form but concluded that exclusion clauses could only be enforced if they were not unconscionable (at pp. 455-56, per Dickson C.J.) or unfair or unreasonable (p. 517, per Wilson J.; see also Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423). All judges expressly highlighted the centrality of the interpretation of the exclusion clause and the need to preserve the integrity of the parties bargain. Dickson C.J. understood that in the commercial context, clauses limiting or excluding liability are negotiated as part of the general contract and [a]s they do with all other contractual terms, the parties bargain for the consequences of deficient performance such that the exclusion clauses ultimately end up being reflected in the contract price (p. 461). He preferred to interpret the terms of the contract, in an attempt to determine exactly what the parties agreed and if on its true construction the contract excludes liability for the kind of breach that occurred, the party in breach will generally be saved from liability (p. 462). Wilson J. also warned against giving exclusion clauses a strained or artificial interpretation and stated that the effect of such exclusion clauses is said to depend in each case on the true construction of the contract (p. 509).\nThe problem-plagued doctrine of fundamental breach was finally laid to rest in Tercon, in which this Court favoured a modern and holistic approach that focused on the real question of what agreement the parties themselves intended (para. 108, per Binnie J., dissenting, but not on this point). Tercon sets out three steps to help assess the enforceability of an exclusion clause. First, the court must determine whether an exclusion clause even applies in the circumstances, which necessarily depends on an assessment of the intention of the parties (para. 122). Post-Tercon, interpretation is thus the initial analytical step when a court is faced with an exclusion clause and this includes a search for intent using the general rules of contractual interpretation (A. J. Black, Exclusion Clauses in Contracts and their Enforceability Following the Decline of Fundamental Breach (2015), 44 Adv. Q. 139, at p. 163; see also p. 150). \nIf the exclusion clause is found to be valid at the first step, the second step requires a court to consider whether the exclusion clause was unconscionable at the time the contract was made (Tercon, at para. 122). Third, even if not unconscionable, a court may consider if there is some overriding public policy consideration that outweighs the strong public interest in the enforcement of contracts and if there is, the court may refuse to enforce the otherwise valid exclusion clause (para. 123). Thus, concerns of potential unfairness that the doctrine of fundamental breach attempted to remedy are now addressed in the second and third step of the Tercon test (see also C. Pike, Now Were Talking: Revisiting the Canadian Approach to No Oral Modification Clauses (2021), 47:1 Queens L.J. 1, at p. 31; J. D. McCamus, The Supreme Court of Canada and the Development of a Canadian Common Law of Contract (2022), 45:2 Man. L.J. 7, at pp. 16-17; S. OByrne, Assessing Exclusion Clauses: The Supreme Court of Canadas Three Issue Framework in Tercon Contractors Ltd v British Columbia (Transportation and Highways) (2012), 35 Dal. L.J. 215, at pp. 231-32). Establishing unconscionability and the public interest as limits on freedom of contract has returned the focus onto the true contractual intention of the parties.\nThe modern contractual interpretation principles from Sattva clearly apply to contracts containing exclusion clauses, especially at the first step of the Tercon test. Sattvas direction to consider the surrounding circumstances when interpreting the terms of a contract means exclusion clauses must also be analyzed in light of [their] purposes and commercial context (Tercon, at paras. 64-65; see also Dow Chemical Canada ULC v. NOVA Chemicals Corporation, 2020 ABCA 320, 17 Alta. L.R. (7th) 83, at paras. 47 and 50). Accordingly, [i]n a commercial contract[,] . . . the court should know the commercial purpose of the contract and this in turn presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context [and] the market in which the parties are operating (Sattva, at para. 47, citing Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v. Hansen-Tangen, [1976] 3 All E.R. 570, at p. 574; see also Hall, at pp. 34-35 and 89-90).\nAs a result, when interpreting an exclusion clause, like the express agreements contemplated under s. 53, bright-line rules of construction are infrequent and have been replaced by a contextual inquiry into what the parties objectively intended based on the text and surrounding circumstances (Black, at p. 164). Courts can review such clauses for unconscionability and may refuse to enforce the exclusion clause if there is an overriding public policy reason that outweighs the public interest in the enforcement of contracts (Tercon, at para. 123).\nExplicit, Clear and Direct Language as Applied to Statutory Conditions and Identity\nIn compiling its standard of explicit, clear and direct language, the Court of Appeal cited Dickson C.J.s statement from Hunter Engineering about how contracting out of statutory protections must be done by clear and direct language (para. 51); relied on the 1982 Ontario High Court of Justice decision in Chabot v. Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 162, for the requirement that conditions and warranties implied by sale of goods acts may be excluded only by explicit language (para. 50); and invoked its own decision in Gregorio v. Intrans-Corp. (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 527 (C.A.), which restated the need for explicit language (para. 52). The Court of Appeal said it was bound to apply this legal standard and that it was a principle of law to be enforced on a standard of correctness. \nLanguage that explicitly, clearly and directly ousts a protection that the legislature has presumptively bestowed on a party to a contract is an optimal way to ensure the parties mutual objectives are being carried out. As a drafting technique, it is the gold standard for contractual certainty and its presence is to be encouraged. However, with respect, this approach should not be elevated into a binding prerequisite, the absence of which would not only create a stand-alone error of law, but would lead to the inapplicability of an express exclusion clause at the first step of the Tercon test. In the case at bar, this binding prerequisite would lead to the non-enforceability of the exclusion clauses because the parties did not expressly refer to conditions or to identity to demonstrate their intention to contract out of s. 14 of the SGA. \nWhile Hunter Engineering is the only authoritative case cited by the Court of Appeal in relation to the standard of explicit, clear and direct language, its lessons are many and are tied to the particular nature of the legal issue being addressed at various parts of the judgment. While it has been widely cited in relation to true exclusion clauses, its discussion of clear and direct language arose in a very different legal and factual matrix: one that did not involve parties expressly trying to restrict liability in a written exclusion clause. The nature of the contractual term being considered at this part of the judgment was an express contractual warranty limiting Hunter U.S.s liability to either 24 months from the date of shipment or 12 months from the date of start-up, whichever occurred first. The issue was the legal significance, if any, of an express contractual warranty on the sellers implied statutory obligations. Hunter U.S. claimed that its act of inserting the express contractual warranty was enough to render the implied statutory warranty inapplicable (p. 449). In rejecting this argument, Dickson C.J. said, at pp. 449-50:\nThe mere presence of an express warranty in the contract does not mean that the statutory warranties are inconsistent. If one wishes to contract out of statutory protections, this must be done by clear and direct language, particularly where the parties are two large, commercially sophisticated companies.  \nIn light of the contractual provision at issue, Dickson C.J. was principally concerned with exactly what was agreed to by the parties. Requiring clear and direct language makes real sense when the issue is whether the sellers express warranty about the goods overrode the implied statutory terms. In considering whether the existence of the former precluded the application of the latter, the parties would need to speak clearly to the intended interrelationship between these two types of legal responsibilities and directly address whether the express warranty was meant to be in addition to, or in substitution of, the implied statutory conditions. \nDickson C.J.s statement was not made in reference to situations where parties have intentionally and expressly included an exclusion clause. Indeed, the Hunter U.S. contract contained no words of exclusion at all. Under s. 53, there was therefore no express agreement excluding legal liabilities and the issue was what inference could be drawn from their unexpressed intention about the operation of a contractual warranty. To insist that direct and clear language is also or always needed when words of exclusion are actually employed by the parties takes this dicta out of its context and risks unnecessarily extending it at the expense of the objective intention of the parties, in a manner that is at odds with broader principles of contractual interpretation. When buyers and sellers have directed their minds to the allocation of risk and inserted words like those contained in clauses 6 and 7 of the impugned Contract, the same approach should not simply be transposed or apply as strictly or in the same way in this different factual matrix. The very presence of words excluding liability shows that the parties intention is express. \nI therefore do not read Hunter Engineering as binding authority for the general proposition that explicit, clear and direct language  a strict, formulaic requirement  must be used, as a matter of law, by any party seeking to exempt themselves from statutory liability under the SGA. Dickson C.J.s comments were not meant to establish universal legal rules or rigid verbal formulas, especially when the parties have agreed to an exclusion clause. It would be stretching Hunter Engineering to overlay the additional requirement that to successfully secure their stated intention the parties must, as a matter of law, also employ certain words to do so. \nHunter Engineering must instead be read as a whole, including the importance it placed on interpreting the parties intentions. Even if that decision stood for what the respondent says at the time that it was rendered, moreover, it would now need to be read in light of the evolution towards the practical, common-sense approach set out by this Court subsequently in Sattva, Tercon and their progeny. Notably, that passage from Hunter Engineering underscores the importance of the nature of the contractual term at issue and the circumstances of the contracting parties, two factors that are relevant to determining the existence of an express agreement under s. 53. This recognition of how the circumstances of the parties may be taken into account predated and is entirely consistent with how Sattva made the surrounding circumstances relevant to what the parties objectively intended and with how Tercon underscored the importance of the commercial context for the interpretation of exclusion clauses. \nIn addition, Dickson C.J. did not insist on explicit language, and he certainly did not call for explicit language which tracks the legal characterization or content of the term sought to be excluded. No problems arise if explicit is just another way of saying the agreement must be express or apparent, and cannot be implied, imputed or inferred. However, difficulties surface if the standard of explicit language is taken too far and is turned into a principle of law employed to insist that something must always be referred to by name. This is what happened when the Court of Appeal held that the term quality cannot capture identity and parties must expressly state they are negating implied statutory conditions. They reasoned, based on Chabot, that because the exclusion of implied warranties does not exclude implied conditions, excluding responsibility for the quality of the goods does not exclude responsibility for an implied statutory condition for their identity (para. 59).  \nWith respect, while the Court of Appeal cited Sattva, it did not give full effect to its direction that the overriding concern of contractual interpretation is determining the objective intention of the parties. Sattva mandated a shift away from technical rules of construction and required that words be understood in their factual matrix (para. 47; C.A. reasons, at para. 68). By insisting on a specific type of language, such as terms with distinct legal meanings, the Court of Appeal tended to fixate on the precision of the language required to negative liability rather than focus on the objective intention of the parties. \nThe Court of Appeal was correct that there is a recognized distinction, in both the SGA and the case law, between warranties and conditions. In Chabot, the trial judge took into account the nature of the exclusion clause and the status and sophistication of the parties in deciding that words excluding implied warranties are sufficient only to exclude implied warranties, and do not also exclude implied conditions (p. 175). The court was mindful that there was no opportunity for negotiation: the plaintiff purchased a vehicle and was required to sign the sellers standard form agreement that excluded warranties implied under the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.M. 1970, c. S10. Because of a defect, the car burst into flames, was destroyed, and the buyer sought damages. Before Tercon and consumer protection legislation, courts often interpreted clauses against the superior party who insisted on their insertion or held them tightly to the precise terms of their claimed exemption. Depending on the words used, the surrounding circumstances and the intention of the parties, such an approach is consistent with s. 53, Sattva and Tercon.  \nConditions should be distinguished from warranties unless there is something in the context to displace the presumption that [those terms were] intended to carry [their] technical meaning (Rosenberg v. Securtek Monitoring Solutions Inc., 2021 MBCA 100, 465 D.L.R. (4th) 201, at para. 98, citing S. K. Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts (7th ed. 2021), at p. 284). The cardinal principle requiring courts to interpret a contract in accordance with the parties objective intention allows space for what the parties objectively intended those terms to mean. The contracting parties may not have intended to invite the legal ramifications that can accompany the usage of particular terms and thus a strict enforcement of the legal distinction may not always be in keeping with the parties objective intention. Thus, a consideration of the surrounding circumstances necessarily means that the words used by the parties cannot always be interpreted in a uniform way because the meaning of even legal terms may depend on who the contracting parties are, their relationship to each other and whether they are sophisticated at contracting. \nThe same rigour applied to the distinction between warranties and conditions need not be extended to a term like quality, which is often used in general parlance. The term quality is not exhaustively defined in the SGA and is less likely to be thought of as a word that carries with it a similar significant legal meaning, especially when used by individuals contracting without legal assistance. \nThe law continues to recognize a distinction between the identity and qualities of goods, but courts should not impose a very high, and often unrealistic, burden on contracting parties to be aware of and fully understand the legal characterization and consequences of the words they use to express themselves. In some circumstances, sophisticated parties negotiating through lawyers may know all about the legally significant differences between conditions and warranties, and between identity and quality. However, in many situations, such a rigid and rigorous review may thwart the parties objective intention, especially when their words have different meanings and admit of multiple interpretations. In Co-operators Life Insurance Co. v. Gibbens, 2009 SCC 59, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 605, this Court held that words in a contract must be given their ordinary meaning as they would be understood by the average person . . ., and not as they might be perceived by persons versed in the niceties of [the] law (para. 21, citing National Bank of Greece (Canada) v. Katsikonouris, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1029, at p. 1043 (emphasis added)).\nFurther, the logic underlying the proposition that the terms conditions and warranties are presumed to carry their established legal meaning is actually significantly weaker when applied to the terms identity and quality. Unlike conditions and warranties, the terms identity and quality will generally not be applicable to most contracts and they also do not form a substantial part of the entire structure and basis of the SGA. While a considerable portion of the SGA is premised on the distinction between conditions and warranties, the relevance of the distinction between identity and quality is confined to the applicability of s. 14. The demarcation between a goods identity and a goods quality is not so easily discernible, arises from the case law and is not even mentioned in the SGA. Finally, the term quality is used frequently in everyday conversation such that it has a much wider and more colloquial meaning as compared to the terms conditions and warranties. \nAn approach requiring the strict and unwavering application of a legally established distinction between terms is also inconsistent with case law that has held, for example, that goods sold as is oust the statutorily implied conditions even though they do not refer to conditions or the defining feature of the implied condition at issue, like identity, or fitness or merchantability (see Moldenhauer v. Alberta Powersports Inc., 2009 ABPC 118, at paras. 33-37 and 48 (CanLII); Conners v. McMillan, 2020 BCPC 230 (CanLII), at paras. 67-68). These cases also underscore how s. 53 requires only an express agreement and not express language.\nWith respect, the Court of Appeal placed too great an emphasis on the explicit language that was not used, instead of asking what the parties intended by the words they did employ in their commercial context. Little consideration was given to what the words would have reasonably meant to two parties who had discussed both the changing nature of the soils composition as well as its testing and delivery.  \nThe requirement that as a matter of law, the express agreement must be that explicit, direct and clear, is inconsistent with the broad language and wide purpose of s. 53 and to Sattvas flexible approach to contractual interpretation in which the overriding concern is to determine the intent of the parties and the scope of their understanding (para. 47). \nSection 53 does not say that express language referring to specific legal terms is necessary to capture the parties intention to oust legal liabilities under the SGA. In this context, an express agreement means that a court is able to reasonably ascertain the parties intention after reading the words of the contract in light of the factual matrix. Sattva and Tercon give priority to the parties objective intention and promote a more flexible approach better suited to assessing whether, and the extent to which, parties intended to negative implied statutory conditions. This is so because sometimes buyers and sellers may seek to displace all such conditions, or may select among them. They may replace them with other contractual terms or remove them entirely. The ousting of the statutory protection may be absolute or only arise conditionally when something else, like inspection, was not done. Further, the SGA and s. 53 apply to a broad spectrum of contract types, from those dealing with millions of dollars worth of equipment as in Hunter Engineering, to the simple sale of a used bicycle taking place in a sellers backyard. This range of circumstances and sophistication in contracting must be duly accounted for when interpreting a sale of goods contract. A proper application of the principles from Sattva and Tercon account for the varying contracting scenarios that can arise between different sets of parties.\nIf an express provision in a contract protects a party and the court concludes the provision was intended to operate in the circumstances which have occurred, the provision is to be given full effect. That is because commercial certainty is best served by the law giving effect to what was actually agreed to by the parties. Searching for the parties objective intention furthers that purpose, whereas the overly technical and legalistic interpretation of exclusion clauses does not.\nSummary of the Proper Approach to Interpreting Exclusion Clauses Under Section 53 of the Sale of Goods Act\nIn conclusion, because s. 53 requires an express agreement and s. 57(1) confirms the applicability of the common law as it exists from time to time, the principles from Sattva and Tercon extend to contracts for the sale of goods. While recognizing the need to balance protections for parties, freedom of contract and commercial certainty, exclusion clauses in sales contracts are not categorically distinct or subject to different or stricter rules of construction. The SGA must be read as a whole and while the legislature wanted to provide presumptive protections to parties, it also expressly allowed parties to opt out entirely from the implied statutory conditions. The express agreement contemplated by s. 53 of the SGA is to be interpreted and applied accordingly. \nIt is at the first step of the Tercon test where a court should determine whether there is an express agreement between the parties that is sufficient to meet the requirements of s. 53. To do so, a court must apply the principles of modern contractual interpretation, which involves, among other things, a consideration of the words used in the contract, the surrounding circumstances, who the contracting parties are and their level of contracting sophistication. The overall goal is to ascertain whether it was the objective intention of the contracting parties to exempt one party from statutorily imposed liability as permitted by s. 53.\nCourts tasked with deciding whether implied statutory conditions have been excluded from a contract will seek to ascertain the objective intention of the parties as manifested by the words chosen and the surrounding circumstances (Sattva, at para. 47). A flexible approach, focused on the objective intention of the parties, will allow courts to give effect to the parties bargain while taking into account the nature of the contract and the contracting parties, what the parties would have reasonably understood their words to mean and to ensure the parties objective intention is not thwarted by strict rules of interpretation and to control for unfairness by unconscionability and public policy considerations. \nAs the prevailing goal of contractual interpretation is to ascertain the objective intent of the parties, this necessarily requires a decision-maker to refer to the surrounding circumstances of a contract while at the same time ensuring that the surrounding circumstances do not overwhelm the words of [the] agreement (Sattva, at para. 57). This is so because using a sterile textual analysis of a contracts language without regard to the surrounding circumstances . . . is apt to lead to indeterminacy and brings a significant risk of inaccurate results (Hall, at p. 30). A consideration of the surrounding circumstances in this respect necessarily means that the words used by the parties cannot always be interpreted as having a meaning that has been well established in law. The meaning of the words used can largely depend on who the contracting parties are, their relationship to each other and their degree of contracting sophistication. The principles emerging from Sattva require this interpretive flexibility to account for the varying contracting scenarios that can arise between different sets of parties.\nIf the contract, by express provision, protects a party by ousting implied statutory terms and the court thinks the provision was intended to operate in the circumstances which have occurred, the provision is to be given full effect unless it is found, at steps two and three of the Tercon test, respectively, to have been unconscionable at the time the contract was made or if there are overriding public policy concerns that would compel a court to refuse to enforce it. That is because it was the objective intention of the parties and because commercial certainty is best served by the law giving effect to their actual bargain. Searching for the parties objective intention furthers that purpose, whereas an overly technical and legalistic interpretation of exclusion clauses does not. \nAn express agreement under s. 53 requires that the parties have expressly and unambiguously used language that signals their intention to override the statute. This means that silence or omission does not suffice. Nor can the court imply, impute or infer intention to opt out of the statute based on parties presumed intention. Section 53 requires an express agreement, not express language, and is far removed from setting a legal standard that insists on explicit, clear and direct language which speaks to the legal characterization of the terms at issue. There is no requirement for magic words. While the words of the agreement itself are undoubtedly important, Sattva allows a court to read these words with the surrounding circumstances in mind and does not mandate that words be strictly attributed with a singular, prescriptive meaning. It simply requires that any intention of the parties to exclude the SGA be grounded in the text, if the contract is a written one. To have an effective express agreement that satisfies s. 53, the parties joint intention must be declared and the exclusion clause must unambiguously vary or negative the statutorily implied obligation, based not only from the words of the contract itself, but also from an analysis of the surrounding circumstances (Sattva, at paras. 58-61). \nIn sum, any express agreement sufficient for the purposes of s. 53 must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be expressly set forth within the parties contract. One must be able to point to the contract and say, that exclusion clause ousts the operation of an implied term of the SGA.  \nClauses 6 and 7 Exempt Earthco From Liability Under Section 14\nUnder this approach to interpreting an express agreement under s. 53, it is clear that clauses 6 and 7 exempt Earthco from any statutorily imposed liability under s. 14 of the SGA. I conclude that the interpretation advanced by Pine Valley is at odds with s. 53 of the SGA; is out of step with the modern approach to both contractual interpretation and the legal treatment of exclusion clauses; and overstates the need for explicit language that refers to the precise legal character of the obligation at issue.\nAlthough the trial judge did not explicitly consider Sattva, his interpretation of the Contract is grounded firmly in the evidence and respects the objective intention of the parties. As stated previously, this stage of the analysis is placed squarely within step one of the Tercon test, which addresses whether a particular exclusion clause is applicable (para. 122). Step one from Tercon asks whether the exclusion clause at issue applies to the circumstances established in the evidence and includes a Courts assessment of the intention of the parties as expressed in the contract (para. 122). In this case, it is ultimately an exercise of determining if the parties had an express agreement, sufficient for the purposes of s. 53 of the SGA, as to what liability was being exempted by clauses 6 and 7. To determine as much, the modern contractual interpretation principles emerging from Sattva must be applied at this stage of the Tercon test. A court must ascertain the parties objective intention and look to the surrounding circumstances in order to determine if the exclusion clause is applicable. In order for an exclusion clause to be applicable in a case such as this, a court must conclude that the parties came to an express agreement sufficient to meet the requirements of s. 53 of the SGA. As I have previously stated, such an express agreement need not be comprised of particular or explicit language and what is deemed to be a sufficiently express agreement will vary depending on the contracting parties and the circumstances. Once it is determined that an exclusion clause is applicable and that it successfully exempts a party through s. 53 from any statutorily implied liability, the courts then ask whether the exclusion clause was unconscionable, and if it is not, whether the courts should decline to enforce it due to public policy considerations. \nThe starting point is that the parties must be taken to have some intention because they decided they needed to add bespoke exclusion clauses to the Contract. They had precise concerns that arose from this particular sale and its specific nature and they explicitly addressed them. The clauses they added are in simple language and were the product of their individual conversations and negotiations. These two clauses are contractual terms of utter particularity (Ledcor, at para. 41). Pine Valley and Earthco purposively inserted two express written clauses into their agreement to say that if the buyer waived its right to test and approve the goods, then the seller would not be responsible for their quality. Unlike the contract with Hunter U.S. in Hunter Engineering, the parties in the case at bar sought to negative liability and conveyed their intention about their legal relationship through words clearly directed to their agreed upon allocation of contractual risk. They have unequivocally expressed an objective intention to contract out of certain statutory protections.\nLooking to the words the parties chose, clause 6 can only mean that Pine Valley had the right to both test and approve the soil before delivery. On its face, clause 7 says that if the right to test and approve is waived, Pine Valley, not Earthco, will be responsible for the quality of the material once it leaves Earthcos facility (A.R., at p. 201). In this sense, the plain meaning of clauses 6 and 7 of the Contract was to explicitly, directly and clearly protect Earthco from liability for any defects should Pine Valley fail to test and approve the topsoil before shipping. \nQuality cannot be construed in isolation and must be interpreted as the parties reasonably intended and within their commercial context. Quality does not have an immutable or absolute meaning. These parties reasonably understood the word quality to describe and include all the attributes of the soil, including its ultimate composition. In this case, the parties clearly knew, or ought to have known, that by exempting liability for the quality of the soil, they were exempting liability for any percentage-based compositional deficiency. They used the word quality in its colloquial and commercial sense, and not in its legal sense. When ascertaining what the parties truly intended to exempt liability for, how those parties classify it is not as crucial as enforcing what the parties objectively intended to contract out of. In my view, they did not need to explicitly refer to conditions or identity to effect their desired result.  \nThe term quality must be also interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of formation of the contract (Sattva, at para. 47). Pine Valley was a commercial purchaser with years of experience in buying large quantities of soil. Pine Valley had direct input into the formation of the Contract based on the advice of Mr. Serrao, who also had significant training and experience with different soils, as well as access to the City Consultant. Both parties were aware of the changing nature of the topsoil, that the soil was sold in large bulk qualities and that the existing test results for it were dated.\nEarthco and Pine Valley used plain language in their bespoke contractual edits and there is no evidence these clauses were reviewed by legal professionals before the Contract was signed. It is unrealistic to expect these parties to know about the legal distinction between the terms identity and quality or, for that matter, between conditions and warranties. To further expect the parties to then explicitly include proper legal reference to these terms without knowing the legally significant difference between them is a commercially impractical expectation and takes the focus away from where it should be: how the parties reasonably understood, or ought to have understood, the words they used.\nIn this case, the parties were free to negotiate and allocate the risk of not testing the soil prior to delivery as they saw fit. Before the Contract was formed, Pine Valley was advised that Earthco was not taking responsibility for the quality of the soil once it left its facilities and that Pine Valley should have the soil tested before delivery. Mr. Outred wrote to Mr. Serrao and said: I think you should wait until the test is done but if you would like to start shipping at your own risk please let me know (A.R., at p. 136 (emphasis added); trial reasons, at para. 25). Mr. Valente specifically insisted on including the exclusion clauses in the Contract because they reflected the discussions that Earthco had had with Pine Valley up until that date outlining that if Pine Valley were to waive its right to pre-shipment testing of the soil, Earthco would assume no liability for the quality of the soil once it left its premises (trial reasons, at para. 75). Other post-contract evidence, which can only be used to assess what the parties objectively believed their agreement was at the time it was made, also shows that Earthco was no longer responsible for the material once it [left their] yard (A.R., at p. 151; trial reasons, at para. 29) and without testing, all risks would be assumed by Pine Valley (trial reasons, at para. 73; see also para. 29).  \nA key surrounding circumstance which helps to ascertain the objective intention of the parties is that Pine Valley was in a tremendous rush to receive the soil, given pressure from the City about ongoing delays and the looming threat of the imposition of liquidated damages. Pine Valley deliberately assumed the risk that the soil would not meet the Projects requirements, and chose not to test or approve the product before delivery simply because it needed the soil fast. It made its own conscious and strategic decision, based on its assessment of the possible risks associated with taking delivery before testing versus the near certain obligation of having to pay the City for every further working day of delay. \nIn the commercial context of the agreement, there was no unfairness in refusing to find Earthco liable for what the trial judge called Pine Valleys expensive but calculated mistake: the very purpose of clauses 6 and 7 was to avoid the exact situation in which a customer failed to test the product and then attempted to hold the supplier responsible for a loss (trial reasons, at para. 127). Interestingly, in Hunter Engineering, Wilson J. recognized, at p. 509: \nThe exclusion clause cannot be considered in isolation from the other provisions of the contract and the circumstances in which it was entered into. The purchaser may have been prepared to assume some risk if he could get the article at a modest price or if he was very anxious to get it. \nUltimately, the trial judge did not err by finding that Pine Valley knowingly chose to accept the risk of not testing the R Topsoil in favour of expediting the soils delivery so as to avoid liquidated damages for delaying the Project (para. 125). Having done so, Pine Valley cannot now claim liability for variations in the soil composition against Earthco after Pine Valley knowingly accepted the possibility that this could occur but refused to perform soil tests. To allow Pine Valley to do so would be to not give effect to the parties objective intention at the time of the Contracts formation, which would amount to a rejection of the principles of modern contractual interpretation post-Sattva and Tercon.\nThe parties stated intention and the surrounding circumstances of the Contracts formation all strongly support the conclusion that Pine Valley clearly accepted the risk that the soil might not be consistent with the August test results when it chose not to test the soil intended for delivery. That this was the parties true and overarching objective intent is demonstrated by the words used, how they were reasonably understood by the parties and the surrounding circumstances. The trial judges thorough and well-reasoned approach, which considered the exclusion clauses in harmony with the rest of the Contract and in light of its purposes, the surrounding circumstances and the commercial context, was clearly in line with the modern approach to contractual interpretation as developed by cases such as Sattva and Tercon (Sattva, at para. 47; Tercon, at para. 64). \nThe trial judge made no error in finding that the exclusion clauses agreed on by the parties were clear and unambiguous and worked to insulate Earthco from all liability because to hold otherwise would have defeated the parties objective intention (paras. 117 and 126). Ultimately, the parties in this case came to an express agreement about the allocation of risk, by using direct, clear and express language in their contract, which demonstrated that their objective intention was for Pine Valley to waive its right to pursue Earthco for any liability relating to the soil.\nAs mentioned, the Court of Appeal erred by holding that there was an extricable question of law in the case at bar meriting a correctness review. On the applicable deferential standard of review, I am of the view that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his findings of fact. The principles from Sattva were properly applied by the trial judge to support his finding that the parties had an express agreement that Earthco would not be liable for any issues relating to the composition of the soil. I wish to reiterate that the context and surrounding circumstances certainly do not serve to change or replace the words used in the agreement; rather, they are used as helpful interpretive tools, which is exactly how the trial judge used them in the case at bar.\nBefore concluding, I note an alternative argument advanced by the seller before this Court, but not before the Court of Appeal, that the sale between Earthco and Pine Valley was not in fact a sale by description and consequently, the failure to supply soil with the specified percentages of sand, silt and clay was not a breach of s. 14 but rather a breach of a contractual promise relating to the quality of the goods, which fell squarely within the scope of the exclusion clauses (see C. Bangsund, Two Wrongs Dont Make a Right: A Case Comment on Pine Valley Enterprises Inc. v. Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc. (2023), 67 Can. Bus. L.J. 476, at p. 499). While Pine Valley does not object to this Court addressing this new argument, I nevertheless decline to do so in light of my ultimate conclusion that the exclusion clauses were sufficient to exempt Earthco from liability under s. 14 of the SGA.\nDisposition\nFor the reasons above, I would allow Earthcos appeal, set aside the Court of Appeals order and restore the trial judges judgment, with costs throughout. \n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tCote J.  \nOverview\nThis appeal concerns the interpretation of certain provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.1 (SGA), and their application to a contract for the sale of topsoil. More specifically, it involves determining whether and how parties can contract out of an implied condition under that Act.\nThe appellant, Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc. (Earthco), and the respondent, Pine Valley Enterprises Inc. (Pine Valley), entered into a contract for the sale of topsoil with a composition agreed upon on the basis of test results (Contract). In clauses 6 and 7 of the Contract (Exclusion Clauses), the parties agreed that Earthco, the seller, would not be responsible for the quality of the topsoil if Pine Valley, the buyer, waived its right to test the topsoil before it was shipped. After the topsoil was delivered, it was discovered that it did not have the composition Pine Valley had bargained for. Pine Valley now seeks damages arising from this breach.\nThe main issue in this appeal is whether the Exclusion Clauses together constitute an express agreement within the meaning of s. 53 of the SGA so as to exclude liability for a breach of any statutory condition arising under a contract for the sale of goods, including the conditions in ss. 14 and 15 of the SGA. Section 14 implies a condition that the goods delivered will correspond with the description agreed upon in the contract. The condition in s. 14 is distinct from the condition in s. 15, which pertains to the quality or fitness for the purpose of the goods. The answer to the question of whether the Exclusion Clauses expressly exclude liability for a breach of the implied condition in s. 14 or 15 turns in part on the proper interpretation of the requirement, set out in s. 53, that parties intending to contract out of a statutorily implied condition arising do so by express agreement.\nThere is no reason to depart from our Courts previous interpretation in Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 426, regarding what is required to exclude liability where the SGA applies. As our Court held in that case, if parties wish to exclude liability for a breach of a statutorily implied condition by express agreement, they must do so using clear and direct language (p. 450). Although this legal standard does not require the use of any magic words, it does require the parties to express their intention to exclude liability for a statutorily implied term with language inconsistent with that term. This is the conclusion that must be reached when the words express agreement are read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme and purpose of the SGA. The decisions of our Court in Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways), 2010 SCC 4, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 69, and Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, have not altered this statutory requirement.\nIn my view, the Exclusion Clauses are not an express agreement within the meaning of s. 53 of the SGA to exclude Earthcos liability for a breach of the implied condition in s. 14 that goods sold by description will correspond with their description  in this case, that the soil supplied would have the composition established in the test results from August 2011, as bargained for by the parties. An exclusion clause is not an express agreement under s. 53 with regard to a particular implied condition if interpreting it as such requires deviating from the text of the contract and asking what the surrounding circumstances would deem the parties to have written, instead of interpreting the meaning of the words actually used by the parties. Interpreting the surrounding circumstances in isolation from the text of the contract is inconsistent with Sattva. The trial judge also misdirected himself in interpreting and applying the standard imposed by s. 53. The trial judge improperly relied on the factual matrix to change the meaning of the word quality used by the parties in the Exclusion Clauses from its ordinary and grammatical meaning to a meaning that included the identity of the goods. This was unsupported by the text of the Contract and inconsistent with the scheme of SGA, which was a vital part of the commercial setting in which the parties contracted. Such an approach, which disregards the law governing the sale of goods contract, was inconsistent with the well-established clear and direct language requirement articulated by our Court in Hunter Engineering. This constitutes an error of law reviewable on a standard of correctness, as established in Sattva.\nContext\nOn the whole, I agree with my colleagues description of the factual background and summary of the decisions below. However, I wish to highlight certain points that circumscribe the issue in the present appeal.\nAt first instance, the trial judge determined that while Pine Valley had waived its right to test the soil, it had not waived its right to receive the soil it had bargained for, namely R Topsoil with the composition established in test results from August 2011  46 percent sand, 36 percent silt, and 18 percent clay. The trial judge noted that Pine Valley had not received soil with the composition established in those tests results, given the significant variation between the soil promised and the soil delivered (2020 ONSC 601, at para. 103 (CanLII)).\nThe trial judge found that the Contract entered into by the parties was a sale by description and that the soil supplied by Earthco did not match the agreed-upon description. In determining whether the parties intended to exclude Earthcos liability for failing to supply topsoil corresponding with the agreed-upon description, the trial judge proceeded in two steps.\nAt the first step of the analysis, he examined whether, under the test established in Tercon with regard to the enforceability of exclusion clauses, the Exclusion Clauses applied to the circumstances of the dispute. In this respect, the trial judge found that the parties had contemplated that Earthco would not be contractually responsible for the quality of the material once it left its facility if Pine Valley failed to test and approve the soil before it was shipped (para. 89). According to him, the word quality included all aspects of the soil that could be subject to testing . . . includ[ing] the texture or the composition of the soil (para. 91).\nAt the second step of the analysis, the trial judge examined whether the implied condition in s. 14 of the SGA was ousted by the Exclusion Clauses. He concluded that the Exclusion Clauses, because they removed Earthcos responsibility for quality, could exclude any statutory liability, if Pine Valley failed to test the soil before it was shipped (para. 119). Therefore, the Exclusion Clauses ousted liability for a breach of the condition implied by s. 14 of the SGA that the goods would correspond with their description. But for the Exclusion Clauses, the trial judge would have awarded damages assessed at $350,386.23 (para. 142).\nThe question before our Court is whether the trial judge misdirected himself in determining whether the Exclusion Clauses were an express agreement within the meaning of s. 53 of the SGA to exclude the implied condition in s. 14. This was the main focus of the Court of Appeals decision. Pine Valley argued that the Exclusion Clauses were not an express agreement within the meaning of s. 53, because this provision requires the parties to use explicit, clear, and direct exclusionary language. According to Pine Valley, given the distinction between the identity and the quality of the goods under ss. 14 and 15, the parties, by using the word quality, had not expressly agreed to exclude statutory liability in relation to soil that did not match its contractual description.\nBefore the Court of Appeal, Earthco did not challenge a number of the trial judges findings: that the Contract was a sale of goods by description within the meaning of s. 14 of the SGA; that the soil being sold was described as R Topsoil with the composition established in the August 2011 test results and was not just any soil; and that the soil supplied did not correspond with that description (2022 ONCA 265, 161 O.R. (3d) 103, at paras. 3, 9, 18, 26 and 43, quoting trial reasons, at para. 100). The outcome of the dispute therefore turned entirely on the interpretation and application of ss. 14, 15 and 53 of the SGA.\nZarnett J.A., for a unanimous court, determined that the trial judge had erred in concluding that the Exclusion Clauses ousted all statutory liability under the SGA, including for breaching the statutory condition that the soil would correspond with the description agreed upon on the basis of the test results for R Topsoil. Zarnett J.A. identified three extricable questions of law: the legal nature of the condition in s. 14 of the SGA, the standard imposed by the express agreement requirement in s. 53, and the use of the factual matrix to inform the meaning of the express exclusionary language (paras. 35-36). In his view, s. 53 requires parties to use an express agreement[, i.e.,] composed of explicit, clear and direct language to exclude statutorily implied conditions (para. 7).\nAnalysis\nStandard of Review\nIn a civil litigation context like this one, it is well established that statutory interpretation  which is distinct from contractual interpretation  is a question of law subject to the standard of review of correctness (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 8; Teal Cedar Products Ltd. v. British Columbia, 2017 SCC 32, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 75-76). In contrast, a trial judges interpretation of a contract is owed deference on appeal; unless there is an extricable question of law, the standard of review is that of palpable and overriding error (Sattva, at para. 53). Where an extricable question of law is identified, the applicable standard of review is correctness.\nThe Principles of Statutory Interpretation Apply\nThe provisions of the SGA under scrutiny in the present appeal are ss. 14, 15 and 53. The meaning of these provisions must be determined first and foremost by applying the relevant principles of statutory interpretation. The interpretation of the express agreement requirement in s. 53 is distinct from the interpretation of the Contract. What constitutes an express agreement may vary, but what an express agreement requires does not. Any legal standard that s. 53 creates applies equally to all contracts that fall within the ambit of the SGA.\nThe SGA was first enacted in 1927. Like its other provincial counterparts, it is closely modelled on the Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893 (U.K.), 56 & 57 Vict., c. 71. The Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893 was built on and reflected many of the common law principles applicable to the sale of goods in England at the time. While its full title was An Act for codifying the Law relating to the Sale of Goods, it did not completely displace the common law: . . . the common law . . . has had and continues to have a significant impact upon the development of the law [on the sale of goods] (E. McKendrick, Sale of Goods, in P. Birks, ed., English Private Law, vol. II (2000), 223, at para. 10.02). The purpose of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893 was, as its drafter wrote, to lay down clear rules in an area of the law where the certainty of the rule is often of more importance than the substance of the rule (M. D. Chalmers, The Sale of Goods Act, 1893, Including the Factors Acts, 1889 & 1890 (2nd ed. rev. 1894), at pp. v-vi).\nThe SGA, like the Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893, may not be a complete codification of the law on the sale of goods, but it remains a codifying statute. Lord Herschell wrote in Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers, [1891] A.C. 107 (H.L.), at p. 145, that the object of a codifying statute has been said to be that on any point specifically dealt with by it, the law should be ascertained by interpreting the language used instead of . . . roaming over a vast number of authorities. As with all statutory interpretation, the first step is to interpret the language of the statute to ascertain the expressed legislative intent. While legislation must be interpreted in light of the context of the common law, developments in the common law cannot override the express language of a statute. This is especially plain in view of s. 57(1) of the SGA, which provides that [t]he rules of the common law, including the law merchant, except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act . . . continue to apply to contracts for the sale of goods. The SGAs provisions must be read in light of the common law of contract, but they are to be given precedence where any inconsistency arises.\nAs a result, the issue before us is, first and foremost, one of statutory interpretation. The legal standard that the legislature intended to impose for ousting any statutorily implied condition arising under a contract for the sale of goods must be determined by reading the words express agreement in s. 53 of the SGA and the conditions in ss. 14 and 15 of the SGA in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of [the legislature] (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26). When the words of a provision are precise and unequivocal, the ordinary meaning of the words plays a dominant role in the interpretive process (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10; Celgene Corp. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 1, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 21).\nThe Legal Standard for Ousting an Implied Condition Under the SGA\nTerms Arising Under Contracts for the Sale of Goods by Implication of Law\nThe SGA provides protections to buyers in the sale of goods context by implying certain conditions into each contract for the sale of goods. The codification of such conditions, which were originally implied at common law, is [t]he final stag[e] in the journey of their development, when a baleful eye is cast on attempts to exclude or limit [them] in the contract (M. G. Bridge, Sale of Goods (1988), at pp. 428-29; see also M. G. Bridge, The Sale of Goods (4th ed. 2019), at p. 388). Most relevant to this appeal are the statutory conditions that the goods will correspond with their description (s. 14), will be fit for their purpose (s. 15 para. 1), and will be of merchantable quality (s. 15 para. 2). Each of these statutory conditions creates distinct rights, duties, and liabilities for the parties to a contract for the sale of goods, and it is important not to conflate them.\nSection 14 sets out an implied condition that the goods delivered under a contract for the sale of goods by description will correspond with their description:\n14 Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods will correspond with the description, and, if the sale is by sample as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.\nThe purpose of s. 14 of the SGA is to protect the buyers reliance on the sellers representations going to the description of the goods by incorporating into the contract an implied condition that the goods will correspond with that description. Establishing a breach of s. 14 involves a two-step analysis. It is first necessary to determine whether the contract is a sale by description within the meaning of s. 14. If so, it is then necessary to determine whether the goods delivered corresponded with their agreed-upon description (Bridge (2019), at pp. 389-92; C. Bangsund, Two Wrongs Dont Make a Right: A Case Comment on Pine Valley Enterprises Inc. v. Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc. (2023), 67 Can. Bus. L.J. 476, at pp. 499-500). I agree with my colleague that this is a fact-specific determination that turns on whether a statement describing the goods being sold was made and reasonably relied upon (Ashington Piggeries Ltd. v. Christopher Hill Ltd., [1972] A.C. 441 (H.L.), at p. 503, per Lord Diplock, cited in Bakker v. Bowness Auto Parts Co. Ltd. (1976), 68 D.L.R. (3d) 173 (Alta. S.C. (App. Div.)), at p. 178).\nWhile s. 14 of the SGA offers protection to the buyer with regard to the identity of the goods sold, this provision is to be distinguished from s. 15 of the SGA, which is broadly directed at their quality. In particular, s. 15 para. 1 sets out an implied condition that the goods sold will be reasonably fit for their purpose, and s. 15 para. 2 sets out an implied condition that they will be of merchantable quality:\n15 Subject to this Act and any statute in that behalf, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, except as follows:\n\n1. Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required so as to show that the buyer relies on the sellers skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description that it is in the course of the sellers business to supply (whether the seller is the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods will be reasonably fit for such purpose, but in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.\n\n2. Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description (whether the seller is the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods will be of merchantable quality, but if the buyer has examined the goods, there is no implied condition as regards defects that such examination ought to have revealed.\nThe conditions in ss. 14 and 15 of the SGA arise under all contracts of sale by implication of law unless the contracting parties have taken the pains to exclude or limit them (Bridge (1988), at p. 427; see also Bridge (2019), at p. 387). In the present case, given that a breach of the implied condition in s. 14 is alleged and that exclusion clauses are raised as a defence, it is necessary to determine whether and how parties can contract out of an implied condition under the SGA.\nSection 53 of the SGA\nThe common law of contract is fundamentally committed to respecting the freedom of the contracting parties to shape their agreement as they deem fit (see Printing and Numerical Registering Co. v. Sampson (1875), L.R. 19 Eq. 462, at p. 465). The SGA does not prevent the parties from doing so. On the contrary, they are free to contract out of any right, duty or liability arising under a contract for the sale of goods by implication of law. However, s. 53 precisely delineates the manner in which the parties can demonstrate their intention to vary or exclude statutory liability:\n53 Where any right, duty or liability would arise under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage, if the usage is such as to bind both parties to the contract.\nThis provision sets out three distinct routes for ousting liability arising in the context of the SGA, namely usage, the course of dealing between the parties, and express agreement. First, usage, in appropriate circumstances and when proven, can be considered part of the contract for the sale of goods so as to negative or vary any right, duty, or liability arising by implication of law (see Produce Brokers Co., Ltd. v. Olympia Oil and Cake Co., Ltd., [1916] 1 A.C. 314 (H.L.)). Second, the parties can be taken to have agreed, through their conduct in previous transactions, that a right, duty, or liability arising by implication of law will be varied or excluded (Continental Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Trunk Trailer Co. Ltd., 1985 S.C. 163 (1st Div.), at pp. 169-70, citing McCutcheon v. David MacBrayne Ltd., 1964 S.C. (H.L.) 28, at p. 35). This requires the parties to have conducted business together before. Third, in keeping with freedom of contract, the parties are free to structure their contract as they see fit by express agreement (K. P. McGuinness, Sale & Supply of Goods (2nd ed. 2010), at 6.6).\nIn the present case, it is not contended that the implied condition in s. 14 was negatived or varied by the course of dealing between the parties or by usage binding on both parties. Pine Valley and Earthco did not have a pre-existing business relationship, and the Contract was their first agreement. No evidence of usage was presented. Earthco is arguing only that its liability for the breach, if any, of the implied condition in s. 14 was negatived by express agreement, in the form of the Exclusion Clauses. The focus must therefore be on the meaning of the words express agreement.\nWhile s. 53 is broadly directed at allowing parties to contract out of statutorily implied conditions, this does not mean that the legislative intent is to permit them to contract out of statutory liability whenever they may have intended to do so, regardless of how their intentions are expressed. By delineating three distinct routes for departing from the rights, duties, and liabilities arising under a contract of sale by implication of law, the legislature has set clear standards for ousting liability for breaches of statutory conditions. That the routes are distinct is made clear by the use of the word or to separate each of them textually (by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties or by usage). The availability of distinct routes, besides that of an express agreement, does not dilute the requirement that there be an express agreement, but instead reinforces it. It is not incongruous that s. 53 allows the parties to exclude liability without recourse to an express agreement in some cases  that is, where this is implied by the course of dealing between the parties or by usage  but not in all.\nThe Meaning of Express Agreement\nTurning now to the meaning of express agreement, I am of the view that this expression requires the parties to manifest their intention to exclude liability using clear and direct language, that is, language inconsistent with the terms the legislature sought to imply in the contract. This interpretation of the requirement in s. 53 of the SGA is the one that must prevail when the words express agreement are read in their entire context  including the common law as it currently stands  and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, in light of the scheme and purpose of the SGA.\nClear and Direct Language\nAn express agreement requires that statutory liability be excluded through language, not merely implicitly through inferences drawn from the surrounding circumstances of the contract. This much is clear from the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words express agreement when read together and separately as well as in their broader context. In determining the meaning of the words express and agreement, it is helpful to keep in mind that s. 53 of the SGA is a simple application of the general legal maxims [e]xpressum facit cessare tacitum and [m]odus et conventio vincunt legem (Chalmers, at pp. 103-4). The scheme of the SGA itself distinguishes between what is express and what is implied (ss. 12(3), 15, 16(1) and 28(1)). What is express, in this context, is contrasted with what is silent or left unspoken. It necessarily involves either spoken or written language.\nIt is true that s. 53 refers to the necessity of an express agreement rather than express language. While agreement relates to the legal content that the parties objectively contemplated, and not merely the language of the contract, the parties are dependent on words to express that content (F. Wilmot-Smith, Express and Implied Terms (2023), 43 Oxford J. Leg. Stud. 54, at p. 60; S. M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts (8th ed. 2022), at p. 103). The requirement that the agreement be express indicates that the parties must manifest their intention to exclude liability through language, and this intention cannot be inferred from conduct or from other terms of their contract.\nGenerally, an agreed-upon term will be express if it has been specifically mentioned by the parties (G. H. L. Fridman, The Law of Contract in Canada (6th ed. 2011), at p. 433). This is consistent with the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the word express. An express agreement is [d]irectly and distinctly stated, [d]eclared in terms and set forth in words (Blacks Law Dictionary (6th ed. 1990), at p. 580). Put simply, it requires direct and appropriate language; what the parties agreed upon must be [c]lear; definite; explicit; plain; direct; unmistakable; not dubious or ambiguous (p. 580). Again, what is express is distinguished from what is ambiguous, implied, or inferred from conduct.\nAny inquiry to determine whether the parties expressly agreed to negative or vary a right, duty, or liability must focus on the words of their agreement. Indeed, an express agreement is clearly distinguished, within the scheme of the SGA, from the intention of the parties as revealed by a contextual analysis. In the sale of goods context, where the legislature intends the circumstances of the contract to govern the determination of whether a right, duty, or liability applies, it provides so expressly. For example, certain provisions of the SGA apply only in the absence of evidence to the contrary (ss. 20(2), 31(1), 48(3), 49(3) and 51(3)) or [u]nless otherwise agreed (ss. 21, 27, 28(5), 30(1), 32, 33(2) and 35). Other provisions expressly call for the court to look at the circumstances of the case in ascertaining the parties intentions with respect to the timing of the transfer of property (s. 18(2)); determining whether a breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract or severable (s. 30(2)), and determining what is a reasonable contract for the delivery of the goods (s. 31(2)).\nThis interpretation of express agreement in s. 53 of the SGA emphasizing the importance of the words chosen by the parties is further supported by a distinction that applies in the context of ss. 13, 14 and 15 of the SGA. Whereas any liability arising from ss. 14 and 15 must be ousted by express agreement, the rights, duties, and liabilities provided for in s. 13 apply [i]n a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of the contract are such as to show a different intention. I do not take this to mean that the parties cannot oust any liability arising from ss. 14 and 15. However, in order to grasp the meaning of express agreement and what it requires, the distinction drawn by the scheme of the SGA between an express agreement and the surrounding circumstances of the contract must be taken into account. In particular, the common law of contract, if it were incompatible with this distinction, could not be relied upon to set it aside. This would be inconsistent with the express provisions of the SGA. The legislature does not speak in vain (Attorney General of Quebec v. Carrieres Ste-Therese Ltee, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 831, at p. 838; Canada (Attorney General) v. JTI-Macdonald Corp., 2007 SCC 30, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, at para. 87; R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 89).\nThe foregoing is in line with Hunter Engineering, a binding precedent of our Court. In the context of s. 53 of the SGA, express agreement requires the use of language that is sufficiently clear to indicate that the parties objectively intended to oust the liability imposed by the SGA. In Hunter Engineering, a conflict arose in the context of two contracts for the supply of gearboxes, which had failed. The supplier could not be held contractually liable for the design fault because the failure was discovered after the contractual warranty period specified in the two contracts had expired. The first contract provided that the express contractual term represented the suppliers only warranty and that no other warranty or conditions, statutory or otherwise shall be implied (p. 439). The second contract had no clause of that sort. The supplier argued that the mere presence of the express warranty sufficed to render the implied condition of fitness for purpose contained in s. 15 para. 1 of the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 421, inapplicable.\nDickson C.J. rejected this argument in light of both ss. 15 para. 4 and 53 of the Act, which are identical in content to the equivalent provisions of the SGA now in force. According to s. 15 para. 4, [a]n express warranty or condition does not negative a warranty or condition implied by this Act unless inconsistent therewith (p. 487). On the basis of this provision, Dickson C.J. correctly held that [t]he mere presence of an express warranty in the contract does not mean that the statutory warranties are inconsistent (p. 449). Turning his mind specifically to s. 53, he added that while the parties can contract out of statutory protections, this must be done by clear and direct language, particularly where the parties are two large, commercially sophisticated companies (pp. 449-50). The express warranty clause in the second contract did not meet that standard. However, the exclusion clause in the first contract was sufficient to exclude the operation of the implied warranty (p. 449). Wilson J., dissenting, but not on this point, also found that the implied warranty in s. 15 para. 1 was not excluded by the express terms of the second contract, because clear and unambiguous language is required to oust an implied statutory warranty (p. 497).\nWith respect, there is no reason to depart from the interpretation of express agreement in s. 53 of the SGA that was established by our Court in Hunter Engineering. This interpretation is consistent with the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words express agreement, construed in light of the scheme and purpose of the SGA. Put simply, in the context of the SGA, an express agreement is distinct from what can be inferred from the conduct of the parties (in both previous and present dealings), usage, or the surrounding circumstances of the contract. The legislature has established such a standard to protect the reasonable expectations of both contracting parties in an area of the law where certainty and predictability are most important. As the drafter wrote in his commentary on the Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893, commercial parties are taken to know their respective legal positions before entering into a contract of sale (see Chalmers, at pp. v-vi). If they intend to negative or vary any statutory right, duty or liability, they must express this intention using clear and direct language.\nLanguage Inconsistent With the Terms the Legislature Sought To Imply\nAn express agreement to exclude statutory liability in a contract for the sale of goods is one in which the language used by the parties is clear and direct having regard to the subject matter of the purported exclusion. In other words, the language must be inconsistent with the terms the legislature sought to imply in the contract by way of the SGA.\nThe Court of Appeal was right to emphasize the difference between ss. 14 and 15 of the SGA (paras. 39 and 43). Much turns on the distinction between the two in the present case. The implied condition in s. 14 that the identity of the goods will correspond to their description in the contract is not interchangeable with the implied conditions in s. 15 paras. 1 and 2 that the goods will be reasonably fit for their purpose and will be of merchantable quality. The delivery of defective goods may breach one or more of the conditions set out in ss. 14 and 15 as a matter of fact, but the conditions have distinct legal content; the two sections are to some extent mutually exclusive (M. Bridge, ed., Benjamins Sale of Goods (12th ed. 2024), vol. 1, at p. 572). If the goods delivered correspond with their description, the fact that they are of poorer quality than promised will not be relevant in determining whether there was a breach of s. 14 (C.A. reasons, at para. 40). On the other hand, if the goods delivered do not correspond with their description, the fact that their quality is equivalent to that promised will not absolve the seller from liability under s. 14 (para. 42).\nAny intention to exclude liabilities arising from both ss. 14 and 15 must be expressed in clear and direct language, that is, language inconsistent with the content of the conditions in those sections. In this respect, the Court of Appeal was correct in stating that clear and direct language means at the very least that the language must refer to the type of legal obligation the SGA implies  reference to a different legal obligation will not suffice (para. 56). Indeed, s. 53 expressly refers to negativing or varying a particular right, duty or liability arising under a contract of sale by implication of law.\nThis is not to say that the parties are required to use magic words, such as condition or warranty, or to make explicit reference to a specific section of the SGA or to the statutory nature of the liability. But when the parties choose to write down what they have agreed upon  as the parties decided to do here  courts will attribute precise legal meaning to technical terms used (C. Twigg-Flesner, R. Canavan and H. MacQueen, Atiyah and Adams Sale of Goods (13th ed. 2016), at p. 204). The parties must use language that is clearly and directly aimed at excluding the content of the conditions they purport to negative or vary. Where only a particular duty is excluded by the language used by the parties, all other duties remain. Conversely, when the parties intend to exclude one or more of the conditions implied by the SGA, the language used must encompass the legal content of all the relevant conditions. Should the parties fail to use language that unambiguously encompasses the implied condition or warranty in question, no express agreement can be said to have been concluded (see Benjamins Sale of Goods, at pp. 682-83).\nIn Wallis, Son & Wells v. Pratt & Haynes, [1911] A.C. 394 (H.L.), the House of Lords held that a clause that excludes all express or implied liability for a breach of warranty does not exclude liability for a breach of condition. Referring to the relevant provisions of the Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893, Lord Alverstone C.J. wrote that legal effect must be given to the distinction between warranty and condition and to the different consequences flowing from . . . one stipulation [or] the other (p. 398). The parties could not be taken to have expressly agreed to negative or vary any liability arising from a breach of condition by using the word warranty. This reasoning has been consistently applied ever since, including recently by apex courts in other jurisdictions where a legal regime derived from the Imperial Sale of Goods Act, 1893 applies (see Advance Rumely Thresher Co. v. Lester, [1927] 4 D.L.R. 51 (Ont. S.C. (App. Div.)), at pp. 59-60; McNichol v. Dominion Motors Ltd. (1930), 24 Alta. L.R. 441 (S.C. (App. Div.)), at p. 444; Gregorio v. Intrans-Corp. (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 527 (C.A.), at pp. 535-36; Cork v. Greavette Boats Ltd., [1940] O.R. 352 (C.A.); Murray v. Sperry Rand Corp. (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 456 (H.C.J.), at p. 464; Chabot v. Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 162 (H.C.J.), at p. 175; Keefer Laundry Ltd. v. Pellerin Milnor Corp., 2008 BCSC 1119, 49 B.L.R. (4th) 222, at paras. 102-4; Kobelt Manufacturing Co. v. Pacific Rim Engineered Products (1987) Ltd., 2011 BCSC 224, 84 B.L.R. (4th) 189, at para. 150; IPEX Inc. v. Lubrizol Advanced Materials Canada Inc., 2012 ONSC 2717, 4 B.L.R. (5th) 148, at paras. 40-41; Brantford Engineering and Construction Ltd. v. Underground Specialties Cambridge Inc., 2014 ONSC 4726, 33 B.L.R. (5th) 239, at paras. 119-20; Haliburton Forest & Wildlife Reserve Ltd. v. Toromont Industries Ltd., 2016 ONSC 3767, at para. 77 (CanLII); see also Herbert Construction Company Ltd. v. Carter Holt Harvey Ltd., [2013] NZHC 780, at para. 46 (NZLII)). This is because the scheme of such legislation firmly distinguishes contractual terms that constitute conditions, the performance of which is fundamental to the contract, from those that constitute simple warranties, which are collateral to the main purpose of the contract (see, e.g., SGA, s. 1(1) quality of goods and warranty).\nLikewise, an attempted exclusion of liability may fail because the words used by the parties are directed at excluding liability with respect to the quality of the goods when the defect is instead related to their identity (G. H. L. Fridman, Sale of Goods in Canada (6th ed. 2013), at p. 249). This is why a contract for the sale of goods as is or with all faults will generally exclude liability for defects in the quality of the goods but not for discrepancies with their description (see Benjamins Sale of Goods, at p. 686). For instance, the context of the decisions in each of Moldenhauer v. Alberta Powersports Inc., 2009 ABPC 118, and Conners v. McMillan, 2020 BCPC 230, makes clear that the implied terms excluded by a clause providing that the goods were sold as is pertained only to their quality, not to their description. In this respect, I can put it no better than Zarnett J.A. did: Just as an exclusion that speaks to implied warranties does not exclude implied conditions because of the legal difference between those terms, an exclusion of responsibility for quality cannot exclude an implied statutory condition imposing responsibility for the identity of the goods, which covers different legal territory (C.A. reasons, at para. 59). The common law of contract does not make it possible to erase the statutory distinction between the correspondence of the goods with their description (their identity) and their merchantable quality or fitness for purpose (their quality).\nThe Role of Modern Principles of Contractual Interpretation\nRecent developments in the common law of contract cannot alter and have not altered the requirement that parties intending to contract out of a statutorily implied condition do so by express agreement. Any rule of the common law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the SGA must be set aside, as explained above (s. 57(1)). This is not to say that modern principles of contractual interpretation play no role in determining whether an exclusion clause constitutes an express agreement to exclude a given statutorily implied condition, or that a departure from these principles is necessary. No one is suggesting that s. 53 of the SGA has fossilized the law of contractual interpretation. But the exercise of contractual interpretation cannot be conducted in a manner that disregards the law governing the contract.\nIn Sattva, Rothstein J. was careful not to suggest that the surrounding circumstances of the contract can be relied upon as an alternative way to ascertain the objective intention of the parties. The interpretation of a written contract must always be grounded in the text, and contractual provisions must be read in light of the entire contract (para. 57). The facts surrounding the formation of a contract can be considered to clarify what the parties objectively intended by elucidating the meaning of the words used (Corner Brook (City) v. Bailey, 2021 SCC 29, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 540, at para. 19). This is not an invitation for a reviewing court to deviate from, modify, or contradict the words used in the contract, however compelling or fair the result may seem: While the surrounding circumstances will be considered in interpreting the terms of a contract, they must never be allowed to overwhelm the words of that agreement . . . (Sattva, at para. 57 (emphasis added)). This would defeat the reasonable expectations of the parties with respect to the meaning of the contract  contrary to [t]he principal function of the law of contracts, which is to protect such expectations  and create great commercial uncertainty (Waddams, at p. 97; see also Resolute FP Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 60, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 394, at para. 74; Elias v. Western Financial Group Inc., 2017 MBCA 110, 417 D.L.R. (4th) 695, at paras. 76-77).\nTo interpret a written contract, a reviewing court must give the words used in the contract their ordinary and grammatical meaning, consistent with the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of formation of the contract (Sattva, at para. 47). The goal of this exercise is to ascertain the objective intentions of the parties, that is, to determine what the parties reasonably understood the words to mean at the time. The surrounding circumstances serve to deepen a decision-makers understanding of the mutual and objective intentions of the parties as expressed in the words of the contract (para. 57).\nThe same practical, common-sense approach (Sattva, at para. 47) prevails with regard to exclusion clauses. The law recognizes that contracting parties are free to shape their agreement and allocate risks, including the consequences of deficient performance, as they deem fit. The relevant question is whether, as a matter of ordinary contractual interpretation, the exclusion clause . . . applies to the circumstances established in evidence (Tercon, at para. 122 (emphasis deleted)).\nIn the sale of goods context, however, the analysis must proceed on the assumption that the parties objectively intended to accept the rights, duties, and liabilities arising under the SGA. Such an approach reflects the policy choice, enshrined in s. 53, to give primacy to legislative purposes, unless the parties have clearly expressed their intention for a different private ordering of their rights and obligations (G. R. Hall, Canadian Contractual Interpretation Law (4th ed. 2020), at p. 179). Terms implied by the SGA do not depend on the actual intention of the parties but on a rule of law, such as the terms, warranties or conditions which, if not expressly excluded, the law imports (Luxor (Eastbourne), Ld. v. Cooper, [1941] A.C. 108 (H.L.), at p. 137, per Lord Wright). The purpose of the SGA is to provide commercial certainty for the contracting parties. There is nothing unfair or unrealistic in assuming that the parties knew their respective legal positions in entering into the contract. This was emphasized by Lord Diplock in Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd., [1980] A.C. 827 (H.L.), at pp. 850-51, as follows:\nSince the presumption is that the parties by entering into the contract intended to accept the implied obligations exclusion clauses are to be construed strictly and the degree of strictness appropriate to be applied to their construction may properly depend upon the extent to which they involve departure from the implied obligations. Since the obligations implied by law in a commercial contract are those which, by judicial consensus over the years or by Parliament in passing a statute, have been regarded as obligations which a reasonable businessman would realise that he was accepting when he entered into a contract of a particular kind, the courts view of the reasonableness of any departure from the implied obligations which would be involved in construing the express words of an exclusion clause in one sense that they are capable of bearing rather than another, is a relevant consideration in deciding what meaning the words were intended by the parties to bear. But this does not entitle the court to reject the exclusion clause, however unreasonable the court itself may think it is, if the words are clear and fairly susceptible of one meaning only.\nThis principle was recently reaffirmed by Lord Leggatt J.S.C. in Triple Point Technology Inc. v. PTT Public Co. Ltd., [2021] UKSC 29, [2021] A.C. 1148, at paras. 106-13. In keeping with such an approach, a court must bear in mind that a reasonable person would not take commercial parties to have intended to exclude rights, duties, and liabilities implied by the SGA unless that intention has been expressed in sufficiently clear words (paras. 108-10; see also Stocznia Gdynia S.A. v. Gearbulk Holdings Ltd., [2009] EWCA Civ 75, [2010] Q.B. 27, at para. 23; Whitecap Leisure Ltd. v. John H. Rundle Ltd., [2008] EWCA Civ 429, [2008] 2 Lloyds Rep. 216, at para. 20; Seadrill Management Services Ltd. v. OAO Gazprom, [2010] EWCA Civ 691, [2011] 1 All E.R. (Comm.) 1077, at paras. 27-29). The requirement of an express agreement in the context of the SGA means that precise legal meaning must be attributed to the terms used in exclusion clauses purporting to oust statutorily implied conditions (Fridman (2013), at p. 249; Twigg-Flesner, Canavan and MacQueen, at p. 204).\nThis is not to say that certain formalities or the use of magic words by the parties is required, as my colleague suggests. There is no contradiction between attributing precise legal meaning to the terms used in exclusion clauses in the context of the SGA and applying the modern principles of contractual interpretation. This is plain from Hunter Engineering, where our Court articulated the clear and direct language standard, all the while recognizing the importance of applying ordinary principles of contractual interpretation to exclusion clauses (see p. 450, per Dickson C.J., and p. 497, per Wilson J.). The same can be said of Lord Diplocks approach in Photo Production. Although interpreting the words used in an exclusion clause may require reference to the whole contract or the surrounding circumstances, the legislature has indicated that the rights, duties, and liabilities arising under the SGA must be considered a vital part of the setting in which parties contract (Triple Point, at para. 108, per Lord Leggatt J.S.C.; see also E. Peel, Whither Contra Proferentem?, in A. Burrows and E. Peel, eds., Contract Terms (2007), 53, at pp. 66-74).\nAgain, the SGA represents the legislatures understanding of commercial efficacy or common sense in the sale of goods context, and its provisions are designed to promote certainty and predictability. In this context, a contextual analysis must be more restricted, unless otherwise provided by statute, and it does not allow a reviewing court to change the meaning of the words used, as was made clear in Sattva (para. 57). Given that the parties are taken to know their legal positions in entering into a contract of sale, they must also be presumed to intend the legal consequences of the words they use (Hall, at p. 120, citing Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, at para. 56). This is so regardless of the parties level of sophistication, even though this is particularly the case where the parties are two large, commercially sophisticated companies (Hunter Engineering, at pp. 449-50); ignorance of the law is no excuse.\nContractual interpretation remains concerned with giving effect to what the parties objectively agreed to (Sattva, at paras. 49, 55 and 57). Where the SGA applies to an exclusion clause, the reviewing court must determine whether the specific right, duty, or liability arising under the contract by implication of law was excluded by express agreement. In so doing, the court must be particularly cautious in assessing the meaning of the words used by the parties in the contract. If the parties did not use sufficiently clear language, they must have to have objectively intended to accept the right, duty, or liability in question. In considering the surrounding circumstances of the contract, the reviewing court must keep in mind that the provisions of the SGA are a vital part of the commercial setting in which the parties negotiated and contracted. It is insufficient that the parties intended in some sense to exclude liability in certain circumstances or that they used language that could shield a party from all contractual liability, having regard to the surrounding circumstances. Instead, it must be clear and unambiguous that the parties agreed to exclude liability for a breach of the specific condition.\nApplication\nBefore the Court of Appeal, Earthco never argued that the trial judge had wrongly characterized the Contract as being a sale by description or that the soil composition had not properly been considered part of the identity of the goods. On appeal to our Court, Earthco is now arguing for the first time that the Contract falls outside the scope of s. 14, either because the Contract was a sale by inspection (A.F., at para. 43)  as opposed to a sale by description within the meaning of that provision  or because the soil composition was not part of the description of the soil but rather related to the quality of the soil. Earthco is alleging extricable errors of law in the trial judges decision.\nI am of the view that, under the cover of extricable questions of law, Earthco is trying to challenge the trial judges findings of mixed fact and law. Earthco has not pointed to any reviewable error in the trial judges characterization of the Contract as being a sale by description or in the determination of the identity of the goods bargained for by Pine Valley (A.F., at para. 44). Let me explain.\nFirst, it was open to the trial judge to find that the Contract was a sale by description within the meaning s. 14 of the SGA. Sales by description are either sales of unascertained goods as being of a certain kind of class or sales of specific goods bought by the buyer in reliance upon the description given (see Leggett v. Taylor (1965), 50 D.L.R. (2d) 516 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 518; see also Benjamins Sale of Goods, at pp. 566-67). In the present case, the trial judge found that Pine Valley, in entering into the Contract, had relied on Earthcos description of the soil, as evidenced by the tests provided and the exchanges between the parties (trial reasons, at para. 100). The mere fact that the parties contractually provided an opportunity for the buyer of the goods to inspect them before they were shipped does not change the fact that the parties agreed to a sale by description.\nSecond, the trial judge correctly relied on the relevant authorities to find that what constitutes the description of goods turns on the intention of the parties, as objectively ascertained (Ashington Piggeries, at p. 502, per Lord Diplock; Bakker, at pp. 178-79). The statements making up the description of the soil on which Pine Valley reasonably relied in entering into the Contract with Earthco are a matter of contractual interpretation, in respect of which the trial judge is owed deference. While the composition of the soil may be relevant to assessing its quality, this does not mean that the trial judge could not, in this case, find that it went to the identity of the goods. In Ashington Piggeries, the dispute was over whether the sellers statement that the goods sold, namely herring meal, would be fair average quality of the season was part of the description of the goods (p. 470). In finding that the sellers statement went to the quality of the goods, Lord Hodson wrote that [a]lthough quality could be used, no doubt, as part of a description it is, I think, not so used in this case (p. 470). Again, this is a fact-specific determination. It was therefore open to the trial judge to find that the goods had been described as R Topsoil with the composition established in the August 2011 tests and that, as a result, Pine Valley had not received what it had bargained for (trial reasons, at para. 100). Earthco has failed to demonstrate any reviewable error in the trial judges assessment of the description of the soil.\nAccordingly, the question in this case is not whether the Contract was a sale by description or whether the soil composition formed part of the identity of the goods as reasonably contemplated by the parties at the time they entered into the Contract, but rather whether the implied condition in s. 14 of the SGA was properly excluded by the Exclusion Clauses. This inquiry must focus on the words used by the parties:\n6) [Pine Valley] has the right to test and approve the material at its own expense at our facility before it is shipped and placed. Please contact Richard Outred [(an Earthco representative)] to arrange.\n\n7) If [Pine Valley] waives its right to test and approve the material before it is shipped, Earthco Soils Inc. will not be responsible for the quality of the material once it leaves our facility. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., at p. 201)\nThe trial judge concluded that clauses 6 and 7 of the Contract are clear and unambiguous and oust the liability for the seller created by s. 14 of the SGA (para. 127). He described the Exclusion Clauses as stating that Earthco cannot be held responsible for any defects and that Earthco will be absolved of liability if Pine Valley failed to test and approve the topsoil before it was shipped (paras. 119 and 127). This conclusion turned entirely on the trial judges understanding of the commercial purpose of the agreement. In his view, the only . . . purpose of testing the soil was for Pine Valley to ensure that it had the composition bargained for (para. 125). According to the trial judge, by accepting the Exclusion Clauses as part of its bargain, Pine Valley assumed all risks associated with the composition of the soil should it fail to test and approve the soil before it was shipped.\nWith respect, the Court of Appeal was justified in setting aside the trial judges conclusion in this regard. There are two legal errors in the trial judges approach. First, in concluding that the Exclusion Clauses were sufficiently clear and direct to exclude s. 14 of the SGA, the trial judge departed from the words used by the parties in a manner that allowed the surrounding circumstances to overwhelm those words.\nAs a general rule, appellate courts should be cautious in identifying extricable questions of law in matters of contractual interpretation, because [t]he circumstances in which a question of law can be extracted will be uncommon (Corner Brook, at para. 44). That being said, our Court stated in Teal Cedar that interpreting the surrounding circumstances in isolation from the text of the contract, thereby effectively creating a new agreement between the parties, constitutes an error of law (para. 62; see also Rosenberg v. Securtek Monitoring Solutions Inc., 2021 MBCA 100, 465 D.L.R. (4th) 201, at para. 83; Ecoasis Resort and Golf LLP v. Bear Mountain Resort & Spa Ltd., 2021 BCCA 285, 53 B.C.L.R. (6th) 343, at para. 34; Mann v. Grewal, 2023 BCCA 88, at para. 44 (CanLII)).\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge made an error of this sort in his analysis of the Exclusion Clauses (C.A. reasons, at paras. 60-62). While the trial judge was correct in stating that the focus of the analysis must be on the plain language of the Contract between the parties, this was not what he did (trial reasons, at para. 118). He did not explain what the parties had meant by using the words responsible for the quality of the material, but rather determined what the parties had to be taken to have written based on his understanding of the purpose of the agreement. According to the trial judge, the Exclusion Clauses clearly and unambiguously stated something that the parties had not written down. By deviating from the text of the Contract to determine what the parties must be taken to have written given the surrounding circumstances, the trial judge effectively created a new agreement.\nSecond, the trial judges approach in departing from the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words used by the parties did not comport with the requirements of s. 53 of the SGA (C.A. reasons, at paras. 65-69). As the Court of Appeal noted, the clear and direct language standard does not turn on the sophistication of the contract and therefore cannot be deviated from simply because the language used by the parties is not sophisticated (para. 57). There was no basis in this case to deviate from this standard. The parties are sophisticated commercial corporations that must be taken to have known their legal positions in entering into a contract of sale and to have intended the legal consequences of the words they used. Again, the determination of whether the parties expressly agreed to negative or vary a statutory right, duty, or liability must focus on the words of their agreement, as required by s. 53.\nI respectfully disagree with my colleague that the Court of Appeal erred in identifying errors on extricable questions of law in the trial judges approach and that giving legal effect to the distinctions established by the SGA is contrary to Sattva. Once it was determined that the trial judge had interpreted the surrounding circumstances in isolation from the text of the Contract, it was open to the Court of Appeal to intervene. I acknowledge that the mere fact that contractual interpretation involves consideration of a statutory provision does not mean that review must be on a correctness standard. However, applying incorrect legal principles in the interpretation exercise is one of the errors identified by Rothstein J. in Sattva as warranting a correctness review (para. 53). The Court of Appeal determined that the trial judge had erred in assessing whether the Exclusion Clauses constituted an express agreement by failing to follow this Courts precedent in Hunter Engineering. This is consistent with Sattva. As I explained above, the requirement of clear and direct language is not incompatible with the modern principles of contractual interpretation and, even if it were, precedence must be given to the provisions of the SGA, as is clear from s. 57(1): the rules of the common law apply except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act. The legislature can set aside the requirement in s. 53 of the SGA or the distinction between quality and identity established by the SGA, but courts simply cannot do so.\nIt is noteworthy that the parties in this case chose to put down their agreement in writing. Thus, our task is to determine what they meant by agreeing to exclude liability in relation to the quality of the material. In doing so, we must keep in mind that, in the present case, we are interpreting a contractual term governed by the SGA. The surrounding circumstances of the contract cannot change the meaning of the statute. The starting point is that the Exclusion Clauses did not actually state that if Pine Valley did not test and approve the soil before it was shipped, then Earthco would not be liable for any defects, including defects in the composition of the soil. Rather, the parties agreed that Earthco would not be responsible for the quality of the material. The ordinary and grammatical meaning of these words relates to the fitness for purpose of a good, within the meaning of s. 15 para. 1 of the SGA. In this case, quality of the material refers to the ability of the soil to perform the agreed-upon function in the Moore Park Project (A.F., at para. 2). The reference to the material also indicates that the parties did not objectively intend the Exclusion Clauses to exclude liability if the identity of the material was different from the one agreed upon. I agree with the Court of Appeal that, on their face, the words used by the parties do not constitute clear and direct language excluding liability under s. 14 (para. 10). The express agreement excludes liability only in relation to quality, not in relation to identity.\nThe fact that the trial judge found that the composition of the soil went to the identity of the goods, while it could also be relevant to the fitness of the soil for a particular purpose, does not mean that the parties objectively intended to shield Earthco from any and all liability. Excluding liability for defects affecting the soils fitness for its purpose is not incompatible with maintaining liability for failure to deliver soil matching the agreed-upon description, because these are distinct conditions. As the Court of Appeal correctly pointed out, ss. 14 and 15 of the SGA cover different legal territory (para. 59). A failure to deliver goods of a particular quality is distinct from a failure to deliver goods having the agreed identity. While the trial judge seems to have been alive to the distinction between the identity and the quality of the goods  finding that the sale was by description and that the description went to the identity of the goods  he ultimately failed to appreciate the effect of this distinction in interpreting the Exclusion Clauses. This was an error of law.\nThe Court of Appeal was correct to hold that the requirement of clear and direct language to exclude terms arising by implication of law under the SGA is superimposed on other principles of contractual interpretation (para. 65). The exercise of interpreting an exclusion clause in the context of the SGA cannot and should not be limited to an analysis of the meaning of the words used, having regard to the surrounding circumstances known to the parties at the time of formation of the contract. Rather, the legislative purposes of the SGA must be taken into account. The distinction between the identity of the goods (based on their description) and the quality of the goods was a vital part of the commercial setting in which the parties contracted. Had the parties objectively intended to contract out of the implied condition in s. 14, they would have done so by express agreement, i.e., using clear and direct language. The fact that a word may be used colloquially does not divest that word of its legal meaning, especially where no evidence suggests that the parties intended to use the word differently from that meaning.\nIn the present context, the meaning of the word quality cannot be expanded to cover any defects relating to the identity of the soil, as the trial judge concluded. While I recognize that Pine Valley was in a rush to receive the soil, this in itself does not mean that it objectively understood that it would assume the risk of not receiving what it had bargained for. A reasonable person would not understand Pine Valley to have intended to contract out of the implied condition in s. 14 of the SGA by accepting the terms of the Exclusion Clauses at the time of formation of the Contract (i.e., before its subsequent exchange with Earthco). The duty to deliver goods corresponding with their description is fundamental to a contract of sale by description; it is the sellers main contractual duty. Failure to perform this duty amounts to a total failure to perform the contract (Benjamins Sale of Goods, at p. 565; see also Bangsund, at pp. 501-2; E. McKendrick, Goode and McKendrick on Commercial Law (6th ed. 2020), at para. 11.06). It had to be made sufficiently clear that the parties intended to contract out of such a fundamental condition of the Contract. This is not to say that parties cannot agree on a sale of specific goods while excluding any liability that would arise from the goods not corresponding with their description. In this case, however, the language of the Exclusion Clauses does not express the parties objective intention to exclude the condition of correspondence with description in s. 14 of the SGA. Pine Valley may have accepted the risk that the R Topsoil with the agreed-upon composition would not be fit for its purpose, but it did not waive its right to receive the soil it had bargained for.\nEarthco may have been under the impression that it would be protected from any and all liability arising from their sale agreement as a result of the bespoke changes made to the Contract, as evidenced by the broader terms it used in the email sent to Pine Valley before the soil was shipped (A.R., at pp. 150-52). But this is not what the parties objectively agreed to. In this respect, I fully endorse Lord Neuberger P.S.C.s view in Arnold v. Britton, [2015] UKSC 36, [2015] A.C. 1619, at para. 19, that [t]he mere fact that a contractual arrangement, if interpreted according to its natural language, has worked out badly, or even disastrously, for one of the parties is not a reason for departing from the natural language. The parties objectively agreed that Earthco would not be liable for defects in the quality of the material, but not that it would be shielded from its statutory duty to supply Pine Valley with R Topsoil with the composition established in the August 2011 test results.\nThe foregoing does not mean that the Exclusion Clauses served no purpose. It is clear that if Earthco had supplied Pine Valley with the soil it had bargained for, i.e., soil with the composition established in the August 2011 test results, but the soil had failed to properly capture excess water in the neighbourhood, any liability under s. 15 of the SGA would have been excluded.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the trial judge erred in concluding that the Exclusion Clauses clearly and directly stated that Earthco would be protected from any liability if Pine Valley failed to test the soil before it was shipped (para. 119). The clear and direct language chosen by the parties in the Exclusion Clauses limited the exclusion of liability to defects in quality within the meaning of s. 15 of the SGA. In contrast, the Exclusion Clauses did not contain any express agreement to exclude liability for a breach of the implied condition in s. 14.\nTherefore, the legal standard in s. 53 of the SGA was not met. The appeal should be dismissed and the Court of Appeals decision ordering Earthco to pay Pine Valley damages in the amount assessed by the trial judge, $350,386.23, should be upheld, with costs before our Court.\n\nAPPENDIX\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nSale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.1\n\n\n1 (1) In this Act, \n\n. . .\n\nquality of goods includes their state or condition;\n\n. . .\n\nwarranty means an agreement with reference to goods that are the subject of a contract of sale but collateral to the main purpose of the contract, the breach of which gives rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat the contract as repudiated.\n\n12 . . .\n\n. . .\n\n(3) Where a contract of sale is not severable and the buyer has accepted the goods or part thereof, or where the contract is for specific goods the property in which has passed to the buyer, the breach of any condition to be fulfilled by the seller can only be treated as a breach of warranty and not as a ground for rejecting the goods and treating the contract as repudiated, unless there is a term of the contract, express or implied, to that effect.\n\n13 In a contract of sale, unless the circumstances of the contract are such as to show a different intention, there is, \n\n(a) an implied condition on the part of the seller that in the case of a sale the seller has a right to sell the goods, and that in the case of an agreement to sell the seller will have a right to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass; \n\n(b) an implied warranty that the buyer will have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods; and \n\n(c) an implied warranty that the goods will be free from any charge or encumbrance in favour of any third party, not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made.\n\n14 Where there is a contract for the sale of goods by description, there is an implied condition that the goods will correspond with the description, and, if the sale is by sample as well as by description, it is not sufficient that the bulk of the goods corresponds with the sample if the goods do not also correspond with the description.\n\n15 Subject to this Act and any statute in that behalf, there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, except as follows:\n\n1. Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required so as to show that the buyer relies on the sellers skill or judgment, and the goods are of a description that it is in the course of the sellers business to supply (whether the seller is the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods will be reasonably fit for such purpose, but in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its patent or other trade name there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any particular purpose.\n\n2. Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that description (whether the seller is the manufacturer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods will be of merchantable quality, but if the buyer has examined the goods, there is no implied condition as regards defects that such examination ought to have revealed.\n\n3. An implied warranty or condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose may be annexed by the usage of trade.\n\n4. An express warranty or condition does not negative a warranty or condition implied by this Act unless inconsistent therewith.\n\n16 (1) A contract of sale is a contract for sale by sample where there is a term in the contract, express or implied, to that effect.\n\n18 (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred.\n\n(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case.\n\n20 . . .\n\n(2) Where goods are shipped and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to the order of the seller or the sellers agent, the seller in the absence of evidence to the contrary reserves the right of disposal.\n\n27 Unless otherwise agreed, delivery of the goods and payment of the price are concurrent conditions, that is to say, the seller shall be ready and willing to give possession of the goods to the buyer in exchange for the price and the buyer shall be ready and willing to pay the price in exchange for possession of the goods.\n\n28 (1) Whether it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the seller to send them to the buyer is a question depending in each case on the contract, express or implied, between the parties, and apart from any such contract, express or implied, the place of delivery is the sellers place of business, if there is one, and if not, the sellers residence, but where the contract is for the sale of specific goods that to the knowledge of the parties, when the contract is made, are in some other place, then that place is the place of delivery.\n\n. . .\n\n(5) Unless otherwise agreed, the expenses of and incidental to putting the goods in a deliverable state shall be borne by the seller.\n\n30 (1) Unless otherwise agreed, the buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by instalments.\n\n(2) Where there is a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by stated instalments that are to be separately paid for and the seller makes defective deliveries in respect of one or more instalments or fails to deliver one or more instalments or the buyer neglects or refuses to take delivery of or pay for one or more instalments, it is a question in each case depending on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case whether the breach of contract is a repudiation of the whole contract or whether it is a severable breach giving rise to a claim for compensation but not to a right to treat the whole contract as repudiated.\n\n31 (1) Where in pursuance of a contract of sale the seller is authorized or required to send the goods to the buyer, the delivery of the goods to a carrier whether named by the buyer or not, for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, delivery of the goods to the buyer.\n\n33 . . .\n\n(2) Unless otherwise agreed, when the seller tenders delivery of goods to the buyer, the seller shall, on request, afford the buyer a reasonable opportunity of examining the goods for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract.\n\n35 Unless otherwise agreed, where a buyer refuses to accept delivery of goods and has the right to do so, the goods are not bound to be returned to the seller, but it is sufficient if the buyer intimates to the seller that acceptance of the goods is refused.\n\n48 . . .\n\n. . .\n\n(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price at the time or times when the goods ought to have been accepted, or, if no time was fixed for acceptance, then at the time of the refusal to accept.\n\n49 . . .\n\n. . .\n\n(3) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed, then at the time of the refusal to deliver.\n\n51 . . .\n\n. . .\n\n(3) In the case of breach of warranty of quality, such loss is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty.\n\n53 Where any right, duty or liability would arise under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by usage, if the usage is such as to bind both parties to the contract.\n\n57 (1) The rules of the common law, including the law merchant, except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, and in particular the rules relating to the law of principal and agent and the effect of fraud, misrepresentation, duress or coercion, mistake or other invalidating cause, continue to apply to contracts for the sale of goods.\n\tAppeal allowed with costs throughout, Cote J. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision, upholding the trial judge's ruling that exclusion clauses in a contract can exempt a seller from liability for the quality of goods.\n\nThis appeal concerns the interpretation of exclusion clauses in a contract for the sale of topsoil between Pine Valley Enterprises Inc. and Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., specifically whether the clauses are sufficient to exempt the seller from liability for the quality of the material.\n\nPine Valley Enterprises Inc. (the buyer) entered into a contract with Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc. (the seller) to purchase topsoil with a specified composition for a municipal project. However, due to delays and the risk of liquidated damages, the buyer waived its right to test and approve the topsoil before delivery. The contract contained exclusion clauses stating that the seller would not be responsible for the quality of the topsoil if the buyer waived its right to test it before shipment. When the topsoil was found to have a different composition than promised, the buyer claimed damages against the seller. The buyer alleged that the seller breached the implied condition of correspondence with description under section 14 of the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) by delivering topsoil that did not meet the specified composition requirements.\n\nAt trial, the judge found that the contract was a sale by description within the meaning of section 14 of the SGA and that the buyer did not receive the topsoil it bargained for. However, the judge also ruled that the exclusion clauses operated to insulate the seller from liability under section 14 of the SGA. The Ontario Court of Appeal (OCA) reversed the trial judge's decision, holding that there was no express agreement to exclude the statutory condition of correspondence with description. The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) allowed the appeal, upholding the trial judge's ruling that the exclusion clauses in the contract were sufficient to exempt the seller from liability for the quality of the material.\n\nThe key legal principle established by the court is that the interpretation of exclusion clauses must be approached in a flexible, practical, and common-sense way, taking into account the surrounding circumstances and the objective intention of the parties.\n\nWriting for the majority, Wagner C.J. held that the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties' express agreement is that the buyer accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it knew was an organic and changing substance. The court found that the parties' contract contained a valid exclusion clause that exempted the seller from liability for the quality of the topsoil if the buyer waived its right to test the material before it left the seller's facility. This decision highlights the importance of considering the surrounding circumstances and the objective intention of the parties in interpreting exclusion clauses, and it emphasizes the need for a flexible and balanced approach to the interpretation of exclusion clauses in contracts.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies what is required for an exclusion  clause in a contract of sale to exempt the seller from an implied condition  under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. </strong>This appeal concerned a party\u2019s ability to contract out of an  implied condition of sale under Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale  of Goods Act</em>. Implied conditions are obligations that are automatically  incorporated into a contract unless the parties expressly agree otherwise. The  Supreme Court clarified what was required to show that the parties expressly  agreed to contract out of the implied condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Pine Valley  Enterprises Inc. was hired by the City of Toronto to work on a municipal  project to remediate flooding, which included the removal and replacement of  topsoil for drainage. Pine Valley contacted Earthco Soil Mixtures Inc., a  topsoil provider, to obtain topsoil with a specified composition. Earthco provided  Pine Valley with laboratory reports from different topsoil samples taken about  six weeks prior, and warned against purchasing the topsoil without updated test  results. \u00a0However, Pine Valley had  already missed project deadlines and urgently wanted delivery of the topsoil to  avoid a financial penalty. Pine Valley therefore insisted on immediate  delivery. Pine Valley and Earthco agreed to add two exclusion clauses to their  contract that stated that Pine Valley had the right to test and approve the  material before it was shipped, and that if it waived those rights, Earthco  would not be responsible for the quality of the material once it left its  facility. After the  topsoil was delivered and placed on the project site, water ponding was noted. New  testing revealed that there was substantially more clay in the topsoil than the  initial test results had indicated, and Pine Valley had to remove and replace  the topsoil. Pine Valley then sued Earthco for damages, alleging that it did  not receive topsoil within the range of compositional properties that had been  indicated in the initial test results.The trial judge  dismissed Pine Valley\u2019s action. He found that the contract was for a sale of  goods by description within the meaning of section 14 of Ontario\u2019s <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which sets out an  implied condition that goods must correspond with their description. He agreed  that Pine Valley did not get the topsoil it bargained for, because of the  variation between the topsoil that was promised and the topsoil that was  delivered. However, the trial judge concluded that the exclusion clauses met  the requirements of an \u201cexpress agreement\u201d according to section 53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, which allows parties to  contract out of the implied condition under section 14. He concluded as such  despite the fact that the exclusion clauses did not explicitly mention that  they were added to the contract for this purpose. \u00a0The Court of  Appeal disagreed with the trial judge and found that the wording in the  exclusion clauses was insufficient to exempt Earthco from liability under section  14 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>. The  Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and substituted a judgment requiring Earthco  to pay damages. Earthco appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal.<strong>The exclusion clauses were an express agreement  pursuant to section 53. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin said that to be sufficient for the purposes of section  53 of the <em>Sale of Goods Act</em>, an  \u201cexpress agreement\u201d must be comprised of an agreement to negative or vary a  statutorily implied right, duty or liability and such an agreement must be  expressly set forth within the parties\u2019 contract. The determination as to what  qualifies as an express agreement must also be informed by principles of  contractual interpretation and the law concerning exclusion clauses, and the  paramount consideration must be the objective intention of the parties. In the instant  case, the trial judge made no error of law with respect to the exclusion  clauses at issue. The objective meaning of the parties\u2019 express agreement was that  Pine Valley accepted the risk that the topsoil would not meet the previously  supplied specifications concerning its composition if it failed to test what it  knew was an organic and changing substance. For these reasons, Justice Martin  allowed the appeal and restored the trial judge\u2019s judgment. "

C-46, s. 278.95.\n\tThe accused and the complainant were in a romantic relationship for over twenty years. In February 2018, they separated and the accused moved into the basement of the family home. According to a statement made to police by the complainant, she and the accused had consensual intercourse on the evening of April 1, 2018, and the accused sexually assaulted her the following morning. The accused brought a pre-trial application to adduce evidence of the sexual activity from the evening of April 1, pursuant to ss. 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code. The application stated that the accuseds defence was consent. The trial judge dismissed the application. He held that the events of April 1 were not relevant to the issue of consent on April 2, and rejected the accuseds argument that the events on April 1 formed a continuous event with the events on April 2. He also concluded that the evidence was sought to be adduced for the prohibited purpose of arguing that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the alleged sexual activity or that she was less worthy of belief.\n\tThe accused was convicted of sexual assault and appealed his conviction. The appeal proceeded in camera and the appeal record was sealed. The majority of the Court of Appeal held that the accused failed to establish how evidence of the April 1 sexual activity was fundamental to his defence, which was not, in fact, a defence of consent as set out in his application, but was rather a complete denial that the assault occurred. It its view, evidence of consensual sex on April 1 could not support a defence that a sexual assault on April 2 did not occur. The dissenting judge held that the evidence of prior sexual activity was essential to challenging the complainants credibility and the Crowns theory that the sexual assault occurred in the context of a complete breakdown in the accused and complainants relationship. The accused appealed to the Court as of right. The Crown brought a motion for the appeal to be held in camera, for filed materials to be sealed, and for any other order necessary to protect the information covered by ss. 276 and 278.93 to 278.95 of the Criminal Code, on the basis that the procedural protections prohibiting publication put in place at the trial level under ss. 278.94 and 278.95 should extend to the appeal before the Court.\n\tHeld (Cote and Moreau JJ. dissenting on the appeal): The appeal should be dismissed and the Crowns motion should be allowed in part.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: The accused failed to sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability to make full answer and defence. Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in denying the application. With respect to the Crowns motion, the mandatory publication ban under s. 278.95 of the Criminal Code does not extend to this appeal. Rather, the Courts power to make an order limiting court openness in the instant case is derived from the implied jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records. The Courts discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as practicable while protecting the complainants personal dignity and privacy and the accuseds fair trial rights. Applying the test set out in Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 75, the circumstances of the instant case do not justify all of the measures requested by the Crown. Banning publication of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity other than that which forms the subject-matter of the charge is sufficient.\n\tOn appeal from a trial judges determination to admit or refuse evidence of other sexual activity, an appellate court must ensure that the trial judge applied the correct legal principles, considered all the evidence they should have, did not admit irrelevant evidence, and did not otherwise err in law; no deference is owed in this regard. However, as to the trial judges determination that the evidences prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value, appellate courts should defer. In reviewing a trial judges initial s. 276 ruling, the appellate court must only consider the evidence that was before the trial judge at the time of the determination on admissibility.\n\tOther sexual activity evidence may be admissible in relation to issues of credibility or context, but the applicant must establish a specific use for this information that is permitted by the s. 276 regime, and the applicant bears the burden of establishing that any such probative value is not substantially outweighed by prejudicial effect. Specificity is required so judges can apply the scheme in a way that protects the rights of the complainant and ensures trial fairness, and there must be a sufficient factual and evidentiary basis for the trial judge to properly consider and weigh the factors set out in s. 276. The applicant must demonstrate that, in the absence of the evidence, their position would be untenable or utterly improbable.\n\tThe relevance and probative value of prior sexual activity evidence may not crystallize until witnesses have begun their testimony and the evidence, or the inconsistency or materiality thereof, becomes apparent. Where the evolution of a witness testimony at trial results in a material change in circumstances, the trial judge may, either on their own initiative or by request from either party, revisit an earlier s. 276 ruling in light of the new evidence or information. The possibility of reconsideration of a pre-trial ruling in no way relieves the defence of its responsibility, in the majority of cases, to make a request for reconsideration and articulate the permissible purposes of the evidence in light of the changed circumstances. However, if the nature of the evidence at trial cries out for a reconsideration, an appellate court may find that a trial judge was required to revisit their prior s. 276 ruling of their own motion even without being specifically asked to do so.\n\tIn the instant case, there could be no use for the April 1 evidence beyond twin-myth reasoning. The proposed evidence could not provide any greater context for understanding the complainants actions on April 2, or whether she did or did not consent, beyond unequivocally impermissible reasoning. Even if the evidence had some relevance to either context or credibility, the trial judge made no error in weighing its probative value against its prejudicial effect, and his conclusion on this point is entitled to deference. As for the issue of whether the trial judge ought to have revisited his pre-trial ruling, addressed by Cote and Moreau JJ., it is beyond the proper scope of the appeal to the Court. The scope of an appeal to the Court under s. 691(1)(a) of the Criminal Code is limited to those questions of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents. Although in ascertaining the real ground upon which dissent is based the Court may look to the written reasons of the dissenting judges, in the instant case the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal plainly stated that the issue of dissent was whether there was an error in the pre-trial ruling; it was not whether the trial judge should have revisited his initial ruling. Those are separate questions.\n\tWith respect to the Crowns motion, it requires consideration of the source of the Courts powers to make orders limiting court openness on appeals of s. 276 determinations. This issue engages an exercise in statutory interpretation. The words of s. 278.95 are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. Section 278.95 prohibits the publication of information and evidence adduced for applications and admissibility hearings pursuant to ss. 278.93 and 278.94, but provides trial judges with a discretion to permit the publication of their decision or determination under s. 278.93(4) or 278.94 by others after considering the complainants right of privacy and the interests of justice. A plain reading of the text suggests that it is aimed not at courts but at other entities who would otherwise publish a courts decisions, such as law reporters, media outlets and reporters, and the general public. The wording of s. 278.95 also limits the power to displace the presumptive statutory publication ban to the judge or justice who has the ability to make orders under ss. 278.93(4) or 278.94(4) in trial proceedings. Section 278.95 is situated among a procedural scheme, the objects of which are to keep improper evidence out of trial proceedings. The scheme contemplates the appeal of such evidentiary determinations but it does not explicitly extend the trial protections to appellate proceedings or otherwise indicate the appropriate procedure on appeal. Had Parliament intended for s. 278.95 to apply to reviewing courts, it could have explicitly stated so.\n\tIn the absence of a legislatively imposed exception to the open court principle, the presumption of court openness persists. The Court has implied jurisdiction to make orders limiting court openness, including orders that a hearing proceed in camera and for the sealing of filed materials, derived from its jurisdiction to control its own processes and records. This discretion is not to be exercised lightly, but while court openness is the rule, it is not an absolute or overriding principle. In appeals concerning a sexual offence, the application of the Sherman Estate test draws upon the legislative context and objectives of the s. 276 regime and the two analytical factors set out under s. 278.95  the complainants right of privacy and the interests of justice. Privacy and personal dignity are important public interests, and protection of the dignity and privacy of complainants is not limited to the trial process. An applicant seeking a limiting order must articulate why the serious risk to the complainants privacy and dignity warrants a greater restriction on court openness than would be occasioned by an alternative measure. Sealing orders and in camera hearings are greater incursions on court openness compared to publication bans. The benefits of the requested orders must also outweigh their negative effects, bearing in mind the interests of justice in the case. Courts of appeal should also consider what orders were previously made in courts below. Furthermore, the Court has a responsibility to provide clear and authoritative statements of law and guidance to lower courts, which supports judicial accountability in sexual offence trials. Reasons from, and hearings before, the Court provide not only an explanation of an appeals resolution to the parties but also give meaning to the judgments precedential value.\n\tThe sexual nature of the evidence in the instant case touches on the complainants dignity and right of privacy, and publication of this type of information gives rise to a serious risk to the public interests of personal privacy and dignity. However, the Crown has not established that the risk to the complainants privacy and dignity requires a sealing order or in camera hearing. It can be addressed by banning publication of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity other than that which forms the subject-matter of the charge. The request to hold the hearing in camera is a greater restriction than is necessary. As the appeal deals with a question of law, counsel were able to argue their case without heavy reliance on sensitive information and evidence. In view of the alternative measures available, the benefits of the requested orders do not outweigh their negative effects on court openness.\n\tPer Cote and Moreau JJ. (dissenting on the appeal): The appeal should be allowed, the accuseds conviction quashed, and a new trial ordered. There is agreement with the majority on the disposition of the Crowns motion, and there is further agreement that the trial judge did not err in his initial pre-trial determination on the voir dire under s. 276. However, the evolution of the evidence should have prompted the trial judge to revisit the voir dire ruling made at the pre-trial stage, and he should have allowed the accused to cross-examine the complainant about the April 1 consensual sexual activity for limited purposes. In failing to do so, the trial judge committed a reviewable error.\n\tAn appeal under s. 691(1)(a) of the Criminal Code is limited to the questions of law on which a judge of a court of appeal dissents, but it is important to maintain some flexibility in identifying what is at the heart of the dissent. An appellate court that raises new issues on appeal must allow the parties to make submissions on those matters, but only when the issue was not raised by the parties or cannot reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties. Criminal appeals on questions of law are based in part on the desire to ensure that criminal convictions are the product of error-free trials. An unduly rigid approach to characterizing the question on which a judge dissents would prevent the Court from addressing the substance of their disagreement.\n\tSection 278.97 of the Criminal Code states that admissibility determinations under s. 276 are deemed to be questions of law. While appellate courts owe deference to the factual conclusions that underpin the analysis, the standard of review on the question of whether sexual activity evidence is admissible under s. 276 is correctness. This gives appellate courts a more active role in overseeing decisions made under s. 276, allowing them to step in more easily to give the proper interpretation to these provisions.\n\tPre-trial rulings are not set in stone. An order related to the conduct of trial may be varied or revoked if there is a material change of circumstances. Counsel plays an important role in bringing such evidentiary shifts to the trial judges attention, but trial judges have the ability to revisit s. 276 rulings even in cases where counsel has not made a formal request or application. Trial judges have an obligation to remain alert to the evidentiary developments that warrant revisiting s. 276 rulings. Where the evidence cries out for a reconsideration of a prior ruling, the trial judge has an obligation, at the very least, to invite submissions on the issue. This contributes to maintaining trial fairness and avoiding a miscarriage of justice: trial judges responsibility to ensure that s. 276 is properly applied is crucial not only to evidence that may need to be screened out, but also to evidence that may need to be admitted for the accused to be afforded the opportunity to make full answer and defence.\n\tIn general, whether or not a relationship has previously included a sexual component is not relevant to determining whether a complainant has consented to a particular instance of sexual activity, and an accused must not be allowed to suggest that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity in question because she had previously consented in the context of the same relationship. However, when the evidence suggests that, because of the platonic nature of a particular relationship, the complainant would be unlikely to consent, challenging that depiction of the relationship is fundamental to the coherence of the defence narrative.\n\tIn the instant case, the question on which the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal dissented is whether or not the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence of the parties sexual activity on April 1. The question of whether the trial judge should have revisited the pre-trial ruling can be said to stem from the issue framed by the accused and the Crown, in this case, the admissibility of prior consensual sexual activity. The complainants trial testimony suggested that, according to her, consent was improbable in the context of separation, transforming the neutral fact of separation into an element that supported the conclusion that she did not consent. This testimony created a material change in circumstances that triggered the trial judges obligation to revisit his pre-trial ruling. The testimony should have opened the door to cross examination of the complainant regarding her consensual sexual activity with the accused on April 1 for two limited purposes: to neutralize the suggestion that the complainant was unlikely to consent after the separation, and to test her credibility on this point.\nCases Cited\nBy OBonsawin J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

Dartana, K.C., for the intervener.\n\tThe judgment of Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ. was delivered by\n\tOBonsawin J.  \nOverview\nThis appeal offers an opportunity for this Court to reaffirm the proper use of other sexual activity evidence for credibility and context purposes and to consider the powers of an appellate court to make orders that limit court openness in appeals of admissibility determinations under s. 276 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.\nThe appellant was convicted of sexual assault against his spouse, the complainant. Prior to the trial, the appellant brought an application to adduce evidence of prior sexual activity pursuant to ss. 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code, more particularly, an incident of consensual intercourse the night before the sexual assault. The trial judge dismissed the application on the basis that the evidence was not being adduced for a purpose other than twin-myth reasoning. This determination was upheld by a majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. The appellant now appeals to this Court as of right.\nThe conduct of sexual offence trials calls for a delicate balance in order to uphold their truth-seeking function: the process must safeguard the fair trial rights of the accused while also respecting the complainants dignity and right of privacy to achieve a result that is fair to all involved. Thus, while the open court principle and the protection of complainants personal dignity and privacy present competing interests, they can operate harmoniously. An open court that protects complainants personal dignity and privacy increases public confidence in the court process and administration of justice and encourages the reporting of sexual offences.\nPrior to the hearing before this Court, the Crown brought a motion requesting that this appeal be held in camera, a sealing order on all filed materials, and any other order the Court deems necessary to protect information covered by sections 276 and 278.93-278.95 of the Criminal Code (p. 1). It asserted that the procedural protections put in place at the trial level under ss. 278.94 and 278.95 should extend to the appeal before this Court. The Crown argued that either or both these provisions and a courts implied jurisdiction to control its own processes grants this Court the authority to make the orders that it seeks. As I will explain, a courts implied jurisdiction to control its own processes includes the discretionary ability to make those orders. However, the Courts discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as practicable while protecting the complainants personal dignity and privacy and the accuseds fair trial rights.\nOn appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence for context and credibility purposes. I disagree. As I will explain, the appellant failed to sufficiently identify a specific use for the evidence that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability to make full answer and defence.\nFacts\nThe appellant and the complainant were in a romantic relationship for over 20 years. In February 2018, they took a trip, and on their return the couple separated. The appellant moved into the basement of the home he shared with the complainant and her son.\nThe appellant sought to adduce evidence of sexual activity in the evening of April 1, 2018 and just after midnight on April 2, 2018. For ease of reference, I will refer to this event as occurring on April 1. The complainant alleged that in the morning of April 2, the appellant sexually assaulted her. The complainants evidence was that she and the appellant had separated in February 2018, and that they had consensual intercourse on April 1. \nThroughout the trial proceedings, the appellants defence evolved, but he ultimately advanced a defence of denial that the sexual assault occurred. He contested the complainants version of events and testified that the complainant had consented to sexual intercourse in the afternoon of April 2.\nProcedural History\nOral Ruling on Voir Dire, 2021 BCSC 270 (Jenkins J.)\nJustice Fitch, writing for the majority below, set out in detail the s. 276 applications procedural history, noting the unfortunate way in which the s. 276 application was framed and presented in the trial court (2022 BCCA 312, 418 C.C.C. (3d) 169, at para. 110; see paras. 110-42). I will therefore not repeat that history in depth here, but I make note of it as I agree with the majority that the manner in which the application unfolded enable[s] a more informed assessment of the probative value of the evidence and its potential for prejudice (para. 110), which I will turn to later in these reasons.\nThere were three iterations of the appellants application. The appellant initially sought the admission of prior sexual activity evidence between February 2018 and April 1, 2018 on the basis that it had significant probative value as it highlights the nature of the relationship between the complainant and the accused (A.R., vol. II, at p. 5). The application did not specify the defence being advanced.\nThe appellants amended notice of application sought only the admission of prior sexual activity evidence from April 1. The application stated that [t]he evidence has significant probative value as it is relevant to the context of how the events transpired between the complainant and the accused from April 1, 2018 to April 2, 2018 from the accuseds perspective (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 6-7). The application stated that the appellants defence was one of consent and that the context of the relationship and the complainants credibility were factors in assessing this defence. The evidence was relevant to context and coherence in the defence narrative because the evidence was necessary to understand the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant (including that their relationship was not platonic) and to challenge the complainants credibility on the nature of their relationship.\nThe appellants further amended notice of application added only that the appellant was seeking the admission of evidence from events on April 2 as well as from April 1.\nThe trial judge dismissed the application. He held that the complainants statement to the police and her evidence on the preliminary inquiry were not inconsistent. In any case, the events of April 1 were not relevant to the issue of consent on April 2. He rejected the appellants argument that the events on April 1 formed a continuous event with the events on April 2. The trial judge concluded that the evidence was being adduced for the prohibited purpose of arguing that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the alleged sexual activity or that she was less worthy of belief.\nBritish Columbia Court of Appeal, 2022 BCCA 312, 418 C.C.C. (3d) 169 (Newbury and Fitch JJ.A., Frankel J.A. Dissenting)\nThe appeal before the Court of Appeal for British proceeded in camera and the record was sealed. \nThe majority upheld the trial judges decision, agreeing that the appellants application had not satisfied the requirements for admissibility. The appellant failed to establish how evidence of the prior sexual activity was fundamental to his defence, which was not, in fact, a defence of consent as set out in the appellants s. 276 applications, but was rather a complete denial that the assault occurred. In the majoritys view, the evidence was not fundamental to this defence: evidence of consensual sex on April 1 could not support a defence that a sexual assault on April 2 did not occur. Further, based on the appellants testimony at trial, it was clear that the evidence would have been adduced to support the myth that because they had consensual sex on April 1, she consented to sex on April 2 or it should not be believed that she did not consent on April 2. There was no inconsistency in the complainants evidence to the police and at the preliminary inquiry that could only be resolved by the prior sexual activity evidence, because it was not inconsistent for the complainant to state that she and the appellant separated in February but had consensual sex on April 1.\nJustice Frankel, dissenting, would have allowed the appeal, finding that it was an error for the trial judge to dismiss the application. In his view, the evidence of prior sexual activity was essential to challenging the complainants credibility and the Crowns theory that the sexual assault occurred in the context of a complete breakdown in the appellant and complainants relationship. Credibility was the central issue at trial and the appellant was entitled to explore the divergences in their accounts to challenge the complainants credibility. The prejudice to the complainant would be minimized by the fact that she had already disclosed the prior sexual activity to the police, and her personal dignity would be protected by the publication ban.\nIssues\nThe appellant argues that the majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia erred in finding that the trial judge made no error in dismissing the appellants s. 276 application. The appellant submits that the evidence of prior sexual activity was necessary to challenge the complainants credibility and to provide necessary context to the defences case. \nThe Court must also determine the Crowns motion to conduct the hearing before this Court in camera, to seal the filed materials, and to make any other order necessary to protect the information protected by ss. 276 and 278.93 to 278.95 of the Criminal Code. This requires the Court to consider its authority to do so and whether this appeal warrants additional orders that would limit court openness in this case. \nAnalysis \nThe Standard of Review of Section 276 Decisions \nSection 278.97 of the Criminal Code states that an appeal from a trial judges determination to admit or refuse evidence of other sexual activity is a question of law. However, this provision only delimits the nature of the issues that can be raised on appeal; it does not prescribe a standard of review.\nSome courts have suggested that appellate review of s. 278.94 admissibility decisions attracts deference to the trial judges determination. Both the majority and dissent in the court below agreed with Fisher J.A.s conclusion, in R. v. Ravelo-Corvo, 2022 BCCA 19, 79 C.R. (7th) 128, that such a determination is a discretionary exercise that involves a fact-sensitive analysis guided by the factors enumerated in s. 276(3), and is entitled to substantial deference on appeal (para. 29). The Court of Appeal for Ontario made a similar observation in R. v. I. (C.), 2023 ONCA 576, 168 O.R. (3d) 575, at para. 102, speaking of determinations to admit an accuseds records about a complainant (which are subject to the same standard of review):\nThe admissibility of evidence under s. 278.92 is deemed to be a question of law for the purposes of determining appeal rights. Despite this characterization, the admissibility of evidence offered under s. 278.92 lies very much in the exercise of the trial judges discretion. Assuming the trial judge correctly applies the applicable legal principles, does not misapprehend material evidence, does not fail to consider relevant evidence, and does not arrive at an unreasonable result, this court will defer to the trial judges ruling. [Citations omitted.]\nSee also R. v. Graham, 2019 SKCA 63, [2019] 12 W.W.R. 207, at para. 69; R. v. T. (M.), 2012 ONCA 511, 289 C.C.C. (3d) 115, at para. 54.\nThere is no dispute that the question of relevance is reviewable on a standard of correctness (R. v. Schneider, 2022 SCC 34, at para. 39). However, in making a determination of whether to admit evidence of other sexual activity, the trial judge balances a number of considerations, both those enumerated in s. 276(3) and others that may arise in the specific circumstances of a case. The admissibility of prior sexual activity evidence is highly fact-specific and contextual, and the trial judge is best placed to assess probative value versus prejudice (R. v. Araya, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para. 31; S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at 2.93). The appellate courts approach on appeal must respect this reality while giving effect to Parliaments decision to deem s. 278.94 determinations questions of law. Justice MacKenzie in R. v. Clayton, 2021 BCCA 24, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 283, at paras. 50-51, astutely articulated how an appellate court should approach a trial judges admissibility determination:\nThe parties disagree on the standard of review. The appellant says the standard is correctness as it is a question of law whether the judge erred in taking an overly restrictive view of relevance in the context of cross-examination. The Crowns position is that the judges assessment of the probative value and prejudicial effects of the evidence, and his management of cross-examination, is owed deference on appeal. In my view, both parties are correct.\n\nWhether the threshold requirement of relevance is met is a question of law reviewable on a correctness standard; it would be a legal error to admit irrelevant evidence. However, not all relevant evidence is necessarily admissible. A judges decision to exclude relevant evidence where its probative value is outweighed (or, for defence-led evidence, substantially outweighed) by its prejudicial effect involves the exercise of discretion. Absent reliance on improper legal principles, the judges conclusion in this regard is owed deference. [Citations omitted.]\nI agree. An appellate court must ensure that the trial judge applied the correct legal principles, considered all the evidence they should have, did not admit irrelevant evidence, and did not otherwise err in law; no deference is owed in this regard. However, as to the trial judges determination that the evidences prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value, appellate courts should defer.\nFinally, in reviewing a trial judges initial s. 276 ruling, the appellate court must only consider the evidence that was before the trial judge at the time of their determination on admissibility (R. v. Goldfinch, 2019 SCC 38, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 63 and 101).\nThe Use of Other Sexual Activity Evidence for Credibility and Context\nIn 1982, to address the detrimental and truth-distorting uses of other sexual activity evidence that permeated the jurisprudence, Parliament chose to set parameters for when evidence of other sexual activity can be introduced at trial. Either the Crown or the defence can bring an application for a voir dire or a s. 278.94 hearing where it seeks to adduce evidence that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity (s. 276). There is no need to do so where the parties only seek to establish that a relationship existed between the accused and the complainant, unless the very nature of that relationship is sexual, as was the case in Goldfinch.\nOver time, those parameters have been further refined to create a rigorous statutory regime that prohibits entirely the use of other sexual activity evidence to support twin-myth reasoning  that is, the reliance on inferences that, based on the other sexual activity evidence, the complainant is more likely to have consented to the impugned sexual activity or that they are less worthy of belief. Under the s. 276 regime, a trial judge may only admit evidence of other sexual activity when it is not used to support twin-myth reasoning; is adduced for specific, relevant and permissible purposes; and when its probative value to the trial is not substantially outweighed by the prejudice it might occasion (s. 276(2)). The proper application of this regime ensures that the right to present ones case [is not] curtailed in the absence of an assurance that the curtailment is clearly justified by even stronger contrary considerations (R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 621). The statutory regime therefore requires trial judges to ensure that evidence that is misleading, irrelevant, or substantially more prejudicial than probative is excluded to avoid tainting the trials fairness (R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 443, at paras. 37 and 42-43; R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at para. 74; D. Brown and J. Witkin, Prosecuting and Defending Sexual Offence Cases (2nd ed. 2020), vol. 4, at p. 354).\nEvidence of other sexual activity can be adduced for permissible reasoning: The phrase by reason of the sexual nature of that activity in s. 276 is a clarification by Parliament that it is inferences from the sexual nature of the activity, as opposed to inferences from other potentially relevant features of the activity, that are prohibited (Darrach, at para. 35 (emphasis in original)). However, as I will elaborate below, it is incumbent on the accused to identify in a detailed manner how the evidence is necessary for that permissible reasoning without relying on twin-myth reasoning. The need for precision is especially important where the proposed uses are for credibility and context, two issues that not only exist in nearly every criminal case but have broad and, at times, vague spectrums of use.\nWitness Credibility, Context, and the Permissible Uses of Other Sexual Activity Evidence \nOther sexual activity evidence may be admissible for issues of credibility or context, but the applicant must establish a specific use for this information that is permitted by the s. 276 regime. Goldfinch instructs that [b]are assertions that such evidence will be relevant to context, narrative or credibility cannot satisfy s. 276(2) (para. 51; see also para. 65), and the same caution applies to probative value. In order to be potentially admissible, the relevance and probative value of the evidence in each case must go beyond a general ability to undermine the complainants credibility or to add helpful context to the circumstances of the case; it must respond to a specific issue at trial that could not be addressed or resolved in the absence of that evidence (Brown and Witkin, at pp. 379-81). The applicant also bears the burden of establishing that any such probative value is not substantially outweighed by prejudicial effect.\nTrial judges must guard against improperly widening the scope of when other sexual activity evidence should be admitted given that, as Karakatsanis J. noted in Goldfinch, [c]redibility is an issue that pervades most trials (para. 56); the same is true of the significance of context. Too broad an approach to credibility and context would cast open the doors of admissibility, overturning Parliaments specific intention and this Courts longstanding jurisprudence that evidence of other sexual activity will be admitted only in cases where it is sufficiently specific and essential to the interests of justice. Given the specific thresholds set by Parliament and their underlying objectives, something more is required to show that admission is justified. The applicant must demonstrate with particularity not only that credibility or context is relevant to an issue at trial but that, in the absence of the evidence, their position would be untenable or utterly improbable (see Goldfinch, at para. 68).\nThe appellant raised three cases where prior sexual activity evidence was admitted to challenge a complainants credibility or to provide necessary context. Each is illustrative of the instructions in Goldfinch on the proper use of prior sexual activity evidence for context or challenging credibility. \nThe first case the appellant raises is R. v. Crosby, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 912, where the complainant told police that she had visited the accused with the intention of having sex; however, at the preliminary inquiry she testified that she did not intend to have sex with the accused when she visited him. The trial judge excluded the complainants statement to the police under s. 276. When the complainant testified again on cross-examination that she did not intend to have sex with the accused when she visited him, the earlier ruling barred defence counsel from challenging this testimony as inconsistent with her statement to police.\nJustice LHeureux-Dube, writing for a majority of this Court, held that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence because the starkly opposing versions of events testified to by the complainant and the accused placed credibility as the central issue at trial, and the complainants statements presented a material inconsistency. Balancing the evidences probative value against its prejudicial effect, the interests of justice favoured admitting the evidence.\nJustice LHeureux-Dubes comments were cited two years later in R. v. Harris (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 498 (Ont. C.A.). The accused and the complainant met at a bar several days before the alleged assault. The complainant testified in chief that her relationship with the appellant was platonic, that they had not engaged in any sexual activity, and that she told him she did not want a sexual relationship. The accused sought to adduce evidence of an alleged consensual sexual encounter several days before the sexual assault.\nJustice Moldaver held that the prior sexual activity evidence was necessary to the appellants ability to make full answer and defence because it could rebut the complainants claim that their relationship was strictly platonic. Justice Moldaver succinctly summarized the implications of the exclusion of this evidence: \nBy failing to permit the appellant to lead evidence of the Tuesday night incident, the jury was deprived of the tools needed to fully and fairly assess the conduct of the parties and the believability of their respective positions. Left unchallenged, the complainants testimony concerning her relationship with the appellant was potentially devastating to his position. [para. 49]\nR. v. Temertzoglou (2002), 11 C.R. (6th) 179 (Ont. S.C.J.), is another case where prior sexual activity evidence was admitted for credibility and context. The complainant had made inconsistent statements about whether her relationship with the accused was sexual, and the evidence was essential to the defences ability to make full answer and defence by challenging the complainants credibility. \nRead in light of the current statutory regime and the jurisprudence since these cases were decided, these decisions serve as examples of when evidence of other sexual activity evidence may be relevant to credibility where the complainant makes inconsistent statements about the very existence of a sexual relationship, or where the evidence goes to the fundamental coherence of the defence narrative (Goldfinch, at paras. 63 and 65-66). The admission of the evidence in each of these cases was held to be necessary to the ability of the accused to make full answer and defence.\nIt bears repeating that the applicant is tasked with establishing with clarity and precision the use to be made of the other sexual activity evidence sought to be adduced. Before a trial judge may grant an application for an admissibility hearing, they must be satisfied that the application set[s] out detailed particulars of the evidence that the accused seeks to adduce and the relevance of that evidence to an issue at trial (Criminal Code, s. 278.93(2)). As the majority noted on appeal below, [s]pecificity is required so judges can apply the scheme in a way that protects the rights of the complainant and ensures trial fairness (para. 97, quoting Goldfinch, at para. 53). The applicant need not include so many details that the witnesss privacy is unnecessarily intruded upon, but there must be a sufficient factual and evidentiary basis for the trial judge to properly consider and weigh the factors set out in s. 276.\nApplication to This Case\nThe appellant argues that the trial judge erred in denying the application to introduce prior sexual activity evidence. He argues the evidence was not being proffered for twin-myth reasoning but rather on the basis that it was relevant to challenging the complainants credibility and to the context required for his defence. The complainants credibility was put in issue because her evidence about whether the nature of her relationship to the appellant was sexual was equivocal. The nature of the complainants relationship to the appellant could either prove or disprove the Crowns argument that the sexual assault occurred after their marriage broke down, which was critical to the appellants ability to make full answer and defence to the Crowns case.\nI disagree. Ultimately, and particularly in light of the chaotic way in which the s. 276 application was presented (C.A. reasons, at para. 94, per Fitch J.A.), the appellant was unable to discharge his burden of satisfying the conditions for admissibility of the prior sexual activity evidence. In this case, the prior sexual activity evidence had no permissible purpose for either context or credibility. The regime under s. 276 requires trial judges to first consider whether the evidence is inadmissible because it supports an inference relying upon one or both of the twin myths. It is an error of law to admit evidence that supports twin-myth reasoning. I agree with the majority that the trial judge did not err by finding that the evidence would invoke twin-myth reasoning. The fact that the parties here previously had a sexual relationship is uncontested and is admitted. For this reason, there could be no use for the April 1 evidence beyond twin-myth reasoning. As the majority noted, the proposed evidence could not provide any greater context for understanding the complainants actions on April 2, or whether she did or did not consent beyond unequivocally impermissible reasoning: that if they had had consensual sex on April 1, they did so again on April 2; or, that her denials of consent should not be believed based on their prior consensual intercourse (para. 180).\nI agree with the majority that the proposed evidence held little relevance to either context or challenging the complainants credibility. As explained above, the question of relevance is reviewed on a correctness standard. With respect to context, the appellants application must fail for the same reason as in Goldfinch: . . . the difficulty here was not that Goldfinch and the complainant had a relationship, but that Goldfinch could point to no relevant use for evidence of the sexual nature of the relationship (para. 47 (emphasis in original)). The complainant here did not dispute that her marriage to the accused involved sexual activity, and therefore the prior sexual evidence was not needed to establish this. In this regard, the present case is unlike Harris and Temertzoglou, where the nature and origin of the relationships were central to the inconsistencies in the complainants testimonies that formed the basis for admitting the evidence. Here, there was no inconsistency in the complainants testimony and therefore no risk that the trial judge would not understand the nature of their relationship (see C.A. reasons, at para. 190, per Fitch J.A.).\nWith respect to the appellants argument on the evidences relevance to credibility, the trial judge and majority on appeal found the complainant did not give inconsistent statements about the nature of her relationship with the appellant. I see no reason to interfere with this conclusion. I agree with the majority that the complainant did not give any inconsistent statements about whether their relationship was sexual or not (see paras. 185-89). The Attorney General of Alberta, intervening before this Court, rightly points out that it does not follow that the end of a marriage or other romantic relationship signals the end of a sexual relationship. Therefore, it was not inconsistent for the complainant to have stated that their marriage was over but that there was other consensual sexual activity after their separation. In the absence of any inconsistent statements by the complainant, Crosby offers no support to the appellant.\nEven if the evidence had some relevance to either context or credibility, I am not convinced the trial judge made any error in weighing its probative value against its prejudicial effect, and I would defer to his conclusion on this point. The appellant could not explain why the evidences probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. As noted in Goldfinch, the relative value of sexual history evidence will be significantly reduced if the accused can advance a particular theory without referring to that history (para. 69 (emphasis in original); R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 64; see also Brown and Witkin, at p. 389).\nIn the present case, nothing turned on whether they had engaged in consensual sex the prior night. The appellants theory was that their marriage had not broken down and consequently they engaged in consensual sex on April 2. As stated above, whether the relationship had ended did not determine the matter. Without any specific evidence on the materiality of the severance of this relationship in the specific circumstances of this case, this alone could not establish significant probative value of the prior sexual activity evidence. In contrast, the prejudicial effect of the proposed evidence was clear: as the trial judge held, the admission of the evidence would invoke and rely on twin-myth reasoning and would prejudice the complainants personal dignity and right of privacy. There was no benefit to the truth-seeking function of the trial to be gained.\nTwo points of correction are necessary with respect to the dissenting judges approach to this matter. First, as stated above, the review of a s. 278.94 determination is based only on the record that was before the trial judge at the time of the admissibility hearing. The dissenting judge, despite stating that his conclusion was based on the position advanced by [the appellant] on the application (para. 58), referred to the complainants testimony at trial and the Crowns closing submissions, neither of which formed part of the trial judges pre-trial ruling. This was improper and employed hindsight reasoning. Appellate courts must not widen the record available to review the trial judges determination.\nSecond, I would also reject the dissenting judges analysis of possible prejudice to the complainant if the prior sexual activity evidence were admitted. In assessing the factors under s. 276(3), the dissenting judge stated that concerns about the potential for prior sexual activity evidence to jeopardize the privacy and dignity of the complainant were minimized by the fact that she disclosed the activity in issue to the police and there is a publication ban concerning her identity (para. 79). This reasoning contradicts the animating purposes of the s. 276 regime, which includes encouraging the reporting of sexual offences by complainants and to do so by eliminating to the greatest extent possible those elements of the trial which cause embarrassment or discomfort to the complainant (Seaboyer, at p. 605 (emphasis added); see also Darrach, at paras. 19 and 25; Criminal Code, s. 276(3)(b)). As the majority of the Court of Appeal correctly observed, at paras. 194-95, the fact that an individual has reported a sexual assault to the police, or that their identity is subject to a publication ban, cannot disentitle them to the full protective benefit of s. 276. To hold otherwise would automatically diminish the scope of protection afforded by the legislature under s. 276 in almost every sexual assault case.\nReconsideration of the Pre-trial Ruling\nMy colleagues take the position that the trial judge fell into error by failing to reconsider his pre-trial ruling in light of how the complainants testimony evolved between her statement to police and her trial testimony. With respect, this question is beyond the proper scope of this appeal.\nAppeals to this Court from conviction by an accused person are governed by s. 691(1) of the Criminal Code, which limits the scope of appeal not simply to questions of law, but specifically to those questions of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents (see also R. v. J.A., 2011 SCC 28, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 440, at para. 84, per Fish J., dissenting, but not on this point).\nMy colleagues approach to the question of jurisdiction relies in part on the instruction in Dunlop v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 881, that [i]n ascertaining the real ground upon which dissent is based, if the formal judgment fails to make that clear, this Court may look to the written reasons of the dissenting judges (p. 889). In Dunlop, the formal judgment did not specifically set out the grounds of dissent. In order for the Court to determine whether a specific ground raised a question of law, it was necessary to look at the dissenting judges written reasons. Doing so revealed that the crux of the dissenting judges concern was whether the jury should have been instructed on party liability at all, a clear question of law.\nIn contrast, here the formal judgment plainly states the issue of dissent is whether there was an error in the pre-trial ruling. Even when one looks at the written reasons, as instructed in Dunlop, the issue dissented on was not whether the trial judge should have revisited his initial ruling. Unlike in Dunlop, neither the majority nor the dissent address this issue in their reasons. Whether the trial judge erred by failing to revisit his pre-trial ruling is a separate question from whether he erred in the pre-trial ruling itself, and these questions are assessed on different evidentiary records. The dissenting judges references to evidence adduced at trial were not directed to the question of whether the trial judge should have revisited the pre-trial ruling but rather to whether the pre-trial ruling itself was correct. Accordingly, the issue of whether the trial judge ought to have revisited his pre-trial ruling is not a question of law on which a judge of the Court of Appeal below dissented.\nThis question was also not raised by the parties before this Court: the notice of appeal does not raise the issue; the appellant did not raise the issue in his factum; and this Court received no meaningful submissions on it at the hearing. Had the appellant wished to argue this issue on appeal, he could have sought leave (see R. v. Keegstra, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 381, at paras. 23-24). He did not.\nEven if the trial judge revisited his pre-trial ruling, I disagree with my colleagues that the complainants trial testimony required the trial judge to reconsider his pre-trial ruling and that the admission of the prior sexual activity evidence became necessary in light of the complainants trial testimony. My colleagues suggest that the complainants protests at the time of the sexual assault that she was no longer the appellants wife suggested that their separation was a factor in her lack of consent, and that the admission of the prior sexual activity evidence was necessary to respond to this suggestion and test the complainants credibility.\nMy colleagues and I are in agreement that the relevance and probative value of prior sexual activity evidence may not crystallize until witnesses have begun their testimony and the evidence, or the inconsistency or materiality thereof, becomes apparent. Where the evolution of a witness testimony at trial results in a material change in circumstances, the trial judge may, either on their own initiative or by request from either party, revisit an earlier s. 276 ruling in light of the new evidence or information (R.V., at paras. 72-75; R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 65). \nThe possibility of reconsideration of a pre-trial ruling in no way relieves the defence of its responsibility not only to make out the application at first instance, but also, in the majority of cases, to make a request for reconsideration and articulate the permissible purposes of the evidence in light of the changed circumstances. Generally speaking, absent a request at trial for reconsideration, appellate courts should review the merits of a trial judges s. 276 pre-trial ruling in the context of the record on which it was made. However, if the nature of the evidence at trial cried out for a reconsideration, an appellate court may find that a trial judge was required to revisit their prior s. 276 ruling of their own motion even without being specifically asked to do so by counsel (R. v. L.S., 2017 ONCA 685, 354 C.C.C. (3d) 71, at paras. 63-64; Harris, at paras. 50-51). The power of a trial judge to reconsider their own s. 276 ruling of their own motion is limited, and must be exercised in a manner that is consistent with the s. 276 regime, specifically that the accused specify the use for which the evidence is proposed and that the complainant has standing.\nI am not of the view that the evidence in this case cried out for reconsideration. If the appellant was concerned that the complainants testimony linked her lack of consent to the parties separation, it was open to him to ask the trial judge to reconsider his pre-trial ruling and permit him to argue the relevance of the evidence on this basis. There was the opportunity to do so when, mid-trial, the defence argued that he should be permitted to cross-examine the complainant about further sexual activity that occurred on April 2, after the alleged assault, because the appellant would be advancing an opposing version of events. Furthermore, there was ample opportunity for the appellant to take an approach along the lines of what my colleagues suggest, and he made the tactical decision to proceed otherwise. At the mid-point of the trial, the defence did not seek the admission of the April 1 evidence because the complainants evidence on the separation had evolved. Rather, in the defences submission, the April 1 evidence was essential pursuant to the rule in Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.), because he anticipated the accused would be testifying to further sexual activity that occurred on April 2, after the alleged assault. He also suggested that, due to the wording of the charge before the court, all sexual activity between April 1 to April 2 could be seen as the subject-matter of the charge and therefore not subject to s. 276 at all. After obtaining an adjournment to consider his position, defence counsel did not pursue the admission of the prior sexual activity evidence from April 1.\nIt is not the role of this Court to speculate as to defence counsels reasons for approaching the issue in this manner or to substitute its own view of what he should have done differently. Such decisions are protected by solicitor-client privilege and are often made for entirely valid strategic purposes.\nLimitations on Court Openness on Appeals of Section 276 Determinations\nThe Crown brought a motion before this Court requesting orders necessary in light of sections 278.93 to 278.95 of the Criminal Code (p. 1), namely that the appeal proceed in camera, that the parties factums be sealed and only redacted versions made public, and any other order deemed necessary. The appellant opposed only the obligation to further redact his factum beyond information covered under ss. 276 and 278.93 to 278.95, arguing that certain unredacted information was already published in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. On an interim basis, the Court accepted the filed materials under seal and held the hearing in camera pending its final disposition of the motion.\nThe Crowns motion requires this Court to consider the source of its powers to make orders limiting court openness on appeals of s. 276 determinations. This issue engages an exercise in statutory interpretation. The modern approach to be taken is well known: . . . the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, as cited in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21).\nThe Crown argues that s. 278.95 and the discretion it affords applies to this Court; or, if it does not, then this Court can make certain orders for the conduct of the hearing and publication of their reasons pursuant to its implied jurisdiction. Section 278.95 reads as follows:\nPublication prohibited\n\n278.95 (1) A person shall not publish in any document, or broadcast or transmit in any way, any of the following:\n\n(a) the contents of an application made under subsection 278.93;\n\n(b) any evidence taken, the information given and the representations made at an application under section 278.93 or at a hearing under section 278.94;\n\n(c) the decision of a judge or justice under subsection 278.93(4), unless the judge or justice, after taking into account the complainants right of privacy and the interests of justice, orders that the decision may be published, broadcast or transmitted; and\n\n(d) the determination made and the reasons provided under subsection 278.94(4), unless\n\n(i) that determination is that evidence is admissible, or\n\n(ii) the judge or justice, after taking into account the complainants right of privacy and the interests of justice, orders that the determination and reasons may be published, broadcast or transmitted.\n\nOffence\n\n(2) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.\nSection 278.95 thus prohibits the publication of information and evidence adduced for applications and admissibility hearings pursuant to ss. 278.93 and 278.94, but provides trial judges with a discretion to permit the publication of their decision or determination under s. 278.93(4) or 278.94 by others after considering the complainants right of privacy and the interests of justice.\nAs I will explain, this Courts implied jurisdiction grants it authority to make orders for the conduct of its hearings and publication of its reasons, not s. 278.95. I begin first by summarizing the history and purpose of the prohibition on publication under s. 278.95 before considering its application to this Court.\nHistory and Purpose of Section 278.95\nFollowing this Courts decision in Seaboyer, Parliament passed Bill C-49, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual assault), S.C. 1992, c. 38, introducing a suite of reforms to sexual offence provisions and procedures in the Criminal Code. This included a prohibition on publication (at the time under s. 276.3 and now contained in s. 278.95). The statutory scheme governing s. 276 applications today balances, on the one hand, the constitutional right of the accused to make full answer and defence and, on the other hand, the complainants right not to have irrelevant, highly sensitive details of their sexual history dredged up before the court (Seaboyer, at pp. 620-21; Crosby, at para. 11; Darrach, at para. 19; Mills, at paras. 17 and 61). Neither interest is absolute nor overriding; instead, the statutory regime requires trial judges to balance these interests against each other, bearing in mind the objectives of protecting the integrity of the trial, the accuseds trial rights, the security and privacy of complainants, and equality rights (Seaboyer, at p. 606; Darrach, at para. 19; R. v. Kruk, 2024 SCC 7, at para. 40).\nIn the first draft of the bill, trial judges had no discretion to publish their decision or reasons on applications to adduce evidence of other sexual activity. As the Honourable Kim Campbell explained at the Committee meeting on the bill, [w]hen Bill C-49 was drafted, I viewed the inclusion of a provision banning publication as essential to protect the privacy interests of complainants and to encourage them to come forward with their reports of sexual assault (House of Commons, Legislative Committee on Bill C-49, Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of Legislative Committee on Bill C-49, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sexual assault), No. 6, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., June 2, 1992, at p. 46). At the same time, there were countervailing factors that favoured publication of admissibility decisions. Judicial accountability, not only for the decisions themselves but the manner in which they were made, was a concern raised by the National Association of Women and the Law as well as the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (see Legislative Committee on Bill C-49, No. 4, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., May 20, 1992, at pp. 25 and 46). Ensuring the consistent application of the law across the country was another concern that justified the possibility of publication (see Legislative Committee on Bill C-49, No. 5, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., May 21, 1992, at p. 18 (Stephen Bindman); see also House of Commons Debates, vol. VIII, 3rd Sess., 34th Parl., April 8, 1992, at p. 9528 (George S. Rideout)). Accordingly, subsequent amendments to the bill added a discretion for trial judges to publish their decision and reasons on inadmissibility after taking into account a complainants privacy and dignity and the interests of justice.\nFurther amendments to the regime were made in 2018 through Bill C-51, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Department of Justice Act and to make consequential amendments to another Act, S.C. 2018, c. 29, though the publication prohibition remained largely the same. The debates at that time again highlighted the dual interests of an accuseds fair trial rights and a complainants privacy interests:\nFirst, [the regime] respects the fair trial rights of the accused in that it does not prevent relevant evidence from being used in court. The Supreme Court has already recognized that an accuseds right to full answer and defence does not include a right to defence by ambush.\n\nSecond, it acknowledges the privacy interests of a complainant. While privacy interests do not trump all else, the regime seeks to acknowledge that victims of sexual assault and other related crime, even when participating in a trial, have a right to have their privacy considered and respected to the greatest extent possibly.\n\nFinally, the regime seeks to facilitate the truth-seeking function of the courts by ensuring that evidence that is clearly irrelevant to an issue at trial is not put before the courts, with its potential to obfuscate and distract the trier of fact. \n\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 249, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., December 11, 2017, at pp. 16218-19 (Marco Mendicino))\n \nThe factors a trial judge must consider in exercising their discretion to lift the prohibition on publication thus reflect two key policy values underlying sexual assault trials: the accuseds right to make full answer and defence and the complainants right of privacy.\nHowever, even at the inception of what is now s. 278.95, it was unclear whether the wording of the provision captured appellate proceedings:\n. . . Mr. Borovoy wants to guarantee a right of appeal. We are not sure, as the legislation is currently drafted, if a case on this point is appealed to the appeal court if this publication ban is still in effect. For example, in the Seaboyer case, the entire media in the country probably breached the publication ban imposed when the evidence was originally sought to be admitted and as it worked its way up. So I think that certainly needs clarification. \n\n(Legislative Committee on Bill C-49, No. 5, at p. 17 (Stephen Bindman))\nAs is evident, no clarification was made to the provisions application to appellate proceedings before its enactment.\nText and Legislative Scheme of Section 278.95\nThe Crown suggests that the mandatory ban under s. 278.95 of the Criminal Code extends to appellate proceedings and allows the Court to order that this appeal hearing proceed in camera (as it did at trial, pursuant to s. 278.94) and to seal the filed materials. The corollary of this argument is that the Court may also displace the presumptive prohibition on publication under s. 278.95 and permit the publication, broadcast or transmission of the trial judges decision under s. 278.93 or determination under s. 278.94, after balancing the complainants privacy and dignity and the interests of justice.\nIn my view, there are several reasons s. 278.95 does not support the Crowns proposition. First, a plain reading of the text suggests that it is aimed not at courts but at other entities who would otherwise publish a courts decisions, such as law reporters, media outlets and reporters, and the general public. Section 278.95(1) prohibits publication by [a] person while s. 278.95(2) creates an offence for [e]very person who contravenes subs. (1). The definition of every person in the Criminal Code, while specifically including His Majesty and organizations, does not mention courts (see s. 2). Person is not a defined term in the Criminal Code, and is defined in the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, simply as including a corporation (s. 35(1)). Applying the ordinary sense of the word person, this clearly would not include a court. It is notable that some neighbouring provisions to s. 278.95 make specific reference to a judge, provincial court judge or justice (see ss. 278.92 and 278.93) and that a court of appeal is a defined term in the Criminal Code that is used throughout (s. 2). Importantly, a court cannot be found guilty of the offence created by s. 278.95(2). It is thus not evident on a plain reading that a person could reasonably be expanded to include judges, justices, or courts of appeal. The wording of s. 278.95 also states that it is only the judge or justice who made a decision under s. 278.93(4) or 278.94(4) who may order the publication, broadcast or transmission of otherwise prohibited information. This indicates that the power to displace the presumptive statutory prohibition is limited to trial judges who have the ability to make such orders in trial proceedings.\nThe scope and application of s. 278.95 must also be interpreted in light of its scheme and object. Section 278.95 is situated among a series of provisions dictating the procedural requirements where the accused seeks to obtain or adduce evidence relating to a complainant in which there is a privacy and personal dignity interest (see Criminal Code, ss. 278.1 to 278.98). These issues are matters of evidentiary admissibility, an issue which does not typically arise in appellate proceedings. The purpose of these procedural provisions as a whole is to provide a means of ensuring that the substantive protections against improper use of other sexual activity evidence are enforced (Darrach, at para. 20); their primary focus is aimed at thwarting attempts to bring distorting evidence into the trial in the first place. Read in this context, the objects of s. 278.95 can be understood as furthering the goal of keeping improper evidence out of trial proceedings by restricting the publication of evidence and information that would ordinarily occur in the normal course of a trial, and entrusting the decision as to whether publication of the s. 278.93(4) decision or s. 278.94(4) determination is appropriate to the judge or justice who has had the benefit of hearing all submissions on the admissibility of the proposed information or evidence. In this respect, too, s. 278.95 seems primarily concerned with the conduct of trial proceedings.\nFinally, the provisions relating to the admissibility of other sexual activity evidence contemplate the appeal of such determinations (see s. 278.97) but do not explicitly extend the trial protections to appellate proceedings or otherwise indicate the appropriate procedure on appeal. Had Parliament intended for s. 278.95 to apply to reviewing courts, it could have explicitly stated so.\nFor these reasons, I am not convinced that s. 278.95 applies to this appeal, as the Crown suggests. In the absence of a legislatively imposed exception to the open court principle, the presumption of court openness persists.\nThe Court Has Implied Jurisdiction To Make Orders Limiting Court Openness\nThe Courts power to make an order limiting court openness in this case is derived from the implied jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records (Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480 (C.B.C. v. New Brunswick), at para. 37; R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421, at p. 1457; Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. MacIntyre, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 175, at p. 189). Pursuant to this implied jurisdiction, a court may exercise its discretion to make orders for the conduct of a hearing, including orders that a hearing proceed in camera, and for the sealing of filed materials. Accordingly, this Court may consider whether this is an appropriate case to exercise its discretion in this manner.\nI note at the outset that a courts discretion to make orders that limit court openness is not to be exercised lightly. This Court has long recognized the importance of the open court principle as a vehicle to give effect to freedom of expression and fair trial rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well as to promote confidence and integrity in the administration of justice (Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, at pp. 876-77 and 882; R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, at para. 29; MacIntyre, at p. 185; C.B.C. v. New Brunswick, at paras. 21-22; Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 75, at paras. 30 and 39). But while court openness is the rule, it is not an absolute or overriding principle. It is balanced against other interests that are worth protecting, such as the legislative objectives underlying the s. 276 regime. The exercise of this Courts discretion must give effect to these legislative objectives, notwithstanding that, in this case, they do not operate through the vehicle of s. 278.95. In this regard, I echo the observation by the court in R. v. Davies, 2022 BCCA 103, 412 C.C.C. (3d) 375, that while the legislative provisions governing the disclosure and use of personal and private information in sexual offence cases do not apply on appeal, their substantive purpose, protecting the dignity and privacy of complainants, is not limited to the trial process (para. 18 (emphasis added)). The complainants personal interest in privacy and dignity, and the publics shared interest in the same, are still present on appeal, though the interests of justice that are weighed against privacy and dignity interests are informed by the particular function of this Court as the apex appellate court.\nFurther, when considering restrictions on appellate court openness, a court of appeal should also consider what orders were previously made in relation to the trial. As courts of second or third instance, appellate courts act in sequence and have a unique position: not only do they have the ability to uphold or overturn prior decisions about court openness restrictions, but whether and what restrictions were imposed in the proceedings below may impact an appellate courts decision to add, remove, or modify such restrictions on appeal. This may be especially salient when Parliament has imposed mandatory restrictions at the trial level in an attempt to encourage the reporting of sexual offences (see Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 122, at para. 15). \nLimiting Court Openness in This Case\nIn my view, in the circumstances of this case, the Crown has not established that the Court should exercise its discretion to make all of the requested orders. My analysis is guided by the test articulated by Kasirer J. in Sherman Estate at para. 38, affirming the test set out in Dagenais and Mentuck:\nIn order to succeed, the person asking a court to exercise discretion in a way that limits the open court presumption must establish that: \n(1) court openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest;\n(2) the order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent this risk; and,\n(3) as a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects. \n(See also, generally, Dagenais, at p. 878; Mentuck, at para. 32.)\nAs this appeal concerns a sexual offence, I have applied the Sherman Estate test drawing on the legislative context and objectives of the s. 276 regime and the two analytical factors set out under s. 278.95  the complainants right of privacy and the interests of justice  which the Crown relied on in its submissions. This approach allows for the analysis in this case to meaningfully balance the open court principle with Parliaments intentions of protecting the fairness and integrity of sexual offence trials for accused persons and complainants privacy and security.\nThe threshold to satisfy this test remains high. As Kasirer J. went on to note in Sherman Estate, at para. 63:\n. . . in order to preserve the integrity of the open court principle, an important public interest concerned with the protection of dignity should be understood to be seriously at risk only in limited cases. Nothing here displaces the principle that covertness in court proceedings must be exceptional. [Emphasis added.]\n(See also MacIntyre, at p. 189; C.B.C. v. New Brunswick, at para. 22.)\nI am satisfied that the sexual nature of the evidence in this case touches on the complainants dignity and right of privacy, and that publication of this type of information gives rise to a serious risk of affront to the public interests of personal privacy and dignity (Sherman Estate, at para. 77; Fedeli v. Brown, 2020 ONSC 994, 60 C.P.C. (8th) 417, at para. 9). Privacy and personal dignity are public interests that have been recognized in our jurisprudence (see MacIntyre, at pp. 185-87; C.B.C. v. New Brunswick) including in cases involving sexual offences (see R. v. Jarvis, 2019 SCC 10, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 488, at para. 82). Protecting the complainants privacy and personal dignity, as far as practicable, promotes the objectives of the Criminal Codes statutory protections for complainants in encouraging reporting of offences, participation in the process, and overall confidence in the administration of justice (R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 30).\nHowever, I am not persuaded that this risk can only be addressed through the requested orders. An applicant seeking a limiting order must articulate why the serious risk to the complainants privacy and dignity warrants a greater restriction on court openness than would be occasioned by an alternative measure. The Crown has not established that the risk to the complainants privacy and dignity requires a sealing order or in camera hearing. Sealing orders and in camera hearings are greater incursions on court openness compared to publication bans, because they more absolutely limit public discourse on the subject information by preventing access to the protected material entirely (see J. Rossiter, K.C., Law of Publication Bans, Private Hearings and Sealing Orders (loose-leaf), at  1:11-1:12).\nI am not persuaded that the circumstances of this case justify these measures. I am mindful of the fact that the trial proceedings were sealed and held in camera, as required by ss. 278.94 and 278.95, and that the bulk of the file in the Court of Appeal was also under seal and the hearing held in camera, with public reasons. However, in my view, there are alternative measures that sufficiently protect the complainants privacy and dignity.  \nWith respect to the request for a sealing order, the full contents of the Courts file do not need to be sealed in order to protect the complainants privacy and dignity. This can be accomplished in this case by banning publication of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity other than that which forms the subject-matter of the charge, and I would make such an order. This balances respect for the goal of restricting publication of the details of s. 276 applications with this Courts task as an appellate court to provide guidance to lower courts. The request to hold the hearing in camera is also a greater restriction than is necessary. Proceeding in camera at the trial level pursuant to s. 278.94 permits counsel in all cases to freely and vigorously argue the merits of the application where the information and evidence sought to be adduced may be highly prejudicial and its value is untested. In contrast, this appeal deals with a question of law and counsel are able to argue their case without heavy reliance on information and evidence that is mandatorily protected under s. 278.95. The publication ban that I would impose under the Courts implied jurisdiction, the statutory one imposed under s. 486.4, and the use of initials for the appellant are further measures that protect the complainants privacy and dignity on this appeal.\nAdditionally, I do not find that the benefits of the requested orders outweigh their negative effects, bearing in mind the interests of justice in this case. The scope of the interests of justice within the open court principle is broad: in the jurisprudence, it has included an accuseds fair trial rights and right to make full answer and defence; the truth-seeking function of the trial process; the importance of freedom of the press to report on matters and the right of the public to receive such information; the proper administration of justice; and others (see, e.g., Crosby, at para. 12; Mills, at paras. 73-74; Mentuck, at paras. 23-24; C.B.C. v. New Brunswick, at paras. 23-25 and 39). In this case, the interests of justice include Parliaments goal of protecting the integrity of sexual offence trials. As this Court observed in Mills, [i]f constitutional democracy is meant to ensure that due regard is given to the voices of those vulnerable to being overlooked by the majority, then this court has an obligation to consider respectfully Parliaments attempt to respond to such voices (para. 58). \nI have also considered the responsibility of this Court to provide clear and authoritative statements of law and guidance to lower courts, which supports judicial accountability in sexual offence trials. Reasons from, and hearings before, this Court provide not only an explanation of an appeals resolution to the parties but also give meaning to the judgments precedential value which, through the principle of stare decisis, binds and guides lower courts in the consistent application of the law. The interests of justice weigh in favour of court openness in this case because this appeal asks the Court to clarify the appropriate use of prior sexual activity evidence for context and credibility purposes. The law on sexual offences is quickly and ever-evolving, and guidance from appellate courts is important for the proper adjudication of these cases and to fulfill Parliaments objectives to ensure fair sexual offence trials. In view of the alternative measures available, the benefits of the requested orders do not outweigh their negative effects on court openness.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the Crowns motion in part by making less restrictive orders than those requested.\nDisposition\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. The trial judge made no errors in his determination that the applicant had not identified a use for the prior sexual activity evidence that did not rely on twin-myth reasoning and that was relevant to an issue at trial.\nI would allow the Crowns motion in part. The circumstances of this case do not justify all of the orders requested. I would order that:\nAny information about or reference to the nature of sexual activity of the complainant which is at issue in this proceeding, other than that which forms the subject-matter of the charge, shall not be published, broadcast, or transmitted; and\nThe parties shall file, within 30 days, versions of their factums for posting on the Courts website in which any information about or reference to the nature of sexual activity of the complainant at issue in this proceeding, other than that which forms the subject-matter of the charge, and any information that could identify the complainant, shall be redacted.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tCote and Moreau JJ.  \nIntroduction\nWe agree with our colleagues disposition of the Crowns pre-hearing motion. We take no issue with her conclusion that courts have implied jurisdiction to control their own processes. We further agree that the trial judge did not err in his initial pre-trial determination on the voir dire under s. 276 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The trial judge made appropriate findings on the evidentiary record available to him at the time of the voir dire.\nHowever, we are of the view that this conclusion does not end the analysis. In the instant case, the central issue in the trial was credibility. The complainants testimony evolved from her first statement to the police to her trial testimony  following the trial judges ruling on the s. 276 voir dire  and would have left the trier of fact with the mistaken impression that the circumstances of the separation and her belief that the appellant was in a relationship with another woman made it unlikely and improbable for her to consent to sexual activity with him.\nThis evolution of the evidence should have prompted the trial judge to revisit the voir dire ruling made at the pre-trial stage. As we will explain, trial judges have an obligation to revisit their previous rulings when there is a material change in circumstances. In light of the complainants trial testimony-in-chief, the trial judge should have allowed the appellant to cross-examine her about the consensual sexual activity that took place between her and the appellant the previous evening for the limited purposes of neutralizing the suggestion that she was unlikely to consent to sexual activity after their separation and testing her credibility on this point. In failing to do so, the trial judge committed a reviewable error.\nAs we explain below, we are of the view that the issue is within our Courts jurisdiction. We would therefore allow the appeal, quash the conviction, and order a new trial.\nEvolution of the Evidence and the Record\nThe Evolution of the Complainants Evidence\nThe complainant reported to the police on April 9, 2018 that the appellant had sexually assaulted her one week before. She told the police that she and the appellant had separated in February 2018 after a trip they took. She also mentioned that she and the appellant had consensual sexual intercourse on April 1 because he had asked nicely and because she did not want her son to overhear an argument. During the preliminary inquiry, the complainant indicated that the two separated in February 2018, following which the appellant moved into the basement. She said that the relationship ended that same month.\nIn support of his pre-trial application under s. 276, the appellant highlighted the complainants statement to the police, where she indicated that she had consensual sexual intercourse with the appellant both during their trip in February and on April 1. He also referred to her preliminary inquiry testimony where she said that the relationship ended over a week after their February trip.\nWe agree with our colleague that there is no inconsistency between the complainants statements that she consented to sexual activity with the appellant on April 1 and that the parties had separated in February. Had this been the extent of the complainants evidence regarding the separation, there would be no basis upon which to admit the April 1 evidence which was at the heart of the pre-trial application under s. 276.\nThe situation changed, however, when the complainant testified at trial.\nThe complainants trial testimony suggested that the separation factored into her lack of consent on April 2. She testified that when the appellant grabbed her, she responded, I am not your wife anymore (A.R., vol. I, at p. 96). When the appellant called her name and told her that she was his wife, she answered, [t]here is a real certificate already, Im not your wife anymore and you already got a girlfriend (p. 97). When the appellant touched her shoulder, she said, [d]ont touch me, Im not  Im no longer your wife (p. 98). When he responded that they were still husband and wife, having not yet signed the divorce papers, she disagreed and said [n]o, its not the case, you have already got [a] wife (p. 98).\nConsidered in isolation, these statements suggest that it was unlikely that the complainant would consent to sex with the appellant in light of their separation and his relationship with another woman. The April 1 evidence provides crucial context to these statements, as the complainant had reported to the police that the two had in fact had consensual sex during their separation, just hours before the April 2 events which formed the basis of the allegations against the appellant.\nDiscussions at Trial\nWhile defence counsel did not bring this evolution in the complainants evidence to the trial judges attention, there were further discussions of the April 1 evidence after the complainant testified. The focal point of these discussions was not the evening before April 2, but rather the afternoon of April 2. The appellant denied that any sexual activity occurred on the morning of April 2 and claimed that he and the complainant had consensual sex later in the afternoon.\nDefence counsel sought to cross-examine the complainant about this version of events. The sexual activity on April 1 was relevant to this line of inquiry insofar as defence counsel sought to adduce evidence to demonstrate that the complainant and the appellant had spent the evening of April 1 together in the appellants bedroom (see A.R., vol. I, at pp. 123 et seq.). The trial judge refused to admit this evidence (p. 142).\nStandard of Review\nIn our view, the standard of review on the question of whether sexual activity evidence is admissible under s. 276 is correctness. On this issue, we agree with Moldaver J.s position in his concurring reasons in R. v. Goldfinch, 2019 SCC 38, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 101: The determination of whether sexual activity evidence is admissible under s. 276 raises a question of law . . . . A ruling on this matter is therefore reviewable on a standard of correctness.\nWhile appellate courts owe deference to the factual conclusions that underpin the analysis, the overarching question of whether the trial judge erred in determining whether or not to admit the evidence is reviewable on a standard of correctness. We come to this conclusion based on s. 278.97 of the Criminal Code, where Parliament has explicitly stated that such a determination shall be deemed to be a question of law. Indeed, excerpts from the parliamentary debates regarding this provision, while scarce, support an interpretation that would give appellate courts a more active role in overseeing decisions made under s. 276. Before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Senator Dalphond highlighted some advantages to treating these decisions as ones that raise a question of law. In particular, doing so would give appellate courts broader jurisdiction, allowing them to step in more easily to give the proper interpretation to these provisions and to come to the right result (Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, No. 48, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., September 20, 2018, at p. 73).\nThe case before us illustrates the benefits of Parliaments decision to deem s. 276 determinations as questions of law, because the standard of correctness allows us to fully engage with the evolution of the evidence. As we will explain, a careful review of the record reveals elements that are fundamental to the appellants right to make full answer and defence. In this particular case, these elements should have prompted the trial judge to revisit his pre-trial dismissal of the appellants s. 276 application following the complainants testimony-in-chief at trial.\nThe Trial Judges Ability To Revisit a Pre-trial Ruling\nIn enacting s. 276 of the Criminal Code, Parliament sought to strik[e] a balance between the rights of the accused and those of the complainant by codifying rules pertaining to the admission of evidence regarding a complainants sexual history (see R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 35). This regime categorically bars the admission of such evidence for twin-myth reasoning and affirms the equality and dignity rights of complainants (Goldfinch, at para. 43).\nThe evidence captured by s. 276 is presumptively inadmissible. That said, this presumption is rebuttable. To tender evidence of a complainants sexual history at trial, the accused must establish, on a voir dire, that the evidence (a) is not being adduced for the purpose of supporting twin-myth reasoning; (b) is relevant to an issue at trial; (c) is of specific instances of sexual activity; and (d) has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice (see Criminal Code, s. 276(2)). In balancing the probative value against the danger of prejudice, the trial judge is tasked with considering a list of factors in s. 276(3). If a trial judge ultimately determines that the danger of prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value, the evidence cannot be tendered at trial and the application made under s. 276 is denied.\nThroughout the trial, trial judges must remain attentive to the evolving nature of the evidence. Even when trial judges have decided not to admit evidence in a ruling under s. 276, their role with respect to this evidence does not end there.\nTrial judges may revisit pre-trial rulings on their own motion as the evidence evolves during trial, provided, of course, that they give the parties an opportunity to make submissions on the issue (see, e.g., R. v. Arens, 2016 ABCA 20, 334 C.C.C. (3d) 379; R. v. Farrah, 2011 MBCA 49, 87 C.R. (6th) 93). Pre-trial rulings are not set in stone; indeed, trials are dynamic and often unpredictable processes. Consequently, as Sopinka J. wrote in R. v. Adams, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 707, at para. 30, [a]s a general rule, any order relating to the conduct of a trial can be varied or revoked if the circumstances that were present at the time the order was made have materially changed. Where the evidence develops in such a way as to warrant revisiting a pre-trial ruling, it is important that the trial judge or counsel raise these issues on the record.\nOur Courts jurisprudence demonstrates that the trial judge has a particularly important role to play with respect to evidentiary rulings in the context of sexual assault trials. As our Court recently noted in R.V., at para. 74, an order related to the conduct of trial may be varied or revoked if there is a material change of circumstances. In R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, our Court provided an example of the type of evidentiary shift that would make it appropriate for a trial judge to revisit a ruling made under s. 276:\n. . . where a complainant makes a statement to the police that prior sexual activity occurred but later contradicts that evidence in her testimony at trial, that contradictory testimony would open the door to the defence bringing a renewed s. 276 application seeking to have the prior sexual activity evidence admitted for credibility purposes, despite an initial ruling of inadmissibility. [Citations omitted; para. 65.]\nCounsel plays an important role in bringing such evidentiary shifts to the trial judges attention. When there is a material change in circumstances, either party may request that a previous evidentiary ruling be re-visited (R.V., at para. 74).\nNevertheless, this role does not fall exclusively on counsels shoulders. Trial judges have the ability to revisit s. 276 rulings even in cases where counsel has not made a formal request or application. In the excerpt from Barton cited above, our Court went on to expressly recognize that [t]here may be circumstances in which it would be appropriate for the trial judge to reopen a s. 276 ruling and hold a new hearing to reconsider the admissibility of prior sexual activity evidence (para. 65 (emphasis added)). While this passage does not explicitly address the issue of whether trial judges can raise the issue on their own motion, its wording suggests that they have an active role to play in this respect.\nTrial judges have an obligation to remain alert to the evidentiary developments that warrant revisiting s. 276 rulings, particularly those made prior to trial. As our Court explained in R.V., at para. 72:\nSection 276 continues to operate even after an initial evidentiary ruling has been rendered. Trial judges must therefore remain vigilant in ensuring the objectives of the provision are upheld as the trial unfolds. Cross-examination about the complainants sexual history, where permitted, should be closely monitored to ensure it remains within the permissible limits. And as evidence emerges, it may become necessary to re-consider prior s. 276 rulings. [Emphasis added.]\nThere are circumstances in which the evidence crie[s] out for a reconsideration of a prior ruling (see R. v. L.S., 2017 ONCA 685, 354 C.C.C. (3d) 71, at para. 63). Even where counsel fails to raise this material change in circumstances, the trial judge has an obligation to, at the very least, invite submissions on the issue. As noted in the excerpt above from R.V., some cases will make it necessary  rather than merely appropriate  to revisit a prior ruling. This approach may impose a high standard on trial judges. That said, it is already established in our jurisprudence that they have a duty to ensure that the accuseds rights with regard to cross-examination, which are so essential to the defence, are protected (R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 673, per Cory J.).\nWe would draw a parallel with this Courts comments in R. v. Hodgson, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449, at para. 41 (in relation to the need to conduct a voir dire on the voluntariness of an accuseds statement):\nHowever, where the defence has not requested a voir dire and a statement of the accused is admitted into evidence, the trial judge will only have committed reversible error if clear evidence existed in the record which objectively should have alerted him or her to the need for a voir dire notwithstanding counsels silence. Thus, the test for holding a voir dire is assessed by an appellate courts objective review of the evidence in the record to determine whether something should have triggered the trial judges obligation to conduct an inquiry.\nThe logic underlying this passage is transposable to the context of s. 276. As a general rule, trial judges have a duty to conduct [a] trial judicially quite apart from lapses of counsel (see R. v. Sweezey (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 400 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 417 per Martin J.A., endorsed in Hodgson, at para. 41). Like the trial judges obligation to direct that a voir dire be held, revisiting a ruling contributes to maintaining trial fairness and avoiding a miscarriage of justice. The accuseds right to a fair trial is constitutionally protected (see R. v. Kahsai, 2023 SCC 20, at para. 35), and the trial judge has a duty to uphold that right (see Amell v. The Queen, 2013 SKCA 48, 2013 D.T.C. 5102, at para. 25; R. v. Harris (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 498 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 51).\nSpecifically, with respect to s. 276, our Court has stated that [t]he ultimate responsibility for enforcing compliance with the mandatory s. 276 regime lies squarely with the trial judge, not with the Crown. After all, it is the trial judge, not the Crown, who is the gatekeeper in a criminal trial (Barton, at para. 68). Thus, trial judges ongoing task to revisit their rulings is particularly acute under the s. 276 regime (see R. v. Edmundson, 2023 ONSC 4236, at para. 22 (CanLII), citing Barton, at para. 65). Our colleague suggests that the trial judges powers in this regard must be informed by the fact that s. 276 requires that the accused specify the use for which the evidence is proposed and that the complainant has standing. However, the accuseds constitutionally protected right to make full answer and defence is also a vital component of the provisions framework. This dimension of s. 276 also informs the scope of the trial judges power to revisit their own rulings. Section 276 strik[es] a balance between the accuseds right to make full answer and defence and the dignity and privacy of complainants (see Goldfinch, at para. 39). It follows that trial judges responsibility to ensure that s. 276 is properly applied is crucial not only to evidence that may need to be screened out, but also to evidence that may need to be admitted for the accused to be afforded the opportunity to make full answer and defence.\nWhile pre-trial rulings are useful for streamlining and focusing the trial process, they should not hinder the accuseds ability to make full answer and defence in a criminal trial.\nJurisdiction\nWe begin by maintaining that our Court has jurisdiction to consider this issue.\nWe acknowledge that an appeal under s. 691(1)(a) of the Criminal Code is limited to the questions of law on which a judge of a court of appeal dissents, unless the appellant seeks leave to address other issues (see R. v. Keegstra, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 381, at paras. 23-24; see also R. v. Downes, 2023 SCC 6, at para. 56, regarding s. 693(1)(a)).\nHaving said that, it is important to maintain some flexibility in identifying what is at the heart of the dissent. For instance, [i]n ascertaining the real ground upon which dissent is based, if the formal judgment fails to make that clear, this Court may look to the written reasons of the dissenting judges (Dunlop v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 881, at p. 889, per Dickson J. (as he then was); see also p. 908, per Pratte J.; M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2023 (30th ed. 2023), at para. 51.332, citing Dunlop). While the situation in Dunlop is not identical to the one before us, this example demonstrates that appellate courts need not take an overly formalistic approach in assessing the substance of a dissent. It is worth bearing in mind that [c]riminal appeals on questions of law are based in part on the desire to ensure that criminal convictions are the product of error-free trials (R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 26). An unduly rigid approach to characterizing the question on which a judge dissents would prevent the Court from addressing the substance of their disagreement.\nIn the case before us, the question on which Frankel J.A. dissented is whether or not the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence of the parties sexual activity on April 1. We are responding to that same question; the trial judges obligation to revisit the s. 276 ruling is simply the mechanism through which we do so. It is not a separate or standalone question. We also note that, as our colleague mentions, Frankel J.A. referred to the complainants trial testimony and to the Crowns closing submissions. We agree with our colleague that the way in which he considered this evidence was improper; as she notes at para. 43 of her reasons, the pre-trial ruling should be assessed on the basis of the record that was available to the judge at that time. Nevertheless, Frankel J.A.s failure to identify the basis upon which an appellate court could legitimately consider the trial evidence should not prevent this Court from doing so in responding to the overarching question of whether the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the April 1 evidence.\nFurthermore, our reasons do not raise any new issues. It is true that an appellate court that raises new issues on appeal must allow the parties to make submissions on those matters. This requirement only comes into play, however, when the issue is truly a new one. In R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 35, our Court determined that an appellate court will be found to have raised a new issue when the issue was not raised by the parties [or] cannot reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties (emphasis added). In our view, the question of whether the trial judge should have revisited the pre-trial ruling can be said to stem from the issues as framed by the appellant and respondent, in this case, the admissibility of their prior consensual sexual activity. It is clear from our jurisprudence that a pre-trial ruling, including a ruling under s. 276, may need to be revisited during the trial. A determination of whether the trial judge erred in failing to do so must consider how the evidence in respect of the pre-trial ruling unfolded at trial.\nWe would add to this that the trial judge had an opportunity to address the events of April 1 during the course of the trial. This aspect of the proceedings lends further support to our conclusion that the issue we are addressing is not a new one. As noted by Frankel J.A., dissenting, when defence counsel attempted to cross-examine the complainant on whether she had spent the evening of April 1 in the appellants bedroom, Crown counsel objected and the trial judge excused the complainant from the courtroom (2022 BCCA 312, 418 C.C.C. (3d) 169, at para. 28). It is true that the focal point of these discussions was not the precise issue we are addressing. Nevertheless, since those discussions concerned the parties interactions on April 1, they provided the trial judge with an opportunity to consider the significant impact of the complainants in-chief trial testimony on his pre-trial ruling. The trial judge failed to take this opportunity to revisit that ruling.\nThis sequence of events also suggests that defence counsels failure to explicitly raise the issue was not, as our colleague says, a strategic decision. Defence counsel did indeed try to circle back to April 1 and was met with opposition from the trial judge and Crown counsel. We fail to understand what tactical advantage the appellant could have gained by not expressly flagging the evolution of the complainants testimony. Defence counsels failure to address this specific aspect of the proceedings appears to be a lapse  the consequences of which should not fall on the appellant  rather than a deliberate strategic choice. He obtained an adjournment for the specific purpose of seeking guidance on the Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.), issue (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 130-36); there is nothing on the record to suggest that he considered and rejected the possibility of invoking the evolution of the complainants trial testimony.\nApplication\nIn our view, the complainants trial testimony should have prompted the trial judge to revisit the pre-trial ruling under s. 276.\nHaving established that this Court has jurisdiction to consider the effect of the evolution of the trial evidence, we would conclude that the trial judge ought to have permitted cross-examination of the complainant on the events of April 1.\nThe complainants trial testimony left the trier of fact with the impression that she was unlikely to consent to sex with the appellant after their separation. To be clear, we are not suggesting that the mere fact of separation makes consent more or less likely. Rather, the complainants trial testimony suggests that, according to this particular complainant, consent was improbable in the context of separation. In other words, her testimony transformed the neutral fact of separation into an element that supported the conclusion that she did not consent to the sexual activity.\nThe testimony should have opened the door to cross-examination of the complainant regarding her consensual sexual activity with the appellant on April 1 for two limited purposes: (1) to neutralize the suggestion that the complainant was unlikely to consent after the separation, and (2) to test her credibility on this point.\nThus, the April 1 evidence does not derive its relevance from twin-myth reasoning. Its purpose would not be to suggest that the complainant was more likely to consent to sexual activity on April 2 because she consented under similar circumstances  i.e., those of the separation  on April 1. Nor would it suggest that she is inherently less worthy of belief because she and the appellant engaged in other sexual activity. Rather, the purpose of the evidence would be to dispel the impression  created by the complainants trial testimony  that she would not have consented to sex with the appellant given their separation and his relationship with another woman.\nOnce the complainant testified at trial, the April 1 evidence became relevant. We would draw a parallel with Harris. In that case, a pre-trial ruling had excluded evidence of alleged consensual sexual activity between the complainant and the appellant. At trial, the complainant testified that the two did not have a sexual relationship and that she had made it known to the appellant that she was not interested in one. For the court, Moldaver J.A. (as he then was) concluded that by testifying as she did, the complainant placed the nature of her relationship with the appellant in issue. As a result, the appellant was entitled to lead evidence to rebut the complainants testimony (see Harris, at para. 42).\nThe decision in Harris illustrates that, in some situations, evidence of prior sexual activity becomes relevant to challenging a complainants depiction of the relationship because it is fundamental to the coherence of the defence narrative (see Goldfinch, at para. 66). There need not be inconsistent statements in order for this to be the case. For instance, when the complainant suggests that her relationship with the accused has hitherto been platonic because of their separation, she herself is putting the sexual nature of the relationship at issue. In some cases, the complainants depiction of the relationship may make the accuseds claim that the complainant consented to sex untenable or utterly improbable (to borrow the language used in Goldfinch, at para. 68). It may be that the only way for the accused to test this depiction would be to demonstrate that the relationship had previously included a sexual dimension.\nOf course, a mere assertion that evidence of prior sexual activity is relevant to the context of a relationship or to credibility is not sufficient. In general, whether or not a relationship has previously included a sexual component is not relevant to determining whether a complainant has consented to a particular instance of sexual activity. We stress that the accused must not be allowed to suggest that the complainant was more likely to have consented to the sexual activity in question because she had previously consented in the context of the same relationship. Trial judges must remain vigilant in ensuring that relationship evidence does not serve this prohibited purpose, which would fall squarely within twin-myth territory.\nHowever, the situation changes when the evidence suggests that, because of the platonic nature of a particular relationship, the complainant would be unlikely to consent. In such circumstances, when [l]eft unchallenged, the complainants testimony regarding their relationship with the accused could become potentially devastating to [the accuseds] position (see Harris, at para. 49).\nThis is one such case. Without the April 1 evidence, the complainants testimony would leave the trier of fact with the impression that the separation and the appellants relationship with another woman made his narrative untenable or utterly improbable (Goldfinch, at para. 68). The complainant herself brought the sexual nature of the relationship into question, by implying that she was unlikely to consent to sex with the appellant during their separation. As we know from the complainants police statement, this implication was not accurate; she had told the police that the two had consensual sexual intercourse on April 1, a couple of months after they separated. Before the complainants trial testimony, the April 1 evidence was not relevant. However, her testimony created a material change in circumstances that triggered the trial judges obligation to revisit his pre-trial ruling. As was the case in Harris, defence counsels failure to raise this particular issue is not fatal.\nIn our view, the trial judge should have allowed the appellant to cross-examine the complainant about the consensual sexual activity of April 1, as this evidence satisfies the criteria set out in s. 276. As we have explained, it is not being adduced for the purpose of supporting one of the twin myths and is relevant for two specific purposes. The evidence also pertains to specific instances of sexual activity.\nMoreover, the evidence has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice. This balancing exercise depend[s], in part, on how important the evidence is to the accuseds right to make full answer and defence (Goldfinch, at para. 69). Unlike in Goldfinch, excluding the evidence in the case before us would compromise the appellants right to do so: without this evidence, the appellant would be unable to challenge evidence that severely undermined his own narrative with respect to the central issue of consent. With respect to the danger of prejudice, we strongly disagree with Frankel J.A.s statement that the complainants disclosure to the police diminishes the impact of the admission of the evidence on her dignity and right to privacy. On this point, we are in complete agreement with our colleagues comments that his statement contradicts the animating purposes of the s. 276 regime (para. 44).\nNonetheless, in this case, the appellants right to make full answer and defence tilts the balance in favour of admitting the evidence. Moreover, a limiting self-instruction outlining the evidences permissible uses  which are narrowly circumscribed  would mitigate the potential prejudice.\nConsequently, we would allow the appeal, quash the conviction, and order a new trial.\n\tAppeal dismissed, Cote and Moreau JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Helps Law Corporation, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Ministry of Attorney General, B.C.

T.W.W.\n\nThis appeal involves the use of prior sexual activity evidence in a sexual assault trial and raises questions about the admissibility of such evidence and the limits of court openness.\n\nThe complainant and the accused, T.W.W., were in a romantic relationship for over 20 years before separating in February 2018. The accused was charged with sexual assault against the complainant on April 2, 2018. He applied to adduce evidence of consensual intercourse between himself and the complainant on the evening of April 1, 2018, as part of his defence, pursuant to sections 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge dismissed the application, and the accused was subsequently convicted of sexual assault. The accused appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence of prior sexual activity.\n\nThe accused's appeal process involved multiple levels of court proceedings. The trial judge initially dismissed the application to adduce evidence of prior sexual activity, finding that it was not relevant to the issue of consent on April 2 and that it would invoke twin-myth reasoning. The accused appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal, which upheld the trial judge's decision. The accused further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada as of right. Meanwhile, the Crown brought a motion requesting orders to protect information covered by sections 276 and 278.93-278.95 regarding the appeal process. The Court considered the source of its authority to limit court openness on appeals of section 276 proceedings and ultimately determined that section 278.95 of the Criminal Code does not extend to the appeal process. However, the Court found that it had the implied jurisdiction to make orders limiting court openness derived from its jurisdiction to control its own processes and records.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada established the principle that evidence of prior sexual activity may be admissible in a sexual assault trial if it is not used to support twin-myth reasoning and if its probative value is not substantially outweighed by prejudicial effect. The accused bears the burden of establishing a specific use for this information that is permitted by the s. 276 regime and that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice OBonsawin held that the trial judge did not err in denying the application to introduce prior sexual activity evidence under sections 276 and 278.93 of the Criminal Code. The appellant failed to identify a specific use for the evidence that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and was essential to his ability to make full answer and defence. The majority also held that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the Criminal Code does not extend to appellate proceedings, but the Court has implied jurisdiction to make orders limiting court openness. However, the Crown's motion to restrict publication and hold the hearing in camera was only partially allowed, with the Court imposing a publication ban on any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity other than that which forms the subject-matter of the charge.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court says a trial court was right to refuse evidence of  prior sexual activity in a sexual assault case. \u00a0\u00a0</strong>The accused was convicted of a sexual assault that  took place on April 2, 2018. The complainant was his spouse, who testified that  her marriage to the accused had completely broken down in February of that  year. However, in an earlier statement to the police, the complainant also  stated that she and the accused had engaged in consensual sexual activity on  the evening of April 1, the night before the sexual assault. Prior to his trial, the accused asked the court to  allow evidence that he and the complainant had engaged in consensual sexual  activity in the evening of April 1 and in the morning of April 2. He argued  that admitting such evidence would serve to challenge the complainant\u2019s  credibility \u2013 specifically with respect to her claim that the marriage had  completely broken down at the time of the alleged assault \u2013 to provide context,  and to support his defence that the complainant had consented to the sexual  activity, as it was all part of one interaction. Under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual activity with the  accused or with any other person is not admissible to support an inference that  the complainant is either (a) more likely to have consented to the sexual  activity at the center of the charge; or (b) is less worthy of belief. In law,  this is called \u201ctwin-myth reasoning\u201d and relying on such inferences is not  allowed.The trial judge dismissed the accused\u2019s application to  admit this evidence. He found no inconsistency between the complainant\u2019s  statement to the police and her testimony. In his view, the evidence the accused  wanted to submit was irrelevant to her credibility \u2013 it would only serve to  support one of the two inferences prohibited under section 276(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. As required under section  278.95 of the <em>Criminal </em>Code, the  content of the accused\u2019s application, the hearing that was held to decide the  issue and the trial judge\u2019s decision were subject to a publication ban. The  case went to trial and the accused was ultimately convicted. The accused\u2019s appeal proceeded <em>in camera </em>(closed to the public) and the appeal record was sealed  (not made public). A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia  dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal. It agreed with the trial judge that the accused  had not identified a legitimate use of the proposed evidence. The accused then appealed the decision to the Supreme  Court of Canada. By way of a motion, the Crown relied on section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to ask the Court for an <em>in camera </em>hearing, for filed materials  to be sealed, and for any other order necessary to protect information and  evidence related to the accused\u2019s application to admit evidence on prior sexual  activity. The Court heard oral arguments on the motion before continuing with  the hearing on the appeal. The Supreme Court has dismissed the accused\u2019s appeal  and allowed the Crown\u2019s motion in part. \u00a0\u00a0<strong>The evidence of prior sexual activity was inadmissible at the trial.</strong>Writing  for the majority, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin held that the accused failed to  sufficiently identify a specific use for the prior sexual activity evidence  that did not invoke twin-myth reasoning and that was essential to his ability  to make full answer and defence. The trial judge did not make a mistake in  denying the application. As such, the accused\u2019s conviction was upheld. With respect to the Crown\u2019s motion, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin determined  that the mandatory publication ban under section 278.95 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>did not extend to  appellate proceedings. Rather, she said the Supreme Court\u2019s power to make an  order limiting court openness in the instant case was derived from implied  jurisdiction of courts to control their own processes and records. The Court\u2019s  discretion should be exercised in a way that maintains court openness as far as  practicable while protecting the complainant\u2019s personal dignity and privacy and  the accused\u2019s fair trial rights.Justice O\u2019Bonsawin then applied the test set out in <a href=\"/case-dossier/cb/2021/38695-eng.pdf\"><em>Sherman Estate v. Donovan</em></a>, a prior unrelated  decision of this Court, to conclude that the circumstances of the instant case  did not justify all of the measures requested by the Crown. Banning publication  of any information about or reference to the nature of the sexual activity  other than that which formed the subject-matter of the charge was  sufficient.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 "

Lozada\n2024 SCC 18\nFile Nos.: 40701, 40709.\n2024: February 13; 2024: May 17.\nPresent: Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Jamal and Moreau JJ.\non appeal from the court of appeal for ontario\n\tCriminal law  Charge to jury  Co-principal liability  Group assault  Manslaughter  Causation  Intervening act  Both accused part of group that attacked victim but fatal stab wound inflicted by other group member  Accused convicted of manslaughter by jury  Accused appealing convictions and claiming that trial judge erred in jury instructions on causation in context of co-principal liability  Whether jury properly instructed.\n\tL and R were involved in a physical altercation between two groups of people. The victim was stabbed in the heart and died. L and R did not inflict the fatal stab wound and there was no evidence that they knew or foresaw that any person in their group had a knife or that the victim would be stabbed. At L and Rs jury trial, the Crown advanced two theories of party liability for manslaughter: as co-principals under s. 21(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and as aiders under s. 21(1)(b). L and R were convicted of manslaughter. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed their appeals. The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeals and ordered a new trial, on the basis that the trial judge misdirected the jury in his instructions on causation in the context of co-principal liability.\n\tHeld (Rowe and Jamal JJ. dissenting): The appeals should be dismissed.\n\tPer Karakatsanis, Martin and Moreau JJ.: On a reading of the jury instructions and the trial judges answers to the jurys questions as a whole, the jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation. The instructions conveyed the proper test for causation: whether L and Rs conduct was a significant contributing cause of the victims death. Moreover, the trial judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools to assist the jury in determining whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would absolve L and R of legal responsibility for manslaughter.\n\tAppellate courts take a functional approach in reviewing jury instructions by asking whether the jury was properly, not perfectly, instructed so as to equip the jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. The instructions must be read as a whole, and must be responsive to the evidence and set out the law in plain and understandable terms. Responses to questions from the jury require particular care because they carry influence exceeding the instructions given in the final charge. In cases involving causation, which is case-specific and fact-driven, trial judges must be accorded the flexibility to put issues of causation to the jury in an intelligible fashion that is relevant to the circumstances of the case.\n\tThe overall test for legal causation for manslaughter is whether the accuseds unlawful acts were a significant contributing cause of death. In cases where an intervening act is said to have broken the chain of causation between the accuseds acts and the victims death, asking whether the intervening act was reasonably foreseeable or was an independent factor can be helpful analytical aids, but the overall significant contributing cause test is the legal standard. With respect to the reasonable foreseeability analytical aid, there is no requirement that the specific subsequent attack be reasonably foreseeable; it is sufficient if the general nature of the intervening act and the risk of non-trivial harm are objectively foreseeable at the time of the dangerous and unlawful acts. The reasonable foreseeability inquiry asks whether the intervening acts and the harm that actually transpired flowed reasonably from the conduct of the accused. While some degree of specificity about the nature of the intervening act must have been reasonably foreseeable, there is no requirement for objective foreseeability of the precise future consequences of the accuseds conduct.\n\tThe act of a co-participant in a group assault can trigger the application of the intervening act doctrine. There is no single test or measure for determining whether a particular act has broken the chain of causation. The issue in considering joint liability as co-principals under s. 21(1)(a) is whether the unlawful acts of the accused were a significant contributing cause of the victims death. The Court in R. v. Strathdee, 2021 SCC 40, has left open the prospect of an instruction addressing a discrete or intervening event even in the case of co-participants in a group assault.\n\tIn the instant case, the trial judges legal causation instructions conveyed the correct overall test and focused the jurys attention on L and Rs contribution to the victims death. The trial judges two statements that it may be enough to establish legal causation if the continuation of assaults on the victim was reasonably foreseeable should be understood in the context of the full instructions. The jury would not have found this factor to be adequate to establish legal causation without also accepting that the continuation of assaults was of the same general nature as the stabbing, or that the stabbing flowed reasonably from L and Rs conduct. Accepting that L and R did not know or foresee that anyone in their group had a knife would not force a conclusion on legal causation. The jury was broadly instructed to consider whether and how the conduct of L and R contributed to the victims death or whether the fatal act flowed reasonably from that conduct. Read in context, the impugned statements would not have conveyed to the jury that it could have concluded that the stabbing did not break the chain of causation simply because the continuation of the assaults was reasonably foreseeable if it did not also accept that the continuation of the assaults was of the same general nature as the stabbing, or that the stabbing flowed reasonably from L and Rs conduct.\n\tPer Rowe and Jamal JJ. (dissenting): The appeals should be allowed, the manslaughter convictions set aside and a new trial ordered. There is agreement with the majority that L and R were entitled to have the jury properly instructed on how an intervening act may affect legal causation for unlawful act manslaughter. There is also agreement that an intervening act instruction is available in a case involving co-principal liability arising out of a group assault. There is, however, disagreement that the trial judges intervening act instruction in the instant case properly instructed the jury on the issue of causation for unlawful act manslaughter.\n\tThe trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury by repeatedly instructing them that, even though the victim was stabbed by another member of the group involved in the group assault, it may be enough to make L and Rs unlawful actions in participating in the group assault legal causes of the victims death if it was reasonably foreseeable that the assaults on the victim would continue and create a risk of non-trivial bodily harm to him. Even when read functionally and as a whole, the trial judges instructions on the causation element of unlawful act manslaughter did not properly equip the jury to decide the case according to the law. A reasonably foreseeable intervening act will not usually break the chain of legal causation so as to relieve the offender of legal responsibility for an unintended result. However, what has to be reasonably foreseeable is the general nature of the intervening acts and the accompanying risk of harm. This standard requires greater specificity than the standard of reasonable foreseeability of the risk of further non-trivial bodily harm. An intervening act may break the chain of legal causation because the general nature of the intervening act and the accompanying risk of harm is not reasonably foreseeable, even though the risk of further non-trivial bodily harm is reasonably foreseeable.\n\tTo find that L and Rs actions were legal causes of the victims death even though he was stabbed by another member of the group, the jury had to find that the stabbing did not break the chain of legal causation from L and Rs unlawful actions to the victims death. Based on the trial judges instructions, however, at least some members of the jury may have incorrectly found that the stabbing did not break the chain of legal causation simply because the continuation of the assaults on the victim and the resulting risk of non-trivial bodily harm to him was reasonably foreseeable. A single ambiguous or problematic statement in one part of a charge will not necessarily be an error of law where the charge as a whole equipped the jury with an accurate understanding of the relevant legal issue. In the instant case, however, other parts of the trial judges instructions did not prevent the jury from being inaccurately instructed on whether the stabbing broke the chain of legal causation.\n\tMoreover, the trial judges instructions did not make clear that the reasonable foreseeability of the continuing assaults may be enough to establish legal causation despite the stabbing of the victim, provided that the stabbing was of the same general nature as a continuation of the assaults. Simply repeating the test for legal causation, pointing to relevant evidence, and inviting the jury to consider whether the stabbing was extraordinary, unusual or overwhelming, or flowed naturally from or was directly related to L and Rs unlawful conduct, would not have made this underlying premise clear to the jury.\nCases Cited\nBy Moreau J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

Trehearne, Jennifer Epstein and Samuel Greene, for the respondent.\n\tThe judgment of Karakatsanis, Martin and Moreau JJ. was delivered by\n\tMoreau J.  \nOverview\nThe appellants, Emanuel Lozada and Victor Ramos, appeal as of right to this Court under s. 691(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed their appeals from jury convictions for unlawful act manslaughter. The dissenting judge would have allowed their appeals and ordered a new trial. \nThe charges against the appellants arose from physical altercations between two groups of people who had been attending a rave in downtown Toronto. The first altercation was a fight between Rameez Khalid and Joseph Triolo in which Mr. Khalid had the upper hand. A glass bottle may have been used. However, the first altercation did not result in significant physical injuries. Both men were angry after the fight, but Mr. Khalid and his friend, Travis Galliah, walked away from the scene.\nThe other group, which included Mr. Triolo and the appellants, followed shortly after. The Crowns theory at trial was that the group pursued Mr. Khalid and Mr. Galliah to settle the score (2023 ONCA 221, 166 O.R. (3d) 179, at para. 7). When the two groups met, someone (whom the Crown argued was Mr. Ramos) pushed Mr. Khalid up against a wall and yelled, [i]s this the guy? (paras. 19 and 177). After someone else responded, [y]eah, another fight broke out (para. 19). Mr. Triolo, Mr. Ramos and others from the group attacked Mr. Khalid, who fell to the ground and was punched and kicked by multiple persons. Mr. Lozada fought Mr. Galliah, knocking him to the ground and repeatedly punching him. Approximately 15 seconds after this second altercation began, Mr. Khalid was stabbed twice, in the abdomen and fatally through the heart. He collapsed into the street and died several seconds later. The appellants did not inflict the fatal stab wound and the Crown conceded at trial that there was no evidence that the appellants knew or foresaw that any person in their group had a knife or that Mr. Khalid would be stabbed. \nThe jury was satisfied that Mr. Triolo was the stabber, and so he was convicted of second degree murder. The appellants were convicted of manslaughter. At trial, the Crown advanced two theories of party liability for manslaughter: as co-principals under s. 21(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and as aiders under s. 21(1)(b). The Crown maintained that the appellants actions under either theory supported their convictions. These appeals are concerned only with the Crowns theory of liability under s. 21(1)(a). The appellants submit that the trial judge misdirected the jury in his instructions on causation in the context of co-principal liability and in his response to a question from the jury seeking further clarification on causation.\nI am essentially in agreement with the majority of the Court of Appeal that, on a reading of the jury instructions and the trial judges answers to the jurys questions as a whole, the jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation. The instructions conveyed the proper test for causation: whether the particular appellants conduct was a significant contributing cause of death. Moreover, on the particular facts of this case, the trial judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools described in R. v. Maybin, 2012 SCC 24, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 30, to assist the jury in determining whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would absolve the appellants of legal responsibility for manslaughter. \nTherefore, I would dismiss the appeals.\nThe Trial Judges Instructions on Causation\nThe trial judge began the causation instructions by setting out the proper test for legal causation: whether the particular appellants unlawful act was a significant contributing cause of death. In other words, was each appellants conduct sufficiently connected with the death that it remained a significant contributing cause that continued until [Mr.] Khalids death without interruption (A.R., vol. XXIV, at pp. 105-6)? The trial judge clarified that this inquiry does not simply amount to determining the medical cause of Mr. Khalids death but also concerned the contribution of the [appellants] to that result (p. 106).\nThe trial judge then discussed the reasonable foreseeability concept in relation to the facts of the case. He noted that the fact that none of the [appellants] knew that anyone in their group had a weapon, or expected that anyone in their group would use a weapon, d[id] not necessarily mean that their conduct was not a significant contributing cause of death (p. 106). He continued:\nThe specific act of stabbing does not need to be reasonably foreseeable at the time of the particular [appellants] dangerous unlawful act for that dangerous unlawful act to be a significant contributing cause of death. If the continuation of assaults on [Mr.] Khalid and the risk of nontrivial bodily harm to [Mr.] Khalid from those continuing assaults was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the particular [appellants] dangerous unlawful act, that may be enough for an [appellants] conduct to be a significant contributing cause of death. It is up to you. [pp. 106-7]\nNext, the trial judge posed several additional questions about the effect of each appellants conduct in relation to the fatal stabbing. The jury was told to consider: (1) whether those assaulting Mr. Khalid and Mr. Galliah significantly contributed to Mr. Khalids death by preventing the possibility of aid or escape, or otherwise rendering Mr. Khalid more vulnerable to a fatal knife attack; (2) if Mr. Khalid was the aggressor and determined to fight despite being outnumbered, whether fighting with him before the stabbing really made him more vulnerable to a knife attack; (3) whether there really was any possibility that [Mr.] Galliah would have aided [Mr.] Khalid or helped him escape if he had not been kept busy by those who were fighting with him; and (4) whether the stabber could have inflicted the wounds if others were or were not attacking Mr. Khalid (pp. 108-9).\nThe trial judge concluded this portion of his instructions by reiterating the overall significant contributing cause standard for legal causation (p. 109).\nDuring deliberations, the jury asked for a definition for a break in the chain of causation (A.R., vol. VIII, at p. 7). \nIn response, the trial judge first repeated the overall significant contributing cause standard and explained that this standard relates to whether it is still morally just and fair to hold the [appellants] legally responsible for the death (A.R., vol. XXIV, at p. 220). The jury could ask itself whether the stabbing was so overwhelming as to make the effect of the unlawful acts of the [appellants] merely part of the background (p. 220). The jury could also ask itself whether the stabbing was directly related to the unlawful acts of the [appellants] (p. 220). The trial judge then twice stated that the jury might consider whether the stabbing was extraordinary or unusual in the sense that an ordinary person would not reasonably foresee it (pp. 220-21). \nThe trial judge concluded his answer by listing three scenarios in which the fatal act would break the chain of causation:\nIf the fatal act was an extraordinary and highly unusual occurrence, as opposed to being an event that could ordinarily, or naturally flow from the circumstances of this case (p. 221);\nIf the fatal act was a reasonably unforeseeable act, remembering that the act of stabbing does not need to be reasonably foreseeable at the time of the particular [appellants] dangerous, unlawful act. If the continuation of assaults on [Mr.] Khalid and the risk of non-trivial bodily harm to [Mr.] Khalid from these continuing assaults was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the particular [appellants] dangerous, unlawful act, and flowed naturally from that dangerous, unlawful act, that may be enough (pp. 221-22); or\nIf the fatal act was an intentional act of a third party acting independently from the [appellants] (p. 222).\nThe Accuracy of the Jury Instructions\nRelevant Legal Principles\nAppellate courts take a functional approach in reviewing jury instructions by asking whether a jury was properly, not perfectly, instructed so as to equip the jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence (R. v. Abdullahi, 2023 SCC 19, at paras. 4 and 35-37; R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at paras. 8-9; R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 62). Importantly, the instructions must be read as a whole (Abdullahi, at para. 35). Jury instructions must be responsive to the evidence and set out the law in plain and understandable terms (R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at paras. 29-32). Responses to questions from the jury require particular care because they carry influence exceeding the instructions given in the final charge (R. v. Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, at p. 139; Abdullahi, at para. 42). \nIn Maybin, at para. 28, this Court held that the overall test for legal causation for manslaughter remains the same as the earlier statements from Smithers v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, and R. v. Nette, 2001 SCC 78, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488: were the accuseds unlawful acts a significant contributing cause of death? In cases where an intervening act is said to have broken the chain of causation between the accuseds acts and the victims death, asking whether the intervening act was reasonably foreseeable or was an independent factor can be helpful analytical aids, but the overall significant contributing cause test is the legal standard (paras. 26-29 and 44).\nWith respect to the reasonable foreseeability analytical aid, there is no requirement that the specific subsequent attack be reasonably foreseeable. Instead, it is sufficient if the general nature of the intervening act and the risk of non-trivial harm are objectively foreseeable at the time of the dangerous and unlawful acts (Maybin, at para. 34). Karakatsanis J. also described the reasonable foreseeability inquiry as asking whether the [intervening] acts and the harm that actually transpired flowed reasonably from the conduct of the accused (para. 38). Conversely, Maybin does require that [s]ome degree of specificity about the nature of the intervening act . . . be foreseeable (para. 37). It does not assist in addressing moral culpability to require merely that the risk of some non-trivial bodily harm is reasonably foreseeable (para. 38).\nThe circumstances of Maybin illustrate the type of specificity that is required when relying on the reasonable foreseeability analytical aid. Karakatsanis J. rejected the defences submission that it was pertinent that the bouncers assault of the unconscious victim was not reasonably foreseeable. It was sufficient for the trial judge to conclude that in the context of an escalating bar fight, it was reasonably foreseeable that further non-trivial harm would be caused by the interventions of other patrons and bar staff (para. 41). The relevant question was, more broadly, whether there was a risk of harm from third party interventions flowing from the accuseds conduct.\nApplication to This Case\nThe appellants submit that the jury was improperly instructed when the trial judge twice stated that it may be enough to establish legal causation if the continuation of assaults on Mr. Khalid, and accompanying risk of non-trivial bodily harm, was reasonably foreseeable (see A.F., at paras. 4-5 and 91-96). They argue that the trial judge should have told the jury that a stabbing could break the chain of causation unless the use of some weapon  or, at the very least, the heightened escalation of the assault  was reasonably foreseeable (para. 93).\nIn my view, the trial judges statements that it may be enough to establish legal causation if the continuation of assaults was reasonably foreseeable could be characterized as ambiguous in isolation, but accurate when read in the context of the instructions as a whole. Applying the directions from Maybin, at para. 38, it was correct to tell the jury that the reasonable foreseeability of continuing assaults may be enough to establish causation, provided that the jury accepted the premise that the continuation of assaults was of the same general nature as the fatal act (the stabbing) or that the stabbing flowed reasonably from the appellants conduct.\nThe remainder of the instructions made that underlying premise clear. The trial judge accurately stated the overall test for legal causation  whether the appellants conduct was a significant contributing cause of Mr. Khalids death  more than ten times in the course of his instructions and response to the jurys question (see A.R., vol. XXIV, at pp. 104-9 and 220-21). The repetition of this standard would have underscored to the jury that its assessment broadly concerned the contribution of the appellants to Mr. Khalids death. Moreover, the trial judge told the jury to consider whether the fatal stabbing would naturally flow from each appellants conduct, whether it was extraordinary and highly unusual, whether it was directly related to each appellants unlawful act, and whether it was so overwhelming as to make the conduct of the appellants merely part of the background or setting (pp. 220-21). \nThe further references to the evidence would have also centered the jurys attention on each appellants contribution to Mr. Khalids death. These include the trial judges prompts that the jury consider whether the appellants conduct rendered Mr. Khalid more vulnerable to the stabbing and whether Mr. Galliah could have aided Mr. Khalid if he was not being attacked (pp. 108-9).\nThe functional approach to appellate review of jury instructions requires that the charge be read as a whole (Abdullahi, at para. 35). As the trial judge explained, accepting that the appellants did not know or foresee that anyone in their group had a knife would not force a conclusion on legal causation. The jury was broadly instructed to consider whether and how the conduct of the appellants contributed to Mr. Khalids death or whether the fatal act flowed reasonably from that conduct  which is one way that Maybin defines what it means for the general nature of an intervening act to be reasonably foreseeable (para. 38). Read in context, the impugned statements would not have conveyed to the jury that it could have concluded that the stabbing did not break the chain of causation simply because the continuation of the assaults was reasonably foreseeable if it did not also accept that the continuation of the assaults was of the same general nature as the stabbing, or that the stabbing flowed reasonably from the appellants conduct. As Doherty J.A. reasoned for the majority of the Court of Appeal, it should not be assumed that a reasonably intelligent juror would . . . ignore the rest of the causation instructions if satisfied that the risk of non-trivial bodily harm was foreseeable at the time of the actions of [the appellants] (para. 196).\nCausation is case-specific and fact-driven (Maybin, at para. 17). Trial judges must be accorded the flexibility to put issues of causation to the jury in an intelligible fashion that is relevant to the circumstances of the case (Nette, at para. 72). In this case, there was evidence that would have supported the conclusion that the fatal stabbing was of the same general nature as the violent assaults that were underway. Mr. Khalid sustained multiple lacerations, abrasions and blunt force injuries to multiple parts of his body from the blows he received after being attacked by several people (C.A. reasons, at para. 163, per Paciocco J.A.). There was evidence that a glass bottle was used in the course of the earlier altercation (C.A. reasons, at para. 5). As the jury could have reasoned that the reasonable foreseeability of continuing assaults, and the accompanying non-trivial bodily harm, was a factor proving legal causation, the trial judge did not inaccurately instruct the jury by telling it that reliance on this factor may be enough. \nMoreover, Maybin does not structure the jurys reasonable foreseeability analysis by first requiring it to characterize the intervening act and then ask whether that type of act was reasonably foreseeable. Such an approach risks undermining Maybins holding that the specific intervening act need not be reasonably foreseeable (see paras. 34-35). While [s]ome degree of specificity about the nature of the intervening act must have been reasonably foreseeable, there is no requirement for objective foreseeability of the precise future consequences of the accuseds conduct (paras. 37-38). It is useful to recall that in Maybin, the Court concluded that it would be too specific to examine the foreseeability of the bouncers assault of the unconscious victim (paras. 39-40). Rather, the inquiry more broadly concerned the reasonable foreseeability of interventions of other patrons and bar staff (para. 41). Similarly, Jamal J.s suggestion that jurors could have characterized the general nature of the intervening act as assault with a weapon is in my view too narrow a formulation, and inviting the jury to first characterize the intervening act could generate confusion (see para. 48). With respect to the reasonable foreseeability analytical aid, Maybin only requires that the jury consider whether the general nature of the intervening acts and accompanying risk of harm was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the accuseds unlawful acts, or whether the intervening acts flowed reasonably from the accuseds conduct.\nIn sum, the trial judges legal causation instructions conveyed the correct overall test and focused the jurys attention on each appellants contribution to Mr. Khalids death. The trial judges two statements that it may be enough to establish legal causation if the continuation of assaults on Mr. Khalid was reasonably foreseeable should be understood in the context of the full instructions. The jury would not have found this factor to be adequate to establish legal causation without also accepting that the continuation of assaults was of the same general nature as the stabbing, or that the stabbing flowed reasonably from the appellants conduct.\nIntervening Acts and Group Assaults\nThe issue of whether it is legally possible, in the context of a group assault, for an intervening act to be committed by a member of the attacking group requires additional comment, having been raised by the Crown as a new issue before this Court. \nAs this Court held, [g]enuinely new issues are legally and factually distinct from the grounds of appeal raised by the parties . . . and cannot reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties (R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 30; see also Quan v. Cusson, 2009 SCC 62, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712, at para. 39). However, the applicability of the doctrine of intervening acts in the context of co-principal liability under s. 21(1)(a) of the Criminal Code arises naturally from the issues in these appeals as framed by the appellants, in particular, whether the trial judge erred by inaccurately instructing the jury with respect to the causation element of unlawful act manslaughter. Further, the appellants had the opportunity to respond to the Crowns new argument in their joint reply factum and at the oral hearing. \nThe possibility of an intervening act occurring in the context of a group assault was contemplated by this Court in R. v. Strathdee, 2021 SCC 40, at para. 4: \nJoint/coprincipal liability flows whenever two or more individuals come together with an intention to commit an offence, are present during the commission of the offence, and contribute to its commission. In the context of manslaughter, triers of fact should focus on whether an accuseds actions were a significant contributing cause of death, rather than focusing on which perpetrator inflicted which wound or whether all of the wounds were caused by a single individual. In the context of group assaults, absent a discrete or intervening event, the actions of all assailants can constitute a significant contributing cause to all injuries sustained. [Emphasis added.]\nThe causation inquiry is case-specific and fact-driven. There is no single test or measure for determining whether a particular act has broken the chain of causation. The issue in considering joint liability as co-principals under s. 21(1)(a) is whether the unlawful acts of the accused were a significant contributing cause of the victims death (Maybin, at paras. 18-29). Strathdee leaves open the prospect of an instruction addressing a discrete or intervening event even in the case of co-participants in a group assault.  \nAccordingly, I reject the Crowns argument before this Court that in no case can the act of a co-participant in a group assault trigger the application of the intervening act doctrine. \nConclusion\nI would dismiss the appeals.\n\tThe reasons of Rowe and Jamal JJ. were delivered by\n\tJamal J.  \nI agree with my colleague Moreau J. that the appellants were entitled to have the jury properly instructed on how an intervening act may affect legal causation for unlawful act manslaughter. As my colleague explains, an intervening act instruction is available in a case involving co-principal liability arising out of a group assault (see R. v. Strathdee, 2021 SCC 40, at para. 4).\nI respectfully disagree, however, with my colleagues conclusion, and that of the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the trial judges intervening act instruction properly instructed the jury on the issue of causation for unlawful act manslaughter. I substantially agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the dissenting justice in the Court of Appeal. \nThe Trial Judges Intervening Act Instruction Did Not Properly Instruct the Jury on Legal Causation\nIn my view, the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury by repeatedly instructing them that, even though Rameez Khalid was stabbed by another member of the group involved in the group assault, it may be enough to make the appellants unlawful actions in participating in the group assault legal causes of Mr. Khalids death if it was reasonably foreseeable that the assaults on Mr. Khalid would continue and create a risk of non-trivial bodily harm to him (A.R., vol. XXIV, at pp. 106-7 and 221-22).\nEven when read functionally and as a whole, the trial judges instructions on the causation element of unlawful act manslaughter did not properly equip the jury to decide the case according to the law. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that the test for legal causation is whether the appellants actions were significant contributing causes of Mr. Khalids death. But he also twice incorrectly instructed the jury  once in response to a question from the jury asking for a definition of a break in the chain of causation (A.R., vol. XXIV, at pp. 178 and 218)  that the stabbing may not break the chain of legal causation from the appellants unlawful actions to Mr. Khalids death if it was reasonably foreseeable that the assaults on Mr. Khalid would continue and create a risk of non-trivial bodily harm to him (pp. 106-7 and 221-22).\nIn my view, this instruction was erroneous. As this Court has recognized, a reasonably foreseeable intervening act will not usually break the chain of legal causation so as to relieve the offender of legal responsibility for an unintended result (R. v. Maybin, 2012 SCC 24, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 30, at para. 30). However, in order for legal causation to function as a narrowing concept that funnels a wider range of factual causes into those which are sufficiently connected to a harm to warrant legal responsibility (para. 16), what has to be reasonably foreseeable is the general nature of the intervening acts and the accompanying risk of harm (para. 38). This standard requires greater specificity than the standard of reasonable foreseeability of the risk of further non-trivial bodily harm. An intervening act may break the chain of legal causation because the general nature of the intervening act and the accompanying risk of harm is not reasonably foreseeable, even though the risk of further non-trivial bodily harm is reasonably foreseeable (paras. 37-38). Failing to appreciate this distinction would diminish the intervening act doctrines effectiveness as any limitation of the scope of criminal liability (para. 37).\nIn sum, to find that the appellants actions were legal causes of Mr. Khalids death even though he was stabbed by another member of the group, the jury had to find that the stabbing did not break the chain of legal causation from the appellants unlawful actions to Mr. Khalids death. Based on the trial judges instructions, however, at least some members of the jury may have incorrectly found that the stabbing did not break the chain of legal causation simply because the continuation of the assaults on Mr. Khalid and the resulting risk of non-trivial bodily harm to him was reasonably foreseeable.\nI accept that [a] single ambiguous or problematic statement in one part of a charge will not necessarily be an error of law where the charge as a whole equipped the jury with an accurate understanding of the relevant legal issue (R. v. Abdullahi, 2023 SCC 19, at para. 41). Here, however, other parts of the trial judges instructions did not prevent the jury from being inaccurately instructed on whether the stabbing broke the chain of legal causation.\nAlthough the trial judge explained the approach to legal causation by referring to other evidence and inviting the jury to consider whether the appellants unlawful actions made Mr. Khalid more vulnerable to being attacked with a knife, this line of inquiry would not have helped the jury to assess whether the stabbing was an intervening act that broke the chain of legal causation. For example, even though the appellants unlawful actions made Mr. Khalid more vulnerable to being stabbed, the general nature of the stabbing and the accompanying risk of harm may not have been reasonably foreseeable to the appellants. As a result, this aspect of the trial judges instruction did not adequately mitigate the risk that the jury may have applied the wrong reasonable foreseeability standard to find that the stabbing did not break the chain of legal causation.\nIn addition, in response to the jurys question asking for a definition of a break in the chain of causation, the trial judge told the jury that they may consider: (1) whether holding the appellants responsible for Mr. Khalids death is morally just and fair; (2) whether the stabbing of Mr. Khalid by another member of the group was so overwhelming as to make the appellants actions merely part of the background; (3) whether the stabbing was directly related to the assaults; and (4) whether the stabbing was extraordinary or unusual or whether it flowed naturally from the circumstances in this case (A.R., vol. XXIV, at pp. 220-21). Again, despite this further guidance, at least some members of the jury may have reasonably relied on the trial judges incorrect instruction and found that the stabbing of Mr. Khalid did not break the chain of legal causation simply because the appellants could have reasonably foreseen the continuation of assaults on Mr. Khalid and the resulting risk of non-trivial bodily harm. \nMy colleague Moreau J. concludes that the trial judge was correct to tell the jury that the reasonable foreseeability of continuing assaults may be enough to establish causation, provided that the jury accepted the premise that the continuation of assaults was of the same general nature as the fatal act (the stabbing) or that the stabbing flowed reasonably from the appellants conduct (para. 19). She also concludes that the remainder of the trial judges instructions made this underlying premise clear by repeating the test for legal causation, pointing to relevant evidence, and inviting the jury to consider whether the stabbing was extraordinary, unusual or overwhelming, or was directly related to or would naturally flow from the appellants unlawful conduct (paras. 20-21).\nRespectfully, I do not share this view. It was up to the jury, not the trial judge, to decide whether the intervening act (the stabbing) was of the same general nature as a continuation of the assaults. The trial judges inaccurate instructions cannot be salvaged by assuming that the jury would have characterized the general nature of the stabbing in this case as a continuation of [the] assaults (A.R., vol. XXIV, at p. 221). In any event, the trial judges instructions did not make clear that the reasonable foreseeability of the continuing assaults may be enough to establish legal causation despite the stabbing of Mr. Khalid, provided that the stabbing was of the same general nature as a continuation of the assaults. The trial judge never referred to the general nature of the stabbing. As a result, simply repeating the test for legal causation, pointing to relevant evidence, and inviting the jury to consider whether the stabbing was extraordinary, unusual or overwhelming, or flowed naturally from or was directly related to the appellants unlawful conduct, would not have made this underlying premise clear to the jury. \nThe risk of an improper instruction was especially high here because the trial judge repeated his incorrect instruction when the jury asked him to define a break in the chain of causation. As this Court recently explained in Abdullahi, [t]here is a greater risk that the jury has an inaccurate understanding of the law where an inaccurate statement is made in a recharge in response to a question from the jury . . .; this may well compound and thereby make more serious such an error (para. 42).\nI also agree with the following observations of former Justice David Watt on the importance of questions from the jury:\nAppellate courts say that answers to questions from the jury are extremely important. Questions carry an influence far exceeding the instructions in the main charge. If a jury asks a question about a subject covered in the main charge, it is clear that they did not understand or remember what was said about it in the main charge. Equally clear is that they must rely exclusively on the trial judges response to resolve any confusion or debate on the issue that may have taken place in the jury room prior to their question. A question submitted by the jury provides the clearest possible indication that one, several, or all jurors have the problem reflected in the question on which they seek further instructions. [Footnotes omitted.]\n\n(D. Watt, K.C., Helping Jurors Understand (2nd ed. 2023), at  9:6)\nIn this case, as reflected in the jurys question, the case against the appellants turned on the issue of what constitutes a break in the chain of legal causation. The jury could reasonably have been expected to focus on the trial judges answer in particular. I note that even the majority of the Court of Appeal accepted that the trial judges answer, [w]hen read in isolation, . . . can be said to have misstated the law as laid down in Maybin, but it concluded that when [r]ead as a whole, the instruction accurately put the law of causation as it applied to [the appellants] (2023 ONCA 221, 166 O.R. (3d) 179, at para. 207).\nThe Curative Proviso Does Not Apply\nIn the circumstances, I would not apply the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. \nIf an accused has shown that a jury instruction is improper, the Crown, if it seeks to rely on the [curative] proviso, bears the burden to establish one of the requirements of the proviso: that (1) the error of law is harmless, or (2) despite a potentially prejudicial error of law, there is an overwhelming case against the accused, such that the jury would inevitably have convicted the accused (Abdullahi, at para. 33, citing R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para. 25; see also R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 31; R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at para. 36). \nThe Crown argues that the evidence against the appellants was so overwhelming that there is no realistic possibility that a new trial would produce a different verdict (R.F., at para. 53). I disagree. The evidence did not conclusively establish whether the appellants could have reasonably foreseen the general nature of the stabbing of Mr. Khalid by another member of the group and the accompanying risk of harm. For example, had the trial judge properly instructed the jury, at least some members of the jury may have characterized the general nature of the intervening act  the stabbing of Mr. Khalid  as an assault with a weapon and found that the appellants could not have reasonably foreseen an assault with a weapon because there was no evidence that the appellants knew or foresaw that anyone in their group had a knife or would stab Mr. Khalid.\nIn the alternative, the Crown argues that the appellants would have been liable for manslaughter as aiders even if the jury had a reasonable doubt about the appellants liability as co-principals. I would not give effect to this submission. As all members of the Court of Appeal accepted, it cannot be known what route to liability the jury took in convicting the appellants (paras. 128 and 181). As the trial judge accurately instructed the jury, to convict the appellants of manslaughter as aiders, the jury had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt [t]hat a reasonable person in all the circumstances of the [appellants] would have appreciated that bodily harm that is neither trivial nor transitory was a foreseeable consequence of [the] assault on [Mr.] Khalid (A.R., vol. XXIV, at p. 112; see also R. v. Jackson, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 573, at p. 583). The jury could have had reasonable doubt about this issue because the appellants did not foresee that a knife would be used on Mr. Khalid, and because in an altercation earlier that evening between Mr. Khalid and the stabber both parties had been unhurt (C.A. reasons, at para. 5).\nTherefore, in the circumstances, I see no basis to apply the proviso.\nDisposition\nI would allow the appeals, set aside the manslaughter convictions, and order a new trial.\n\tAppeals dismissed, Rowe and Jamal JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant Emanuel Lozada: Stockwoods, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant Victor Ramos: Smith Litkowski, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario, Crown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.",

Lozada\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether the trial judge's instructions on causation in the context of co-principal liability for manslaughter were adequate.\n\nRameez Khalid was involved in a physical altercation with two groups of people, including Emanuel Lozada and Victor Ramos, which resulted in Mr. Khalid being stabbed twice, once in the abdomen and fatally through the heart. The accused did not inflict the fatal stab wound, and there was no evidence that they knew or foresaw that anyone in their group had a knife or that Mr. Khalid would be stabbed. The accused were convicted of manslaughter under sections 21(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code, with the Crown advancing two theories of party liability. The accused appealed their convictions, claiming that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on causation in the context of co-principal liability.\n\nThe trial judge instructed the jury on the issue of causation, explaining that the appellants' conduct must be a significant contributing cause of the victim's death. The judge also discussed the concept of reasonable foreseeability, stating that the continuation of assaults on the victim and the risk of non-trivial bodily harm may be enough to establish legal causation. The jury was satisfied that the appellants' actions were a significant contributing cause of the victim's death, and they were convicted of manslaughter. On appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals, finding that the trial judge's instructions were accurate and sufficient. However, the dissenting judge would have allowed the appeals and ordered a new trial, finding that the trial judge's instructions on causation were inadequate. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed the appeals, upholding the manslaughter convictions.\n\nThe most critical legal principle established by the court is that in cases involving co-principal liability for manslaughter under s. 21(1)(a), where an intervening act may have broken the chain of causation between an accused's acts and a victim's death, it must be determined whether such intervening act was reasonably foreseeable or flowed reasonably from an accused's conduct; however, what must be reasonably foreseeable is not merely further non-trivial bodily harm but rather its general nature and accompanying risk.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Moreau held that the trial judge's instructions on causation in the context of co-principal liability were accurate and properly equipped the jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. The majority found that the trial judge's instructions conveyed the correct overall test for legal causation, which is whether the accused's unlawful acts were a significant contributing cause of death. The majority also held that the trial judge properly instructed the jury on the issue of intervening acts, including the possibility that an act of a co-participant in a group assault can trigger the application of the intervening act doctrine.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  the convictions of two men guilty of manslaughter.</strong>The issue in these appeals  was whether the trial judge made a mistake in instructing the jury on how to  establish causation between the accused\u2019s unlawful acts and the victim\u2019s death from  stabbing wounds inflicted by a third person. Emanuel Lozada and Victor  Ramos were accused of manslaughter as a result of an unlawful act (known in law  as \u201cunlawful act manslaughter\u201d) after participating in a fight in downtown  Toronto, which resulted in the fatal stabbing of a victim. It was never  suggested that either Mr. Lozada or Mr. Ramos had stabbed the victim. A third person  was convicted of second degree murder for the stabbing. Rather, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos were accused of acting as co-principals in the fatal attack or aiders  and abettors to the stabber. To convict Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos, the Crown needed to establish causation between their unlawful acts \u2013  their participation in the group assault \u2013 and the victim\u2019s death. To do so,  the Crown had to prove that the unlawful acts were a significant contributing  cause to his death. The Crown\u2019s theory was that Mr. Ramos fought with the  victim and punched or kicked him, while Mr. Lozada fought with one of the  victim\u2019s friends. It argued that the two men\u2019s assaults left the victim  vulnerable to being stabbed by the third man. In their defence, Mr. Lozada and  Mr. Ramos argued that the stabbing was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence  of their decision to join a fight. As such, the stabbing event broke the chain  of causation between their assaults and the victim\u2019s death and they could not  be held criminally responsible for it. The jury convicted Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos of unlawful act manslaughter. The two men appealed their  convictions together at the Ontario Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial  judge made a mistake when instructing the jury on whether their conduct was a  significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. The majority of the Court  of Appeal dismissed their appeals. It found that when considered in isolation,  two passages from the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on reasonable  foreseeability misstated the law. However, the majority concluded that read as  a whole, the instructions given by the trial judge to the jury were accurate. Mr.  Lozada and Mr. Ramos appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeals.<strong>The jury was accurately instructed on the issue of causation.</strong>Writing for the majority,  Justice Moreau said that on a reading of the jury instructions and the trial  judge\u2019s answers to the jury\u2019s questions as a whole, the instructions conveyed  the proper test for causation: whether the conduct of Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos  was a significant contributing cause of the victim\u2019s death. Moreover, the trial  judge properly equipped the jury with appropriate analytical tools \u2013 i.e. the  question of reasonable foreseeability \u2013 to assist the jury in determining  whether the stabbing could be considered to be an intervening act that would  absolve Mr. Lozada and Mr. Ramos of legal responsibility for manslaughter. For  these reasons, Justice Moreau dismissed the appeals and upheld the manslaughter  convictions. \u00a0"

E-19, s. 27(1)(a). \n\tSeveral family members own a property in the Broad Cove River watershed. Groundwater within the watershed drains toward the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City of St. Johns for the local water supply. While the property was located in unorganized territory and not subject to any planning authority at the time it was conveyed by Crown grant in 1917, amendments to the City of St. Johns Act in 1959 resulted in the property becoming subject to the Citys pollution control and expropriation powers. In 1964, the legislature enacted a prohibition on the construction of buildings in the watershed, with limited exceptions. In 1978, the building prohibition was amended to empower the City to permit construction, subject to the prior recommendation of the City manager. In 1992, a municipal reorganization extended the Citys boundaries to formally encompass the property. The property remained subject to the statutory building prohibition in the City of St. Johns Act, but was now also subject to the Citys zoning regulations. Following the boundary expansion, a new municipal plan and development regulations were prepared for the entire City. The 1994 Development Regulations included a watershed zone that encompassed the property. There are no permitted uses within the watershed zone, but three discretionary uses are contemplated: agriculture, forestry and public utility. In 1996, the City and the provincial government adopted a watershed management plan, based on a report that observed that the City of St. Johns Act entitled the City to prohibit the erection of buildings within the watershed regions, including the Broad Cove River watershed, and that recommended it should continue to use those powers to do so.\n\tSince at least the 1990s, the family has tried to obtain permission to develop the property. In 2008, the City refused to transfer the property to an adjacent town, and, in 2011, the City indicated informally that the land must be kept unused in its natural state. Then, in 2013, the City rejected a formal application to develop a residential subdivision on the property, citing its authority under the City of St. Johns Act and the propertys designation as part of the watershed zone pursuant to the 1994 Development Regulations. Following that refusal, on application by the family, the Court of Appeal declared that the property had been constructively expropriated and that the family had a right to file a claim for compensation with the City as though a notice of expropriation had been served as of February 1, 2013.\n\tWhen the City applied to the Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities for a determination of the amount of compensation payable, the Board stated a special case for the opinion of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador asking whether the compensation should be assessed based on the uses permitted by the existing zoning  agriculture, forestry and public utility uses  or whether the existing zoning should be ignored and the value determined as if residential development were permissible. The application judge concluded that the compensation assessment should take account of the existing zoning. The Court of Appeal allowed the familys appeal and ordered the Board to determine compensation without reference to the existing zoning.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the application judges order restored. \n\tThe family is entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair compensation for the Citys constructive expropriation of the property. Given the application judges finding that the watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation, the market value assessment for the property must take into account the fact that it is limited to discretionary agriculture, forestry, and public utility uses. \n\tA taking of property triggers a presumptive entitlement to compensation absent clear statutory language showing an intention not to compensate. The basic measure of compensation is the same for both formal and constructive expropriation: compensation is based on the propertys market value. As land use restrictions, including zoning regulations, impact market value, they are normally taken into account when fixing compensation. The compensation for expropriation can be further affected by other statutory and common law factors. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Expropriation Act prescribes a series of rules applicable to the determination of compensation. One such principle, sometimes referred to as the Pointe Gourde principle, has been incorporated into many jurisdictions expropriation statutes, including s. 27(1)(a) of Newfoundland and Labradors Expropriation Act: changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are to be ignored in the compensation assessment. An authority cannot downzone or freeze a propertys development in anticipation of the need to acquire the property, thereby depreciating the value of the property in order to reduce the compensation payable.\n\tIn determining whether a regulations effect on a property value should be ignored for compensation purposes, the key question is whether the enactment was made with a view to the expropriation or, conversely, was an independent enactment. This is normally a factual determination to be made by the board or other authority tasked with determining compensation, and courts reviewing these determinations must accord deference to first instance decision-makers. The inquiry involves examining the purposes and effects of the enactment. As every land use enactment may impact property values, ignoring their purposes would render each a source of potential liability, impairing the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest. It would also fail to achieve proper economic reinstatement, and it would distort the propertys true market value. The purposes of an enactment can be discerned by considering, inter alia, debates, deliberations, and statements of policy that give rise to the regulation, the preamble or the terms of the enactment, and the rationale for a municipal by-law that can be found in the municipalitys long-term plans and correspondence involving officials.\n\tWhile there must be a connection between the regulation and the expropriation for the effects of the regulation to be excluded, causation does not drive the inquiry and is of limited assistance in determining the scope of the expropriation scheme. Asking whether there is a causal connection between the imposition of the planned use restriction and the expropriation which subsequently occurs is inconsistent with the jurisprudence, which affirms that zoning regulations properly bear on the compensation for expropriation. It would also risk including as part of the expropriation scheme decisions that neither contemplated nor required a taking, and it would emphasize form over substance as measures closely related to the expropriation that lower the propertys value may not be links in the chain that enabled the taking to occur. Conversely, focusing on the act or decision that caused the taking and hence the loss is too narrow. Excluding that act or decision, and nothing further, would permit a state actor to progressively downzone or freeze a property in anticipation of acquiring it in an attempt to reduce the compensation payable. When making the required determination, some relevant factors include whether the land use restriction was enacted as part of a city-wide or province-wide policy, whether it targets specific properties, or whether it was enacted by a different public authority than that which expropriated the property, but a governments knowledge of another level of governments development plans is not conclusive. Neither bad faith nor a scheme in any nefarious connotation need be proved.\n\tIn the instant case, there is no basis to interfere with the application judges conclusion that the watershed zoning was part of an independent zoning regulation and not part of the expropriation scheme to be disregarded under s. 27(1)(a) of the Expropriation Act. While the enactment of the 1994 Development Regulations was a link in the chain of events culminating in the expropriation, they were not enacted at the time with a view to the expropriation. To ignore the watershed zoning would compensate the family for something it never would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop residential housing.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co. v.

That is the question engaged by this appeal.\nThe starting point for assessing compensation for expropriation is determining the propertys market value. It is well established that land use restrictions impact market value and they are normally taken into account when fixing compensation. The jurisprudence reveals an exception: changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are to be ignored in the compensation assessment (the Pointe Gourde principle; see Pointe Gourde Quarrying and Transport Co. v. Sub-Intendent of Crown Lands, [1947] A.C. 565 (P.C.)). This principle has been incorporated into many jurisdictions expropriation statutes, including s. 27(1)(a) of Newfoundland and Labradors Expropriation Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. E-19, which is at the centre of this case. Determining which enactments form part of the expropriation scheme, and are thus ignored for valuation purposes, is the key factual question that decision makers must grapple with.\nIn this case, the City of St. Johns (City) constructively expropriated the respondents property when it refused to permit any development on it. The City deprived the respondents of all reasonable uses of the property and was found to have acquired a beneficial interest in the form of the right to a continuous flow of uncontaminated groundwater downstream to the Citys water facilities. At the time of the expropriation, a zoning regulation limited the property to discretionary agriculture, forestry, and public utility uses  a measure that no doubt diminishes the market value of the property compared to the respondents desired residential development use and, therefore, the compensation owed for the expropriation. The application judge concluded that the zoning regulation was an independent enactment and not part of the expropriation scheme. This meant that it could operate to influence the market value of the expropriated property and was not to be ignored for the purpose of fixing compensation. The Court of Appeal disagreed, concluding that compensation should be determined without reference to the zoning regulation. \nAs I see no basis to interfere with the application judges conclusion, which is entitled to deference, I would allow the appeal.\nFactual Background\nThe Lynch Property\nThe respondents grandfather, David Lynch, was issued a Crown grant in 1917 for the purpose of harvesting trees for barrel making and firewood. The respondents today own a 7.36-acre portion of the original Crown grant (Lynch Property). A house was constructed on the property in 1930, but was moved to another location around 1945. The Lynch Property has been left in its natural state of trees and shrubs since that time.\nThe Lynch Property is located on the western side of the Broad Cove River watershed. Groundwater within the watershed drains toward the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City for the local water supply. \nWhile the Lynch Property was located in unorganized territory and not subject to any planning authority or land use restrictions at the time of the Crown grant in 1917, a review of the subsequent legislative activity reveals the long history of development controls in the Broad Cove River watershed. A 1959 amendment to the City of St. Johns Act, R.S.N. 1952, c. 87, resulted in the Lynch Property becoming subject to the Citys pollution control and expropriation powers (S.N. 1959, No. 57, ss. 4 and 5). In 1964, the legislature enacted a prohibition on the construction of buildings in the Broad Cove River watershed, with an exception for accessories to or extensions of existing buildings (S.N. 1964, No. 85, s. 5). In 1978, the building prohibition was amended to empower the City to permit the construction of a building or extension to an existing building subject to the prior written recommendation of the City Manager that a permit be issued for such building or extension (S.N. 1978, c. 45, s. 6(b)). A version of this provision remains in effect today (City of St. Johns Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. C-17, s. 104(4)(d)).\nA reorganization of the municipalities on the Northeast Avalon Peninsula occurred on January 1, 1992. The Citys boundaries were extended to formally encompass the Lynch Property (City of St. Johns Boundary Order, 1991, Nfld. Reg. 236/91). The Lynch Property remained subject to the statutory building prohibition in the City of St. Johns Act, but was now also subject to the Citys zoning regulations. Following the boundary expansion, a new municipal plan and development regulations were prepared for the entire city. The 1994 Development Regulations, enacted pursuant to the Urban and Rural Planning Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. U-7, included a Watershed zone that encompassed the Lynch Property. There are no permitted uses within the Watershed zone, but three discretionary uses are contemplated: (a) agriculture; (b) forestry; and (c) public utility (Development Regulations, s. 10.46.1).\nIn 1996, the City received a report it had commissioned in collaboration with the provincial government. The report, entitled A Watershed Management Plan, St. Johns Regional Water Supply, included a background study and a policy document. The policy document observed that the City of St. Johns Act entitles the City to prohibit the erection of buildings within the watershed regions, including the Broad Cove River watershed (s. 2.2, reproduced in A.R., vol. IV, at p. 27). It noted that, while City Council had the power to erect a new building upon the recommendation of the City Manager, . . . this power [was] rarely used (s. 2.2). It recommended that the City continue to use the powers under [the City of St. Johns Act] to restrict the erection of new buildings within the protected watersheds, recognizing they are complementary to the powers contained in the Citys plan and zoning by-law (s. 2.2). The policy document went on to say:\nThe practice of not allowing further urban development within the protected watershed in order to protect the water supply is appropriate and should continue. . . . Existing sub-urban development . . . should not expand and the long term intention is to revert these areas back to natural, pristine conditions as opportunity and funding permit. [s. 2.5]\nThe Watershed Management Plan was adopted by the City and the provincial government in the fall of 1996.\nDevelopment Inquiries\nThe respondents tried to obtain permission to develop the Lynch Property since at least the 1990s. The street the Lynch Property is located on marks the municipal boundary between the City of St. Johns and the Town of Paradise, and some limited development is permitted across the street from the Lynch Property within the Town of Paradises jurisdiction. A request by the respondents that the Lynch Property be transferred to the Town of Paradise was denied by the City in December 2008. A report from the Citys Director of Engineering stated that staff were not prepared to recommend any boundary changes that would have the effect of opening up . . . lands that are located in the Watershed for development (A.R., vol. III, at p. 72). He explained:\nThere is considerable land within the Citys boundaries located in the Watershed which could be developed but the policy of [the] City as set out in Section 104 of the City of St. Johns Act strictly prohibits new development. Even serviced development can have a deleterious effect on the watershed because of pesticide and herbicide use and the loss of a natural buffer. The purpose of this is to maintain the excellent raw water quality of the Windsor Lake and Broad Cove Rive[r] Watershed which allows the production of potable water of extremely high quality without risk of having the contaminants found in many municipal water supplies caused by intense urban development. [p. 71]\nThe respondents were provided with a copy of the Director of Engineerings report in the correspondence from the City denying the boundary adjustment.\nThe respondents made inquiries of the City in 2011 concerning the permitted uses of the Lynch Property under the Development Regulations and the City of St. Johns Act. They asked about whether residential development and other activities including tree harvesting, farming, saw milling, and the construction of wind turbines and solar panels would be permitted. The City responded that those activities were not permitted and that the land must be kept unused in [its] natural state (A.R., vol. III, at p. 86).\nThe respondents nonetheless formally applied to develop a 10-lot residential subdivision on the Lynch Property. By letter dated February 1, 2013, the City formally rejected the application, citing its authority under the City of St. Johns Act and the Lynch Propertys designation as part of the Watershed Zone pursuant to the Development Regulations.\nThe Constructive Expropriation Claim\nFollowing the Citys refusal to permit development, the respondents commenced proceedings, seeking a declaration that the Lynch Property had been constructively expropriated. In a decision that is not the subject of this appeal, the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador concluded that the property was constructively expropriated by the City. On behalf of the court, Barry J.A. found that the City acquired a beneficial interest in the Lynch Property consisting of the right to a continuous flow of uncontaminated groundwater downstream to the Citys water facilities (2016 NLCA 35 (expropriation decision), at paras. 60-61 (CanLII)). He also found that the respondents rights to the property flowing from the Crown grant were transformed into merely a right to keep the land unused in its natural state (para. 63). In other words, virtually all of the aggregated incidents of ownership [were] taken away and the respondents were left with no reasonable uses of the property (para. 63). The court issued the following declaration:\n(i) That the real property owned by the Lynches in the Broad Cove River catchment area within the City of St. Johns has been constructively expropriated by the City of St. Johns pursuant to sections 101 and 105 of the City [of St. Johns] Act: and\n\n(ii) That the Lynches have a right pursuant to sections 18 and 19 of the Expropriation Act to file a claim for compensation with the City as though a notice of expropriation has been served under the Act as of February 1, 2013, and, failing agreement within three months of the filing of the formal order, concerning the amount of compensation that is to be paid by the City to the Lynches, they have a right to proceed to a determination of the compensation claim by the Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities. [para. 71]\nThe parties obtained appraisals for the Lynch Property with an effective date of February 1, 2013. The Citys position was that the property should be valued in accordance with the Watershed zoning  that is, based on discretionary agriculture, forestry, and public utility uses. The Citys appraiser considered that the highest and best use under this scenario would be agricultural and forestry related uses that would be acceptable to the City, and therefore not deleterious to waters within the zone (A.R., vol. II, at p. 103). This resulted in an appraised value of $105,000 for the Lynch Property. Alternatively, under the hypothetical scenario of medium-density residential development, the Citys appraiser valued the property at $670,000. For their part, the respondents contended that that the Lynch Property should be valued as if the Watershed zoning had not been in place and asked their appraiser to assume that residential development would be approved. The respondents appraiser valued the property at $875,000 on this basis.\nAs the parties could not agree on compensation, the City filed an application with the Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities (Board) for a determination of the amount payable.\nProcedural History\nBoard of Commissioners of Public Utilities\nAs a preliminary matter, the Board decided to make a reference to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador pursuant to s. 26(3) of the Expropriation Act. Section 26(3) provides that the Board may at any stage of its proceedings . . . state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the court a question of law arising in the course of the proceedings. The question posed by the Board was:\nWhether the [respondents] compensation should be assessed based on the uses permitted by the existing zoning, which are agriculture, forestry and public utility uses, or whether the existing zoning should be ignored and the value determined as if residential development were permissible.\n\n(2020 NLSC 92, 2 M.P.L.R. (6th) 241 (application reasons), at para. 3)\nSupreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2020 NLSC 92, 2 M.P.L.R. (6th) 241 (Chaytor J.)\nThe application judge recognized that the question put to her required the consideration and application of the principle from Pointe Gourde, which stipulates that any change in the value of the expropriated property that was caused by the expropriation scheme itself is to be ignored in assessing the propertys value for compensation purposes. She questioned whether there was a sufficient factual matrix before the court to determine that issue, but noted that the parties agreed that the pertinent facts are contained within the Expropriation Decision and that any disagreement between them on matters of fact requires an interpretation by this Court of that decision. Such interpretation, is a question of law (para. 8).\nThe application judge considered the Court of Appeals expropriation decision and noted its finding that the underlying purpose behind the expropriation was to prevent the pollution of the Citys water supply. Accordingly, the key question was whether the pollution prevention scheme that caused the constructive expropriation included the Watershed zoning. The respondents argued it did. In support of their desired valuation of the land as a residential development property, they claimed the Watershed zoning restrictions should be ignored (as part of the expropriation scheme) and not constrain its market value. \nSignificantly, the application judge noted that the Watershed zoning did not preclude all uses of the property (given the discretionary uses of agriculture, forestry, and public utilities). Similarly, s. 104(4) of the City of St. Johns Act allowed for some development in the Broad Cove River watershed upon the recommendation of the City Manager. Had any of the discretionary uses been allowed, the expropriation would not have occurred. In the application judges view, the refusal to allow the respondents any uses of the property was due to the Citys pollution prevention policy to keep the property unused in its natural state  not the zoning of the property (para. 39; see also para. 44).\nThe application judge noted that the actual act of expropriation of a property is part of a continuing process. She recognized two established but competing principles. First, a municipality cannot use the device of zoning to depress the value of a property as a prelude to expropriating it for public purposes; in such cases, the effect of the rezoning or freeze on the propertys value is to be ignored for assessing compensation. Second, land use regulation is the norm and on its own does not constitute compensable expropriation. Based on this Courts decision in Kramer v. Wascana Centre Authority, [1967] S.C.R. 237, zoning regulations that are independent enactments and not part of a scheme to facilitate the expropriation at reduced compensation are not to be ignored in assessing compensation (para. 47).\nIn the application judges view, the Development Regulations were an independent enactment and not part of the Citys pollution prevention scheme to keep the property unused in its natural state. In making this determination, she adverted to the 1992 municipal reorganization, which prompted a new city-wide planning process and ultimately led to the Development Regulations through which the Lynch Property was zoned Watershed. The reorganization was a comprehensive zoning process and not specific to the Lynch Property. The application judge noted that the respondents could have been allowed to develop the land in accordance with the Watershed zoning had the City exercised its discretion to permit it. As the Development Regulations were an independent enactment, they were not to be ignored in valuing the Lynch Property pursuant to the Pointe Gourde principle. \nThe application judge therefore concluded that the compensation assessment should take account of the zoning regulations in effect on February 1, 2013 (the time that the Court of Appeal found the expropriation occurred). The Lynch Property was not to be valued as a development property, but instead should be valued based on its potential agriculture, forestry, and public utility uses.\nCourt of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador, 2022 NLCA 29, 470 D.L.R. (4th) 679 (Green, Butler and White JJ.A.)\nThe Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from the application judges decision on the basis for calculating compensation and ordered that the respondents compensation should be determined without reference to the existing watershed zoning in the Development Regulations (para. 139). \nAfter reviewing the relevant jurisprudence and extracting general principles from it, the Court of Appeal identified three errors in the application judges reasoning. First, she failed to take account of the interconnections between the City of St. Johns Act, the Development Regulations, and the Citys policy of prohibiting development in the Watershed. The Court of Appeal reasoned that:\nThe state of mind of the City in adopting the regulations was to further the objective of water pollution control mandated by the City [of St. Johns] Act. It is clear from the earlier studies undertaken by the City in relation to the management of the watershed that the policy that was developed was to use the powers under the City [of St. Johns] Act in a manner that was complementary to the powers contained in the Citys municipal plan and zoning bylaw, the ultimate intention being to revert the areas back to natural, pristine conditions. . . (Policy Document, at s. 2.5). As subsequently determined by this Court in the Expropriation Decision, achieving reversion of the lands to natural, pristine conditions effectively meant refusal of all development and use, which amounted to de facto expropriation. Expropriation was therefore the logical result of the zoning policy that was adopted and the manner in which it was applied. It is not hard, therefore, to infer a causal connection between the adoption and application of the watershed zoning regulations and the expropriation. [Emphasis added; para. 113.]\nSecond, the application judge did not refer to or rely on affidavit evidence from City officials confirming that the Development Regulations and the City of St. Johns Act were interconnected in terms of purpose, focus and application. Third, the application judge did not recognize that the Court of Appeal, in the expropriation decision, regarded the expropriation process as beginning in 1964 and culminating with the February 1, 2013 refusal by the City Manager to exercise his discretion to permit any development, with the effect that all reasonable uses of the property were taken away, and implied that the Development Regulations were part of this broad scheme of watershed pollution protection (paras. 118-19).\nIssue on Appeal\nThis appeal requires the Court to consider how compensation for constructive expropriation should be assessed. While there are substantial similarities between different federal and provincial expropriation statutes, it is the compensation framework set out in Newfoundland and Labradors Expropriation Act that must be applied in this case. \nSpecifically, the Court must determine whether the Development Regulations form part of the compulsory acquisition of the land, which is to be ignored in assessing the respondents compensation entitlement pursuant to s. 27(1)(a) of the Expropriation Act.\nAnalysis\nCompensation for Expropriation\nA taking  defined as the forcible acquisition by the Crown of privately owned property . . . for public purposes  can occur in two ways (K. Horsman and G. Morley, Government Liability: Law and Practice (loose-leaf), at  5:1). Formal expropriation (a de jure taking) occurs where a public authority acquires legal title (typically through the authoritys invocation of a statutory expropriation framework) (Annapolis Group Inc. v. Halifax Regional Municipality, 2022 SCC 36, at paras. 18 and 104). Constructive expropriation (a de facto taking), on the other hand, involves the appropriation of private property by a public authority exercising its regulatory powers (Annapolis, at para. 18). In this case, the Lynch Property was constructively expropriated as the City had acquired a beneficial interest in it and all reasonable uses of the property had been removed. I note that the expropriation decision, which is not under appeal, applied the test from Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City), 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227, but the conclusion with respect to the Lynch Property is consistent with this Courts more recent articulation of the test for constructive expropriation set out in Annapolis.\nA taking of property triggers a presumptive entitlement to compensation absent clear statutory language showing an intention not to compensate (Annapolis, at para. 21; AttorneyGeneral v. De Keysers Royal Hotel, [1920] A.C. 508 (H.L.), at p. 542). \nThe basic measure of compensation is the same for both formal and constructive expropriation: compensation is based on the propertys market value. Market value is codified as the starting point in several federal and provincial expropriation statutes, including the applicable Newfoundland and Labrador statute (Expropriation Act, s. 27(1)(a); other examples include Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-21, s. 26(2); Expropriations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26, ss. 13 and 14). \nCompensation based on market value naturally flows from the objective of economic reinstatement. Displaced property owners should be put back in the same economic position that they were in prior to the expropriation: no better and no worse (see E. C. E. Todd, The Law of Expropriation and Compensation in Canada (2nd ed. 1992), at pp. 109-10; Irving Oil Co. v. The King, [1946] S.C.R. 551, at p. 556; Hallidays Estate v. Newfoundland Light & Power Co. (1980), 29 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 212 (Nfld. C.A.), at paras. 21-22). Furthering economic reinstatement accounts for the rights and legitimate expectations of property owners while ensuring that governments can act in the public interest without paying a premium for doing so. As Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead explained in Waters v. Welsh Development Agency, [2004] UKHL 19, [2004] 2 All E.R. 915, at para. 1, powers of expropriation are essential to a modern democratic society, but the obligation to pay full and fair compensation goes [h]and in hand.\nIn Diggon-Hibben Ltd. v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 712, at p. 715, Rand J. identified the key question for assessing compensation as being what the property owner at the moment of expropriation would pay for the property rather than be ejected from it. The relevant market value is the value to the owner and not the propertys value in the eyes of the taker (the public authority) (Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste, [1914] A.C. 569 (P.C.), at p. 576; Irving Oil, at p. 555; Todd, at pp. 109-12). \nIn the land expropriation context, market value may reflect a higher and better use of the land than its current state  in other words, recognizing the lands development potential (see, e.g., Lasade Enterprises Ltd. v. Newfoundland (1993), 114 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 19 (Nfld. C.A.), at para. 26; Miller v. Province of Newfoundland (1977), 14 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 110 (Nfld. C.A.), at paras. 22-27; Todd, at pp. 134-35). But the jurisprudence leaves no doubt that zoning regulations and other land use restrictions properly bear on a propertys market value (and thus compensation for expropriation). In Musqueam Indian Band v. Glass, 2000 SCC 52, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 633, at para. 47, Gonthier J. explained:\nLegal restrictions on land use . . . may affect the market value of freehold property. In Revenue Properties [Co. v. Victoria University (1993), 101 D.L.R. (4th) 172 (Ont. Div. Ct.)], at p. 182, the court held that [a]ll applicable statutes and laws relating to use such as zoning by-laws must be considered when assessing land value. . . . To determine land value, whether as vacant or as improved, the appraiser . . . considers the highest and best use that is legally permissible, physically possible, financially feasible, and maximally productive.\nCompensation is not to be based on speculative or unrealistic expectations about higher-value uses to which a property could be put (Lasade, at para. 27).\nThat zoning enactments affect the amount of compensation due to an owner is particularly appropriate in the context of constructive expropriation, where it has been repeatedly affirmed that restrictions on land use, on their own, do not constitute a taking. Ordinarily, in this country, the United States and the United Kingdom, compensation does not follow zoning either up or down (The Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia v. Tener, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533, at p. 557). More is required for regulation to constitute expropriation than drastically limiting use or reducing the value of the owners property (Annapolis, at para. 43, quoting Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 1999 NSCA 98, 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696, at p. 716; see also Urban and Rural Planning Act, 2000, S.N.L. 2000, c. U-8, s. 5). Constructive expropriation only occurs when a beneficial interest accrues to the state and the regulatory measure removes all reasonable uses of the property (Annapolis, at para. 4).\nBeyond the starting point of a propertys market value, the compensation for expropriation can be further affected by other statutory and common law factors. For example, this Courts decision in Toronto Area Transit Operating Authority v. Dell Holdings Ltd., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 32, considered the extent to which a property owner was entitled to recover disturbance damages as part of their compensation under s. 13(2)(b) of Ontarios Expropriations Act. Newfoundland and Labradors statute prescribes a series of rules applicable to the determination of compensation (s. 27). It is not necessary to examine all of these factors in these reasons. Only one is in issue on this appeal: the direction in s. 27(1)(a) that no account shall be taken of changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself (the compulsory acquisition of the land). This is sometimes referred to as the Pointe Gourde principle.\nThe Pointe Gourde Principle\nThe key principle from Pointe Gourde was articulated by Lord MacDermott: . . . compensation for the compulsory acquisition of land cannot include an increase in value which is entirely due to the scheme underlying the acquisition (p. 572). \nThe factual circumstances of Pointe Gourde demonstrate how this principle directly stems from considering the propertys value to the owner, not the taker. The case involved the expropriation of land used as a quarry for the purpose of constructing a naval base in Trinidad. There was no dispute that compensation was to reflect the value of the quarry as a going concern (Todd, at p. 159). However, the quarrys value was increased by the fact that a base was being established in the vicinity for which a large quantity of stone in a readily accessible situation was required (Pointe Gourde, at p. 572). The quarry owners sought a higher valuation based on claims they would have been even more profitable because their stone would be used to build the base. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the increase in value was not compensable as it was entirely due to the scheme underlying the expropriation. The special need for the stone only arose because a naval base was to be constructed, prompting the need for the expropriation in the first place. While the public authority benefitted from the large quantity of stone that was readily accessible (i.e., it was valuable to the taker), it presented no additional value to the owners in the absence of the naval base project and expropriation. \nThe principle that changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme are to be ignored in assessing compensation was not created in Pointe Gourde, however. Several early 20th century decisions recognized the principle (see, e.g., Cunard v. The King (1910), 43 S.C.R. 88, at pp. 99-100, per Duff J., dissenting; Re Gibson and City of Toronto (1913), 11 D.L.R. 529 (Ont. S.C. (App. Div.)), at pp. 536-37). Those authorities recognize that compensation is to be assessed without reference to decreases in value caused by the expropriation scheme as well (Cunard, at p. 100; Gibson, at p. 537). In effect, the principle seeks to remove extrinsic influences associated with the taking (I.F., Canadian Home Builders Association, at para. 4). Ignoring both increases and decreases in market value caused by the expropriation scheme results in neither an economic burden nor a windfall for the owner. As the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia points out, applying the Pointe Gourde principle facilitates economic reinstatement, allowing the owner to purchase an equivalent replacement property (I.F., at para. 23). \nExpropriation statutes have incorporated the Pointe Gourde principle, though the terminology employed varies between them. For example, s. 27(1)(a) of Newfoundland and Labradors Expropriation Act provides that no account shall be taken of the compulsory acquisition of the land in fixing compensation. In Ontario, any increase or decrease in the value of the land resulting from the development or the imminence of the development in respect of which the expropriation is made or from any expropriation or imminent prospect of expropriation is excluded from consideration (Expropriations Act, s. 14(4)(b)). Section 33 of British Columbias expropriation statute lists several elements of the expropriation scheme that are to be ignored in assessing compensation, including the anticipated or actual purpose for which the expropriating authority intends to use the land, increases or decreases in value resulting from the expropriation and related development (or the prospect of either), and the enactment of zoning regulations made with a view to the development in respect of which the expropriation is made (Expropriation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 125). Although they share some principles, the specific terms of the relevant jurisdictions statutory provisions must ground any compensation analysis. \nThe Scope of the Scheme to be Ignored\nApplying the Pointe Gourde principle requires that changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme be ignored in assessing compensation. The key question is, therefore: What is the scope of the expropriation scheme?\nThere are different dimensions to that question. Temporally, the inquiry exposes a tension in expropriation law. On the one hand, property is expropriated by the state at a defined moment in time. In the constructive expropriation context, this happens when a beneficial interest accrues to the state and all reasonable uses of the property are removed (Annapolis, at para. 4). On the other hand, this Court has recognized that expropriation is a process: \nThe courts have long determined that the actual act of expropriation of any property is part of a continuing process. In [City of Montreal v. McAnulty Realty Co., [1923] S.C.R. 273], at p. 283, Duff J. noted that the term expropriation is not used in the restrictive sense of signifying merely the transfer of title but in the sense of the process of taking the property for the purpose for which it is required. [Emphasis in original.]\n\n(Dell Holdings, at para. 37)\nCompensation Jurisprudence\nBoth the City and the respondents cite several authorities on this appeal demonstrating that regulatory enactments made with a view to the expropriation are considered to be part of the expropriation scheme and are thus ignored in calculating compensation. Conversely, changes in value caused by enactments determined to be independent of the expropriation are taken into account. The parties frame their arguments around this dichotomy (see, e.g., A.F., at paras. 37, 48, 89-90, 95-96, 101, 105, 107-8 and 120; R.F., at paras. 45 and 87). It is instructive to review some of these authorities.\nIn Gibson, the City of Toronto adopted a by-law preventing the construction of any building on a 17-foot strip of property fronting onto St. Clair Avenue. The property was later expropriated for the purpose of widening the road. Writing for the majority, Hodgins J.A. reasoned that an authority ought not to be able, by the exercise of its other powers immediately prior to the taking, to reduce the value of what it seeks and intends to acquire and of which it is contemplating expropriation (p. 536). It was open to the property owner to prove that the by-law freezing development was not really an independent legislative act . . . but had an intimate connection with, and was really part of, the scheme for widening St. Clair avenue (p. 538). Gibson illustrates that the enactment of a by-law freezing or limiting development in contemplation of future expropriation cannot be used as a mechanism to reduce the compensation the state authority will have to pay the property owner. \nKramer concerned lands in Regina that had been initially zoned for residential development. City Council then enacted a by-law that repealed the previous zoning and limited the subject lands to public service use. Eight months previously, the Wascana Centre Authority  a provincial entity  was created and given the power to expropriate lands by The Wascana Centre Act, 1962, S.S. 1962, c. 46. The Wascana Centre Authority expropriated the appellants property for a public interest development project. This Court divided on whether the citys zoning by-law limiting development to public service use should be ignored in assessing the appellants compensation. For the majority, Abbott J. endorsed the arbitrators conclusion that the zoning by-law was an independent zoning enactment even though it was passed . . . with knowledge of the Wascana Centre Scheme (p. 239). He noted that the zoning by-law crystallized an overall city plan that had been designed over a year prior to its enactment. Compensation was therefore to be assessed in light of the propertys limited public service use. Spence J., writing separately, was troubled by the timing of the zoning by-laws enactment. In his view, the by-law was simply a step . . . in the setting up of the Wascana Centre and the purpose as to the lands in question [was] very plainly to prevent [the residential] development . . . envisaged by the appellants (pp. 246-47). In sum, both opinions centered, but disagreed, on whether the public service use zoning by-law was an independent enactment or was made with a view to the expropriation. \nTwo Newfoundland decisions contrasted by the application judge and the Court of Appeal below offer a helpful comparison. In Halliday, a development freeze was placed on land situated within the area designated for the future C. A. Pippy Park on the outskirts of St. Johns. The court held that, while there was no immediate intent to expropriate the lands in question when the development freeze was implemented, there was a declared intent to control development thereon to the end that the lands would be available for the use and purpose of the [C. A. Pippy Park] Commission, as the park was gradually developed (para. 15). I agree with the Citys argument that Halliday supports the proposition that an authority cannot downzone or freeze a propertys development in anticipation of the need to acquire the property, thereby depreciating the value of the property in order to reduce the compensation payable (A.F., at para. 106). The regulatory enactment in that case was made with a view to expropriation. On the other hand, the court in Atlantic Shopping Centres Ltd. v. St. Johns (City) (1985), 56 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 44 (Nfld. C.A.), determined that there was no evidence to suggest that a restrictive enactment was done in anticipation of the particular road expansion project for which the land was expropriated (para. 20). Of significance was the fact that the restriction in issue was the same as that which applied to all other lands in the city. Distinguishing Halliday, the court concluded that the impugned regulation was an independent enactment and was not to be ignored in assessing compensation.\nLastly, in Windsor (City) v. Paciorka Leaseholds Ltd., 2012 ONCA 431, 111 O.R. (3d) 431, at para. 27, the Court of Appeal for Ontario endorsed the view of Sachs J., dissenting, in the court below (2011 ONSC 2876, 106 O.R. (3d) 690 (Div. Ct.)). At para. 130, she had relied on Jewish Community Centre of Edmonton Trust v. The Queen (1983), 27 L.C.R. 333 (Alta. L.C.B.), at p. 360, which said that an enactment is ignored in assessing compensation if it is made for the purpose and with a view to the development under which the land is expropriated. In Paciorka, the City of Windsor expropriated land for the purpose of creating a nature park. A Provincial Policy Statement enacted under Ontarios Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13, applied to environmentally sensitive lands across the province, including the subject lands, and imposed development restrictions. The Court of Appeal adopted the dissenting judges conclusion that the Provincial Policy Statement could not be ignored as it applies across the province and was not directed at the Expropriated Lands, and was passed independently of, and without any connection to, the specific development for which the land was expropriated (para. 27 (emphasis deleted)).\nDetermining the Scope of the Expropriation Scheme\nThe weight of the jurisprudence on this subject affirms that, in determining whether a regulations effect on a property value should be ignored for compensation purposes (the application of the Pointe Gourde principle), the key question is whether the enactment was made with a view to the expropriation or, conversely, was an independent enactment. This jurisprudential trend is reinforced by several expropriation statutes that expressly state that, in determining market value, no account may be taken of enactments made with a view to the development underlying the expropriation (see Expropriation Act (B.C.), s. 33(g); Expropriation Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. E-13, s. 45(e)), or have been interpreted in that manner (see Expropriations Act (Ont.), s. 14(4)(b); Paciorka, at paras. 22 and 27).\nAs the application judge recognized, this is normally a factual determination to be made by the board or other authority tasked with determining compensation (para. 8; see also Vision Homes Ltd. v. Nanaimo (City) (1996), 59 L.C.R. 106 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 20; Clements v. Penticton (City), 2005 BCCA 212, 86 L.C.R. 81, at para. 12). Courts reviewing these determinations must accord deference to first instance decision-makers. On an appeal, compensation determinations are generally reviewable only for palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 36).\nThe Inquiry Involves Examining the Purposes and Effects of the Enactment\nDetermining whether an enactment was made with a view to expropriation involves examining its purposes and effects (see, e.g., Waters, at para. 58; Gibson, at p. 536; Kramer, at pp. 239 and 246-47; Halliday, at para. 15; Atlantic Shopping Centres, at paras. 18-20; Paciorka, at para. 27). The focus on purpose is appropriate given governments need to regulate in the public interest. As the intervener the City of Surrey explains:\n. . . government liability for regulations that reduce property value would be unworkable unless an element of intentionality was required . . . . As every land use regulation may impact property values, a focus on effects would render each land use regulation a source of potential liability, impairing the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest. \n\n(I.F., at para. 8)\nThe purposes of an enactment can be discerned by considering, inter alia, the debates, deliberations, and statements of policy that gave rise to it (see Catalyst Paper Corp. v. North Cowichan (District), 2012 SCC 2, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 29; see also Waters, at para. 63; Vision Homes, at para. 19). As explained in Catalyst Paper Corp., at paras. 29-33, the rationale for a municipal by-law can be found in the municipalitys long-term plans and correspondence involving officials. The preamble and terms of the enactment itself can also be of assistance (see Paciorka, at para. 27).\nIn the constructive expropriation context, it is not until all reasonable uses of the property have been removed that a de facto taking occurs (Annapolis, at para. 19). In assessing compensation once constructive expropriation is found to have occurred, distinguishing enactments on the basis of both their purposes and effects ensures the property owner receives fair compensation but not more than fair compensation (Waters, at para. 61). Ignoring enactments purposes and singularly considering effects would present two equally undesirable possibilities. If the Pointe Gourde principle only excluded the regulation that had the effect of removing all reasonable uses of the property (mirroring the requirement from Annapolis for a taking to occur), governments would be permitted to downzone properties or freeze development in anticipation of expropriation to reduce the compensation payable. This idea has been rejected (see, e.g., Tener, at p. 557; Gibson, at p. 536). If, instead, all prior enactments affecting the propertys value  regardless of whether they removed all reasonable uses of the property or were made with a view to expropriation  were excluded from the compensation assessment, compensation would amount to a windfall. This approach would be inconsistent with settled law: . . . regulation alone will not satisfy the test for a constructive taking . . . and compensation does not follow zoning either up or down (Annapolis, at para. 43; Tener, at p. 557). Neither of these possibilities would achieve proper economic reinstatement, and both would distort the propertys true market value.\nCausation Does Not Drive the Inquiry\nThe Court of Appeal characterized the Pointe Gourde principle as follows: Any change in the value of the property caused by the scheme for which the expropriating authoritys compulsory taking powers were exercised is to be ignored in the computation of the propertys value for expropriation assessment purposes . . . (para. 109 (emphasis added)). In this case, there is no dispute that the Watershed zoning in the Development Regulations diminishes the market value of the Lynch Property, as is clear from the parties competing appraisals. But is it part of the scheme? In reversing the application judges decision, the Court of Appeal also relied on causation in determining that the Watershed zoning was part of the expropriation scheme and therefore to be ignored for valuation purposes. In my view, causation is of limited assistance in determining the scope of the expropriation scheme.\nAfter reviewing the jurisprudence on the Pointe Gourde principle, the Court of Appeal noted that the critical issue in determining whether a particular enactment should be excluded in assessing market value is whether there is a causal connection between the imposition of the planned use restriction and the expropriation which subsequently occurs (para. 109, citing Paciorka, at para. 27). Later in its reasons, the Court of Appeal concluded that there was a causal connection between the adoption of the Watershed zoning regulations and the expropriation of the Lynch Property (para. 113). It also noted that the application judge had failed to take account of these interconnections (para. 115). Similarly, the respondents argue that a broad and expansive approach to causation should be taken, emphasizing that [w]ithout all the prior links [including the Watershed zoning] the Citys 2013 decision would have been without lawful foundation (R.F., at paras. 90 and 96). The respondents encourage an examination of the whole of the chain, each link of which plays a key and unavoidable part in leading to the constructive expropriation (para. 82). \nI do not agree that this broad conception of causation should drive the inquiry. It is inconsistent with the jurisprudence highlighted above, which affirms that zoning regulations properly bear on the compensation for expropriation. Adopting this approach would risk including as part of the expropriation scheme decisions that neither contemplated nor required a taking (I.F., Attorney General of British Columbia, at para. 43). Moreover, such an approach would emphasize form over substance. It will sometimes be the case that measures closely related to the expropriation that lower the propertys value are not links in the chain that enabled the taking to occur. For example, in Gibson, the City of Toronto had enacted a by-law implementing a freeze on any construction of buildings in anticipation of the future expropriation of the property, which occurred later under a different statutory authority. Hodgins J.A. reasoned that the by-law imposing the freeze could have been part of the expropriation scheme (and therefore its effects excluded from the compensation assessment)  notwithstanding that the decision to expropriate was not taken pursuant to that by-law (pp. 536 and 538). Put simply, the analysis does not turn on whether the regulatory enactment was a link in the chain of events leading to the expropriation (i.e., that but for the enactment there would have been no expropriation).\nThe Citys causation proposal is, conversely, too narrow. The City submits that a simple question should have been asked by the courts below: What was the act or decision by the City which caused the taking and hence the loss to the [respondents]? (A.F., at para. 61). It notes that there would have been no taking and no loss had the City permitted development for agriculture, forestry, and public utility purposes, and that it was the Citys decision to refuse permission for any development on the Lynch Property that resulted in the constructive expropriation (paras. 61-62). I agree with the Citys submission that it is not enough for a regulatory enactment to be a related connection to the constructive expropriation to be ignored in assessing compensation (A.F., at para. 64 (emphasis deleted)). However, while, under the Annapolis criteria, a taking crystallizes at a particular moment in time, expropriation is nonetheless a process (Dell Holdings, at para. 37). Merely excluding the act or decision of the state actor that constituted the taking, and nothing further, would permit a state actor to progressively downzone or freeze a property in anticipation of acquiring it in an attempt to reduce the compensation payable. I note that the City itself accepts that the prohibition on such a manoeuvre is a corollary to the Pointe Gourde principle (A.F., at para. 71).\nWhile there must be a connection between the regulation and the expropriation for its effects to be excluded, a focus on causation masks the true inquiry. As I have explained, giving effect to the Pointe Gourde principle requires consideration of whether an enactment was made with a view to the expropriation. If it was connected in this manner, it should be considered part of the expropriation scheme and its effects excluded from the compensation assessment.\nGuidance for Conducting the Assessment\nIt is not necessary for these reasons to set out an exhaustive list of factors that will bear on whether an enactment was made with a view to expropriation, but the jurisprudence I summarize above offers some guidance for those tasked with making this factual determination. If a land use restriction is enacted as part of a city-wide or province-wide policy, or does not target specific properties, that may indicate that the restriction is an independent enactment and is not to be excluded under the Pointe Gourde principle (see Kramer, at p. 239; Atlantic Shopping Centres, at para. 20; Paciorka, at para. 27). It may also be relevant that the impugned regulation was enacted by a different public authority than that which expropriated the property (see Paciorka, at paras. 16 and 26). Further, a governments knowledge of another level of governments development plans is not conclusive of an enactment having been made with a view to expropriation (see Kramer, at p. 239). \nBad faith is not a prerequisite to a finding that an enactment was made with a view to expropriation. No scheme in any nefarious connotation need be proved (Kramer, at pp. 246-47, per Spence J.). Plainly, by-laws that control development in anticipation of eventual expropriation can be firmly rooted in public interest considerations. For example, on the facts of Gibson, there would have been a sound policy reason for the City of Toronto to adopt a by-law preventing building construction on a parcel of land it was intending to later expropriate for road widening. If that was its intent, however, the enactment would be ignored in assessing compensation for the parcels expropriation. Gibson illustrates that the existence of an intimate connection between the impugned regulatory enactment and the project or development that the expropriation facilitates may signal that the enactment was made with a view to expropriation (p. 538). In short, applying the Pointe Gourde principle requires consideration of whether the enactment was made for the purpose of expropriating rather than regulating. \nThe jurisprudence on the scope of the scheme to be ignored under the Pointe Gourde principle does not supply bright-line rules. This is to be expected given that the question of whether an enactment was made with a view to expropriation (or, conversely, whether it was an independent enactment) depends entirely on a cases factual circumstances. There may well be differences of opinion on the characterization of particular enactments, but this type of assessment calls out for flexibility in its application and deference in its review.\nApplication\nThe procedural history of this dispute is unusual. In normal circumstances, Newfoundland and Labradors Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities is tasked with fixing compensation for expropriation, and the Court of Appeals order in the expropriation decision stipulated that the Board would do so in this case failing an agreement between the parties (see Expropriation Act (N.L.), s. 19; expropriation decision, at para. 71). The Board referred the question of whether the Watershed zoning should be ignored in assessing compensation to the application judge pursuant to s. 26(3) of the Expropriation Act, which permits the Board to state in the form of a special case for the opinion of the court a question of law. Both the application judge and the Court of Appeal queried the propriety of resorting to s. 26(3) for this question and the adequacy of the record (application reasons, at para. 8; C.A. reasons, at paras. 130-36). The Court of Appeal was rightly skeptical about whether this was a question of law; as I have explained, the scope of the scheme to be ignored in assessing compensation is a factual determination. \nThat said, the parties agreed that the application judge was equipped to decide the issue based on the facts contained within the expropriation decision and inferences she drew from them (application reasons, at para. 8). In the circumstances, I proceed on the basis that the application judge was the first instance decision-maker tasked with deciding the scope of the scheme to be ignored under s. 27(1)(a) of the Expropriation Act, a task that would be performed by the Board in the normal course. Her determination therefore attracts appellate deference and is reviewable only for palpable and overriding error, absent an extricable error of law (Housen, at para. 36).\nIn my view, there is no basis to interfere with the application judges conclusion that compensation for expropriation of the Lynch Property should take into account the Watershed zoning and the discretionary uses of agriculture, forestry, and public utility.\nThe application judges reasons demonstrate that she was alive to the key question: whether the Watershed zoning in the Development Regulations was an independent enactment or was made with a view to the expropriation of the Lynch Property. She recognized that she was tasked with determining the scope of the expropriation scheme (at paras. 28, 32 and 55), that expropriation is a process and not necessarily a single regulatory act effecting the taking (at para. 45), and the longstanding principle that a municipality cannot through the device of zoning, depress the value of property as a prelude to compulsory taking of the property for a public purpose (para. 46). She noted the respondents contention that the Watershed zoning was a step in the process leading to the Citys acquisition of their property (para. 45).\nHaving correctly identified the question she had to answer, the proper analytical framework, and the parties positions, the application judge was entitled to her view of the evidence. She adverted to the fact that the Watershed zoning was part of a city-wide planning process  a factor I would note was considered relevant in Kramer, Atlantic Shopping Centres, and Paciorka  prompted by the reorganization of the municipalities on the Northeast Avalon Peninsula (paras. 52-53). She properly focused on whether the Watershed zoning was part of the expropriation scheme and not whether the Watershed zoning reduced the value of the Lynch Property (para. 54). Regulation that adversely affects property values is not compensable unless the regulation removes all uses of the property. All of this led her to conclude that the Watershed zoning was part of an independent zoning regulation and not part of the expropriation scheme to be disregarded under s. 27(1)(a) (para. 56). Instead, it was the Citys policy of keeping the Lynch Property unused in its natural state which prevented any development (including development conceivably consistent with the Watershed zonings discretionary uses) and which constituted the scheme giving rise to the expropriation (paras. 54 and 56). \nThe Court of Appeal faulted the application judge for fail[ing] to take account of th[e] interconnections between the Development Regulations, the development controls under the City of St. Johns Act, and the Citys policy as expressed in the policy document stating the long term intention to revert the areas back to natural, pristine conditions (paras. 112-15). In the Court of Appeals view, it was not hard . . . to infer a causal connection between the adoption and application of the watershed zoning regulations and the expropriation (para. 113). \nHowever, the application judge did advert to the Citys policy to prohibit all development and keep the property unused in its natural state, and concluded that it was that pollution prevention scheme that gave rise to the expropriation (paras. 54 and 56). The pollution prevention scheme, in the application judges view, did not include the Watershed zoning, but did include the Citys decision not to exercise its discretionary powers under the City of St. Johns Act and the Development Regulations (paras. 38-44, 54 and 56). Moreover, causation does not drive the Pointe Gourde inquiry. There is no doubt that the enactment of the Development Regulations was a link in the chain of events culminating in the expropriation in 2013, when the City refused to grant the respondents permission to develop their land based partly on that enactment. But the key question was whether the Development Regulations were enacted at the time with a view to the expropriation  in other words, with the intention of never allowing any development on the Lynch Property. The application judges reasons demonstrate that she did not regard the City as having had that intention. \nI add that a review of the record discloses multiple possible interpretations of the Citys intentions when it enacted the Development Regulations in 1994. The Court of Appeal, at para. 120, drew inferences from the Citys policy document associated with the Watershed Management Plan, which recommended that the practice of not allowing further urban development within the protected watershed . . . should continue with the long-term goal of reverting the land back to natural, pristine conditions, in finding that the Development Regulations were made with a view to expropriation. A countervailing consideration would be the fact that this policy document was not received until 1996, several years after the City undertook a city-wide planning process following the 1992 municipal reorganization culminating in the Development Regulations. The Citys counsel pressed the significance of this point in oral argument before this Court. As I have explained, however, there will be reasonable disagreements about the characterization of particular enactments, given that this factual determination does not admit of bright-line rules. In the circumstances, I see no basis to interfere with the application judges assessment. It is entitled to deference.\nConclusion\nThe respondents are entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair compensation for the Citys constructive expropriation of their property (Waters, at para. 61). Given the application judges finding that the Watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation, the market value assessment for the Lynch Property must take into account the fact that it is limited to discretionary agriculture, forestry, and public utility uses. To ignore the Watershed zoning would be to award the respondents a significant windfall. It would compensate them for something they never would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop residential housing.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the application judges order. Compensation for the expropriation of the Lynch Property should take into account the Watershed zoning and its discretionary uses of agriculture, forestry, and public utility. This judgment is the result of protracted litigation on the compensation owed to the respondents that escalated when the City asked the Board to state a case to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 27-29). It will provide guidance to the Board and the City in future compensation disputes. In the circumstances, I would order that each party bear its own costs in this Court and in the courts below.\n\tAppeal allowed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Curtis, Dawe, St. Johns.\n\tSolicitors for the respondents: McInnes Cooper, St. Johns.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Attorney General of British Columbia, Victoria.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the City of Surrey: City of Surrey  Legal Services Division, Surrey.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Home Builders Association: Rayman Harris, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Ontario Landowners Association: McCarthy Tetrault, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Ecojustice Canada Society: Ecojustice Canada Society, Halifax.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the decision of the Court of Appeal for Newfoundland and Labrador, restoring the application judge's order that compensation for the constructive expropriation of a property should be determined with reference to existing zoning regulations.\n\nThis appeal revolves around the issue of whether zoning regulations should be taken into account when assessing compensation for expropriated property.\n\nThe respondents, members of the Lynch family, own a 7.36-acre property in the Broad Cove River watershed near St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. The property was originally granted to their grandfather in 1917 for forestry purposes but has remained largely undeveloped since then. The City of St. John's has historically regulated land use in the watershed to protect its water supply. In 1992, a municipal reorganization extended the City's boundaries to include the Lynches' property. A new city-wide plan and development regulations were prepared for the entire city in 1994, which included a Watershed zone encompassing the Lynches' property with discretionary uses limited to agriculture, forestry, and public utility purposes. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynches have sought permission from various authorities to develop their property but have been consistently refused due to concerns about protecting water quality in accordance with section 104(4) of City of St. John's Act R.S.N.L., c.C-17.\n\nThe Court of Appeal declared that the property had been constructively expropriated and that the family had a right to file a claim for compensation with the City. The Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities referred a question to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador regarding whether compensation should be assessed based on permitted uses under existing zoning or whether those uses should be ignored. The application judge concluded that compensation assessment should take into account existing zoning regulations as they were an independent enactment not part of an expropriation scheme. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from this decision, ordering that respondents' compensation be determined without reference to existing watershed zoning in Development Regulations. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal from this judgment, restoring the application judge's order.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is that, in determining whether a regulation's effect on a property's value should be ignored for compensation purposes, the key question is whether the enactment was made with a view to the expropriation or, conversely, was an independent enactment.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Martin held that the City of St. John's' (City) appeal should be allowed and the application judge's order restored. The court determined that the respondents are entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair compensation for the City's constructive expropriation of their property. The market value assessment for the property must take into account its limited uses due to zoning regulations. The court applied the Pointe Gourde principle, which states that changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are to be ignored in assessing compensation. However, this principle does not exclude all enactments affecting a property's value; rather, it only excludes those made with a view to expropriation. The court ultimately concluded that there was no basis to interfere with the application judge's conclusion that the Watershed zoning was part of an independent zoning regulation and not part of the expropriation scheme.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies  how zoning regulations and other restrictions on land use affect how owners of  expropriated property are compensated. \u00a0</strong>Expropriation is a forcible acquisition by the Crown  of privately-owned property for public purposes. A \u201cconstructive expropriation\u201d  happens when a public authority acquires private property by using its  regulatory powers. In such cases, the owners can be entitled to compensation  based on the property\u2019s market value. At issue in this case was the Lynch family\u2019s property  in the Broad Cove River watershed in Newfoundland. Groundwater within the  watershed drains towards the Broad Cove River, which is used by the City of St.  John\u2019s for the local water supply. Pursuant to the <em>City of St. John\u2019s Act</em>, the Lynch property is subject to the City\u2019s  pollution control and expropriation powers. In 1994, the Lynch property was  zoned as watershed (the \u201cwatershed zoning\u201d). Within the watershed zone, the  City\u2019s permission is required for any use of the land, and it may only be  granted for three discretionary uses: agriculture, forestry and public utility. Since at least the 1990s, the Lynch family has tried  to obtain permission to develop the property. In 2013, the City rejected a  formal application to develop a residential subdivision on the property, citing  its authority under the <em>City of St.  John\u2019s Act </em>and the property\u2019s designation as part of the watershed zone. Following  that refusal, the Lynch family turned to the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of  Appeal, which declared that the City had expropriated the Lynch property when it  refused to permit any development on it. The court\u2019s decision meant that the  Lynch family was entitled to compensation from the City. The City asked the Board of Commissioners of Public  Utilities to assess how much the Lynch family was owed. In turn, the Board  sought the opinion of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador to  determine whether compensation should be assessed based on the watershed zoning  or whether the watershed zoning should be ignored and the value determined as  if residential development were allowed. This question was important because  valuation according to the watershed zoning would diminish the market value of  the property compared to the Lynch family\u2019s desire to use it for residential  development. As a result, taking the watershed zoning into account would reduce  the compensation owed to the Lynch family.The judge applied a legal principle according to which  changes in value resulting from the expropriation scheme itself are ignored in  the compensation assessment. As such, the question became whether the watershed  zoning was made with a view to expropriating the Lynch property. The judge ruled  that the watershed zoning was an independent enactment and not part of the  expropriation scheme. This meant that it could operate to influence the market  value of the Lynch property and was not to be ignored for the purpose of  determining compensation. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed  the Lynch family\u2019s appeal. It disagreed with the first judge and concluded that  the watershed zoning was connected to the expropriation. As such, it ordered  the Board to determine compensation without reference to the watershed zoning. The  City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal.\u00a0 <strong>The watershed  zoning was independent from the expropriation scheme. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Martin held  that the Lynch family was entitled to fair compensation but not more than fair  compensation for the City\u2019s constructive expropriation of the property. She  agreed with the first judge\u2019s finding that the watershed zoning was an  independent enactment and not made with a view to expropriation. As such,  Justice Martin determined that the market value assessment for the property  must take into account the fact that the watershed zoning limits use of the  property to discretionary agriculture, forestry and public utility. To ignore  the watershed zoning would compensate the Lynch family for something they never  would have had absent the expropriation: unencumbered land to develop  residential housing. For these reasons, Justice Martin allowed the appeal, set  aside the order of the Court of Appeal and restored the first judge\u2019s order. "

C-46, ss. 530(3), 686(1)(a), (b).\n\tT is a bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial conducted in English. During the judicial process leading to the conviction, the judge before whom T first appeared did not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to the requirements of s. 530(3) of the Criminal Code. Before the Court of Appeal, T asserted that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French. While the Court of Appeal was of the view that the breach of s. 530(3) was an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, it found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the error had caused any prejudice. It therefore applied one of the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b). \n\tHeld (Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial in French ordered.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Cote, Rowe, Kasirer and OBonsawin JJ.: A breach of the informational duty imposed by s. 530(3) of the Criminal Code on the judge before whom an accused first appears is an error of law warranting appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The breach, once established, taints the trial courts judgment and gives rise to a presumption that the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice, guaranteed to the accused by s. 530, was violated. The Crown can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv). In this case, T has proved that a reviewable error was made, and the Crown has failed to establish that Ts fundamental right was not in fact violated despite the breach of s. 530(3).\n\tInstitutional judicial bilingualism ensures equal access to the courts for members of Canadas linguistic communities through various legal guarantees, including those set out in s. 530 of the Criminal Code. Section 530, a provision enacted to advance the equality of status or use of English and French, goes beyond the constitutional right to speak in the official language of ones choice. It also gives every accused the right to choose the official language they wish to speak and in which they wish to be understood by the judge or the judge and jury, without the use of interpretation or translation services.\n\tSubsections (1) and (4) of s. 530 set out two frameworks governing the exercise of the same fundamental right, that is, the right of every accused to be tried in the official language of their choice. Section 530(1) guarantees to every accused an absolute right to equal access to the courts in the official language of their choice, provided that the accuseds application is timely and that they are able to instruct counsel and follow the proceedings in the chosen language. Where an accuseds application to be tried in the official language of their choice is made outside the period specified in s. 530(1), the accuseds right is then subject to the judges discretion under s. 530(4). However, because of the central importance of language rights in Canadian society, there is a presumption in the accuseds favour that granting their application is in the best interests of justice. The violation of this fundamental right constitutes significant prejudice for which the appropriate remedy is normally a new trial.\n\tTo make certain that an accused is able to choose the language of their trial in a free and informed manner, Parliament has imposed an informational duty for this purpose on the judge before whom the accused first appears. Section 530(3) enshrines the accuseds right to be advised of their fundamental right and of the time before which they must apply for a trial before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of their choice. The judge must ensure that the accused is advised of their fundamental right and of the time limit for exercising it, and if the judge finds that the accused has not been properly informed thereof, or if they have the slightest doubt in this regard, they must take the necessary steps to ensure that the accused is informed. This two-pronged duty requires the judge to take the steps needed to have no doubt that the accused is well aware of their right and of how it is to be exercised. Ultimately, the goal of s. 530(3) is to make sure that information about the accuseds fundamental right and how it is to be exercised is conveyed to the accused in a timely manner in order to help the accused make a free and informed choice of official language. The amendment to s. 530(3) made by Parliament in 2008 to extend the application of the judges informational duty to all accused persons, regardless of whether they are self-represented or represented by counsel, amounts to legislative recognition of a principle of caution requiring judges to avoid presuming, without verifying in a diligent and proactive manner, that an accused has been properly informed of their right and of how it is to be exercised prior to their first appearance. The amendment also reflects the legislative intent to make the judge the ultimate guardian of the fundamental right of every accused to be tried in the official language of their choice, and thus the ultimate guardian of the free and informed nature of the accuseds choice of official language. A first appearance judge who fails to actively ensure that the accused has been informed of their fundamental right and of how it is to be exercised, or who fails to ensure, where the circumstances so require, that the accused is informed thereof, contravenes the judges duty and infringes the accuseds right under s. 530(3).\n\tSection 686 of the Criminal Code sets out the powers of a court of appeal hearing an appeal against a conviction. Section 686(1)(a) allows a court of appeal to intervene only if the appellant is able to show that the verdict is unreasonable (s. 686(1)(a)(i)), that an error of law was made (s. 686(1)(a)(ii)) or that a miscarriage of justice occurred (s. 686(1)(a)(iii)). A court of appeal can generally intervene only where an error was prejudicial to the accused. Unreasonable verdicts and miscarriages of justice are usually, by nature, prejudicial to the accused, while errors of law are presumed to be prejudicial. Therefore, the primary relevance of the distinction between errors of law and the other types of errors referred to in s. 686(1)(a) lies first and foremost in the allocation of the burden of showing that the error was or was not prejudicial. Where the error is one of law, because such an error is presumed to be prejudicial to the accused, the Crown bears the onus of establishing the absence of prejudice at the stage of the analysis under one of the two curative provisos. This means that, in principle, it is less onerous for an accused to establish an error of law, because showing the existence of such an error is sufficient to give rise to a presumption of prejudice and thus to justify appellate intervention.\n\tAn error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) is any error in the application of a legal rule, as long as, first, it is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction, such that it contributed to the ultimate verdict, and second, it was made by a judge, who might not be the trial judge. In such circumstances, it can be concluded that the error tainted the trial courts judgment, with the result that prejudice can be presumed and the conviction quashed. An error in the application of a legal rule may involve either a decision that is wrong in law or an unjustified failure to comply with a legal rule. The error may originate in various ways, including through a misinterpretation of the legal rule. It is not necessary that the legal rule erroneously applied be substantive in nature, because it is well settled that a procedural irregularity, whether trivial or serious, may constitute an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii).\n\tBy comparison, miscarriages of justice under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) are a residual category of errors that exists to ensure that a conviction can be quashed where a trial was unfair. The question to be decided in this regard is whether the irregularity was so severe that it rendered the trial unfair or created the appearance of unfairness. This is a high bar.\n\tA breach of s. 530(3) is an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), with the result that an accused need only disclose the breach in order to justify appellate intervention. Failure by the judge before whom the accused first appears to carry out their informational duty under s. 530(3) is an error in the application of a legal rule. By erroneously failing to apply an imperative legal rule of general application, the judge commits an improper omission. Because this irregularity is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction and is committed by a judge, it has the effect of tainting the trial courts judgment so as to provide a basis for appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a)(ii). In keeping with the logic and structure of s. 686, this error gives rise to a presumption that the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was infringed. The Crown can then rebut this presumption at the stage of the curative proviso analysis.\n\tThe curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal on the ground that an error or irregularity did not result in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) allows the same result to be reached where an error or irregularity causes a loss of jurisdiction, as long as the accused suffered no prejudice and the trial court at least maintained jurisdiction over the class of offences. The common purpose of the two curative provisos is to permit the dismissal of an appeal where the error or irregularity shown by the accused was not prejudicial to them. A breach of s. 530(3) is an error that results in the court losing jurisdiction over the proceedings. The Crown can therefore rely on the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv), which it can validly raise implicitly, and try to show that no prejudice was caused by the error, or in other words, that the error did not result in a violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice. The opportunity for the Crown to rebut the presumption significantly limits the risk of language rights being instrumentalized for tactical purposes. The Crown can argue that the accused does not have sufficient proficiency in the language they were unable to choose, that the accused would in any event have chosen to be tried in the language in which their trial was conducted or that the accused chose English or French in a free and informed manner. If the Crown fails to make this showing on the balance of probabilities standard, it will be presumed that the breach of s. 530(3) resulted in a violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice and thus caused the accused prejudice that was too significant for the conviction to be upheld. \n\tIn this case, the judge erred in law by not ensuring that T was advised of his fundamental right. The Court of Appeal then erred in law by imposing on T the burden of proving, in addition to a breach of s. 530(3), that his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice had in fact been violated at first instance. Lastly, the Crown has not succeeded in showing that the breach of s. 530(3) nevertheless did not result in the violation of Ts fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. The evidence does not make it possible to conclude on a balance of probabilities that T would in any event have chosen English as the official language of his trial if he had been duly informed of his right or that he had timely knowledge of his right otherwise than through notice under s. 530(3), such that it can be concluded that he made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. Because it is the Crown that bears the burden of satisfying the Court on a balance of probabilities, the uncertainty and doubt that remain must be resolved in Ts favour and must weigh against the Crown.\n\tPer Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. A breach of the procedural requirement under s. 530(3) of the Criminal Code to ensure an accused is advised of their substantive language rights is not a ground of a wrong decision on a question of law to set aside the judgment of the trial court under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The failure to give notice under s. 530(3) falls within the residual category under s. 686(1)(a)(iii), meaning an appellant must establish a miscarriage of justice before a remedy can be granted. In order to establish a miscarriage of justice, T was required to show that the lack of notice required by s. 530(3) had some effect on the exercise of his right, that is, he was unaware of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice. He did not meet his burden.\n\tA wrong decision on a question of law relating to the judgment of the trial court under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) occurs only when there is an error on a question of law contained in a decision that is attributable to the trial judge. First, there must be a question of law. If the irregularity is one of fact or of mixed fact and law, it cannot fall within s. 686(1)(a)(ii). It is a question of mixed fact and law if the appellate court must make new findings of fact based on fresh evidence to determine whether a legal error occurred. Second, the error being alleged on appeal must arise from a decision which, in the context of the trial and the circumstances in which the decision was made, represented an erroneous interpretation or application of the law. When the particular irregularity being alleged on appeal was not raised at trial and therefore the trial judge made no ruling on it, it could be said that no error of law is alleged. Third, this wrong legal decision must be attributable to the trial judge. The irregularities cannot have occurred outside the trial judges knowledge, with no opportunity to remedy them. Errors that share these three criteria ordinarily render the verdict of the trial court unsafe and presumptively cause a miscarriage of justice such that the judgment should be set aside. \n\tThe proper classification of an irregularity that occurred during a criminal proceeding governs what an appellant must prove, what the court of appeal can do once it has been proven, and whether the court can dismiss the appeal despite it being proven. If an error is not characterized as a wrong decision on a question of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), which presumptively causes a miscarriage of justice unless the Crown can prove that the error was trivial or evidence was so overwhelming that a conviction was inevitable, then the error must fall into the residual miscarriage of justice clause under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) if the court of appeal is to have any power to intervene. The appellant bears the burden of proving that the error caused their trial to be unfair or to have the appearance of unfairness such that it would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. Therefore, where the question before the appellate court is a question of mixed fact and law, or where the irregularity was not brought to the trial judges attention and therefore they made no decision about it, or where the wrong legal decision cannot be attributed to the trial judge, it falls to the appellant not only to prove the error but to show that it caused a miscarriage of justice under the residual ground of appeal in s. 686(1)(a)(iii). Once proven, the Crown is not able to rebut this and the court of appeal must quash the conviction and either order a new trial or enter an acquittal. Errors that deprive the accused of a chance to make a meaningful choice in the exercise of their rights, thus creating the appearance of unfairness or harming the publics perception of the administration of justice, have been found to fall within s. 686(1)(a)(iii). Such errors do not presumptively render the verdict of the trial court unsafe. The burden is on the appellant in each case to show that a miscarriage of justice occurred. \n\tA judicial officials breach of the procedural requirement under s. 530(3) to ensure an accused is advised of their substantive language rights fails to meet the criteria that typically characterize errors of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii). A breach of s. 530(3) does not give rise to a question of law alone, nor does it concern a decision by a trial judge. A finding of non-compliance with s. 530(3) on appeal would ordinarily require fresh evidence and findings to determine not only whether the judicial official personally informed the accused of their language rights on the record, but also whether they did enough to ensure that the accused had been informed in some other way. Furthermore, a judicial officials failure to provide the required statutory notice at the first appearance arises outside the trial process without the trial judge making any ruling on this point. On its own, it is clearly not an error made by the trial judge.\n\tSection 530(3) exists to make sure an accused is aware of their language rights and can bring their application for a trial in their official language of choice in a timely manner. It does not itself provide the accused with a right to a trial in their official language of choice. It provides the accused with nothing more than knowledge of the right to choose. Where a judicial official fails at the accuseds first appearance to ensure that they are informed of their right to a trial in their official language of choice, it does not necessarily follow that the accused was deprived of their substantive right to choose. The accused may already know of this right in advance, or may learn of it through other means after the first appearance but within the timeframe to make an application, and the breach of s. 530(3) may have no effect at all on the accuseds substantive right. Since the breach of this procedural right does not necessarily result in a breach of the substantive right, without additional evidence from the accused on this point, it does not give rise to a presumption that this error has led to a miscarriage of justice. \n\tIf the court of appeal is to have any power to intervene, non-compliance with s. 530(3) must fall within the residual category in s. 686(1)(a)(iii), in which case the appellant bears the burden of showing that the error actually caused a miscarriage of justice. In order to justify appellate intervention, an appellant must provide evidence, which may be by way of an affidavit, to establish that the breach in fact deprived them of the knowledge necessary to exercise their right to a trial in the language of their choice and that the option of a trial in that other official language was a viable choice. This burden is not onerous and is tailored to the fundamental importance of language rights and the miscarriage of justice that occurs if an appellant, who truly does not know of their language rights, is deprived of their substantive right to choose a trial in the other official language.\n\tHowever, the importance of the language rights s. 530 protects does not mean that any breach, even of a procedural or notice requirement, should result in a near-automatic right to a new trial when raised for the first time on appeal. Nor should appellants be relieved of demonstrating that the lack of notice under s. 530(3) was consequential and actually deprived them of knowledge of their right to trial in the official language of their choice. Without placing some evidentiary duty on the accused, it will be difficult, if not impossible in some cases, for the Crown to prove a negative  that the accused did not know they could choose a trial in either official language. It would be equally difficult for the Crown to prove that the accused did know of their language rights as it is usually a question that only the accused can answer. \n\tIn the instant case, the justice of the peace presiding over Ts first appearance violated s. 530(3). Under the ground of miscarriage of justice in s. 686(1)(a)(iii), T was required to establish that he did not otherwise know of his language rights in order to show that this failure had any consequence. T has brought no evidence to meet this minimal burden. The evidence in the record also strongly supports the inference that he was aware of his language rights. The trial judge had no duty under s. 530(4) to verify whether Ts trial was taking place in the official language of his choice and did not err in law by failing to order on his own initiative that T be remanded for a trial in French. \nCases Cited\nBy Wagner C.J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

C-46 (Cr. C.), guarantees to every accused the right to be tried in the official language of their choice. This is a fundamental right of vital importance. It ensures equal access to the courts for accused persons who speak one of the two official languages and thereby assists in preserving the cultural identity of English and French linguistic minorities across the country.\nTo make certain that an accused is able to choose the language of their trial in a free and informed manner, Parliament has imposed an informational duty for this purpose on the judge before whom the accused first appears. This very important duty, set out in s. 530(3) Cr. C., requires the judge to ensure that the accused is advised of their right to apply for a trial before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of their choice, and of the time before which the application must be made.\nHowever, there may be cases in which accused persons are not duly informed of this fundamental linguistic right and of how it is to be exercised. This appeal is an example of such a situation, and it is a reminder that Canadas linguistic minorities too often still experience difficulties in accessing justice in the official language of their choice.\nThis appeal provides the Court with an opportunity to establish the analytical framework that applies where an accused appeals their conviction and raises, for the first time, a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. when no decision on the accuseds language rights was made at first instance. Thus far, the lower courts are not in agreement on the framework to be applied. While some appellate courts find that such a breach in itself warrants a new trial, others, including the Court of Appeal in this case, instead take the view that the evidence in the record must make it possible to conclude that the breach in fact resulted in a violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice. This Court is thus called upon to settle this debate.\nFor the reasons that follow, I am of the view that a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is an error of law warranting appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. According to the jurisprudence, an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. is any error in the application of a legal rule, through a decision or an improper omission, as long as the error is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction and was made by a judge. A breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. corresponds precisely to this definition. It involves a failure by a judge to comply with a legal rule, and this omission is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction. A breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C., once established, has the effect of tainting the trial courts judgment. It gives rise to a presumption that the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was violated, which opens the door to appellate intervention. The Crown can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) Cr. C.\nIn addition to being in harmony with the scheme for conviction appeals, this framework strikes an appropriate balance. On the one hand, it takes into account and gives effect to the purpose of s. 530 Cr. C., which is to support the preservation and development of linguistic minorities across Canada by ensuring equal access to the courts in criminal proceedings. On the other, it prevents the risk that an accused who has been convicted will improperly take advantage on appeal, for an ulterior motive, of a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. that occurred at first instance. This is because the framework laid down gives the Crown an opportunity to persuade the court of appeal that the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was respected, despite the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. If the Crown succeeds, the appeal can then be dismissed. For this reason, the framework significantly limits the risk of language rights being instrumentalized on appeal  a highly objectionable practice that must be sanctioned to the greatest extent possible.\nIn this case, I conclude that the Court of Appeal erred in law by imposing on Mr. Tayo Tompouba the burden of proving, in addition to a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C., that his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice had in fact been violated at first instance. If the Court of Appeal had applied the proper legal framework, it would have found that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had proved that a reviewable error had been made and that the Crown had failed to establish that the appellants fundamental right was not in fact violated despite the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, quash the conviction and order that a new trial be held in French.\nProcedural and Judicial History\nMr. Tayo Tompouba is a bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial conducted in English in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. It is acknowledged that, during the judicial process leading to Mr. Tayo Tompoubas conviction, the judge did not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to the requirements of s. 530(3) Cr. C. The parties also agree that Mr. Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French and that the trial judge did not order on his own initiative that Mr. Tayo Tompouba be tried in French, as s. 530(4) Cr. C. authorized him to do.\nBecause Mr. Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French or raise the breach of his right under s. 530(3) Cr. C. to be advised of the right to make such an application, these matters were not decided at first instance. However, mention should be made of two judgments rendered by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in which findings concerning the appellants linguistic abilities were made.\nDecisions of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (Marchand J.)\nVoir Dire Decision, 2019 BCSC 2442\nAt a voir dire, Mr. Tayo Tompouba argued that an incriminating statement made to the police shortly after his arrest was inadmissible because his right to counsel had been read to him in English and exercised in that language. The Supreme Court of British Columbia rejected his arguments and admitted the incriminating statement into evidence. Taking the entire record into account, the judge held that there had been no special circumstances imposing a duty on the police to take additional steps to ensure that Mr. Tayo Tompouba understood his right to counsel and exercised it in the official language of his choice.\nThe judge noted that it was obvious that Mr. Tayo Tompouba was not originally from Canada and that English was not his first language  indeed, it was sometimes difficult to understand him when he spoke English. The judge found that Mr. Tayo Tompouba nonetheless displayed a good ability to understand English and had an advanced vocabulary in English, which was consistent with the fact that he had been living in British Columbia for several years at the time of his arrest and that he worked there and attended school there in English. Lastly, the judge found that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had said that he was confident in his ability to interact with the police in English.\nDecision on Guilt, 2019 BCSC 1529\nIn his reasons for judgment on guilt, the judge rejected Mr. Tayo Tompoubas arguments, including that his incriminating statement to the police had been false and that he had misunderstood the significance of such a statement because he did not have a good understanding of English.\nIn the judges view, although Mr. Tayo Tompoubas English was not perfect  as he sometimes struggled to find the right words to express himself and he asked for clarifications several times in order to understand the questions put to him  he displayed an excellent ability to understand and express himself in English. Essentially, his slight linguistic difficulties were no different than those normally experienced by witnesses who speak English as a first language.\nDecision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2022 BCCA 177, 414 C.C.C. (3d) 86 (Dickson, Griffin and Voith JJ.A.)\nIt was not until Mr. Tayo Tompouba was before the Court of Appeal that he asserted that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French. On appeal from his conviction, Mr. Tayo Tompouba urged two grounds for intervention based on the violation of his language rights: the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. and, in the alternative, the trial judges failure to proactively exercise the powers conferred on him by s. 530(4) Cr. C. in order to remand him to be tried by a judge who spoke French. In his opinion, these errors precluded the application of either of the curative provisos and required full new proceedings to be held.\nIt is important to note that Mr. Tayo Tompouba did not seek to file fresh evidence on appeal. He did not try to prove that he had been unaware at first instance of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice, nor did he try to explain why he had waited before asserting this right. In his view, this was unnecessary given his position on the lower courts breaches of his language rights. Therefore, Mr. Tayo Tompouba simply alleged that he had not been informed of his right in this regard at first instance, either by his counsel or by the various judges before whom he had appeared.\nIn a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. First of all, it refused to accept the ground of appeal based on the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. While it was of the view that the breach was an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., it found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the error had caused any prejudice. It therefore applied one of the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b) Cr. C.\nThe Court of Appeal explained that the success of this ground of appeal depended on factual inferences that would support a conclusion that the breach of the duty set out in s. 530(3) Cr. C. had resulted in a violation of the appellants fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. However, in its opinion, such inferences could not reasonably be drawn from the record. Specifically, the evidence before it did not allow a conclusion to be reached one way or the other on various key questions, including when Mr. Tayo Tompouba had learned of his fundamental right, whether he would in fact have chosen a trial in French if he had had an opportunity to do so, and whether he had not made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. Because the onus was, in its view, on Mr. Tayo Tompouba to adduce such evidence and persuade it that his fundamental right had been violated, the Court of Appeal held that the inconclusiveness of the evidence on these questions was fatal to him.\nThe Court of Appeal also dismissed Mr. Tayo Tompoubas alternative ground of appeal to the effect that the trial judge had erred in not remanding him to be tried by a judge who spoke French. As a general rule, a trial judge is not obliged to inquire into an accuseds official language of choice unless it becomes evident that this may be a genuinely live issue (C.A. reasons, at para. 127). In this case, however, several findings of fact  which, in the Court of Appeals view, were not tainted by any palpable error  provided a basis for the trial judge to conclude that the language of the trial was not a live issue: the appellant was fluent in English, he was represented by counsel, he felt that he could interact with the police in English, he demonstrated an understanding of linguistic nuance, and he testified in English without apparent difficulty. In this context, the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the trial judge could not be faulted for not inquiring into whether it would be in the best interests of justice to remand the appellant to be tried in French.\nIt is clear from the Court of Appeals reasons that it was seeking to prevent the risk that accused persons may take advantage of essentially harmless violations of their language rights that occur at first instance. It strongly emphasized the importance of adopting a framework that does not encourage accused persons to raise non-compliance with s. 530(3) Cr. C. in a purely tactical manner for the purposes of a conviction appeal. In its view, accused persons must not be permitted to secure a new trial as a result of a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. that does not genuinely impact their fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice. It held that no accused should be automatically entitled to a new trial solely on the basis of a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C.\nIssues\nThe questions raised by this appeal are as follows:\nWhat framework applies where an accused appeals their conviction while raising a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C., when no decision on the accuseds language rights was made at first instance?\nDid the Court of Appeal make a reviewable error in declining to order a new trial?\nFor the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the applicable framework must be based on the principles enunciated in R. v. Beaulac, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 768, and must also be in harmony with the logic and structure of s. 686 Cr. C. Simply showing that s. 530(3) Cr. C. was breached is sufficient to justify appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. A breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is an error of law and gives rise to a presumption that the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was infringed. The Crown can then rebut this presumption at the stage of the curative proviso analysis. If the Court of Appeal had applied the proper framework, it would have allowed Mr. Tayo Tompoubas appeal, quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial.\nAnalysis\nIt is appropriate to begin the analysis with an overview of language rights, institutional judicial bilingualism, the rights guaranteed by s. 530 Cr. C. and the powers of a court of appeal hearing an appeal against a conviction.\nLanguage Rights: Purpose, Nature and Interpretation\nPurpose and Nature\nThe purpose of language rights is to protect official language minorities in this country and to insure the equality of status of French and English (Beaulac, at para. 41). These rights are a fundamental tool for the preservation and development of Canadas two official language communities (Beaulac, at para. 25, citing Reference re Public Schools Act (Man.), s. 79(3), (4) and (7), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 839, at p. 850; see also Mazraani v. Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc., 2018 SCC 50, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 261, at para. 32; Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia, 2020 SCC 13, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 678, at paras. 11 and 18). Neither negative nor passive, they are substantive rights that require positive action by the state to ensure that they are given effect (Beaulac, at paras. 20, 24 and 28; Mazraani, at para. 20; Bessette v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 31, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 535, at para. 38; Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Education, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31, at para. 111).\nIn the judicial context, language rights must be distinguished from guarantees related to procedural fairness. As Bastarache J. reiterated in Beaulac, language rights are a particular kind of right, distinct from the principles of fundamental justice, in that they are not meant to enforce minimum conditions under which a trial will be considered fair (paras. 25 and 47). Rather, their purpose is to ensure that everyone has equal access to a public service that is responsive to [their] linguistic and cultural identity (para. 45; see also MacDonald v. City of Montreal, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460, at pp. 500-501; Mazraani, at paras. 20 and 46; Bessette, at para. 38).\nThis distinction is especially important in criminal law cases. It means that the harm caused by a violation of an accuseds language rights during criminal proceedings can in no way be tempered by the fact that the accused was still able to make full answer and defence. In practical terms, this means that where the accuseds language rights were violated, the fact that the violation had no impact on trial fairness will not be relevant to the remedy granted (Beaulac, at paras. 41 and 47; Mazraani, at para. 46).\nInterpretation\nSince Beaulac, it has consistently been held that language rights, both those that are constitutional and those that are statutory in nature, must in all cases be interpreted liberally and purposively, in keeping with their purpose, which is to support the preservation and development of Canadas two official language communities (para. 25; see Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island, 2000 SCC 1, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 27; Charlebois v. Saint John (City), 2005 SCC 74, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 563, at para. 23; DesRochers v. Canada (Industry), 2009 SCC 8, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 194, at para. 31; Mazraani, at para. 20; P. W. Hogg and W. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  56:12).\nInstitutional Judicial Bilingualism: An Essential Component of the Preservation and Development of Linguistic Minorities\nThis appeal relates to institutional judicial bilingualism, which ensures equal access to the courts for members of Canadas linguistic communities (see Beaulac, at para. 28; Bessette, at para. 20). The inextricable link between institutional judicial bilingualism and the protection of linguistic minorities, as well as the importance of these two concepts, are reflected in Canadas constitutional fabric (see Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 12, per Wagner C.J., and at paras. 188-89, per Brown and Rowe JJ., dissenting; J. D. Richard, Le bilinguisme judiciaire au Canada (2001), 42 C. de D. 389, at p. 395).\nFirst of all, the Constitution Act, 1867 sets out limited positive rights that protect the use of English and French in certain federal and Quebec institutions, including judicial institutions:\n\t133 Either the English or the French Language may be used by any Person in the Debates of the Houses of the Parliament of Canada and of the Houses of the Legislature of Quebec; and both those Languages shall be used in the respective Records and Journals of those Houses; and either of those Languages may be used by any Person or in any Pleading or Process in or issuing from any Court of Canada established under this Act, and in or from all or any of the Courts of Quebec.\n\tThe Acts of the Parliament of Canada and of the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages.\nIn addition, echoing s. 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and strengthening the constitutional protection provided to linguistic minorities across the country, ss. 16 to 20 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms set out a series of legal guarantees that ensure institutional bilingualism at the federal level. These guarantees are not subject to the notwithstanding clause in s. 33 of the Charter (see R. J. Sharpe and K. Roach, The Charter of Rights and Freedoms (7th ed. 2021), at pp. 433-34).\nIn this case, it is ss. 16 and 19 of the Charter that should be focused on specifically. After stating, in the first subsection, that English and French are the official languages of Canada and that these two languages have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and government of Canada, s. 16 specifies, in the third subsection, that Parliament and the legislatures remain free at all times to advance the equality of status or use of English and French. As for s. 19, it specifically guarantees, in the first subsection, the right to use either English or French in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any federally established court (see Sharpe and Roach, at p. 433).\nThe combined effect of s. 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and s. 19(1) of the Charter is to guarantee to every person the right to speak in the official language of their choice in judicial proceedings at the federal level and in Quebec (Societe des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick Inc. v. Association of Parents for Fairness in Education, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 549, at pp. 574-75; R. v. Mercure, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234, at p. 297-98, per Estey J., dissenting; Hogg and Wright, at  56:9; Sharpe and Roach, at p. 433). This guarantee is a constitutional minimum that can be supplemented by federal and provincial legislation in order to advance the equality of status and use of English and French by conferring additional linguistic guarantees (see s. 16(1) and (3) of the Charter; Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 182, at pp. 192-93; MacDonald, at p. 496; Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 212, at pp. 222-23; Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia, 2013 SCC 42, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 774, at para. 56; Sharpe and Roach, at p. 432).\nThe Official Languages Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.), is an example of federal legislation enacted for this purpose. This statute broadens [translation] the legal guarantees provided by section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, both through its geographic scope and through the range of services offered (Richard, at p. 391; see also Beaulac, at para. 22; V. Gruben, Le bilinguisme judiciaire, in M. Bastarache and M. Doucet, eds., Les droits linguistiques au Canada (3rd ed. 2013), 301, at pp. 350-69). With respect to institutional judicial bilingualism in particular, s. 16 requires every federal court to ensure that the judge who hears proceedings is able to understand the language in which the proceedings are conducted, without the use of translation services.\nSection 530 Cr. C. is another example of a provision enacted to advance the equality of status or use of English and French (see Beaulac, at paras. 22 and 34; Gruben, at pp. 350-51 and 370-71). This section supplements the constitutional minimum guaranteed through the combined effect of s. 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and s. 19(1) of the Charter. It goes beyond the constitutional right to speak in the official language of ones choice by also giving every accused the right to choose the official language they wish to speak and in which they wish to be understood by the judge or the judge and jury, without the use of interpretation or translation services (see Beaulac, at para. 28; Bessette, at para. 20).\nI now turn to the language rights guaranteed by s. 530 Cr. C.\nLanguage Rights Guaranteed by Section 530 Cr. C.\nThe purpose of s. 530 Cr. C. is to provide equal access to the courts to accused persons speaking one of the official languages of Canada in order to assist official language minorities in preserving their cultural identity (Beaulac, at para. 34; see also para. 56; Bessette, at para. 38). In particular, this section guarantees to every accused the fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice (s. 530(1) and (4) Cr. C.) and the right to be advised of this right (s. 530(3) Cr. C.), as can be seen from its wording at the time of Mr. Tayo Tompoubas first appearance:\n530 (1) On application by an accused whose language is one of the official languages of Canada, made not later than\n\t(a) the time of the appearance of the accused at which his trial date is set, if\n\t(i) he is accused of an offence mentioned in section 553 or punishable on summary conviction, or\n\t(ii) the accused is to be tried on an indictment preferred under section 577,\n\t(b) the time of the accuseds election, if the accused elects under section 536 to be tried by a provincial court judge or under section 536.1 to be tried by a judge without a jury and without having a preliminary inquiry, or\n\t(c) the time when the accused is ordered to stand trial, if the accused\n\t(i) is charged with an offence listed in section 469,\n\t(ii) has elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge or a judge and jury, or\n\t(iii) is deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury,\n\ta justice of the peace, provincial court judge or judge of the Nunavut Court of Justice shall grant an order directing that the accused be tried before a justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of Canada that is the language of the accused or, if the circumstances warrant, who speak both official languages of Canada.\n\t(2) On application by an accused whose language is not one of the official languages of Canada, made not later than whichever of the times referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) is applicable, a justice of the peace or provincial court judge may grant an order directing that the accused be tried before a justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of Canada in which the accused, in the opinion of the justice or provincial court judge, can best give testimony or, if the circumstances warrant, who speak both official languages of Canada.\n\t(3) The justice of the peace or provincial court judge before whom an accused first appears shall ensure that they are advised of their right to apply for an order under subsection (1) or (2) and of the time before which such an application must be made.\n\t(4) Where an accused fails to apply for an order under subsection (1) or (2) and the justice of the peace, provincial court judge or judge before whom the accused is to be tried, in this Part referred to as the court, is satisfied that it is in the best interests of justice that the accused be tried before a justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury who speak the official language of Canada that is the language of the accused or, if the language of the accused is not one of the official languages of Canada, the official language of Canada in which the accused, in the opinion of the court, can best give testimony, the court may, if it does not speak that language, by order remand the accused to be tried by a justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak that language or, if the circumstances warrant, who speak both official languages of Canada.\nFundamental Right To Be Tried in the Official Language of Ones Choice\nSubsections (1) and (4) of s. 530 set out two frameworks governing the exercise of the same fundamental right, that is, the right of every accused to be tried in the official language of their choice. In Beaulac, this Court clarified the nature of and manner of exercising the right guaranteed to every accused under these two subsections, which until then had been interpreted inconsistently by the courts (see Gruben, at p. 373, citing R. Soubliere, Les perpetuels tiraillements des tribunaux dans linterpretation des droits linguistiques (2001), 4 R.C.L.F. 1).\nDiscussing s. 530(1) Cr. C., this Court stated that it guarantees to every accused an absolute right to equal access to the courts in the official language of their choice, provided that the accuseds application is timely and that they are able to instruct counsel and follow the proceedings in the chosen language (Beaulac, at paras. 28, 31, 34 and 37). To exercise this absolute right, the accused need only assert which official language is their own language. The judge will then have to grant the accuseds application unless the Crown shows that the assertion is unfounded (para. 34). Where the Crown challenges the accuseds assertion, the judge should not inquire into specific criteria to determine a dominant cultural identity or into the personal language preferences of the accused. The judge will only verify that the requirements of s. 530(1) Cr. C. are met (para. 34). In short, where the accuseds application is timely and there is no evidence establishing that their proficiency in the chosen language is insufficient for them to exercise their right, the accused has an absolute right, guaranteed by s. 530(1) Cr. C., to choose the official language to be used and understood by the judge or the judge and jury before whom they will be tried (para. 56).\nIn contrast, where an accuseds application to be tried in the official language of their choice is untimely  that is, made outside the period specified in s. 530(1) Cr. C.  the accuseds right is then subject to the judges discretion. Under s. 530(4) Cr. C., the judge may grant the accuseds application only if satisfied that doing so is in the best interests of justice. In Beaulac, this Court stated that there are, however, significant constraints on this judicial discretion. In particular, because of the central importance of language rights in Canadian society, there is a presumption in the accuseds favour that granting their application is in the best interests of justice. In practice, therefore, granting an application under s. 530(4) Cr. C. should be the rule and denying it should be the exception (Beaulac, at paras. 42 and 56).\nTo justify the denial of such an application, the Crown must rebut this presumption. It must show that granting the accuseds application is not in the best interests of justice and, for this purpose, make arguments based on both the reasons for the delay and the difficulties caused by the lateness of the application (Beaulac, at paras. 37, 40, 42 and 44). With regard to the reasons for the delay, this Court specified that the later the application is made, the better the reason for the delay must be in order for the application to be accepted. That being said, there is no burden on the accused: even if the accused provides no explanation for the delay, this will not necessarily be fatal. At most, it will merely facilitate the Crowns task of justifying the denial of the accuseds late application (paras. 43 and 56). As for the difficulties caused by the lateness of the application, the Court set out the relevant factors relating to the conduct of the trial, including\n\twhether the accused is represented by counsel, the language in which the evidence is available, the language of witnesses, whether a jury has been empanelled, whether witnesses have already testified, whether they are still available, whether proceedings can continue in a different language without the need to start the trial afresh, the fact that there may be co-accuseds (which would indicate the need for separate trials), changes of counsel by the accused, the need for the Crown to change counsel and the language ability of the presiding judge. [para. 38]\nMere administrative inconvenience, on the other hand, is of no relevance (para. 39).\nThe result is a framework conducive to the protection of the accuseds language rights. Even where the accused decides to exercise their fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice late, even as late as during the trial on the merits, the presumption applies in the accuseds favour. The burden of persuading the court that the accuseds application must be denied falls on the Crown (Beaulac, at paras. 42 and 56).\nFinally, it should be noted that it is well settled that the violation of this fundamental right constitutes significant prejudice for which the appropriate remedy is normally a new trial. In Beaulac, this Court stated that the erroneous denial of an application under s. 530(1) or (4) Cr. C. violates the accuseds right to be tried in the official language of their choice and will always cause prejudice to the accused. It follows that where this fundamental right of the accused was violated, the Crown can never successfully rely on either of the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b) Cr. C., even if the violation had no impact on trial fairness or on the accuseds ability to make full answer and defence (Beaulac, at paras. 52-54; Bessette, at para. 38). Therefore, where there was an infringement of an accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice, a new trial will generally be the fair, appropriate and proportionate remedy (see Beaulac; Mazraani, at paras. 47-48).\nRight To Be Advised of This Fundamental Right\nSection 530(3) Cr. C. enshrines the accuseds right to be advised of their right to be tried in the official language of their choice and of the time before which an application for this purpose must be made. Parliaments intention was that the safeguarding of this fundamental right be ultimately entrusted to the judge before whom the accused first appears. To begin with, s. 530(3) Cr. C. explicitly states that the judge must ensure that the accused is advised of their fundamental right and of the time limit for exercising it. In addition, it is implicit in the language of s. 530(3) Cr. C. that if the first appearance judge finds that the accused has not been properly informed, or if they have the slightest doubt in this regard, they must take the necessary steps to ensure that the accused is informed of their fundamental right and of how it is to be exercised. While this last point is not clear from the language of s. 530(3) Cr. C., it is nonetheless the interpretation that must be adopted in light of the legislative intent. This two-pronged duty  which requires the judge to ensure that the accused is duly informed of their fundamental right and of how it is to be exercised and, where the circumstances so require, to take the necessary steps to inform the accused thereof  is what I refer to as the judges informational duty.\nSection 530(3) Cr. C. states that the judge before whom an accused first appears shall ensure (veille in the French version) that the accused is advised (avise in the French version) of their right and of the time limit for exercising it. The use of these terms in each language version indicates that Parliament intends judges to make certain that every accused is informed of their right and of how it is to be exercised so that the accused can avail themself of the right in a timely manner (Canadian Oxford Dictionary (2nd ed. 2004), sub verbo ensure; The Dictionary of Canadian Law (5th ed. 2020), sub verbo ensure; Le Grand Robert de la langue francaise (electronic version), sub verbo aviser; Grand Robert & Collins (electronic version), sub verbo advise and aviser). In other words, the judge must display [translation] vigilance and actively take care to ensure that the accused is duly informed of their right and of how it is to be exercised (Le Grand Robert de la langue francaise (electronic version), sub verbo veiller). The judge cannot presume what the accuseds choice is or assume that the accused has been or will be advised of their right and of how it is to be exercised. The judge must ensure, in a proactive and systematic manner, that the accused is properly informed, irrespective of the fact that the accused seems to be a member of a linguistic minority or that the accused may have been or may be informed of this right by another person, such as their counsel. In short, the judge must take the steps needed to have no doubt that the accused is well aware of their right and of how it is to be exercised (Mazraani, at para. 34; see also paras. 25, 32, 38, 44 and 60; R. v. MacKenzie, 2004 NSCA 10, 181 C.C.C. (3d) 485, at para. 12; Dhingra v. R., 2021 QCCA 1681, 408 C.C.C. (3d) 466, at para. 49).\nIt should be noted here that if the judge finds that the accused has not been properly informed, or if there remains any doubt about this in their mind, the judge must ensure that the accused is informed of their right and of how it is to be exercised. While it is true that this is not explicitly stated in the provision, this interpretation is nonetheless the one most in keeping with the legislative intent as revealed by the provisions purpose and the legislative history. I will start by looking at the purpose of s. 530(3) Cr. C. The primary purpose of this provision is to help protect the accuseds fundamental right to choose the official language in which they wish to be tried by ensuring that the accused has, at the proper time, the information required to exercise this right. In the context of language rights, the jurisprudence establishes that when it comes to protecting the right to choose an official language, it is essential that this personal choice be a free and informed one (Mazraani, at paras. 42 and 44). Ultimately, the goal of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is therefore to make sure that information about the accuseds fundamental right and how it is to be exercised is conveyed to the accused in a timely manner in order to help the accused make a free and informed choice of official language. This requires the first appearance judge to take the necessary steps to ensure that the accused is informed of their right and of how it is to be exercised where the judge finds that the accused has not been properly informed or where the judge has any doubt in this regard.\nThe legislative history of s. 530(3) Cr. C. also shows that a principle of caution must always guide the judge who has to ensure respect for the accuseds right to be advised of their language rights protected by s. 530 Cr. C., such that the slightest doubt must lead the judge to take the necessary steps to ensure that the accused is duly informed. The previous version of this provision imposed an informational duty on the judge only in cases where the accused was self-represented. It was thus presumed that counsel would properly inform their clients of their language rights (see Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, No. 33, 3rd Sess., 30th Parl., May 31, 1978, at pp. 5-6; Gruben, at p. 379). In 2008, in response to criticisms by courts and other interested institutions and bodies that this presumption was unfounded in practice, Parliament amended s. 530(3) Cr. C. to extend the application of the judges informational duty to all accused persons, regardless of whether they were self-represented or represented by counsel (see Beaulac, at para. 37; An Act to amend the Criminal Code (criminal procedure, language of the accused, sentencing and other amendments), S.C. 2008, c. 18, s. 18; House of Commons, Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, Evidence, No. 65, 1st Sess., 39th Parl., May 2, 2007, at pp. 2-3; Commissioner of Official Languages, The Equitable Use of English and French Before the Courts in Canada (1995), at pp. 102-4).\nThis amendment is important. It amounts to legislative recognition of a principle of caution requiring judges to avoid presuming, without verifying in a diligent and proactive manner, that an accused has been duly informed of their right and of how it is to be exercised prior to their first appearance. While this principle of caution applies in relation to accused persons who are represented by counsel, notwithstanding the fact that counsel generally have an ethical duty to inform their clients of their fundamental right to be tried in the language of their choice, I am of the view that the principle applies with even greater force in relation to accused persons who are not represented by counsel and to those who were purportedly informed of their right by another person or in another way prior to their first appearance.\nThe amendment also reflects the legislative intent to make the judge the ultimate guardian of the fundamental right of every accused to be tried in the official language of their choice, and thus the ultimate guardian of the free and informed nature of the accuseds choice of official language. By imposing a duty on the judge to play an active role in ensuring respect for this fundamental right, this legislative amendment enshrines the principle of active offer when it comes to language rights (see Debates of the Senate, vol. 144, No. 14, 2nd Sess., 39th Parl., November 21, 2007, at pp. 274-75). It recognizes that in a context as intimidating as that of a criminal trial, where the accuseds freedom is at stake, it is important that it be the person in a position of authority, namely the judge, who protects the accuseds language rights under s. 530 Cr. C. by being vigilant, cautious and proactive, particularly to alleviate any fear associated with the exercise of these rights and to help ensure that the choice is a free and informed one (see R. v. Munkonda, 2015 ONCA 309, 126 O.R. (3d) 691, at para. 62; see also Office of the French Language Services Commissioner of Ontario, Active Offer of Services in French: The Cornerstone for Achieving the Objectives of Ontarios French Language Services Act (2016), at pp. 10-11).\nIt follows from the foregoing that a first appearance judge who fails to actively ensure that the accused has been informed of their fundamental right and of how it is to be exercised, or who fails to ensure, where the circumstances so require, that the accused is informed thereof, contravenes the judges informational duty. Such a failure by the judge constitutes a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. and violates the accuseds right.\nFinally, I note that the consequences of a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. will differ depending on when the breach is raised. When it is raised at first instance outside the periods specified in s. 530(1) Cr. C., the accused can file a late application under s. 530(4) Cr. C. The judges failure to comply with s. 530(3) Cr. C. will then be a relevant factor in the accuseds favour that the judge hearing the application must consider when assessing the diligence displayed by the accused in exercising their fundamental right. As Mainville J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal wrote: Should the duty under s. 530(3) . . . Cr.C. not have been satisfied, it would be more difficult to refuse a late application (Dhingra, at para. 51).\nWhere the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is raised for the first time on appeal, as in this case, the consequences of the breach are a subject of disagreement among the courts, with respect to both the applicable framework and the appropriate remedy. Some appellate courts find that a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. in itself causes very significant prejudice to the accused, which requires that a new trial be held (see MacKenzie, at paras. 3, 11, 69 and 82-83; R. v. Deveaux (1999), 181 N.S.R. (2d) 81 (S.C.)). Others, including the Court of Appeal in this case, instead take the view that such a breach cannot justify a new trial on its own in the absence of evidence in the record from which it can be concluded that the breach resulted in a violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice or other significant prejudice (paras. 106 and 125-26; see also R. v. Caesar, 2015 NWTCA 4, 588 A.R. 392, at paras. 8-10).\nBelow I will endeavour to clarify the applicable framework and the appropriate remedy where a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is raised for the first time on appeal. Before that, however, a few words should be said about the powers of a court of appeal hearing an appeal against a conviction under s. 686 Cr. C.\nPowers of a Court of Appeal Hearing an Appeal Against a Conviction\nSection 686 Cr. C. sets out the powers of a court of appeal hearing an appeal against a conviction. The relevant portions of this section read as follows:\n\t686 (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal\n\t(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that\n\t(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,\n\t(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or\n\t(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;\n\t(b) may dismiss the appeal where:\n\t(i) the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was not properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted on another count or part of the indictment,\n\t(ii) the appeal is not decided in favour of the appellant on any ground mentioned in paragraph (a),\n\t(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, or\n\t(iv) notwithstanding any procedural irregularity at trial, the trial court had jurisdiction over the class of offence of which the appellant was convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby;\nPrinciple Underlying Any Intervention by a Court of Appeal Under Section 686(1)(a) Cr. C.\nSection 686(1)(a) Cr. C. allows a court of appeal to intervene only if the appellant is able to show that the verdict is unreasonable, that an error of law was made or that a miscarriage of justice occurred. These three grounds for intervention have the same underlying principle: a court of appeal can generally intervene only where the error was prejudicial to the accused. Otherwise, it is an error without legal consequence, except in cases where the error, without causing direct prejudice to the accused, is so serious that it shakes public confidence in the administration of justice (see R. v. Davey, 2012 SCC 75, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 828, at para. 51, quoting R. v. Wolkins, 2005 NSCA 2, 229 N.S.R. (2d) 222, at para. 89; R. v. Kahsai, 2023 SCC 20, at paras. 67-68).\nSection 686(1)(a)(i) Cr. C. is concerned with situations that are inherently prejudicial to the accused, that is, situations in which the accuseds conviction is unreasonable in the sense that the guilty verdict cannot reasonably be supported by the evidence or is vitiated by illogical or irrational reasoning (R. v. Brunelle, 2022 SCC 5, at para. 7, citing R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, and R. v. Sinclair, 2011 SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3; see also Sinclair, at para. 76, per Charron J., concurring, quoting R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 219). For its part, s. 686(1)(a)(ii), when read along with the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) and (iv), presumes that an error of law is prejudicial to the accused unless the Crown can show the contrary with the requisite degree of certainty (see R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 16; Sinclair, at para. 76, quoting Morrissey, at p. 219; S. Coughlan, Criminal Procedure (4th ed. 2020), at pp. 566-67, 574, 578 and 581-82). Finally, s. 686(1)(a)(iii) Cr. C. permits a court of appeal to intervene in any other situation that causes prejudice giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. This will be the case where the accused was convicted following a trial that was unfair in fact or in appearance, for example where the accused entered a guilty plea without being aware of a collateral consequence of the plea that, if it had been known, would have induced the accused to act differently (Davey, at para. 51, quoting Wolkins, at para. 89; Kahsai, at para. 67, citing Khan, at paras. 69 and 73; R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at paras. 5, 25 and 39, per Moldaver, Gascon and Brown JJ., and at paras. 44, 79 and 85, per Wagner J., dissenting).\nIn short, as a general rule, a court of appeal may intervene only if the error was prejudicial to the accused. Unreasonable verdicts (s. 686(1)(a)(i) Cr. C.) and miscarriages of justice (s. 686(1)(a)(iii) Cr. C.) are usually, by nature, prejudicial to the accused, while errors of law (s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C.) are presumed to be prejudicial (see Khan, at para. 16; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75 and 582).\nImportance of Distinguishing Errors of Law From the Other Two Types of Errors Referred to in Section 686(1)(a) Cr. C.\nTherefore, the primary relevance of the distinction between errors of law and the other types of errors referred to in s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. lies first and foremost in the allocation of the burden of showing that the error was or was not prejudicial. Where the error is one of law, because such an error is presumed to be prejudicial to the accused, the Crown bears the onus of establishing the absence of prejudice at the stage of the analysis under one of the two curative provisos. Where the error is of another type, the onus of showing that it was prejudicial rests on the accused appealing their conviction (see R. v. Arradi, 2003 SCC 23, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 280, at para. 38; Morrissey, at p. 219; Coughlan, at p. 574).\nThis means that, in principle, it is less onerous for an accused to establish an error of law than to establish the other two types of errors referred to in s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. In the former case, showing the existence of an error or irregularity is sufficient to give rise to a presumption of prejudice and thus to justify appellate intervention. The onus then falls on the Crown, for the purposes of the analysis under one of the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b) Cr. C., to rebut this presumption, if it so wishes, by showing that the error of law in question did not in fact cause any prejudice to the accused (see Khan, at para. 23; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75 and 582; M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2023 (30th ed. 2023), at No. 51.238). In the latter case, simply showing the existence of an error or irregularity is not sufficient. The accused must also show that it was prejudicial to them.\nHere, no one is arguing that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. in issue resulted in an unreasonable verdict (s. 686(1)(a)(i) Cr. C.). Rather, it is the distinction between an error of law (s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C.) and a miscarriage of justice (s. 686(1)(a)(iii) Cr. C.) that lies at the heart of this case. It is therefore important to focus the analysis on these two types of errors, starting with an error of law.\nError of Law (Section 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C.)\nSection 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. has been interpreted very broadly by the courts. An examination of the jurisprudence leads to the conclusion that an error of law under this provision is any error in the application of a legal rule, as long as the error is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction and was made by a judge. In such circumstances, the trial courts judgment constitutes a wrong decision on a question of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., which allows prejudice to be presumed and may justify quashing the conviction.\nError in the Application of a Legal Rule\nTo begin with, an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. involves an error in the application of a legal rule. In this regard, three clarifications must be made.\nFirst, an error in the application of a legal rule may originate in various ways, including through a misinterpretation of the legal rule (Khan, at para. 22; Arradi, at para. 39; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75; T. Desjardins, Lappel en droit criminel et penal (2nd ed. 2012), at pp. 147-49).\nSecond, the application error may occur through a decision or an improper omission, that is, an unjustified failure to apply a legal rule. While it is true that the expression a wrong decision on a question of law in s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., coupled with what the majority stated in Khan (see paras. 7, 17 and 22), may at first glance support the idea that an error of law is confined to a decision that is wrong in law, it is clear from this Courts jurisprudence that such an error may also involve an improper omission. More specifically, failing to apply a legal rule  for instance, by not complying with it  may constitute an error of law. This will be the case where, for example, a judge fails to give an instruction to a jury despite being required to do so (see R. v. Chambers, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at p. 1318; R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716, at paras. 32-34; R. v. Abdullahi, 2023 SCC 19, at paras. 48-49; Coughlan, at p. 575); to correct prejudicial remarks made by Crown counsel concerning a defence witness (R. v. Romeo, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 86, at p. 95); to appoint an interpreter when it is apparent that the accused is having difficulty expressing themself or understanding the proceedings for language reasons, such that the failure infringes the accuseds constitutional right protected by s. 14 of the Charter (R. v. Tran, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951, at pp. 980-81 and 1008-9); to comply with a procedural rule (see R. v. Mitchell (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 643 (C.A.); R. v. Sciascia, 2016 ONCA 411, 131 O.R. (3d) 375, at paras. 82-83 and 86, affd on other grounds, 2017 SCC 57, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 539, at paras. 7 and 45; Coughlan, at p. 566; Khan, at para. 16); or to provide sufficient reasons in support of a decision (R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 801, at para. 108, per Brown and Rowe JJ., concurring, citing, inter alia, R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 25 and 28). In short, the jurisprudence indicates that an error in the application of a legal rule may involve either a decision that is wrong in law or an unjustified failure to comply with a legal rule. Indeed, this surely explains why Arbour J. stated in Khan that an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. can be  but is not limited to being  any decision (para. 22).\nThird, for a presumption of prejudice to arise, it is not necessary that the legal rule erroneously applied be substantive in nature. This is because it is well settled that a procedural irregularity, whether trivial or serious, may constitute an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. and trigger the application of the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b) Cr. C. (Khan, at para. 16; R. v. Bain, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91, at pp. 134-35, per Gonthier J., dissenting, quoting R. v. Cloutier (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 46 and 48). In short, the prejudice presumed as a result of an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., which makes it possible to quash the conviction, may arise from a breach of either a substantive or a procedural right (see Coughlan, at p. 576).\nNext, to constitute an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., the erroneous application of a legal rule must be related to the proceedings leading to the conviction and must be attributable to a judge. Only where these two criteria are met can it be concluded that the error tainted the trial courts judgment, with the result that prejudice can be presumed and the conviction quashed.\nRelated to the Proceedings Leading to the Conviction\nTo taint the trial judgment in this manner, the error in the application of the legal rule does not have to be linked to the final verdict or be an error or irregularity on which the verdict was or could have been based so as to prejudice the accused (Khan, at paras. 20 and 22). The error must nevertheless be related to the proceedings leading to the conviction, such that the error contributed to the ultimate verdict as they all do (Khan, at para. 22; see also Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.236).\nMade by a Judge\nFurthermore, to taint the trial judgment in this manner, the error in the application of a legal rule must have been made by a judge. In the majority of situations, it will be the trial judge who commits the error or irregularity. This will be the case, for example, where the trial judge fails to give an instruction to the jury despite being required to do so (see Chambers, at p. 1318; Van, at paras. 32-34; Abdullahi, at paras. 48-49; Coughlan, at p. 575); convicts an accused of contempt of court instanter when it is neither urgent nor imperative to do so, thereby unfairly depriving the accused of the procedural guarantees to which they are entitled (see Arradi, at paras. 36 and 40); violates a Charter right, like the right to an interpreter, through a wrong decision or an improper omission (see Tran); wrongly decides to dismiss a partys application for an order for a new trial (see Khan); excludes the accused from their trial in contravention of s. 650 Cr. C. (see R. v. Barrow, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694; R. v. D.Q., 2021 ONCA 827, 411 C.C.C. (3d) 292); or wrongly decides not to rectify a division and severance order made by a judge who was not the trial judge (see R. v. Litchfield, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333).\nHowever, this will not always be the case. The error in the application of a legal rule may sometimes be made by a judge who is not the trial judge. For example, this will be the case where a judge who is not the trial judge makes a wrong decision on an accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice. This wrong decision may constitute an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., even if it is not brought to the trial judges attention (Beaulac, at paras. 11 and 53-55, revg (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 16 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 1, 54 and 57-58). This will also be the case where an irregularity that amounts to an error of law, and that can therefore be remedied under s. 686(1)(b)(iv) Cr. C., occurs prior to trial (see Khan, at paras. 16 and 18; Coughlan, at pp. 566-67). The example of a justice of the peace who fails to read the charges to an accused or who does not properly put the accused to an election as to the mode of trial, in violation of s. 536(2) Cr. C., is a good illustration of this situation (see Mitchell).\nIn light of this three-part definition, it is easy to understand why preference should generally be given to the framework for miscarriages of justice under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) Cr. C. in cases where an accused raises on appeal, for the first time, the ineffective assistance of their counsel (Khan, at para. 17; see also R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520; R. v. White, 2022 SCC 7) or the invalidity of their guilty plea in the circumstances described in Wong. In such situations, it is not appropriate to analyze the ground of appeal from the standpoint of an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., because both of these cases usually involve no error by a judge in the application of a legal rule. The same is true where, for example, what is being alleged is a violation of a legal rule by a person other than a judge, such as the Crown (see R. v. Yumnu, 2012 SCC 73, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 777; Davey). Similarly, this explains why the miscarriage of justice framework applies in cases where it is alleged that a judge wrongly exercised a highly discretionary power (Fanjoy v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233, at pp. 238-39; Kahsai, at paras. 72 and 74). While the exercise of a highly discretionary power might technically fall within the definition of an erroneous application of a legal rule, this exercise is so dependent on the facts and circumstances in each case that this Court preferred rather to specify that it will not be determined by the simple application of a fixed rule of law (Fanjoy, at pp. 238-39).\nI recognize that, in the past, certain errors or irregularities corresponding to the definition of errors of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. were analyzed on the basis of the framework for miscarriages of justice and then characterized as such. The issue of judicial bias springs to mind: the error of a judge who dismisses a recusal motion or who fails to recuse themself when there is a reasonable apprehension of bias has historically been analyzed under the miscarriage of justice framework (J. Sopinka, M. A. Gelowitz and W. D. Rankin, Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin on the Conduct of an Appeal (5th ed. 2022), at p. 295). But in such a case the characterization of the error under s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. has no impact on the appellants burden of proof or on the outcome, such that the same conclusion would be reached no matter which route was followed (Coughlan, at p. 577). Indeed, regardless of whether an error of law or a miscarriage of justice is involved, an appellant who alleges that the trial judge was biased as a ground for quashing their conviction must establish a reasonable apprehension of bias, which will inexorably lead the court of appeal to order a new trial (R. v. Curragh Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537, at para. 5). The distinction between a miscarriage of justice and an error of law that cannot be cured by the application of the curative provisos because of the prejudice it caused is a theoretical one in this type of situation (Coughlan, at pp. 574 and 577; see also, e.g., Beaulac, at paras. 53-54, and Tran, at pp. 1008-9).\nTo summarize, an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. is any error in the application of a legal rule, as long as it is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction and was made by a judge. In addition, the error may have been made through a decision or an improper omission. It may also concern either a procedural or a substantive legal rule. This definition is consistent not only with the language and inherent mechanics of s. 686 Cr. C. but also with the manner in which this provision has been interpreted by the courts over time. It also has the advantage of being accessible, intelligible, clear and predictable (R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 68). It results in a wide range of errors being classifiable as errors of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., which in fact explains why [m]ost errors that are not based on the unreasonableness of a verdict will relate to an error of law (Coughlan, at p. 574; see also Khan, at para. 25).\nMiscarriage of Justice (Section 686(1)(a)(iii) Cr. C.)\nBy comparison, miscarriages of justice under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) Cr. C. are a residual category of errors that exists to ensure that a conviction [translation] can be quashed where a trial was unfair, regardless of whether the error was procedural or substantive in nature (Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.250; see also Khan, at paras. 18 and 27). The question to be decided in this regard is whether the irregularity was so severe that it rendered the trial unfair or created the appearance of unfairness (Khan, at para. 69, per Lebel J., concurring; see also Fanjoy, at pp. 238-40; Davey, at paras. 50-51; Kahsai, at paras. 67-69). The miscarriage of justice standard is a high bar, which is even higher when claimed based on perceived unfairness instead of actual prejudice (Kahsai, at para. 68).\nCourts have found a miscarriage of justice in a wide range of circumstances (see A. Stylios, J. Casgrain and M.-E. OBrien, Procedure penale (2023), at paras. 18-87 to 18-81). Examples of a miscarriage of justice include the ineffective assistance of counsel (see White), a breach of solicitor-client privilege by defence counsel (Kahsai, at para. 69, citing R. v. Olusoga, 2019 ONCA 565, 377 C.C.C. (3d) 143) and a misapprehension of the evidence that, though not making the verdict unreasonable, nonetheless constitutes a denial of justice (R. v. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, at para. 1; Coughlan, at pp. 576-77). Unfairness resulting from the exercise of a highly discretionary power, related to proceedings leading to a conviction and attributable to a judge will also generally be analyzed under the miscarriage of justice framework (Fanjoy, at pp. 238-39; Kahsai, at paras. 72 and 74).\nCurative Provisos in Section 686(1)(b) Cr. C.\nSection 686(1)(b) Cr. C. contains two curative provisos that can be relied upon by the Crown (R. v. Petel, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 17; R. v. McMaster, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 740, at para. 37). The proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) Cr. C. allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal on the ground that an error or irregularity did not result in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice (Khan, at paras. 16 and 18). The second proviso, set out in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) Cr. C., allows the same result to be reached where an error or irregularity causes a loss of jurisdiction, as long as the accused suffered no prejudice and the trial court at least maintained jurisdiction over the class of offences (Khan, at paras. 11, 16 and 18, citing Cloutier with approval; R. v. Esseghaier, 2021 SCC 9, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 101, at para. 2; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.245).\nThe common purpose of the two curative provisos is to permit the dismissal of an appeal where the error or irregularity shown by the accused was not prejudicial to them (see Khan, at paras. 23 and 30; E. G. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings & Practice in Canada (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at  31:1376.50; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.238; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75 and 582). Ultimately, the provisos attempt to prevent the annulment of criminal verdicts or mistrials for reasons that relate essentially to technicalities of the law, which have no real bearing on the fundamental legality or fairness of a trial (Khan, at para. 98, per LeBel J., concurring).\nThe curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) Cr. C. generally applies where there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different in the absence of the error. This occurs in two cases: (1) where the error or irregularity in question is minor or harmless, such that it had no impact on the verdict; or (2) where the error or irregularity, despite being serious enough to warrant a new trial, caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice because the evidence against the appellant is so overwhelming that a trier of fact would inevitably convict (see Tran, at pp. 1008-9; Khan, at paras. 28-31; Van, at paras. 34-36; R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 85; R. v. Samaniego, 2022 SCC 9, at para. 65; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at Nos. 51.237-51.238). As for the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) Cr. C., the question of prejudice has thus far been analyzed on the basis of the principles of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) (see Khan, at paras. 16 and 18; Esseghaier, at paras. 51-53; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.245). As a result, section 686(1)(b)(iv) is largely parallel to section 686(1)(b)(iii), but applies only to a narrow range of procedural irregularities which create a jurisdictional error that could not be classified as a pure error of law (Coughlan, at p. 582).\nAgainst this backdrop, what must now be considered is the framework that applies where an accused appeals their conviction and raises, for the first time, a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. when no decision on the accuseds language rights was made at first instance.\nFramework That Applies Where a Breach of Section 530(3) Cr. C. Is Raised for the First Time on Appeal\nThe proper framework must be based on the principles enunciated in Beaulac  which, as explained above, further the protection of accused persons language rights  and must also be in harmony with the scheme for conviction appeals, and particularly with the logic and structure of s. 686 Cr. C.\nWhat the Accused Must Show to Justify Appellate Intervention\nThe question of what an accused in the same situation as Mr. Tayo Tompouba must show to justify appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. has a decisive impact on the outcome of the appeal. The answer to this question depends on how a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is characterized, that is, as an error of law (s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C.) or as a miscarriage of justice (s. 686(1)(a)(iii) Cr. C.).\nIf a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., as Mr. Tayo Tompouba suggests, simply showing that the breach occurred will be sufficient to justify appellate intervention. Showing this will give rise to a presumption that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. caused prejudice, a presumption that the Crown can then rebut at the stage of the curative proviso analysis (see Khan, at para. 23; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75 and 582; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.238). In the context of the language rights protected by s. 530 Cr. C., the prejudice in question is, of course, related not to the fairness of the trial or the reliability of the verdict, but rather to the violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice (Beaulac, at para. 53).\nOn the other hand, if a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. cannot be characterized as an error of law, it is the miscarriage of justice framework that must apply, as the Crown and two of my colleagues maintain. The onus will then be on the accused to show that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. caused them prejudice that gave rise to a miscarriage of justice (see Wong, at paras. 5 and 39, per Moldaver, Gascon and Brown JJ., and at paras. 44, 79 and 85, per Wagner J., dissenting; Coughlan, at pp. 574-77). In such a case, no presumption will apply in the accuseds favour. In other words, the accused will have to prove not only a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. but also a violation of their fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice.\nIn my opinion, a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., with the result that an accused need only disclose the breach in order to justify appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. The question of whether the error of law was prejudicial to the accused and, if so, to what extent, is important. But this question arises in connection with the application of the curative proviso, and the onus is then on the Crown to persuade the court of appeal that the error was not prejudicial to the accused (Khan, at para. 23; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.238). Before broaching this aspect of the analysis, I will explain why a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. constitutes an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. and not, as the Crown and two of my colleagues suggest, a miscarriage of justice.\nAs I explained above, the jurisprudence establishes that an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. is any error in the application of a legal rule, as long as it is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction and was made by a judge  whether the trial judge, another judge or a justice of the peace. In addition, the error in the application of a legal rule may result from either a decision that is wrong in law or an improper omission. It may also concern a procedural or a substantive legal rule. When these three elements are present, the trial courts judgment is tainted by an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C., which allows prejudice to be presumed and may justify quashing the conviction.\nFailure by the judge before whom the accused first appears to carry out their informational duty under s. 530(3) is an error in the application of a legal rule (Arradi, at para. 39; Khan, at para. 22; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75). By erroneously failing to apply an imperative legal rule of general application, the judge commits what I have termed an improper omission. In addition, because this irregularity is related to the proceedings leading to the conviction and is committed by a judge, it has the effect of tainting the trial courts judgment so as to provide a basis for appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C.\nFinally, although this is not determinative, I think it helpful to note that my conclusion is echoed in the jurisprudence on language rights, in which this Court has stated that a judges failure to take a litigants language rights into account constitutes an error of law (see Mazraani, at para. 48).\nThis conclusion is also supported by the purpose of s. 530, as interpreted and applied in Beaulac. In that case, as I said earlier, this Court reduced the onus on an accused who seeks to exercise their fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice late by stating that a presumption applies in the accuseds favour, and also specified that the Crown bears the burden of rebutting this presumption (paras. 42 and 56). Similarly, characterizing a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. as an error of law reduces the onus on the appellant by triggering a presumption in their favour once the breach has been established, while also giving the Crown an opportunity to rebut the presumption by showing that the appellants fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was not violated.\nThe Court of Appeal was therefore correct to characterize a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. as an error of law. However, it erred in stating that, to succeed on appeal, an accused in the same situation as Mr. Tayo Tompouba must show not only that the breach occurred but also that their fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was violated.\nWhat the Crown Can Show to Have the Appeal Dismissed Nonetheless\nContrary to what Mr. Tayo Tompouba argues, there is nothing that precludes the application of one of the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b) Cr. C., provided that the Crown shows that the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was not violated.\nA breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is an error that results in the court losing jurisdiction over the proceedings (Bessette, at para. 27; Munkonda, at paras. 131-33). The Crown can therefore rely on the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) Cr. C. and try to show that no prejudice was caused by the error (Khan, at para. 16; Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 51.246). Thus, once a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. has been established, the Crown can argue that, notwithstanding this error of law, the appeal should nonetheless be dismissed on the ground that it did not in fact cause prejudice to the accused  in other words, that the error did not result in a violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice. If the Crown succeeds, the presumption that the error of law caused prejudice to the accused is rebutted and the court of appeal hearing the case can apply the curative proviso (see Khan, at para. 16; Coughlan, at pp. 574-75 and 582).\nIt is useful to note three routes that the Crown can take to show that the accuseds fundamental right was not violated and that it is therefore appropriate to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the appellant did not suffer any prejudice as a result of the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. First, the Crown can argue that the appellant does not have sufficient proficiency in the official language they were unable to choose at first instance  in other words, that the appellant does not have the ability to instruct counsel and follow legal proceedings in that language  such that they cannot avail themself of their fundamental right (Beaulac, at para. 34). Second, the Crown can show that, even if the appellant had been duly informed of their right and had sufficient proficiency in the language they were unable to choose, they would in any event have chosen to be tried in the language in which their trial was conducted. Lastly, the Crown can show that the appellant had timely knowledge of their fundamental right otherwise than through notice under s. 530(3) Cr. C., such that it can be concluded that the appellant chose English or French in a free and informed manner. In each case, the applicable standard of proof is that of the balance of probabilities (see R. v. OBrien, 2011 SCC 29, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 485, at para. 34, per Binnie J., dissenting; Esseghaier, at para. 54).\nTo discharge its burden, the Crown can rely on the evidence already in the record or seek leave to adduce fresh evidence. For example, the Crown might seek leave from a court of appeal to file in evidence transcripts from other criminal cases against an English-speaking accused who was tried in English, where the transcripts indicate that the accused does not have sufficient proficiency in French (see R. v. Deutsch (2005), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 361 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 45-47).\nIn this regard, I note that the cardinal principle governing the admissibility of fresh evidence is that of the interests of justice (see s. 683(1) Cr. C.; R. v. Hay, 2013 SCC 61, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 694, at para. 63, quoting Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775; R. v. Sipos, 2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at para. 28). According to Palmer, the discretion to admit fresh evidence is ordinarily exercised by weighing various factors, namely due diligence, relevance, credibility and the impact on the result (see p. 775; Hay, at para. 63; R. v. J.A.A., 2011 SCC 17, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 628, at para. 7). In the rare cases where an accused appeals their conviction and raises a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. for the first time, when no decision on the accuseds language rights was made at first instance, it stands to reason that it will generally be in the interests of justice to admit any evidence that makes it possible to determine whether the accuseds fundamental right was in fact violated.\nIf the Crown fails to show that the accused does not have sufficient proficiency in the language they were unable to choose, that the accused would in any event have chosen to be tried in the language in which their trial was conducted or that the accused chose that official language in a free and informed manner, it will be presumed that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. resulted in a violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice and thus caused the accused prejudice that was too significant for the conviction to be upheld. As Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance have noted, in cases where an error results in a violation of the [translation] fundamental right . . . to be tried by a court that understands the language of the accused, the Crown will not be able to cure the violation through the application of subparagraph 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code (No. 51.246). Indeed, in Beaulac, this Court established that a conviction entered following a hearing in which this fundamental right was breached can never be saved by the application of a curative proviso (see paras. 53-54). The Court of Appeal therefore erred in law in stating that the onus was on Mr. Tayo Tompouba to establish a violation of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice at the stage of the curative proviso analysis, rather than on the Crown to prove the contrary.\nThis Framework Helps Prevent the Risk of Instrumentalization\nIt is apparent from the Court of Appeals reasons that it was particularly concerned about the risk of instrumentalization that might arise from a framework that reduces the onus on an appellant in the same situation as Mr. Tayo Tompouba. Similarly, the Crown opposes any framework under which it would bear the burden of showing that the accuseds fundamental right was not violated in cases where the issue of language rights was not argued at first instance. The Crown submits that, in such cases, there is little if any evidence in the record concerning the appellants language proficiency and the reasons for the delay in their application. The Crown might therefore have difficulty persuading a court of appeal that it would be appropriate to apply the curative proviso. The Crown notes that it is possible that several pieces of evidence that may be relevant to showing that there was no violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice will be known only to the accused and will accordingly be out of its reach, notably as a result of solicitor-client privilege. In short, the Crown argues that if it is required to make this showing for the purposes of the curative proviso analysis, accused persons who were not given notice under s. 530(3) Cr. C. will gain an undue tactical advantage by raising their language right for the first time on appeal.\nIn this regard, like the Court of Appeal, I stress the importance of preventing language rights violations from being instrumentalized on appeal. As this Court stated in Mazraani, it is entirely improper for a party to try to take advantage of a violation of their language rights for purely tactical purposes (paras. 38-39 and 52). Such a practice is objectionable and must be sanctioned as far as possible. That being said, I am of the view that the applicable framework strikes an appropriate balance between the constitutional importance of language rights in Canada and the risk of these rights being instrumentalized on appeal.\nFirst, while a breach of s. 530(3) does not ipso facto entail a violation of the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice, the proposed framework does create a presumption in the accuseds favour that this right was violated if s. 530(3) Cr. C. was breached. As this Court stated in Mazraani, a persons choice with regard to their language rights must be free and informed (paras. 42, 44 and 73). Where the judge, the ultimate guardian of language rights, fails to comply with the mechanism established by Parliament to ensure that this choice is free and informed  that is, the informational duty set out in s. 530(3) Cr. C.  it is entirely legitimate and fair to presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that this purpose has not been achieved.\nNext, the framework laid down permits the Crown, at the stage of the curative proviso analysis, to rebut the presumption that the accuseds fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was violated as a result of the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. If the Crown does so, the appeal can then be dismissed. This significantly limits the risk of language rights being instrumentalized for tactical purposes, because the framework makes it possible for the Crown to impede accused persons seeking to use a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. for purely tactical purposes on appeal. The Crown can oppose, for example, accused persons who do not have sufficient proficiency in the official language they were unable to choose; bilingual accused persons who would in any event have chosen to be tried in the language in which their trial was conducted; and accused persons who had timely knowledge, otherwise than through notice under s. 530(3) Cr. C., of their right to be tried in the official language of their choice, such that it can be concluded that they chose the language of their trial in a free and informed manner.\nIt is, of course, not possible to prevent all risks of abuse. Even given the Crowns ability to adduce fresh evidence, it is impossible to completely avoid appeals in which the Crown will have difficulty showing that the accuseds fundamental right was not in fact violated by the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. In such circumstances, it is possible that accused persons may take advantage on appeal, for purely tactical purposes, of a violation of their language rights that occurred at first instance. Upon reflection, however, these risks and difficulties are tempered by three considerations.\nFirst, the difficulties encountered by the Crown arise only in cases in which the judge did not carry out their informational duty under s. 530(3) Cr. C. Where the judge did carry out that duty, the accused remains free to raise on appeal, for the first time, the violation of their right to be tried in the official language of their choice. The onus will then be on the accused to prove that violation so as to justify appellate intervention at the stage of the analysis under s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. No presumption will apply in the accuseds favour in the absence of a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C.\nSecond, this type of situation can easily be prevented, including by introducing systematic practices to ensure that the informational duty under s. 530(3) Cr. C. is fulfilled in every case, as some provinces have already done (see R. v. Vaillancourt, 2019 ABQB 859, at para. 6ee) (CanLII)). Similarly, the Crown can play an active role in preventing this type of situation by reminding the judge, at the accuseds first appearance, to perform the duty imposed by s. 530(3) Cr. C., as the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal properly noted in MacKenzie, at para. 15(6).\nFinally, the burden imposed on the Crown and the challenges encountered by the Crown in discharging it are no different than those taken on by the Crown at first instance under the Beaulac framework. Where an accused files a late application under s. 530(4) Cr. C. at first instance, a presumption arises in the accuseds favour that the application should be granted (Beaulac, at paras. 42 and 56). The Crown bears the burden of rebutting this presumption (paras. 42, 44 and 56). The Crown then faces the same problem described above, namely that several pieces of evidence that may be useful to it are out of its reach, notably as a result of solicitor-client privilege.\nApplication to This Case\nIt is acknowledged that the judge did not ensure that Mr. Tayo Tompouba was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to the duty set out in s. 530(3) Cr. C. (A.F., at paras. 1 and 9; R.F., at para. 1; C.A. reasons, at para. 13). This constitutes an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. The outcome of the appeal therefore rests on the Crowns ability to show that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. did not result in a violation of Mr. Tayo Tompoubas fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice.\nThe Curative Proviso Can Apply\nMr. Tayo Tompouba argues that the Crown faces an insurmountable obstacle: it expressly informed the Court of Appeal that it was not invoking the curative provisos, which means that the provisos cannot be applied without violating the rule prohibiting a court of appeal from applying them proprio motu. He contends that this fact alone requires the Court to allow his appeal. I disagree.\nAs a general rule, a curative proviso is available on appeal only if raised by the Crown, since a court of appeal may not apply such a proviso of its own motion (Petel, at p. 17). This is a judge-made rule whose purpose is, on the one hand, to prevent the accused from being prejudiced by being deprived of the right to make submissions on the applicability of such a proviso and, on the other, to respect the Crowns exercise of prosecutorial discretion, to which the courts typically show deference (see R. v. Jolivet, 2000 SCC 29, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751, at paras. 46-47; Samaniego, at para. 66; R. v. Cole, 2021 ONCA 759, 158 O.R. (3d) 680, at paras. 154-60).\nAs far as the application of this rule is concerned, it is now well established that the Crown can validly raise the curative proviso implicitly. This is the case, for example, where its submissions in essence amount to arguing that the identified error or irregularity did not in fact cause any prejudice to the accused, as can be seen from the following remarks made by this Court with respect to s. 686(1)(b)(iii) Cr. C.:\n\tAppellate courts may apply the curative proviso if the Crown has implicitly raised it by arguing, in essence, that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred or that the evidence of guilt is so overwhelming such that the verdict would have been the same (R. v. Ajise, 2018 SCC 51, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 301, at para. 1, affg 2018 ONCA 494, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 384, at para. 32; R. v. Cole, 2021 ONCA 759, at paras. 155-58 (CanLII); R. v. Hudson, 2020 ONCA 507, 391 C.C.C. (3d) 208, at para. 49).\n\t(Samaniego, at para. 66)\nThat is precisely the situation in this case. The Crown has always argued that the appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. because there is no evidence in the record from which it can be concluded that his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice was violated. It follows that the question of prejudice, which is at the heart of the analysis on the applicability of the curative proviso, has always been a central question in the appeal, both in the Court of Appeal and in this Court (see Cole, at paras. 156-58, cited in Samaniego, at para. 66). Indeed, I note that the appellant made written submissions to the Court of Appeal on the inapplicability of the curative provisos in this case (A.F. in the C.A., at paras. 49 and 67, reproduced in R.R., at pp. 22 and 26).\nIt is true that the Crown expressly stated that it was not invoking the curative provisos before the Court of Appeal (A.R., vol. III, at p. 155). However, this does not preclude their application. The Crowns statement must be placed in its context. Not invoking the curative provisos before the Court of Appeal was the logical consequence of the arguments that the Crown made on appeal. The Crown maintained that the burden was on the appellant to prove the violation of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice  and not only the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C.  in order to establish the existence of an error warranting appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. That position has the consequence of preventing the application of the curative provisos in s. 686(1)(b) Cr. C., pursuant to Beaulac (para. 54).\nIn this context, no breach of procedural fairness results from the application of the curative proviso. Mr. Tayo Tompoubas failure to adduce fresh evidence in response to the Crowns arguments about the absence of prejudice caused by the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. cannot be interpreted otherwise than as a deliberate tactical choice.\nIn any event, the Crown now expressly asks in its written arguments that the curative proviso be applied (see, e.g., R.F., at para. 112). It follows that any prejudice suffered by Mr. Tayo Tompouba  if there was prejudice  is cured. Moreover, Mr. Tayo Tompouba has made written and oral submissions to this Court to the effect that the curative provisos cannot apply in light of Beaulac or that, even if they apply, the Crown has failed to show an absence of prejudice (A.F., at paras. 46-54 and 80-84).\nThe Crown Has Failed to Show That Mr. Tayo Tompoubas Fundamental Right Was in Fact Respected\nSince I have concluded that the curative proviso can be applied, what must now be decided is whether the Crown has succeeded in showing that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. nevertheless did not result in the violation of Mr. Tayo Tompoubas fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice.\nIt is common ground that Mr. Tayo Tompoubas first language is French and that his linguistic abilities in French are therefore sufficient for him to choose to be tried in that language. To have the curative proviso applied and the appeal dismissed, the Crown accordingly cannot argue that the accused is not proficient in French. Rather, it can try to show either that Mr. Tayo Tompouba would in any event have chosen English as the official language of his trial if he had been duly informed of his right or that he had timely knowledge of his right otherwise than through notice under s. 530(3) Cr. C., such that it can be concluded that he made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English.\nHowever, the evidence is, at best, inconclusive on these questions, which is to say that it does not allow a conclusion to be reached one way or the other on a balance of probabilities. The uncertainty or doubt that remains must be resolved in Mr. Tayo Tompoubas favour and must weigh against the Crown.\nInconclusiveness of the Evidence\nImpact of a Breach of Section 530(3) Cr. C. on the Choice of Official Language\nIt cannot be concluded on a balance of probabilities that, even if he had been duly informed of his fundamental right, Mr. Tayo Tompouba would still have chosen a trial in English. It is true that he communicated in English with various actors in the system, including a bilingual Francophone police officer and his counsel, and that his ability to understand and express himself in English is advanced, such that he did not require interpretation services at first instance. That being said, it cannot be inferred from this that he would have chosen a trial in English if he had been duly informed of his right to have a trial in French, his first language.\nFirst of all, the fact that a bilingual person speaks in the majority language does not necessarily reflect a preference for that language. As this Court explained in Mazraani, [i]ndividuals who are unaware of their language rights could think that they are required to speak in the other official language (para. 44). It should be noted that this was Mr. Tayo Tompoubas first time being arrested, and he stated that he did not know he was in a position to request anything from the police (see A.R., vol. II, at pp. 109 and 122). It is therefore not surprising that he spoke with the bilingual Francophone police officer in English, given the fact that the officer, by his own admission, dealt with him exclusively in English (e.g., voir dire reasons, at para. 12(2), reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 8; see A.R., vol. II, at pp. 74 and 80). Similarly, the fact that Mr. Tayo Tompouba spoke with his counsel in English also does not support an inference that he would have chosen English if he had known that it was possible for his trial to be held in French, particularly in light of his testimony that he was not able to speak with his counsel in French (see A.R, vol. II, at p. 122).\nNext, the fact that Mr. Tayo Tompouba is bilingual is of only limited assistance in determining whether he would have chosen a trial in English if he had been duly informed of his right. Indeed, attaching too much weight to this factor would be contrary to Beaulac, in which the Court cautioned against any analysis tending to restrict the language rights of bilingual Canadians, especially given that official language minorities in fact have the highest incidence of bilingualism (paras. 45-46; see also Mazraani, at para. 20).\nFinally, I note that the appellant stated at the voir dire that he would have preferred to speak with a French-speaking lawyer if given the opportunity (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 109 and 116) and that he had asked to be represented by a French-speaking lawyer but had been told by a legal aid representative that it would be difficult to find one in Kamloops (pp. 109 and 116). These statements were not contradicted by the findings of fact made by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The trial judge simply found that, because of Mr. Tayo Tompoubas level of knowledge of English and the confidence he displayed in that language when he was arrested, there had been no special circumstances imposing an additional duty on the police to ensure that he had an opportunity to exercise his rights in French (voir dire reasons, at paras. 11 and 13).\nAccordingly, the possibility that Mr. Tayo Tompouba would have chosen a trial in French if he had been duly informed of his fundamental right to do so cannot be excluded on a balance of probabilities.\nTimely Knowledge Otherwise Than Through Notice Under Section 530(3) Cr. C.\nIt also cannot be concluded on a balance of probabilities that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had timely knowledge of his fundamental right otherwise than through notice under s. 530(3) Cr. C. and that he therefore chose English as the official language of his trial in a free and informed manner.\nIn this regard, the Crown emphasizes the fact that, prior to his first appearance, Mr. Tayo Tompouba signed an undertaking and a promise to appear that provided notice in writing of his right to a trial in the official language of his choice. However, like the British Columbia Court of Appeal, I am of the view that it cannot be inferred from Mr. Tayo Tompoubas signature on those documents that he had timely knowledge of his fundamental right and that he therefore chose English in a free and informed manner (paras. 9-10 and 125).\nThe circumstances in which those two documents were signed do not make it possible to conclude that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had time to read the language rights notices or that he was in a state of mind to do so. This observation is based on a number of contextual factors: the documents were signed in the presence of at least one police officer while he was under arrest and as a precondition to being released; his language rights were not explained to him at the time the documents were signed (R.R., at pp. 70-71); the undertaking contained only a small notice exclusively in English under the appellants signature (p. 3); the promise to appear had no notice on the page signed by the appellant, as the bilingual notice in question was on the back of the document (pp. 1-2); and the appellants signature was affixed to those two documents not to indicate that he understood his language rights guaranteed in s. 530 Cr. C. but rather to indicate that he understood, first, his undertakings and the sanctions that could be imposed on him if he failed to comply with them and, second, the fact that failure to appear without lawful excuse was a criminal offence.\nIn any case, even if it were to be found that Mr. Tayo Tompouba read the notices at the time he signed the undertaking and the promise to appear, the same circumstances make it impossible to infer that this gave him a sufficient understanding of the nature and scope of his right. As a result, this Court cannot conclude that Mr. Tayo Tompouba had knowledge of his fundamental right otherwise than through notice under s. 530(3) Cr. C. and that his silence at first instance essentially amounts to a free and informed choice to have a trial in English.\nFurthermore, the fact that Mr. Tayo Tompouba was represented by counsel also provides no basis for concluding that he had timely knowledge of his fundamental right. First of all, with regard to the specific circumstances of this case, the assurance given to the court by Mr. Tayo Tompoubas counsel that he would make sure his client was advised that his undertakings were still in effect (C.A. reasons, at para. 12) is of no assistance. As I mentioned earlier, those undertakings, like the appellants signature on the document setting them out, are unrelated to his language rights.\nNext, while it is true, generally speaking, that the presumption of competence of counsel normally makes it possible to assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that counsel complied with their obligations, the legislative intent stands in the way of this presumption when it comes to the language rights provided for in s. 530 Cr. C. For one thing, the 2008 legislative amendments show that Parliament intended to exclude the presumption of competence of counsel. Until that time, a judge was required to inform accused persons of their language rights only if they were not represented by counsel. In 2008, Parliament extended the judges informational duty so that it applied to all accused persons. If a breach of this duty were remedied by the mere presence of counsel, the duty would virtually cease to be compulsory. In addition, Parliament chose not to implicitly incorporate the presumption of competence of counsel into the scheme of s. 530 Cr. C., unlike what it did with respect to guilty pleas. Section 606(1.2) Cr. C. provides that a courts failure to fully inquire whether certain conditions relating to a guilty plea are met does not affect the validity of the plea. If such a failure has no effect on the validity of a guilty plea, it is not because the courts duty is unimportant, but because Parliament believed that the court could legitimately rely on the presumption of competence of counsel. Section 530 Cr. C. contains no provision comparable to s. 606(1.2) Cr. C. that would implicitly incorporate the presumption of competence of counsel. Accordingly, while the fact that an accused was not represented by counsel can ground an inference that the accused was not informed of their language rights under s. 530 Cr. C., the reverse is not true (see Mazraani, at paras. 32 and 52). The legislative intent therefore precludes the court from drawing an inference from the fact that the accused was represented by counsel.\nIn summary, the evidence in the record does not make it possible to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. did not result in a violation of Mr. Tayo Tompoubas fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. Moreover, the accuseds silence on its own cannot support a contrary conclusion here. Although I seriously doubt that this is the case, the evidence in the record also cannot serve to completely rule out the possibility that Mr. Tayo Tompouba is now using the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. for tactical purposes on appeal. It is simply not possible to reach a conclusion one way or the other on this question on a balance of probabilities. It is therefore necessary to determine in whose favour the remaining uncertainty and doubt must be resolved.\nThe Inconclusiveness of the Evidence Must Benefit Mr. Tayo Tompouba\nIn my opinion, the finding that the evidence is inconclusive must weigh against the Crown, because it is the Crown that bears the burden of satisfying the Court on a balance of probabilities that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. did not, however, result in a violation of Mr. Tayo Tompoubas fundamental right (see OBrien, at para. 34; Esseghaier, at para. 54; S. N. Lederman, M. K. Fuerst and H. C. Stewart, Sopinka, Lederman & Bryant: The Law of Evidence in Canada (6th ed. 2022), at 5.66).\nThe fact that the uncertainty and doubt must be resolved in Mr. Tayo Tompoubas favour and must weigh against the Crown is based on the general principles of the law of evidence in cases where the standard of persuasion to be met by the party bearing the persuasive burden is only the civil standard of the balance of probabilities (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 277; see also R. v. Schwartz, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443, at pp. 466-67; on the two possible standards of proof, see D. Watt, Watts Manual of Criminal Evidence (2023), at p. 214; Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart, at 3.16 and 5.64). As P. Roberts states in his book Roberts & Zuckermans Criminal Evidence (3rd ed. 2022):\n\t\t\tThe fact-finder in an adversarial trial is typically invited to select between the competing contentions or narratives advanced by the parties . . . . However, it is conceivable that the fact-finder might regard neither contention as more likely than not; perhaps neither partys case is at all plausible. When this none of the above conclusion occasionally arises in practice the party bearing the [persuasive] burden inevitably loses his case. [p. 246, fn. 28]\nThe fact that the remaining uncertainty and doubt must weigh against the party bearing the persuasive burden when the evidence is inconclusive on a question to be decided on the balance of probabilities standard is also clear from the treatise on evidence of Lederman, Fuerst and Stewart:\n\t\t. . . the persuasive burden does not play a part in the decision-making process if the trier of fact can come to a determinate conclusion on the evidence. If, however, the evidence leaves the trier of fact in a state of uncertainty, the persuasive burden is applied to determine the outcome. [3.16; footnote omitted.]\n\t(See also R. P. Mosteller, McCormick on Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at  336.)\nConclusion\nI am of the view that a breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is an error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) Cr. C. Mr. Tayo Tompouba has therefore succeeded in establishing a ground for appellate intervention under s. 686(1)(a) Cr. C. In keeping with the logic and structure of s. 686 Cr. C., this breach is presumed to have resulted in a violation of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. The burden was on the Crown to rebut this presumption by showing that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. did not in fact cause such prejudice to Mr. Tayo Tompouba. However, the Crown has failed in this regard: the evidence on the question is, at best, inconclusive. In light of the uncertainty and doubt that remain, this Court has no choice but to conclude that the breach of s. 530(3) Cr. C. is an error of law that caused significant prejudice to Mr. Tayo Tompouba. Given this conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide the alternative ground of appeal based on a breach of s. 530(4) Cr. C.\nDisposition\nFor all these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and it is ordered that a new trial be held in French.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tKarakatsanis and Martin JJ.  \nOverview\nLanguage rights are of central importance to Canadian society and have a special place in criminal proceedings. Together, the various parts of s. 530 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, secure a substantive right to a trial in the official language of the accuseds choice  one that, if requested before trial, is absolute (s. 530(1)). Section 530(3) obliges judges, provincial court judges, judges of the Nunavut Court of Justice or justices of the peace (judicial officials) to ensure that accused persons are advised of their right to a trial in French or English when they first appear in court. This informational duty is designed to give the accused timely and necessary information to facilitate the choice of a trial in either official language. No such notice was provided to the appellant, and the main issue before us is what legal consequences flow from non-compliance with s. 530(3) when that breach is asserted for the first time on appeal. \nWe agree that every accused person should be given the full opportunity to exercise their substantive right to a trial in the official language of their choice. We also agree with the Chief Justices review of the fundamental importance of language rights, that they engender positive obligations, that avoiding a breach of s. 530(3) is not difficult, and that courts should implement practices that ensure accused persons are properly informed of their language rights. We differ though in how we classify the irregularity that occurs when s. 530(3) is not followed.  \nOn this question, the timing of the appellants argument has crucial implications for the framework for analysis and the remedies available. The accused was convicted after a trial in English and first raised the breach of s. 530(3) on appeal. If alleged earlier in the proceedings, other approaches may have been possible. At this late juncture, however, the powers of a court of appeal are constrained by the three avenues of review outlined in s. 686 of the Criminal Code. There is no claim of unreasonable verdict here. Two different grounds of appeal are at issue. Section 686(1)(a)(ii) provides that the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, and s. 686(1)(a)(iii) offers a residual category within the grounds set out in s. 686(1)(a) for allowing an appeal based on any other miscarriage of justice. These two categories have their own requirements and burdens of proof. Thus, characterizing the failure to provide the s. 530(3) notice as either a wrong decision on a question of law or a miscarriage of justice on appeal provides different routes to different results.\nThe appellant seeks a new trial simply because a judicial official did not tell him about his right to a trial in the language of his choice. He offered no evidence, either in the court below or in this Court, to show that he was not otherwise aware of his right to a trial in French, and indeed other evidence strongly supports the inference that he had actual notice of this right from other sources. The Chief Justice finds that the mere failure to comply with s. 530(3) is a wrong decision on a question of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii). He concludes that once the appellant shows that the judicial official did not give the required notice, nothing further is required for a new trial, unless the Crown can invoke the curative proviso and show that the appellant suffered no prejudice resulting from the absence of the notice. \nWe take a different view. A breach of the procedural requirement under s. 530(3) to ensure an accused is advised of their substantive language rights is not a ground of a wrong decision on a question of law to set aside the judgment of the trial court under s. 686(1)(a)(ii). This Courts jurisprudence supports the view that a wrong decision on a question of law occurs only when there is an error on a question of law contained in a decision that is attributable to the trial judge. Such an incorrect legal decision presumptively causes a miscarriage of justice because it would ordinarily affect the judgment of the trial court. While most errors on appeal fall into this category, it does not apply to a breach of s. 530(3) when the claimed irregularity is that a judicial official has failed to provide the required statutory notice to the accused at their first appearance. Rather, that failure is an error that precedes the trial, does not logically undermine the correctness of the judgment itself, and falls outside s. 686(1)(a)(ii). \nFor the reasons that follow, we conclude that the failure to give notice under s. 530(3) falls within the residual category under s. 686(1)(a)(iii), meaning the appellant must establish a miscarriage of justice before a remedy can be granted. Like the British Columbia Court of Appeal, we conclude that in order to establish a miscarriage of justice the appellant was required to show that the lack of notice required by s. 530(3) had some effect on the exercise of his right, that is, that he was unaware of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice. In order to make out a breach of their substantive language rights on appeal, an appellant must provide evidence, which may be by way of an affidavit, stating that they were unaware of the right to choose to be tried in the other official language and that the option of a trial in that language was a viable choice. \nAppellants who raise a breach of s. 530(3) for the first time on appeal must demonstrate that the breach in fact deprived them of the knowledge necessary to exercise their right to a trial in the language of their choice. If they cannot  or will not  do so, they will have failed to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice occurred. In our view, it would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice if an appellant who knew of their language rights, but waited until after they were convicted to raise non-compliance with the s. 530(3) notice, nevertheless received a new trial on this basis. \nAccordingly, we would dismiss the appeal. \nAnalysis\nWe first describe the language rights regime in s. 530 and the appellate powers in s. 686 of the Criminal Code, before turning to the key issues: (1) whether a failure to comply with s. 530(3) breaches a substantive or procedural right; (2) whether that breach is a wrong decision on a question of law or a miscarriage of justice; and (3) the burden on the appellant when raising a s. 530(3) violation for the first time on appeal. Finally, we address the appellants alternative argument based on an alleged breach of s. 530(4).\nSection 530 of the Criminal Code\nLanguage plays an essential role . . . in human existence, development and dignity. It is through language that we are able to form concepts; to structure and order the world around us (Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 744). As both a tool for communication and as a marker of our cultural identity, language lets us form, embrace, and inhabit communities, and describe, delineate, and fulfill the rights and duties we hold toward one another in society (see L. Green, Are Language Rights Fundamental? (1987), 25 Osgoode Hall L.J. 639, at p. 659). \nThe relationship between the two official languages of Canada, French and English, is of central and particular significance to Canadian history, culture, and law. This Court has recognized that language rights are not negative rights, or passive rights; they can only be enjoyed if the means are provided (R. v. Beaulac, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 768, at para. 20). Where the state proceeds against an individual with charges of a criminal offence, Part XVII of the Criminal Code provides such means. It offers a comprehensive system whereby an accused may apply for and receive a trial in which all facets of the proceedings are conducted in the official language of their choice. \nSection 530 is the aspect of this system at issue in this appeal. At the time of the appellants first appearance, the relevant parts of this provision read:\n530 (1) On application by an accused whose language is one of the official languages of Canada, made not later than\n\n(a) the time of the appearance of the accused at which his trial date is set . . .\n\n(b) the time of the accuseds election . . . or\n\n(c) the time when the accused is ordered to stand trial . . .\n\na justice of the peace, . . . or judge . . . shall grant an order directing that the accused be tried before a justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official language of Canada that is the language of the accused or, if the circumstances warrant, who speak both official languages of Canada.\n\n(3) The justice of the peace or provincial court judge before whom an accused first appears shall ensure that they are advised of their right to apply for an order under subsection (1) or (2) and of the time before which such an application must be made.\n\n(4) Where an accused fails to apply for an order under subsection (1) or (2) and the justice of the peace, provincial court judge or judge before whom the accused is to be tried, in this Part referred to as the court, is satisfied that it is in the best interests of justice that the accused be tried before a justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury who speak the official language of Canada that is the language of the accused or, if the language of the accused is not one of the official languages of Canada, the official language of Canada in which the accused, in the opinion of the court, can best give testimony, the court may, if it does not speak that language, by order remand the accused to be tried by a justice of the peace, provincial court judge, judge or judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak that language or, if the circumstances warrant, who speak both official languages of Canada.\nSubsection (1) grants an accused the substantive right to a trial in their official language of choice. Provided the application is made within the stipulated timeframe, this right is absolute: the judicial official must grant the order (Beaulac, at paras. 31 and 37). This subsection places a positive obligation on the state to be institutionally bilingual in all criminal matters, and to facilitate the exercise of the accuseds substantive right to be tried in either French or English by a judge, jury, and prosecutor who speak that language (paras. 20, 34 and 56; see also M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2023 (30th ed. 2023), at No. 9.73).\nEven when an application is not made in a timely manner, s. 530(4) allows a judicial official the discretion to remand the accused to be tried in the official language of their choice if they are satisfied that it is in the best interests of justice to do so. Crucially for our purposes, in Beaulac, this Court directed that, when considering whether it would be in the best interests of justice to make this order, the reasons for the delay are a relevant factor: i.e. when the accused learned of their language rights, whether they waived the right and later changed their mind, and why they may have changed their mind. Other relevant factors that relate to the conduct of the trial include whether the accused were represented by counsel who could have advised them of their language rights, and whether a trial that may have begun would need to start afresh (paras. 37-38). The fairness of the trial is not a factor (para. 41).\nFor its part, subsection (3) exists to make sure an accused is aware of their language rights and can bring their application for a trial in their official language of choice in a timely manner (see Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at No. 9.73). This provision does not require the accused to present themselves as a speaker of a different official language or to take any initiative to insist that their language rights be respected, instead placing the duty upon the judicial official to make sure they are advised of their rights (see R. v. MacKenzie, 2004 NSCA 10, 181 C.C.C. (3d) 485, at para. 12; R. v. Munkonda, 2015 ONCA 309, 126 O.R. (3d) 646, at para. 62; Dhingra v. R., 2021 QCCA 1681, 408 C.C.C. (3d) 466, at para. 49).\nSection 530 thus functions as an integrated system, with the ultimate object being to facilitate the accuseds substantive right to a trial in their official language (see Beaulac, at para. 31; see also Bessette v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 31, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 535, at para. 38). Yet, as we explain, each aspect of this system performs a distinct function  and a failure to abide by each has distinct consequences on appeal.\nSection 686 of the Criminal Code\nThe powers available on an appeal from conviction are purely statutory. A court of appeal may only allow an appeal based on irregularities that fit within the grounds set out exhaustively in s. 686 of the Criminal Code, no matter how injurious they may have been (R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 29; see also R. v. W. (G.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 597, at para. 8).\nThe relevant portions of s. 686 state:\n686 (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction . . ., the court of appeal\n\n(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that\n\n(i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,\n\n(ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, or\n\n(iii) on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice;\n\n(b) may dismiss the appeal where\n\n(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred . . . .\nThe proper classification of an irregularity that occurred during a criminal proceeding thus governs what the appellant must prove, what the court of appeal can do once it has been proven, and whether the court could dismiss the appeal despite it being proven. That said, it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether an error should fall into one category or another (R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at para. 63, per LeBel J., concurring; see also paras. 6-7, per Arbour J.; R. v. Arradi, 2003 SCC 23, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 280, at paras. 38-39; S. Coughlan, Criminal Procedure (4th ed. 2020), at p. 574). It may arise that an error in the proceedings leads to neither an unreasonable verdict, nor a wrong decision on a question of law, nor a miscarriage of justice  in which case it would remain an error, but one without legal effect (Jaw, at para. 29). \nIn most cases, there is no need to debate the characterization of an error because the jurisprudence has settled the question. Legal scholars often simply define the categories by reference to examples of errors that have been identified as falling under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) or (iii) (see, e.g., Coughlan, at pp. 574-77; S. Penney, V. Rondinelli and J. Stribopoulos, Criminal Procedure in Canada (3rd ed. 2022), at 18.10; J. Sopinka, M. A. Gelowitz and W. D. Rankin, Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin on the Conduct of an Appeal (5th ed. 2022), at pp. 289-96). But where the question is not settled, as in this case, we must turn to first principles.\nThe language and structure of s. 686(1) indicate that appeals against conviction are fundamentally concerned with preventing miscarriages of justice. This is the common purpose animating the three grounds on which a court may allow the appeal and quash the conviction (R. v. Sinclair, 2011 SCC 40, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 76, per Charron J., concurring, citing R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 219; see also Coughlan, at pp. 567 and 574; Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin, at p. 289; T. Desjardins, Lappel en droit criminel et penal (2nd ed. 2012), at No. 419). Simply put, [a] conviction which is the product of a miscarriage of justice cannot stand (Sinclair (2011), at para. 76, quoting Morrissey, at p. 219). A miscarriage of justice under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) necessarily falls into this category, as does an unreasonable verdict under s. 686(1)(a)(i). A wrong decision on a question of law presumptively falls into this category  unless the Crown can prove otherwise through the application of the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) (Morrissey, at p. 219; Coughlan, at p. 574). \nWhen read as a whole, s. 686(1) makes it clear that the specific ground under which a conviction can be set aside dictates the applicable burden of proof and what the appellant or Crown is required to establish. When a particular error is characterized under s. 686(1)(a)(i) or (iii), the appellant bears the burden of establishing that it resulted in an unreasonable verdict or a miscarriage of justice and, once proven, the Crown is not able to rebut this and the court of appeal must quash the conviction and either order a new trial or enter an acquittal. However, where the error is characterized as a wrong decision on a question of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), this raises a presumption that this caused a miscarriage of justice which the Crown can only rebut by satisfying its burden under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) to show that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred, because the error was trivial or the evidence was so overwhelming that a conviction was inevitable (Khan, at paras. 28-31; R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para. 25; R. v. Abdullahi, 2023 SCC 19, at para. 33).\nApart from appeals based on an allegation of an unreasonable verdict, most matters that are brought as grounds of appeal against conviction in criminal cases are characterized as errors of law within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(ii) (Khan, at para. 25). Once again, this is clear from s. 686(1) itself: since all wrong decisions on a question of law presumptively cause a miscarriage of justice, the distinct classification of a miscarriage of justice in s. 686(1)(a)(iii) must function as a residual category to catch errors not caught by the previous two subparagraphs (Khan, at paras. 17-18, per Arbour J., and at para. 61, per LeBel J.; Arradi, at para. 38; Fanjoy v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233, at pp. 238-40; Coughlan, at pp. 574-77; Desjardins, at No. 419). In both cases the appellant bears the burden of proving the error; but if an error is not a wrong decision on a question of law, which presumptively causes a miscarriage of justice unless the Crown can prove otherwise, then the error must fall into the residual miscarriage of justice clause and the appellant bears the burden of proving that the error caused their trial to be unfair or to have the appearance of unfairness such that it would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice (R. v. Kahsai, 2023 SCC 20, at paras. 5 and 67-68; R. v. Davey, 2012 SCC 75, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 828, at paras. 50-51; see also Coughlan, at p. 574).\nWe turn first to s. 686(1)(a)(ii), which is the most common ground of appeal. Based on the explicit wording of s. 686(1), and this Courts jurisprudence, in our view, a wrong decision on a question of law relating to the judgment of the trial court occurs when there is an error: (1) on a question of law; (2) in a decision; (3) that is attributable to the trial court. Errors that share these three criteria ordinarily render the verdict of the trial court unsafe and presumptively cause a miscarriage of justice such that the judgment should be set aside (Khan, at paras. 22, 27 and 88; Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at 18.9; Coughlan, at p. 574). These components are reflected in the jurisprudence and the text of s. 686(1)(a)(ii): the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law . . . .\nFirst, there must be a question of law. As noted in Khan (at para. 17) and Fanjoy (at pp. 238-40), if the irregularity alleged is one of fact or of mixed fact and law, it cannot fall within s. 686(1)(a)(ii) (see also R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para. 47; Coughlan, at p. 577; Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at 18.14; Desjardins, at Nos. 396 and 419). Although the difference between a pure question of law and a question of mixed law and fact is admittedly far from self-evident (R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 19; see also R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at p. 181; Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin, at pp. 227-28), it is a question of mixed fact and law if the appellate court must make new findings of fact based on fresh evidence to determine whether a legal error occurred. Three examples are reflected in the case law: the assessment of whether a guilty plea was voluntary, unequivocal, and informed (see, e.g., R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696; Adgey v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426; R. v. Bamsey, [1960] S.C.R. 294); the determination of whether the accuseds defence counsel at trial offered ineffective assistance (see, e.g., R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520); and when raised for the first time on appeal, whether an accuseds election as to the mode of trial was uninformed (see, e.g., R. v. White, 2022 SCC 7). If the facts needed to decide the appeal are not within the record, and the court of appeal cannot simply determine if an error of law occurred from the facts as found by the trial judge but must act as a court of first instance for the issue, then the question before the appellate court is a question of mixed fact and law and cannot fall under s. 686(1)(a)(ii).\nSecond, there must be a wrong decision. As noted in Khan, the error being alleged on appeal must arise from a decision of the trial judge which, in the context of the trial and the circumstances in which the decision was made, represented an erroneous interpretation or application of the law (para. 22; see also paras. 7 and 17; Coughlan, at pp. 575-76; Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at 18.9). While this component is very broad and can include any decision at trial (Khan, at para. 22), there must be some decision; where there is no decision, it could be said that no error of law is alleged (para. 17). In such cases the trial record would contain no application of a legal standard to findings of fact. Therefore, rather than having a decision to review for error, the appellate court must assess whether there was a miscarriage of justice  in other words, whether the accuseds trial was unfair or had the appearance of unfairness  in light of the absence of any decision on the matter.\nFor example, where a jury is improperly provided with unedited transcripts of the trial, the trial judges decision regarding whether to order a mistrial would be a decision capable of falling under s. 686(1)(a)(ii); but where the irregularity was not brought to the trial judges attention and therefore they made no decision about it, the court of appeal must consider the facts of the trial in light of the relevant legal principles and decide for itself whether the accuseds trial was unfair such that a miscarriage of justice occurred (Khan, at paras. 7 and 17). In the same way, where the accused asserts for the first time on appeal that their guilty plea was invalid or their counsel was ineffective, the court of appeal cannot assess whether the trial judges decision was based on the correct legal principles when no decision was made, but must instead make the decision itself (see, e.g., Wong; G.D.B.). The absence of any decision at trial on the particular irregularity being alleged on appeal means that it cannot be assessed as a wrong decision under s. 686(1)(a)(ii). Rather, it would fall to the appellant to show a miscarriage of justice under the residual ground of appeal in s. 686(1)(a)(iii). \nThird, this wrong legal decision must be attributable to the trial judge  as it is the judgment of the trial court that must be set aside. Where the trial judge had the opportunity to avoid or remedy the error through the correct application of the relevant legal principles, but failed to do so through their own erroneous understanding or interpretation of the law, this error may fall under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) (see Khan, at paras. 7 and 22; Coughlan, at pp. 574-76; Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at 18.9; Desjardins, at No. 405). When this occurs, there is a logical connection between the trial judges wrong decision on a question of law and the judgment of the trial court such that it should be set aside because the error would ordinarily render the verdict unsafe. The erroneous legal decision in such circumstances has obviously . . . contributed to the ultimate verdict so as to give rise to this presumption (Khan, at para. 22; see also Morrissey, at p. 219; Coughlan, at pp. 574-76). The burden would then shift to the Crown to prove that, on the particular facts of the case, the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice by showing that the error did not affect the ultimate verdict or that, notwithstanding the error, the conviction was inevitable because the evidence was overwhelming (see Khan, at paras. 28-31; Sarrazin, at para. 25; Abdullahi, at para. 33).\nFor example, in Khan, the trial judge had the chance to order a mistrial after the issue of the unedited transcripts was brought to her attention, so any errors in her decision on this matter could be attributable to her even though the irregularity originated outside the trial (para. 17). Similarly, in R. v. Litchfield, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333, an erroneous pre-trial division and severance order had been made before the trial by a preliminary hearing judge, but because the trial judge was aware of this error and had the opportunity to fix it, the wrong legal decision not to strike the order could be attributed to the trial judge and thus fall under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) (pp. 349-50). It would be the same where a trial judge had the chance to remedy an erroneous pre-trial evidentiary ruling, but made the wrong legal decision to proceed as if they were bound by the order (see R. v. R.V., 2019 SCC 41, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 237, at para. 83).\nConversely, where irregularities have occurred outside the trial judges knowledge, with no opportunity to remedy them, any ensuing prejudice must instead be assessed under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) (see, e.g., Khan, at para. 17; Davey, at paras. 5-6; R. v. Yumnu, 2012 SCC 73, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 777, at paras. 5 and 14-15). Where the wrong legal decision cannot be attributed to the trial judge, there is no logical connection between this decision and the judgment of the trial court, and no presumption that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. In such a case, the appellant must present evidence as to the effect of the error on the fairness of the trial. \nPrevious errors that this Court has characterized as being wrong decision[s] on a question of law demonstrate how these three components must be satisfied for an appeal to fall under s. 686(1)(a)(ii). These include breaches of the accuseds constitutional rights, such as where the trial judge fails to allow the accused their right to an interpreter (R. v. Tran, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951); cases where the trial judge has erroneously included or excluded evidence, or otherwise limited its effect based on a wrong legal principle (see, e.g., Wildman v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311; R. v. Jolivet, 2000 SCC 29, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751; R. v. Cyr-Langlois, 2018 SCC 54, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 456; R. v. Trochym, 2007 SCC 6, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239; R. v. OBrien, 2011 SCC 29, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 485); errors in jury instructions (see, e.g., Abdullahi; R. v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37; R. v. McKenna, 2015 SCC 63, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1087; R. v. Rodgerson, 2015 SCC 38, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 760; R. v. Mack, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3; R. v. Dorfer, 2011 SCC 50, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 366; R. v. Van, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716; R. v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144; R. v. Menard, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 109; R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320; R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314; R. v. G. (R.M.), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 362; R. v. Hebert, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 272; R. v. Brydon, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 253; R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599; R. v. Romeo, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 86; R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345); and errors made by the trial judge in incorrectly instructing themselves about an element of the offence or defence at issue (R. v. Zora, 2020 SCC 14, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 3; R. v. MacGillivray, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 890). \nIn each of these cases, there is a direct logical connection between the wrong decision by the trial judge on a question of law, and the judgment of the trial court. Such errors of law cast doubt on the fairness of the trial, the integrity of the administration of justice, or both  raising a presumption that a miscarriage of justice resulted unless the Crown can prove otherwise. Where an error does not amount to a wrong decision on a question of law by the trial judge, there is no presumption that a miscarriage of justice arose, unless additional evidence is offered by the appellant to show that this was the effect of the error. If the court of appeal is to have any power to intervene, the error must fall within the residual category of s. 686(1)(a)(iii) as a miscarriage of justice, where the burden of proof is on the appellant not only to prove the error but to show that it caused a miscarriage of justice.\nIt is clear from the wording of s. 686(1)(a)(iii) that it is a residual category, meant to include any ground that results in a miscarriage of justice. Generally, courts have grouped miscarriages of justice under two categories: the irregularity either renders the trial unfair, or creates the appearance of unfairness such that the integrity of the administration of justice is at risk (Davey, at para. 51, quoting R. v. Wolkins, 2005 NSCA 2, 229 N.S.R. (2d) 222, at para. 89; Kahsai, at paras. 67-69; Khan, at para. 69; Fanjoy, at p. 240; Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin, at p. 293; S. Coughlan and A. Gorlewski, The Anatomy of Criminal Procedure: A Visual Guide to the Law (2019), at p. 331; Penney, Rondinelli and Stribopoulos, at 18.14). \nThough not an exhaustive list, this Court has recognized a number of miscarriages of justice falling under s. 686(1)(a)(iii). These include matters such as misapprehensions of evidence (see, e.g., R. v. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, at para. 1; R. v. Smith, 2021 SCC 16, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 530, at para. 2; see also Coughlan, at pp. 576-77), and reasonable apprehension of bias (see, e.g., R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484; R. v. Curragh Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537; see also Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin, at p. 295). However, a miscarriage of justice can also include matters entirely outside of the trial judges awareness, including irregularities involving the jury where the trial judge made no decision on the matter (Khan, at para. 7; Davey; Yumnu), and allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel (see, e.g., G.D.B.). Where a self-represented accused alleges that they received inadequate assistance from the trial judge, the appellant must show that the lack of assistance caused their trial to be unfair or to have the appearance of unfairness (see, e.g., Kahsai; see also R. v. D.R.S., 2018 ABCA 342, 368 C.C.C. (3d) 383).\nSignificantly, errors that deprive the accused of a chance to make a meaningful choice in the exercise of their rights, thus creating the appearance of unfairness or harming the publics perception of the administration of justice, have been found to fall within s. 686(1)(a)(iii) (see Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin, at pp. 295-96). As discussed above, these issues can involve questions of mixed fact and law. Where the trial judge fails in their mandatory obligation to ensure that an accuseds guilty plea is informed, pursuant to s. 606(1.1), it may be a miscarriage of justice under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) if the appellant presents evidence of subjective prejudice (see, e.g., Wong, at para. 6; R. v. Miller, 2011 NBCA 52, 374 N.B.R. (2d) 302, at paras. 6-7; R. v. Sunshine, 2016 SKCA 104, 484 Sask. R. 259, at para. 15). Whether an accused is deprived of the chance to make a meaningful election as to their mode of trial is also a question of mixed fact and law, and thus must be resolved under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) as opposed to s. 686(1)(a)(ii) (White, at paras. 2 and 4-5). Where an accused had the right to peremptory challenges in jury selection, but was deprived of the chance to meaningfully exercise that right due to irregularities with the jury panel outside the trial judges knowledge, this error cannot be attributed to the trial judge (see Davey, at para. 64; Yumnu, at para. 17). Crucially, since such errors do not presumptively render the verdict of the trial court unsafe, the burden is on the appellant in each case to show that a miscarriage of justice occurred.\nWe stress, again, that s. 686(1)(a)(iii) is a residual category by design. Despite involving a substantial range of legal situations and subject matter, all of the cases discussed above were resolved under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) because they do not fit within the far narrower parameters of s. 686(1)(a)(ii), which requires a wrong decision on a question of law made by the trial judge. In turn, if the appellant is unable to show that an alleged error fits under subparas. (i), (ii) or (iii), this may indeed be an error, but it is one without legal effect  a court of appeal cannot remedy an error that had no consequence.\nWith these principles in mind, we turn now to the specific error alleged in this case: non-compliance with s. 530(3) of the Criminal Code.\nCharacterizing the Right in Section 530(3)\nThe distinction between irregularities that are characterized as wrong decision[s] on a question of law and those that fall within the residual category of miscarriage[s] of justice is fundamental (Arradi, at para. 38). It is equally important to properly characterize the right (and the legal provision) that was allegedly breached. Not all legal protections are treated the same, and the breach of one may be far more likely to cause a miscarriage of justice than another, thus triggering the presumption at the heart of a wrong decision on a question of law.\nAs we noted above, s. 530(1) provides an absolute statutory right to a trial in ones official language if requested within the appropriate timeframe (Beaulac, at para. 31; Bessette, at para. 38). This Court has held that a right to a trial in the accuseds official language is a substantive right and not a procedural one that can be interfered with (Beaulac, at para. 28; see also Mazraani v. Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc., 2018 SCC 50, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 261, at para. 20). \nBy contrast, s. 530(3) does not itself provide the accused with a right to a trial in their official language of choice. Section 530 functions as an integrated system that, as a whole, facilitates the exercise of that right: ss. 530(1) and 530(4) secure the right in either absolute or discretionary terms, depending on the timing of the application, while s. 530(3) ensures the accused has the knowledge they require to make such an application if they wish. On its own, however, s. 530(3) provides the accused with nothing more than knowledge of the right to choose  knowledge that the accused may obtain from sources other than the judicial official at their first appearance. In other words, while a trial in the accuseds official language of choice is the en[d] which the administration of justice seeks to attain, notice as to the availability of such a trial is simply the vehicle providing the means and instruments by which that end is attained (R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, at para. 94, quoting Sutt v. Sutt, [1969] 1 O.R. 169 (C.A.), at p. 175; see also Angus v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co., [1988] 2 S.C.R. 256, at p. 265).\nThis distinction between the substantive right to a trial in ones official language and the procedural right to be informed of that option is important when properly characterizing the error that arises when a judicial official fails to fulfill their obligation under s. 530(3). A trial judge who improperly refuses an application under s. 530(1), or improperly denies a late application under s. 530(4), makes a wrong decision on a question of law that breaches the accuseds substantive right to be tried in the official language of their choice, harming the administration of justice  and presumptively resulting in a miscarriage of justice (Beaulac, at para. 54). Such errors would properly fall within s. 686(1)(a)(ii) on appeal (para. 53). On the other hand, where a judicial official fails to ensure that the accused is informed of their right to a trial in their official language of choice, it does not necessarily follow that the accused was deprived of their substantive right to choose. The accused may already know of this right in advance, or may learn of it through other means after the first appearance but within the timeframe to make an application, and the breach of s. 530(3) may have no effect at all on the accuseds substantive right.\nMoreover, since the breach of this procedural right does not necessarily result in a breach of the substantive right, without additional evidence from the accused on this point, it does not give rise to a presumption that this error has led to a miscarriage of justice. We agree that s. 530(3) is an important tool for the fulfillment of an accuseds language rights (see Chief Justices reasons, at para. 45). However, the importance of the informational obligation at the accuseds first appearance cannot, in itself, transform the notice obligation in s. 530(3) into a substantive right. As we discuss below, nor does it necessarily transform the failure of the judicial official at the first appearance to abide by that obligation into a wrong decision on a question of law.\nCharacterizing Non-Compliance With Section 530(3)\nWe do not accept that a failure to comply with s. 530(3) qualifies as a trial judges wrong decision on a question of law within s. 686(1)(a)(ii) or that it necessarily causes a breach of the accuseds substantive right to a trial in their official language of choice. A breach of s. 530(3) does not give rise to a question of law alone, nor does it concern a decision by a trial judge. Accordingly, unlike other errors of law recognized under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), a breach of s. 530(3) fails to give rise to a presumption that the error has caused a miscarriage of justice. In our view, non-compliance with s. 530(3) is properly considered under the residual category in s. 686(1)(a)(iii)  in which case the appellant bears the burden of showing that the error actually caused a miscarriage of justice. \nFirst, a failure to comply with s. 530(3) does not give rise to a question of law alone. Additional evidence may be necessary in order to understand whether an error occurred, which typically converts such errors into questions of mixed fact and law (Khan, at para. 25; Fanjoy, at pp. 238-40; Sopinka, Gelowitz and Rankin, at p. 302; Desjardins, at No. 439). Section 530(3) requires a judicial official to ensure that the accused is advised of their right to a trial in the official language of choice  but such assurance could come in many forms, including a standard advertisement which the judicial official ensures that the court clerk reads at the start of all proceedings, documents distributed to accused persons in both official languages at the judicial officials direction, and other methods at the courts discretion sufficient to advise all accused persons based on the needs of the community it serves. A finding of non-compliance with s. 530(3) on appeal, in turn, would ordinarily require fresh evidence and findings to determine not only whether the judicial official personally informed the accused of their language rights on the record, but also whether they did enough to ensure that the accused had been informed in some other way. \nSecond, a breach of s. 530(3) is not a wrong decision by a trial judge. Non-compliance with s. 530(3) is not attributable to the trial judge. It arises outside the trial process without the trial judge making any ruling on this point. While the question of when a trial officially begins is a vexed one which does not need to be answered on this appeal (see, e.g., Litchfield), the judicial officials failure to advise the accused of their language rights at their first appearance clearly occurs outside the trial. Importantly, the text of s. 530(3) also clearly indicates that the failure to abide by the obligation can be committed by a justice of the peace  who, in criminal cases, cannot be the trial judge. If this error had been brought to the trial judges attention, who then failed to correct it through the discretionary order available to them within s. 530(4), then this may amount to a wrong decision (see Beaulac, at paras. 9-11). Other pre-trial errors which the trial judge knowingly fails to correct have been found to be wrong decision[s] on a question of law by this same reasoning (see, e.g., Litchfield, at pp. 349-50; R.V., at para. 83). However, on its own, and including in this case, non-compliance with s. 530(3) is clearly not an error made by the trial judge: . . . when the issue had not been raised at trial and therefore the trial judge had made no ruling on it, it could be said that no error of law is alleged . . . (Khan, at para. 17; see also para. 7).\nNon-compliance with s. 530(3) therefore fails to meet the criteria that typically characterize errors of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii). We would add that in other cases where the Criminal Code imposes a mandatory obligation on a judicial official to ensure that the accused can make a meaningful choice as to the exercise of their substantive rights, the judicial officials failure to do so is only of consequence on appeal if the accused can prove it had some effect  namely, that they did not know about the proper exercise of their substantive right and were prejudiced as a result (Wong, at paras. 33-35; White, at paras. 8-9). The appellate court cannot simply presume that the breach of the obligation necessarily led to a breach of the substantive right. \nFor these reasons, a breach of the informational obligation within s. 530(3) cannot be a wrong decision on a question of law within s. 686(1)(a)(ii). If the court of appeal is to have any power to intervene, this breach must fall within the residual category of a miscarriage of justice in s. 686(1)(a)(iii). The burden is thus on the appellant to establish that this error deprived them of their substantive right to a trial in their official language of choice, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Further evidence from the accused is required for an appellate court to draw that connection. Whether a miscarriage of justice occurred in this context will depend on whether the accused already knew of their right to a trial in English or French, or learned of it through other means: either prior to the first appearance, or only later but in time to make an application under s. 530(1) or (4). \nThe Evidentiary Burden on the Appellant\nThis results in another key point of departure from the reasons of the majority. The Chief Justice concludes (at para. 82) that, to make out a breach of their substantive right to a trial in either official language, all that is required of an appellant is to show that s. 530(3) was not complied with  thereby shifting the evidentiary burden almost entirely to the Crown within the scope of the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b). In our view, that is not enough. Evidence from the appellant must be required to show that non-compliance with s. 530(3) had an actual consequence on their right to choose the language at trial: the accused must establish they did not otherwise know they had that choice. \nThe language rights s. 530 of the Criminal Code protects are undoubtedly important. Their importance, however, does not mean that any breach, even of a procedural or notice requirement, should result in a near-automatic right to a new trial when raised for the first time on appeal. Nor should appellants be relieved of demonstrating that the lack of notice under s. 530(3) was consequential and actually deprived them of knowledge of their right to trial in the official language of their choice. In other contexts involving fundamental rights, it is not sufficient for the appellant to merely prove that a right has been violated  even if the alleged violation could ostensibly have had devastating impacts on the fairness of the trial or on the integrity of the accuseds conviction. \nFor example, the constitutionally entrenched right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is fundamental to the very workings of our criminal justice system and ensures all accused are able to meaningfully respond to the charges. The right to counsel allows a person to be informed of their rights and obligations under the law so that they can obtain advice as to how to exercise them (R. v. Manninen, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233, at pp. 1242-43; R. v. Sinclair, 2010 SCC 35, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 310, at para. 26). Though not precisely analogous to s. 530(3), both provisions are designed to empower the accused with information that enables them to make a meaningful choice as to how the criminal proceedings against them will unfold. Yet this Court has never shied away from the reality that the right to counsel is not absolute; there is a correlative duty on the detainee to invoke their right to counsel and be duly diligent in exercising it (R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173). Given that this duty is imposed even at the pre-trial stage, it should therefore be no surprise that arguments based on breaches of s. 10(b) Charter rights are often not entertained at all if raised for the first time on appeal. If the appellant does wish to make such an argument, at the very least they must lay a proper evidentiary foundation (see, e.g., R. v. Lewis, 2007 ONCA 349, 86 O.R. (3d) 46, at paras. 16-28; R. v. Luu, 2021 ONCA 311, 488 C.R.R. (2d) 225, at para. 23). \nWhile again in a different legal context, the burden placed on an appellant who seeks to have their guilty plea set aside, despite the trial judges statutory obligation to ensure it was properly informed, is also instructive. In pleading guilty and waiving their right to a trial on the merits, the accused surrenders a constitutional protection that lies at the very heart of the criminal law and animates all aspects of a criminal justice system in a free and democratic society: the presumption of innocence (R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at pp. 119-20). A guilty plea that was not voluntary, unequivocal, or informed raises concerns about wrongful conviction. Yet an accused who seeks to withdraw that plea after the conviction is entered still bears the burden of establishing subjective prejudice, including the rather high bar of showing that, had they been properly informed, there is a reasonable possibility that they would have chosen differently (Wong, at para. 19). \nThe importance of the substantive right that underlies s. 530 therefore provides no basis to relieve the appellant of any meaningful evidentiary burden when asserting a s. 530(3) violation for the first time on appeal. With respect, the importance of a right also has little bearing on whether an error is classified as a wrong decision on a question of law or a miscarriage of justice. While we agree with the Chief Justices emphasis on the importance of the constitutional interests that underlie s. 530 as a whole, it is also crucial to remember that s. 530(3) is a statutory notice provision. It is not, in itself, a constitutional right. Even appellants asserting breaches of rights that are explicitly protected by our Charter are subject to a heightened evidentiary burden when raising those rights for the first time on appeal. \nFinally, the structure of s. 530 as a whole illustrates that the longer the proceedings go on, the more likely it is that an accuseds request to be tried in their language of choice will not be granted. While s. 530(1) renders the right to a trial in either English or French absolute if requested not later than the first appearance, the election, or committal for trial, depending on the case (shall grant an order), s. 530(4) subjects that right to the discretion of the trial judge if the application is not made within that timeframe (may ... order; see Beaulac, at paras. 37-38). Surely, an accused who does not raise the issue of their language rights until only after their trial is completed  and they have been convicted  should bear some evidentiary burden beyond merely pointing to s. 530(3) non-compliance in order to receive a new trial. \nIn sum, the appellant must do more beyond simply pointing to the judicial officials failure to inform them of their language rights at the first appearance. In order to justify appellate intervention, we would require an appellant raising a s. 530(3) violation for the first time on appeal to submit an affidavit attesting that they were unaware of their right to a trial in their own official language and that the option of a trial in that other language was a viable choice (see Beaulac, at para. 34). Since a breach of s. 530(3) deprives an unknowing accused of the ability to make a meaningful choice, the appellant need not state in this affidavit that they would have chosen a trial in the other official language had they been properly informed. However  obviously  an accused who raises this breach on appeal must seek a new trial in the other official language. Otherwise, no miscarriage of justice will have occurred. \nThis burden is not onerous, and for good reason. It is tailored to the fundamental importance of language rights in this country and the miscarriage of justice that occurs if an appellant, who truly does not know of their language rights, is deprived of their substantive right to choose a trial in the other official language. In the context of late applications under s. 530(4), trial judges are already required to consider, foremost, the reasons for the delay  which includes evidence of any prior knowledge of the accused, or lack thereof (Beaulac, at para. 37). It only makes sense that evidence of that same nature will be required to make out a breach of s. 530(3) raised for the first time on appeal, a point even later in the proceedings. Crucially, this burden also creates no prejudice to an appellant who did not know they had a choice as to language at trial  disclosing this lack of knowledge on appeal will only help, not hurt, their claim. \nIn relying on the curative proviso as a potential route to curing what he concludes is an error of law, the Chief Justice instead places the burden on the Crown to demonstrate that the appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the s. 530(3) breach (paras. 88-90). He states that the court of appeal could dismiss the appeal if the Crown can show that the accused did not have a sufficient proficiency in the other official language, that the accused would have chosen the same language even if they had known of their substantive right, or that the accused knew of their language rights (para. 90). In our respectful view, this approach is problematic.\nThe accuseds choice of language under s. 530 is subjective and deeply personal, as opposed to being based on more objective factors like the accuseds maternal or dominant language (Beaulac, at para. 34). A breach of s. 530(3), in turn, relates purely to the knowledge the accused needs to make that choice. Without placing some evidentiary duty on the accused in this respect, it will be difficult, if not impossible in some cases, for the Crown to prove a negative  that the accused did not know they could choose a trial in either official language. It would be equally difficult for the Crown to prove that the accused did know of their language rights. Whether the accused knew of their right to a trial in either official language despite the breach of s. 530(3) is usually a question that only the accused can answer. That is why this Court in Beaulac held that an accused who makes a late application under s. 530(4) must present evidence as to when they were made aware of the right (para. 37; see also Dhingra, at para. 51). In our respectful view, the Crown should not be tasked with proving information that often exists only in the mind of an appellant with no duty to speak. \nThis appeal demonstrates how difficult it would be for the Crown to satisfy the proviso for a breach of s. 530(3). As we explain below, the evidence available to the Crown on the record in this case regarding the appellants knowledge of his language rights exceeds what would normally be present in other cases, including the undertaking and the promise to appear the appellant himself signed that had clear information about his language rights, and a s. 10(b) motion specifically dealing with other language rights, that produced a substantial evidentiary record regarding the appellants knowledge of language rights and his abilities and preferences in both English and French. Of lesser significance, the rules of professional conduct in British Columbia, the jurisdiction in which this case was tried, require counsel to advise clients of their language rights. If the circumstances of this case do not satisfy the proviso, it is difficult to imagine what will.\nWith respect, the risk is that accused persons who know of their language rights, but whose first-appearance judicial official fails to ensure that they are advised of them, can remain silent  secure in the knowledge that, if they are convicted, they can raise this breach for the first time on appeal and be rewarded with a new trial. In our view, such a result itself would cause a miscarriage of justice. It would undermine the integrity of the administration of justice. The burden must be on the appellant to show that they did not know of their language rights, and not on the Crown to establish they did. This is generally a matter within the knowledge of the accused and not the Crown. The accused suffers no prejudice in being asked to come forward to establish a limited point on which they have unique knowledge. \nApplication\nBoth parties agreed that the justice of the peace presiding over the appellants first appearance violated s. 530(3). Under the ground of miscarriage of justice in s. 686(1)(a)(iii), the appellant was required to establish that he did not otherwise know of his language rights in order to show that this failure had any consequence. The appellant has brought no evidence to meet this minimal burden, both before the British Columbia Court of Appeal and again before this Court. He has not shown that this breach affected his substantive right to a trial in the official language of his choice, thus causing a miscarriage of justice.\nWhile the appellants silence is enough to dispose of this appeal, we also note that the evidence in the record strongly supports the inference that the appellant was aware of his language rights. Upon his release from the police station after arrest and before his first appearance, he signed a police undertaking and a promise to appear, both of which had notices informing him of the option to apply for a trial in French (2022 BCCA 177, 414 C.C.C. (3d) 86, at paras. 9-10). In the promise to appear, the notice was in both French and English. He signed the undertaking immediately above a statement that he was entitled to apply, pursuant to Section 530 of the Criminal Code, to have [his] trial in either English or French, and that if he wanted a trial in French, he must apply to the court within the specified timeframes (R.R., at pp. 2-3). The promise to appear contained the same statement, and the appellant again signed immediately above a written instruction to See Notice of Language Rights at Trial on reverse (p. 1). \nIn addition, at his first appearance, the appellants counsel affirmed he would ensure his client was aware that the terms of the undertaking were still in effect (C.A. reasons, at para. 12). Like lawyers in most jurisdictions in Canada, this counsel had an ethical duty to inform the appellant of his language rights (see Law Society of British Columbia, Code of Professional Conduct for British Columbia, r. 3.2-2.1; see also Law Society of Ontario, Rules of Professional Conduct, r. 3.2-2A; Federation of Law Societies of Canada, Model Code of Professional Conduct, October 2022 (online), r. 3.2-2A). Where an accused is represented by a lawyer, a court is entitled to presume that defence counsel will fulfill their professional obligations (see, e.g., G.D.B., at para. 27). Although the presence of counsel cannot relieve a judicial official of their obligations under s. 530(3) (Beaulac, at para. 37), where a s. 530(3) breach is raised for the first time on appeal, the role of counsel may be a relevant factor to consider in determining whether the accused otherwise knew of their language rights. \nOnce at trial, the appellant advanced an argument in a voir dire based on an allegation that the police had breached s. 10(b) of the Charter when they obtained a statement without first making sure the appellant understood he had the right to consult with French-speaking counsel (C.A. reasons, at para. 17). Such an argument would tend to demonstrate a nuanced understanding of his language rights and the protections that our law provides him.\nThe appellants silence in the face of this contrary evidence is concerning. This is evidence that the Crown could likely have used to question him on the key point of whether he had knowledge of his right to a trial in French or English. When the appellant alone has the evidence necessary to ground his appeal, an appellate court is arguably entitled to conclude that his silence on these matters raises an adverse inference that the evidence would not have helped his case. His silence speaks volumes (see Levesque v. Comeau, [1970] S.C.R. 1010, at pp. 1012-13; Jolivet, at para. 28).\nThe record below also reveals no serious dispute that the appellant is bilingual: the evidence available as to his language abilities suggests that he could have chosen a trial in either English or French. Although the appellant disputes his English abilities for the first time before this Court, we would not depart from the findings of the trial judge on the voir dire that he is fluent in English, as these findings are entitled to deference (trial reasons, 2019 BCSC 1529, at para. 35 (CanLII); voir dire reasons, 2019 BCSC 2442, at paras. 11-12, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at pp. 7-9). The appellants bilingualism does not affect whether his substantive right to a trial in French was breached if he did not know of his ability to choose a trial in either official language. However, if he knew of this right, the fact that he is competent in English means it is plausible that, from the beginning, he chose to be tried in English. What he knew, he will not say.\nThe appellant has not met his burden to show that a miscarriage of justice occurred. He has not shown that he suffered any consequence from the failure of the justice of the peace presiding over his first appearance to follow s. 530(3) or that this failure deprived him of his substantive right to choose the official language of his trial. Although the breach that occurred in his proceedings should not have happened, this Court has no power to grant relief from an error that, ultimately, had no proven effect.\nThe Trial Judges Duty Under Section 530(4)\nWe turn briefly to the appellants alternative submission that the trial judge had a duty under s. 530(4) to verify whether the appellants trial was taking place in the official language of his choice, and that the trial judge erred in law by failing to order on his own initiative that the appellant be remanded for a trial in French. We would dismiss this ground of appeal as well.\nUnder s. 530(4), trial judges have no mandatory duty to confirm the accuseds choice of language: the ability of the trial judge to do so is left to their discretion. Typically, such an inquiry would be conducted following a late application by the accused, although s. 530(4) also allows the trial judge, of their own motion, to ask and remand the accused to be tried in the other official language if doing so is in the best interests of justice. Trial judges should thus be vigilant for signs that the trial is not proceeding in the accuseds official language of choice, such as the accused switching between languages while testifying (see Mazraani, at para. 45; Parsons v. R., 2014 QCCA 2206, at para. 35 (CanLII)). At the same time, trial judges are not expected to be mind readers (Tran, at p. 982). Unless the circumstances in the trial record are such that the choice of the accused (or lack thereof) to proceed in that language calls out for an inquiry, there will be no breach of s. 530(4) if the trial judge fails to do so.\nThe accuseds choice of language for trial is highly subjective and deeply personal. Although it is important for trial judges to ensure that the accused is being tried in their language of choice, they must also be cautious about interfering with that choice simply because the accuseds first language differs from that of the proceedings. The substantive right to a trial in ones own official language is not necessarily related to the fairness of the trial or the ability of the accused to testify in one language better than another. An accent, or brief slippages into another language, do not automatically trigger a duty under s. 530(4). Each case depends on its own unique circumstances.\nHere, the trial judge found that the appellant was fluent in both English and French (trial reasons, at para. 35; voir dire reasons, at paras. 11-12). In English, the appellant was articulate, able to understand certain nuances, had a solid vocabulary, and spoke fluidly and rationally (trial reasons, at paras. 76 and 83). Although the appellant sometimes struggled to find the right words, he overall displayed an excellent ability to understand and express himself in English and any difficulties in speaking he experienced were like those encountered by many witnesses who testify in criminal proceedings, even those whose first language is English (para. 84). \nIn these circumstances, the trial judge cannot be faulted for failing to ask about the appellants choice to proceed in English. We would dismiss this alternative ground of appeal. \nDisposition\nWe would dismiss the appeal.\n\tAppeal allowed, Karakatsanis and Martin JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Power Law, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Attorney General of British Columbia, B.C.

The alleged offences are related to the breach of section 530(3) of the Criminal Code. Section 530 guarantees to every accused the right to be tried in the official language of their choice, with varying degrees of flexibility depending on the timing of the application. The provision also requires the judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is advised of their right to apply for a trial before a judge or jury who speak the official language of their choice. In this case, the judge failed to inform the accused of his right to a trial in French, contrary to the requirements of section 530(3) of the Criminal Code.\n\nThe Supreme Court of British Columbia heard the original trial, and the accused was convicted of sexual assault. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, the accused argued that the trial judge erred in not informing him of his right to a trial in French under section 530(3) of the Criminal Code. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the breach of section 530(3) did not result in a violation of the accused's fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice. The accused then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada held that a breach of section 530(3) is an error of law under section 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, which gives rise to a presumption that the accused's fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice was violated. The Crown can rebut this presumption by showing that the accused's fundamental right was not in fact violated despite the breach of section 530(3).\n\nWriting for the majority, the Chief Justice held that a breach of the informational duty imposed by section 530(3) of the Criminal Code on the judge before whom an accused first appears is an error of law warranting appellate intervention under section 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The breach, once established, taints the trial court's judgment and gives rise to a presumption that the accused's fundamental right to be tried in the official language of their choice, guaranteed to the accused by section 530, was violated. The Crown can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the curative proviso in section 686(1)(b)(iv). In this case, the appellant proved that a reviewable error was made, and the Crown failed to establish that the appellant's fundamental right was not in fact violated despite the breach of section 530(3). Therefore, the appeal was allowed, the conviction was quashed, and a new trial in French was ordered.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court orders a new trial in French for an accused person who was not informed  of his right to be tried in the official language of his choice.\u00a0 </strong>This case was about the  analytical framework that a court of appeal must apply when an accused person appeals  their conviction because they were not informed of their right to be tried in  the official language of their choice the first time they appeared before a  judge, where no decision on their language rights was made at first instance.Section\u00a0530 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>guarantees to every  accused person the right to be tried in the official language of their choice. To  make certain that the accused\u2019s choice is free and informed, section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> imposes a duty on the  judge before whom the accused first appears to ensure that the accused is  advised of their right and of the time before which they must apply for a trial  before a judge or a judge and jury, as the case may be, who speak the official  language of their choice.Franck Yvan Tayo Tompouba is a  bilingual Francophone who was convicted of sexual assault following a trial  conducted in English in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. During the  judicial process leading to Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s conviction, the judge did  not ensure that he was advised of his right to be tried in French, contrary to  the requirements of section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba did not apply for a trial in French or  raise the breach of his right to be advised of his right to make such an  application.Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  his conviction to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. It was then that he asserted  for the first time that he would have liked his trial to be conducted in French.  Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba alleged that his language rights had been violated due,  among other things, to the fact that the judge had breached his duty under  section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.The Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. While it was of the view that the judge\u2019s breach was an error of law  that warranted its intervention, it found that the evidence did not make it  possible to decide certain key questions, including when Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba  had learned of his fundamental right, whether he would in fact have chosen a  trial in French if he had had an opportunity to do so, and whether he had not  made a free and informed choice to have a trial in English. It therefore found  that the evidence was insufficient and that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had not met  the burden of persuading it that the judge\u2019s breach of the duty set out in section\u00a0530(3)  of the <em>Code</em> had resulted in a violation  of his fundamental right to be tried in the official language of his choice. Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, which has allowed his appeal.<strong>The Court of Appeal erred in imposing on Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba the  burden of proving that his fundamental right had been violated at first  instance.\u00a0 </strong>Writing for the majority, Chief  Justice\u00a0Wagner stated that section\u00a0530(3) imposes a two\u2011pronged  informational duty on the judge before whom an accused first appears: to ensure  that the accused is duly informed of their fundamental right and of how it is  to be exercised, and, where the circumstances so require, to take the necessary  steps to inform the accused of this.  Chief Justice Wagner affirmed that a breach of this informational duty is an  error of law warranting appellate intervention under section\u00a0686(1)(a) of  the <em>Code</em>. As he explained, this  breach, once established, taints the trial court\u2019s judgment and gives rise to a  presumption that the accused\u2019s fundamental right to be tried in the official  language of their choice, which is guaranteed to the accused by section\u00a0530  of the <em>Code</em>, was violated. The Crown  can then rebut this presumption for the purposes of the analysis under the  curative proviso in section\u00a0686(1)(b)(iv) of the <em>Code</em>, which allows a court of appeal to dismiss an appeal where an  error or irregularity shown by the accused did not cause them any prejudice.In this case,  Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner concluded, first, that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba had  proved that an error reviewable on appeal had been made and, second, that the  Crown had failed to establish that Mr.\u00a0Tayo Tompouba\u2019s fundamental right had  not in fact been violated despite the judge\u2019s breach of his informational duty  under section\u00a0530(3) of the <em>Code</em>.  For these reasons, Chief\u00a0Justice\u00a0Wagner allowed the appeal, quashed Mr.\u00a0Tayo  Tompouba\u2019s conviction and ordered that a new trial be held in French."

N-5, ss. 165.21, 165.24(2).\n\tThe nine accused are members of the Canadian Armed Forces who were charged with service offences under the Code of Service Discipline (CSD), which forms Part III of the National Defence Act (NDA), and were brought before courts martial. Under the CSD, members of the Canadian Armed Forces may be charged with service offences, which are serious and encompass offences specific to military personnel and offences under the Criminal Code or other acts of Parliament. Service offences are tried before a court martial, which is a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Courts martial are presided over by military judges, who are required under s. 165.21 of the NDA to be barristers or advocates of at least 10 years standing at the bar of a province and to be military officers and to have been so for at least 10 years. Section 165.24(2) of the NDA further provides that the Chief Military Judge must hold a rank of not less than colonel. The NDA provides that military judges can only be removed for cause by the Governor in Council upon recommendation of the Military Judges Inquiry Committee (MJIC). As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command, and therefore are also subject to prosecution for service infractions and service offences under the CSD.\n\tThe nine accused challenged the statutory requirement that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be officers, alleging that it violates their right to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under s. 11(d) of the Charter. In the courts martial, some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial independence by reason of their dual status of judge and officer, and therefore that the respective accuseds s. 11(d) rights were infringed. The Court Martial Appeal Court (CMAC) held that an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through, would conclude that military judges meet the minimum constitutional norms of impartiality and independence, and therefore that the accuseds s. 11(d) rights were not infringed.\n\tHeld (Karakatsanis J. dissenting): The appeals should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Cote, Rowe, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: The status of military judges as officers under the NDA is not incompatible with their judicial functions for the purposes of s. 11(d) of the Charter. Accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality under s. 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian criminal courts, but this does not require that the two systems be identical in every respect. As presently configured in the NDA, Canadas system of military justice fully ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the Armed Forces and public trust in a disciplined military. Accordingly, the requirement that military judges be officers pursuant to ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA does not fall afoul of s. 11(d) of the Charter.\n\tIn R. v. Genereux, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 259, the Court held that the military status of military judges does not violate s. 11(d). While the Court may depart from precedent when a decisions rationale has been eroded by significant societal or legal change, it has not been shown that the rationale in Genereux has been eroded due to such changes, and therefore there is no compelling reason to abandon settled law. The Court in Genereux did acknowledge that the place of military judges in the military hierarchy detracts from absolute judicial independence, but it also confirmed that s. 11(d) does not require absolute judicial independence or a sort of truly independent military judiciary that could only be assured by civilian judges. Absolute independence is not the constitutional standard endorsed in the Courts jurisprudence.\n\tGenereux establishes that whatever concerns might arise as a result of Parliaments choice to require that military judges be officers, that model is not inherently unconstitutional under s. 11(d). Other models, such as a military judiciary composed of civilian judges, might also be constitutionally compliant, but Genereux does not stand for the proposition that an independent military judiciary requires civilian judges or that only one policy option would be constitutionally compliant. Law reform initiatives in other countries may assist in setting government policy but do not require Parliament to follow suit. Recommendations made in independent reports that were submitted in these cases may be of value as a matter of government policy, but they do not determine what is required by s. 11(d) of the Charter. The suitability of various policy options, within the bounds of the Constitution, is a matter of legislative choice. The Courts proper role is to decide whether ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA are constitutional. What is at issue is not whether the Canadian military justice system could practically function with civilian judges but whether the impugned requirement under the NDA violates the guarantee set by s. 11(d).\n\tGenereux continues to provide useful guidance as precedent on the following matters: s. 11(d) applies to the military justice system; a parallel system staffed by judges with military status who are sensitive to the needs of military justice does not, in itself, offend s. 11(d); and there may well be different modalities for ensuring that military judges have a degree of independence that meets the constitutional minimum. Adapted to the military context, military justice is different in some respects from civilian criminal justice, but the guarantee of independence is no less Charter-compliant by reason of this difference.\n\tIn Genereux, the Court ultimately concluded that military judges did not enjoy a sufficient degree of independence; however, this was based on provisions of the NDA that have since been amended. Accordingly, a fresh analysis is required. To assess the independence of a tribunal, a reviewing court asks whether the tribunal may be reasonably perceived as independent. As explained in Genereux, the exercise for evaluating independence and impartiality under s. 11(d) is the same: the question is whether a reasonable and informed person would perceive the tribunal as independent and impartial. The reasonable and informed person has knowledge of all the relevant circumstances and views the matter realistically and practically. They are alive to the relevant contextual considerations, they are right minded, they think the matter through, they apply themselves to the question and obtain the required information.\n\tIn Valente v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673, the Court identified three essential conditions of judicial independence: security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence. Security of tenure requires that the judge hold office whether until an age of retirement, for a fixed term, or for a specific adjudicative task so as to secure against interference by the executive. Financial security requires that the right to salary and pension be established by law and that judicial remuneration be fixed through a process that includes an independent commission. Administrative independence means judicial control over the administrative decisions that bear directly on the exercise of the judicial function. Additionally, even if the reasonable and informed person would conclude that a court is independent because the three essential conditions are met, they may still come to the conclusion that the court is not impartial at either the individual or the institutional level. While independent courts benefit from a strong presumption of impartiality that is not easily displaced, if a reasonable and informed person would think it more likely than not that the court would not decide fairly because of individual or institutional concerns, the impartiality of the court may be challenged.\n\tThe three essential conditions of judicial independence for military judges are met through the provisions of the NDA. First, regarding security of tenure, the NDA now provides that military judges are appointed by the Governor in Council, and that unless they are removed for cause, they hold office until they are voluntarily released from the military or resign from the position of military judge, or until they reach the age of 60. Military judges can only be removed from office by the Governor in Council, for cause, upon a recommendation of their judicial peers properly convened as the MJIC. While it is true that military judges, as officers, can be convicted of offences under the CSD and sanctioned to sentences including dismissal from the Armed Forces, a reasonable and informed person, looking at matters practically, including a reading of the NDA as a whole, would not view the risk of there being an indirect means of removing military judges to be a realistic possibility. Second, the requirement of financial security is amply met as military judges have their own remuneration scheme and their compensation is fixed through a process that centres on an independent committee. Third, military judges, including the Chief Military Judge, are responsible for the decisions that must be left to judges in order for there to be sufficient administrative independence, such as assigning military judges to preside at courts martial and establishing procedural rules. These matters are insulated from non-judicial interference by the chain of command.\n\tThe place of military judges in the executive branch and their exposure to prosecution for CSD offences do not ground a reasonable perception of a lack of impartiality. First, military judges, as members of the executive, are not in an irretrievable conflict of interest with their judicial role such that the constitutional principle of separation of powers is violated. The manner in which their role as judges is circumscribed makes it plain that they do not act as members of the executive when they perform their judicial duties. Only the Chief Military Judge can assign duties to military judges, and these duties must not be incompatible with their judicial duties, which are also assigned by the Chief Military Judge. Military judges have their own, separate grievance procedure and have protections against interference through performance evaluations by the executive. Like other judges, military judges take a solemn oath to act impartially. They are vested with the same powers, rights and privileges as judges of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction and enjoy the same immunity from liability. The reasonable and informed person would expect that military judges will abide by their oath of office and have confidence that, given their legal training and experience, they will set aside improper influences or recuse themselves if they ever feel that they cannot do so.\n\tSecond, a reasonable apprehension of bias is not created by the possible liability of military judges to discipline under the CSD. Military judges are not above the law and can be held accountable when they act outside their judicial functions for their conduct as members of the Armed Forces. As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command and must comply with lawful orders issued by superior officers. If they fail to do so, they could be subject to discipline under the CSD. However, there are sufficient protections against a perception taking hold that the status of military judges as officers exposes them to interference by the executive in the exercise of their judicial functions. Before military judges can be prosecuted, the person laying the charge must receive legal advice concerning the appropriate charge, and the Director of Military Prosecutions, who has an obligation to act independently of partisan concerns, must decide to proceed with charges. Moreover, an order from a superior officer that has the purpose of interfering with a military judges judicial work would be an unlawful order and an abusive or purely retaliatory prosecution would be an unlawful prosecution. Overall, the reasonable and informed person would not be concerned that the independence or impartiality of military judges can be undermined because of their status as officers that makes them subject to the CSD.\n\tThe requirements in ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA therefore meet the standards of judicial independence and impartiality under s. 11(d) of the Charter. A reasonable and informed person, looking at the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through, would not conclude that the officer status of military judges raises any apprehension of bias or that it amounts to a lack of sufficient independence such that there is a breach of s. 11(d).\n\tPer Karakatsanis J. (dissenting): The appeals should be allowed and the legislative scheme under the NDA should be declared of no force or effect insofar as it subjects military judges to the disciplinary process administered by military authorities.  Members of the Canadian Armed Forces charged with offences are not guaranteed a hearing by an impartial and independent tribunal under s. 11(d) of the Charter due to  the pressure military judges face as part of the chain of command, particularly, their disciplinary accountability through a regime that can be launched and prosecuted by their hierarchical superiors. The liability of military judges to the executive under the CSD as currently structured undermines their judicial independence. The breach of s. 11(d) cannot be saved by s. 1.\n\tThere is agreement with the majority that the requirement that military judges presiding over courts martial also have the military status of officers does not necessarily contravene the s. 11(d) right of a member of the Armed Forces. Properly designed and protected, the executive and judicial roles of military judges can coexist. There is also acceptance that under the NDA, military judges can, as officers, be accountable for CSD offences. However, the ability of the military executive to impose discipline on military judges would cause a reasonable and informed person facing a court martial to apprehend that the military judge could be unduly influenced by a loyalty to rank and by the position or policies of the military hierarchy, to the detriment of the accused members individual rights. There are insufficient safeguards in place to alleviate the potential risk of interference by the military chain of command. There is not enough institutional separation  or independence  between the executive and the judicial role.\n\tThe separation of powers is fundamentally important in maintaining judicial independence, in particular separation from the executive branch. Judges must be able to render decisions based solely on the requirements of the law and justice according to their own conscience, without outside interference or pressure. Judicial independence and impartiality are distinct concepts but they often overlap. Independence is an underlying condition that contributes to the guarantee of an impartial hearing. The three hallmarks of judicial independence  security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence  do not provide a complete answer to the question of whether judges benefit from sufficient independence. A particular tribunal will still lack institutional independence if there is the appearance that it cannot perform its adjudicative role without interference.\n\tAlthough judicial discipline and accountability, both important imperatives of broader social policy, can be in tension with judicial independence, civilian judges remain accountable for their conduct through ethical and professional rules of conduct via a judicial oversight committee. This encroachment on their independence is justified by the need to protect the integrity of the administration of justice. However, in matters of discipline, the separation between the judiciary and the other branches of government is necessary to avoid the appearance of any intervention based on public opinion and political expediency. Judicial independence requires that discipline of the judiciary be reserved to an autonomous, apolitical and independent entity.\n\tIn the military context, judicial independence is analyzed under these same principles. The standard of independence for military judges is no less than for civilian judges. Military judges, much like civilian judges, are subject to the civilian criminal justice system and are accountable for their misconduct through a judicial oversight committee (the MJIC). However, unlike civilian judges, military judges are also answerable for their conduct to their superiors within the chain of command. By holding a military rank, military judges are subject to service infractions and to the many service offences that can be prosecuted under the CSD for the military objectives of good order and discipline, efficiency and morale. They belong to the same institution responsible for laying charges against them and against the members who appear before them. If convicted of service offences, military judges may face dismissal from the Armed Forces, a criminal record and life-time imprisonment. Moreover, under the NDA, military judges face military prosecution for offences already covered by the Criminal Code and any other act of Parliament, but the decision to proceed under the military justice system can have a significant impact on their rights. Thus, military judges face a unique disciplinary regime that is launched and prosecuted by the executive, which has no equivalent in the civilian world.\n\tThe military context matters in determining whether a reasonable and informed person would be concerned about the pressures military judges face given their disciplinary accountability towards their superiors. Independent reports, which provide material insight on the concerns of a reasonable and informed member of the public, have long insisted that military judges, who currently keep the rank they held before their judicial appointment, should be awarded their own distinct rank, or civilianized. Because of a judges given rank, it is reasonable that military personnel facing a court martial may fear a judge could prioritize allegiance to rank and to the chain of command over their respective individual rights. The possibility of the executive reviewing the military judges conduct either by summary hearing or by court martial would be perceived by a reasonable and informed person as insufficient independence between the executive and judicial roles.\n\tBecause of this reasonable apprehension that military judges may not be institutionally impartial, any safeguards that may reduce those effects must be considered. Here, the safeguards said to alleviate the risk that military judges would feel pressure to be loyal towards the chain of command are insufficient. First, the requirement in the NDA that military judges must take an oath of office, while an important foundation for an individual judges independence, does little to guard against an apprehension of institutional bias. Second, military judges do not have sufficient security of tenure simply because they may only ultimately be removed as a military judge for cause through the MJIC. On conviction of a disciplinary offence, the NDA allows for sanctions of demotion or dismissal from the Armed Forces, meaning military judges would lose their status as officers and therefore a key qualification for their tenure. In any event, because military judges remain liable for uniquely military disciplinary charges initiated by their superiors, the rationale that animates the need for security of tenure  securing against interference by the executive  is not safeguarded. Third, the presumption that the Director of Military Prosecutions will carry out its functions independently of partisan concerns cannot be relied upon to safeguard judicial independence. The protection of the rule of law should not depend on a belief that institutions are immune from impropriety and, above all, the DMP does not act independently of the chain of command; rather, the DMP performs its functions under the supervision of the Judge Advocate General, who must be totally loyal and partisan to the interests of the military. A reasonable and informed observer would therefore be concerned about institutional bias because military judges could face discipline from their superiors.\nCases Cited\nBy Kasirer J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

The jurisprudence of this Court has been unwavering in recognizing that the guarantee of judicial independence provided by s. 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to persons in the Canadian Armed Forces who are tried before military courts martial. Adapted to the military context, the guarantee applies with the same vigour before a court martial as it does before a civilian court of criminal jurisdiction. \nOne longstanding source of disquiet, however,  disquiet alluded to by the Court prior to the advent of the Charter in MacKay v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 370  has been the military status of military judges and their place, as officers, within the Canadian Forces chain of command.\nMuch like for other federally appointed judges, only barristers or advocates of at least 10 years standing at the bar of a province are eligible for appointment as military judges. But an additional qualification is required for appointment as a military judge who can preside over a court martial. Section 165.21 of the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5 (NDA), directs that the Governor in Council may only appoint appropriately qualified jurists who are also military officers and who have been so for at least 10 years. Section 165.24(2) further provides that the Chief Military Judge, designated by the Governor in Council, must hold a rank of not less than colonel. \nCharged with service offences under military law, the appellants allege that the statutory requirement that the judges presiding over their courts martial be officers violates s. 11(d). Their divided loyalties as judge and officer are said to deflect military judges from a proper exercise of their judicial duties and leaves them vulnerable to pressure from the chain of command. The appellants say that there is no practical rationale for the requirement that military judges be officers. They argue that the law as it stands is unconstitutional in that it deprives the accused of their right to a trial before a truly independent and impartial judge. Insofar as ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA require military judges to be military officers, the appellants call on the Court to declare those provisions of no force or effect under s. 52 the Constitution Act, 1982.\nIn R. v. Genereux, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 259, Lamer C.J. saw plainly that the association between the military hierarchy and military judges could detract from the absolute independence and impartiality of such tribunals (p. 294). At the same time, he understood that the military training and rank of military judges as officers were a means of ensuring that military judges are sensitive to the need for discipline, obedience and duty and to military efficiency (p. 295). In the end, the Court decided that the military status of military judges was not, in itself, sufficient to give rise to a violation of s. 11(d) of the Charter. \nThe appellants now challenge that conclusion, arguing that Genereux should not be followed to the letter because of social changes affecting military justice that have come to light since that judgment was rendered in 1992. While they accept that a parallel system of military justice is constitutionally sound, the appellants say that requiring judges to be officers is not compatible with judicial independence. In their view, there are no legislative safeguards [that] prevent the chain of command from exerting disciplinary pressure on military judges (A.F., at para. 97). The appellants add that their constitutional challenge is part of a public confidence crisis in military justice, characterized by an insular military culture that is exacerbated by the statutory requirement that judges be officers (paras. 13, 22-25 and 129). The appellants say that, on a proper constitutional standard, truly independent military judges should be civilians, a model for military justice that has proved workable in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.\nIn first instance, some of the military judges held that s. 11(d) was infringed as they lacked judicial independence by reason of their dual status of judge and officer. Stays of proceedings were entered for some of the appellants charged with service offences under the Code of Service Discipline (CSD), in Part III of the NDA, as a remedy for this Charter breach. On appeal, the Court Martial Appeal Court set aside the relevant stays. Citing MacKay and Genereux, the CMAC decided that the safeguards in the NDA adequately protect judicial independence and impartiality in light of the purposes of military justice in Canada.\nIt is true, as the appellants say, that military justice has changed from the command-centric model that was still partially in place at the time of Genereux. I am nevertheless of the view that this Courts endorsement of the constitutionality of a parallel military system of justice, staffed by military judges chosen from the ranks of officers, continues to rest on a proper constitutional footing. Despite changes spoken to by the appellants, the dual status of military judges does not offend s. 11(d). \nAs this Court observed in R. v. Stillman, 2019 SCC 40, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 144, shortcomings in judicial independence and impartiality in the applicable legislative schemes have meant, at different times in the history of Canadian military justice, that this constitutional imperative has not always been met (para. 45). The appellants have seized on this uneven history to argue that the current safeguards fail to ensure truly independent military judges who are free from actual or reasonably apprehended bias. They say the military status of military judges means that they are unable to meet the minimum standards for independence and impartiality guaranteed by the Charter. Military judges belong to the same Canadian Armed Forces institution that lays charges against the accused who appear before them. The appellants argue that military judges cannot, as members of the executive, exercise core judicial functions independently. They are subject to disciplinary pressures from their superior officers in the chain of command which could reasonably be perceived to weaken their ability to render justice impartially. In sum, the appellants say that accused persons tried before courts martial are deprived of their constitutional right to be tried by an independent and impartial judge for which there is no rationale, military or otherwise. A reasonable and informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, would inevitably conclude that the legislative requirement that military judges be military officers as a condition of appointment raises a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nI disagree. To be plain, the appellants are most certainly right to say that as a matter of constitutional law, accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality under s. 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian criminal courts. But as Moldaver and Brown JJ. wrote in Stillman, this does not require that the two systems be identical in every respect (para. 44, citing Genereux). As presently configured in the NDA, Canadas system of military justice fully ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the Forces and public trust in . . . a disciplined armed force (ss. 55 and 203.1(2)(b)). Properly understood, the military context does not diminish judicial independence. \nIn order to protect the constitutional imperative of judicial independence, military judges are not ordinary military officers. They are properly insulated, by law, from the chain of command in their work as judges so that the persons who come before them charged with service offences benefit from constitutionally guaranteed judicial independence. It is true that, like all judges in Canada, military judges are subject to the criminal law and, as military officers, they are subject to military law. Military judges, as officers, are members of the executive and themselves subject to the CSD. But the law protects them from interference from their superiors in the chain of command in their judicial work. While they continue to hold rank and remain part of the military hierarchy, they are first and foremost judges (outline of argument in respondents condensed book, tab 1).\nMilitary judges cannot be subject to discipline for their work as judges. The NDA provides for a myriad of safeguards that protect military judges, notwithstanding their military status, as independent judges. By way of example, only the Chief Military Judge can assign duties to them, and these duties must not be incompatible with their judicial duties (ss. 165.23(2) and 165.25). Like other judges, military judges take a solemn oath to act impartially. They are vested with the same powers, rights and privileges as judges of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction and enjoy the same immunity from liability (ss. 165.231 and 179). Military judges enjoy meaningful security of tenure as judges that protects them from what might be feared as vulnerabilities in respect of mistreatment by superior officers. They have a separate regime for grievances (s. 29(2.1)) and they have protection against relief from performance of military duty (Queens Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces (QR & O), art. 19.75(1)). Military judges have a separate pay scheme from that of other officers that is not fixed by their superiors but by an independent Military Judges Compensation Committee (NDA, s. 165.33). They can only be removed for cause by the Governor in Council upon recommendation of the Military Judges Inquiry Committee (MJIC), consisting of three judges of the CMAC appointed by the Chief Justice of that court (ss. 165.21(3) and 165.31). Importantly, the law protects military judges from improper prosecution under the CSD. Before a military judge can be prosecuted, the person laying the charge must receive legal advice concerning the appropriate charge (QR & O, art. 102.07(2)(b)) and the Director of Military Prosecutions, who has an obligation to act independently of partisan concerns, must decide to proceed with charges (NDA, ss. 161.1(1) and 165). Moreover, an order from a superior officer that had the purpose of interfering with their judicial work would be an unlawful order and an abusive or purely retaliatory prosecution would be an unlawful prosecution. \nThe hallmarks of military judges independence are plainly present notwithstanding their status as officers: the military justice system guarantees their security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence (see Valente v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673). The military status of these judges would not lead a reasonable and informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, to conclude that there is an apprehension of bias or insufficient independence (see Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at p. 394). Canadas system of military justice ensures its purpose of maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the Canadian Armed Forces while respecting the guarantee of judicial independence. The safeguards for judicial independence in the NDA help to sustain public trust in military justice as a statutory regime that, in the words of one scholar, is not a mere [translation] instrument of discipline but a tool of justice (J.-B. Cloutier, Lutilisation de larticle 129 de la Loi sur la defense nationale dans le systeme de justice militaire canadien (2004), 35 R.D.U.S. 1, at p. 97).\nWithin the bounds of the Constitution, Parliament is of course free to enact another system for military justice, but that policy choice does not fall to the courts. There may indeed be different or even better models for judging offences in the military than what is currently set forth in the NDA that also rest on a proper disciplinary rationale and also meet the strictures of s. 11(d). That is not the question before us and, it is fair to say, is not a question that this Court is institutionally designed to answer. Replacing Canadas system of military justice with a model used in other countries as the appellants propose would require close study to determine the extent to which foreign approaches could serve as a model for Canada. Courts are not equipped to do that work, nor is it their proper constitutional role. Instead, this Court is called upon to decide whether the regime that existed at the relevant times is constitutionally compliant. I conclude that it is. \nIn sum, s. 11(d) of the Charter does not dictate a particular model of military justice nor does it require that only civilian judges preside over trials for service offences such as the offences relevant to these appeals. The Constitution allows Parliament a measure of choice in the design of justice before courts martial and does not require that military justice be exactly identical to its civilian counterpart. In my respectful view, the requirement that military judges be officers pursuant to ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA does not fall afoul of s. 11(d). I propose that the appeals be dismissed.\nBackground\nThe nine appellants are members of the Canadian Armed Forces charged with service offences who were brought before courts martial for trial. Military personnel and certain other persons are subject to the CSD, which forms Part III of the NDA.\nService offences are the most serious infringements of the CSD, encompassing offences specific to military personnel  such as disobeying the lawful commands of a superior officer  and offences under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (Cr. C.), or any other act of Parliament that are committed by a person while subject to the Code of Service Discipline (NDA, s. 2 service offence). They are tried before a court martial, which is a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a superior court of criminal jurisdiction (NDA, s. 179). Courts martial are presided over by military judges who are officers.\nLeading Seaman C.D. Edwards was charged with conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline under s. 129 of the NDA for using cocaine, contrary to art. 20.04 of the QR & O.\nCaptain C.M.C. Crepeau was charged with disobeying lawful commands of a superior officer under s. 83 of the NDA, behaving with contempt towards a superior officer under s. 85, and conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline under s. 129.\nGunner K.J.J. Fontaine was charged with offences punishable under s. 130 of the NDA, including trafficking of cocaine and possession of cocaine and methamphetamine with the intention of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(1) and (2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19.\nCaptain M.J. Iredale was charged with three counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Cr. C., punishable under s. 130 of the NDA, and three counts of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline under s. 129.\nCorporal K.L. Christmas was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Cr. C., punishable under s. 130 of the NDA, with disgraceful conduct for touching another persons genitals without consent under s. 93, and for drunkenness under s. 97.\nSergeant S.R. Proulx was charged with disobeying lawful commands of a superior officer, behaving with contempt towards a superior officer, and conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, under ss. 83, 85 and 129 of the NDA, respectively.\nMaster Corporal J.R.S. Cloutier was charged with disgraceful conduct under s. 93 of the NDA, drunkenness under s. 97, and conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline under s. 129.\nLieutenant (Navy) C.A.I. Brown was charged with sexual assault (Cr. C., s. 271) and forcible confinement (Cr. C., s. 279(2)), punishable under s. 130 of the NDA. \nSergeant A.J.R. Thibault was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Cr. C., punishable under s. 130 of the NDA.\nWith the exception of Sgt. Thibault, each of the accused challenged the independence and impartiality of the military judges before whom they were brought to trial. Sgt. Thibault raised the same question on appeal of his conviction. \nKey to understanding the constitutional challenges raised in these appeals are the cases of R. v. Pett, 2020 CM 4002, and R. v. DAmico, 2020 CM 2002, judgments that themselves are not before this Court. \nIn Pett, the court martial held that an Order from the Chief of the Defence Staff, dated October 2, 2019, violated Master Corporal Petts right under s. 11(d) to a trial before an independent and impartial tribunal. That Order designated a single officer to exercise the powers and jurisdiction of a commanding officer with respect to any disciplinary matter involving a military judge on the strength of the Office of the Chief Military Judge (para. 9 (CanLII); R.R., tab 1). The court martial in Pett held that military judges are immune from the disciplinary process applicable to officers while they hold judicial office because discipline for military judges falls exclusively to the MJIC. The Order was thus unlawful in that it purported to grant authority to a commanding officer to charge a military judge, as an officer, with an offence. By undermining this essential protection of military judges independence under the NDA, the Order violated s. 11(d). The court martial declared the impugned part of the Order to be of no force and effect. Another court martial reached the same conclusion in DAmico. \nWith the exception of Sgt. Thibault, all of the appellants alleged in their court martial proceedings that, as in Pett and DAmico, the fact that their trials were presided over by a military judge who was also an officer violated their right to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal under s. 11(d) of the Charter.\nJudicial History\nCourts Martial\nR. v. Edwards, 2020 CM 3006; R. v. Crepeau, 2020 CM 3007; R. v. Fontaine, 2020 CM 3008; and R. v. Iredale, 2020 CM 4011\nIn Edwards, the court martial agreed with Pett and DAmico that the NDA protects military judges independence by insulating them from liability for service offences under the CSD. Instead, military judges were answerable for disciplinary matters through the MJIC. The court martial held that the impugned Order dated October 2, 2019 violated this statutory safeguard by wrongly designating a commanding officer for the purposes of applying the CSD regime, including service offences, to military judges. The Order therefore infringed the right of L.S. Edwards to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal pursuant to s. 11(d) of the Charter and the infringement was not justified by s. 1. The court entered a stay of proceedings for L.S. Edwards as a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter.\nIn Crepeau, the military judge followed the reasoning in Edwards. The judge rejected a direct constitutional challenge to specific sections of the NDA but entered a stay because the impugned Order violated s. 11(d) by undermining judicial independence. In Fontaine and Iredale, stays were entered for the accused based on comparable reasoning. Referring to his conclusions in Pett, the presiding military judge wrote in Iredale, [m]y position to the effect that a military judge should never be brought before a court martial while in office remains (para. 37 (CanLII)).\nR. v. Christmas, 2020 CM 3009; and R. v. Proulx, 2020 CM 4012\nAfter the Chief of the Defence Staff suspended the October 2, 2019 Order, Canadian Forces Organization Order 3763, which includes a section pertaining to the disciplinary regime for military judges, remained in effect. The presiding military judges in Christmas and Proulx concluded that the deficiencies still resulted in a breach of s. 11(d), and thus entered stays of proceedings. \nR. v. Cloutier, 2020 CM 4013; and R. v. Brown, 2021 CM 4003\nIn Cloutier and Brown, military judges held that despite changes to orders bearing on discipline of military judges, the requirements of s. 11(d) were still not met. While concluding that the s. 11(d) right of Master Corporal Cloutier was violated, the military judge directed that, as a remedy, the proceedings be terminated without adjudication pursuant to s. 24(1). In Lieut. Browns case, the military judge followed the reasoning in Cloutier, and entered a stay of proceedings. \nR. v. Thibault, 2020 CM 5005\nSgt. Thibault did not initially allege a violation of his right to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. He was found guilty of sexual assault.\nCourt Martial Appeal Court of Canada\nR. v. Edwards; R. v. Crepeau; R. v. Fontaine; R. v. Iredale, 2021 CMAC 2 (Edwards et al.)\nThe Crown appealed from the stays of proceedings in Edwards, Crepeau, Fontaine and Iredale. In a unanimous judgment, the Court Martial Appeal Court allowed the appeals, set aside the stays and directed that the matters proceed to trial. It agreed with the Crown that the impugned Order did not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias such that the independence of the court martial was compromised. Capt. Crepeau had also filed a cross-appeal to challenge the constitutionality of sections of the NDA pursuant to s. 11(d), which provide that military judges, as officers, are subject to the CSD and thus to pressure from military hierarchy in a manner that is incompatible with judicial independence. The cross-appeal was dismissed. \nThe CMAC in Edwards et al. held that the military judges made two errors of law. First, it held that [t]he premise upon which the decisions under appeal is based  that one cannot be both a military judge and an officer  is simply inconsistent with binding precedent, and if correct, defies the very purpose and rationale of the military justice system (para. 7 (CanLII)). Second, it held that the military judges failed to apply the test for judicial independence that has been set out by this Court. Since [t]he military judges did not consider the context or purpose of the military justice system, they failed to look at the matter realistically and practically as required by the Supreme Court and they failed to take into account the contextual considerations which safeguard the independence and impartiality of military judges (para. 9). \nContrary to the position taken up by most of the courts martial relying on Pett, the CMAC rejected the view that only the MJIC can hear complaints relating to disciplinary matters brought against military judges. Instead, the CMAC noted that the MJIC plays a role similar to that of an Inquiry Committee established through the Canadian Judicial Council for the removal of military judges (para. 80). As such, the MJIC does not impose any penalties, does not establish civil liability nor does it make findings of criminal guilt or innocence (para. 82). It has no power to impose any discipline . . ., short of recommending removal (para. 83). \nThe CMAC explained that, like other members of the Canadian Forces, military judges may be prosecuted for offences under the CSD. The proper issue before the court was thus whether the military status of military judges violates the constitutional protection of judicial independence.\nRelying principally on Genereux, the CMAC explained the purpose of a separate system of military justice. The court wrote:\nMilitary justice, in whatever form, promotes the discipline, efficiency and morale of the Canadian military for the development of operationally ready and effective forces wherever deployed in the world. This mission concept and declaration of purpose is unknown to the civilian criminal justice system. [para. 45]\nThe CMAC noted that, under s. 60(2) of the NDA, the CSD applies to all military personnel, including officers who are military judges. The court observed there are good reasons for this rule. A commander in a theatre of operations is responsible for the mission success and safety of those within their unit. All officers and non-commissioned members must perform all lawful duties. The court recalled that [t]his, in the profession of arms, is considered unlimited liability (para. 63). In this context, [d]iscipline is essential to the military (para. 64). All serving members are expected to undertake general defence duties in addition to their calling within the Canadian Armed Forces. These requirements apply to all, the court concluded, including officers who are also military judges (para. 66). \nMoreover, the court observed that the independence of military judges is not undermined by their status as members of the executive. Holding otherwise would not reflect the reality of our Westminster system of government (para. 68) since judges, including civilian judges, often take up executive functions such as participating in commissions of inquiry. \nThe CMAC held that the potential for military judges to be prosecuted under the CSD does not lead to a violation of s. 11(d). Military judges are subject to the CSD in much the same way as civilian judges are subject to the criminal law. There is no reason to think that military judges will be subject to malicious prosecutions since it is important to expect behaviour consistent with the constitutional norm that prosecutors and commanders will exercise prosecutorial discretion in a quasi-judicial manner and independent of partisan concerns (para. 90). \nThe court concluded: An informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically  and having thought the matter through could, in our respectful view, reach no other conclusion than military judges meet the minimum constitutional norms of impartiality and independence . . . (para. 114).\nR. v. Proulx; R. v. Cloutier, 2021 CMAC 3 (Proulx et al.)\nIn these appeals, the CMAC affirmed its decision in Edwards et al. It also considered whether the Canadian Forces Organization Order, the position of the Office of the Chief Military Judge within the military hierarchy, or the combined application of ss. 12(1) and (2), 17, 18, and 60 of the NDA undermined the independence of military judges. The CMAC answered all three questions in the negative [f]or substantially the same reasons set out in Edwards [et al.] (para. 14 (CanLII)). It allowed the appeals and ordered that the trials of Sgt. Proulx and Master Corporal Cloutier proceed.\nR. v. Christmas, 2022 CMAC 1; R. v. Brown, 2022 CMAC 2; and R. v. Thibault, 2022 CMAC 3\nIn the appeals concerning Cpl. Christmas and Lieut. Brown, the CMAC allowed the appeals, lifted the stays and ordered the trials to proceed for substantially the same reasons set out in Edwards et al. and Proulx et al. In Sgt. Thibaults appeal, he appealed his conviction for sexual assault and argued, among his grounds of appeal, that s. 165.21 of the NDA requiring military judges to be officers violates s. 11(d). This was rejected by the CMAC and the appeal against the conviction was dismissed.\nIssues and Submissions of the Parties\nThe overarching issue in these appeals is whether the military status of military judges under the NDA violates the guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality set out in s. 11(d) of the Charter. \nThe appellants say that the officer status of military judges raises a reasonable apprehension of bias in the mind of an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically (A.F., at para. 51 (emphasis deleted), citing Committee for Justice and Liberty, at p. 394), such that there is a breach of s. 11(d). They say that since the Crown has conceded that an established breach of s. 11(d) cannot be saved by s. 1, ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA, which provide that military judges must be officers, must be declared of no force or effect under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The parties have made further submissions concerning the appropriateness of an immediate or a suspended declaration of invalidity should the issue arise.\nThe appellants offer submissions under two main headings.\nFirst, they say that the CMAC was wrong to say that precedent, in particular Genereux, resolves these appeals. The foundation of the Courts reasoning in Genereux no longer holds true: the military status of military judges is not a practical necessity to ensure discipline, morale and efficiency in the military. Drawing on comments made by Lamer C.J. in his majority reasons, the appellants propose a reading of Genereux that supports the view that the military status of military judges raises a reasonable apprehension of bias and that only civilian judges can be truly independent. They contend that social change since Genereux shows that military judges can now be truly independent because the ends of military justice do not require them to be officers. The appellants point to other countries in which military judges are civilians, arguing that this proves that justice in a parallel system could realistically be assured for the Canadian Armed Forces without breaching the Charter.\nSecond, the appellants point to a series of indicia in the NDA that demonstrate the requirement that military judges be officers is incompatible with the constitutional right to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. Notably, military judges, as officers, belong to the very institution that lays charges against the accused in courts martial, which violates the constitutional imperative of the separation of powers. Further, as part of the chain of command, military judges are subject to discipline under the CSD, which exposes them to real and perceived pressure in the exercise of their judicial duties. The appellants argue that the NDA does not provide sufficient guarantees of judicial independence and that, in the eyes of a reasonable and informed person, the dual status of military judges would raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. \nThe Crown answers that this Courts jurisprudence, in particular Genereux, confirms that the status of military judges as officers does not, in itself, violate s. 11(d). Pointing further to the hallmarks of judicial independence identified in Valente, the Crown contends that military judges have security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence under the NDA. While it is true that, as officers, they are subject to the CSD, military judges are like all judges in Canada in that they are not above the law. None of this offends s. 11(d). \nFollowing an overview of the statutory and constitutional setting for these appeals, I propose to address the appellants two principal arguments attacking the constitutionality of ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA. First, I will examine whether the holding in Genereux that the military status of military judges does not violate s. 11(d) should be revisited in light of changed social circumstances. Second, I will turn to whether the protection for judicial independence and impartiality of military judges meets the constitutional requirements of the guarantee in s. 11(d) of the Charter. Like the CMAC, I conclude that there is no breach; a reasonable and informed person, looking at the matter realistically and practically, would not conclude that there is any apprehension of bias or lack of sufficient independence. There is thus no need to consider the effect of s. 1 or whether a constitutional remedy of any sort, suspended or otherwise, is in order.\nRelevant Constitutional and Statutory Provisions\nThe legislative and constitutional setting for this dispute is complex. \nI start with s. 11(d) of the Charter that provides:\n11 Any person charged with an offence has the right\n\n. . .\n\n(d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;\nThe system of military justice is governed principally by the NDA, the QR & O made under the authority of s. 12 of the NDA, and the Canadian Forces Organization Orders. \nIn Stillman, Moldaver and Brown JJ. described the legislative history of Canadas parallel system of military justice and its evolution over time from a command-centric model of discipline to a full partner in administering justice alongside the civilian justice system (para. 20). Stillman did not bear on s. 11(d) of the Charter and left open the possibility of challenging the independence and impartiality of military judges (para. 86). But Moldaver and Brown JJ. situated the Charter-era legislative and regulatory reforms, as well as the relevant jurisprudence, in the development of a parallel military justice system that sought generally to provide more independence to actors in that system, including military judges (paras. 42 et seq.). In particular, they considered Genereux which, they wrote, confirms that the military justice system, like its civilian counterpart, must comply with the Charter, although this does not require that the two systems be identical in every respect (para. 44). \nThe term discipline as used in the NDA reflects its particular sense in military parlance. Discipline in the military has a far wider meaning than the simple enforcement of laws (D. McNairn, A Military Justice Primer, Part I (2000), 43 Crim. L.Q. 243, at pp. 249-50). Discipline is the prerogative of military commanders to issue lawful orders that must be obeyed by members that are inferior to them in the chain of command (see Stillman, at para. 38). Discipline in the military sense should thus not be confused with the term as it is used in connection with the regulation of conduct of members of a self-governing body, such as a professional order, where issues going to the independence and impartiality of decision makers may also arise (see, e.g., R. v. Lippe, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114, at p. 138, per Lamer C.J.). As noted in the Report of the Special Advisory Group on Military Justice and Military Police Investigation Services (1997), chaired by the Right Honourable Brian Dickson, [t]he maintenance of effective discipline by the established chain of command continues to be a prime prerequisite for a competent and reliable military organization (p. i). Notwithstanding the imperatives of military discipline, as former Chief Justice Dickson and his colleagues explained, the supremacy of the rule of law and, notably, the Charter must be fully respected . . . within the military justice system (p. ii).\nCanadas separate system of military justice is designed to foster discipline, efficiency, and morale in the military (Stillman, at para. 20; see also M. Gibson, Military justice in operational settings, peacekeeping missions and situations of transitional justice, in A. Duxbury and M. Groves, eds., Military Justice in the Modern Age (2016), 381, at p. 382). Since amendments brought to the NDA in 2019, this purpose is codified in s. 55 as the guiding principle for the CSD. \nAccused members of the Forces may be disciplined in one of two ways. Members accused of service infractions, which are less serious than service offences, appear in summary hearings presided over by a commanding officer or their delegate (NDA, ss. 162.4 and 162.94). The constitutionality of those proceedings is not directly at issue in these appeals. The particular aspect of the CSD that is engaged by the charges brought against the appellants is service offences, which are to be heard by a standing court martial, presided over by a military judge sitting alone, who will decide on criminal responsibility on a criminal law standard. \nMembers who are found guilty of service offences may be subject to a range of sanctions ranging in severity from minor punishments to imprisonment for life (NDA, s. 139). The available sentences include dismissal from service with disgrace and dismissal without disgrace (s. 139(1)(c) and (e)).\nThe NDA also contains provisions that deal specifically with military judges who are, as previously noted, both judges and officers:\n165.21 (1) The Governor in Council may appoint any officer who is a barrister or advocate of at least 10 years standing at the bar of a province and who has been an officer for at least 10 years to be a military judge.\n\n(2) Every military judge shall, before commencing the duties of office, take the following oath of office:\n\nI ............. solemnly and sincerely promise and swear (or affirm) that I will impartially, honestly and faithfully, and to the best of my skill and knowledge, execute the powers and trusts reposed in me as a military judge. (And in the case of an oath: So help me God.)\n\n(3) A military judge holds office during good behaviour and may be removed by the Governor in Council for cause on the recommendation of the Military Judges Inquiry Committee.\n\n(4) A military judge ceases to hold office on being released at his or her request from the Canadian Forces or on attaining the age of 60 years.\n\n(5) A military judge may resign from office by giving notice in writing to the Minister. The resignation takes effect on the day on which the Minister receives the notice or on a later day that may be specified in the notice.\n\n. . .\n\n165.23 (1) Military judges shall preside at courts martial and shall perform other judicial duties under this Act that are required to be performed by military judges.\n\n(2) In addition to their judicial duties, military judges shall perform any other duties that the Chief Military Judge may direct, but those other duties may not be incompatible with their judicial duties.\n\n(3) Military judges may, with the concurrence of the Chief Military Judge, be appointed as a board of inquiry.\n\n165.231 A military judge has the same immunity from liability as a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction.\n\n165.24 (1) The Governor in Council may designate a military judge, other than a reserve force military judge, to be the Chief Military Judge.\n\n(2) The Chief Military Judge holds a rank that is not less than colonel.\n\n165.25 The Chief Military Judge assigns military judges to preside at courts martial and to perform other judicial duties under this Act.\nThe NDA also establishes the MJIC that may be charged with conducting an inquiry and making a recommendation to the Governor in Council as to whether a military judge should be removed from office:\n165.31 (1) There is established a Military Judges Inquiry Committee to which the Chief Justice of the Court Martial Appeal Court shall appoint three judges of the Court Martial Appeal Court.\n\n(2) The Chief Justice shall appoint one of the judges to act as Chairperson.\n\n(3) The inquiry committee has the same powers, rights and privileges  including the power to punish for contempt  as are vested in a superior court of criminal jurisdiction with respect to\n\n(a) the attendance, swearing and examination of witnesses;\n\n(b) the production and inspection of documents;\n\n(c) the enforcement of its orders; and\n\n(d) all other matters necessary or proper for the due exercise of its jurisdiction.\n\n165.32 (1) The Military Judges Inquiry Committee shall, on receipt of a request in writing made by the Minister, commence an inquiry as to whether a military judge should be removed from office.\n\n(2) The inquiry committee may, on receipt of any complaint or allegation in writing made in respect of a military judge, commence an inquiry as to whether the military judge should be removed from office.\n\n(3) The Chairperson of the inquiry committee may designate a judge appointed to the committee to examine a complaint or allegation referred to in subsection (2) and to recommend whether an inquiry should be commenced.\n\n(4) The military judge in respect of whom an inquiry is held shall be given reasonable notice of the inquirys subject matter and of its time and place and shall be given an opportunity, in person or by counsel, to be heard at the inquiry, to cross-examine witnesses and to adduce evidence on his or her own behalf.\n\n(5) The inquiry committee may hold an inquiry either in public or in private unless the Minister, having regard to the interests of the persons participating in the inquiry and the interests of the public, directs that the inquiry be held in public.\n\n(6) The Chairperson of the inquiry committee may engage on a temporary basis the services of counsel to assist the committee and may, subject to any applicable Treasury Board directives, establish the terms and conditions of the counsels engagement and fix their remuneration and expenses.\n\n(7) The inquiry committee may recommend to the Governor in Council that the military judge be removed if, in its opinion,\n\n(a) the military judge has become incapacitated or disabled from the due execution of his or her judicial duties by reason of\n\n(i) infirmity,\n\n(ii) having been guilty of misconduct,\n\n(iii) having failed in the due execution of his or her judicial duties, or\n\n(iv) having been placed, by his or her conduct or otherwise, in a position incompatible with the due execution of his or her judicial duties; or\n\n(b) the military judge does not satisfy the physical and medical fitness standards applicable to officers.\n\n(8) The inquiry committee shall provide to the Minister a record of each inquiry and a report of its conclusions. If the inquiry was held in public, the inquiry committee shall make its report available to the public. \nAnalysis\nImplications of Genereux\nThe appellants contest the view that Genereux decided that military judges can be military officers without offending s. 11(d) of the Charter. They seize on what they describe as Lamer C.J.s acknowledgement that military judges who are part of the chain of command cannot be truly independent. They focus on Lamer C.J.s comment that, for the law as it stood in 1992, the necessary association between the military hierarchy and military tribunals  the fact that members of the military serve on the tribunals  detracts from the absolute independence and impartiality of such tribunals (p. 294). The appellants say that it was only due to concerns of what they call practical necessity that Genereux held that the dual status of military judges was not, as a matter of principle, unconstitutional at the time. Even if the defects in the legislation at the time have been corrected since Genereux, they argue that Lamer C.J.s broader affirmation that military judges can be officers and retain their judicial independence is no longer good law.\nFor the appellants, new and uncontroversial social facts have eroded the authority of Genereux, which they argue is no longer binding precedent (citing R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 221, per Cote, Brown and Rowe JJ., concurring). They say civilian judges, particularly those who are former members of the military, would today have the necessary understanding of military life to preside over courts martial. Experience from other countries shows that civilians can realistically act as military judges in Canada. The requirement that military judges be officers under the NDA, say the appellants, violates s. 11(d) because a truly independent military judiciary requires civilian judges, contrary to what the Court held in Genereux.\nIn my view, the appellants have misread Genereux and, in doing so, have failed to identify a compelling reason to abandon settled law. While this Court may depart from precedent when a decisions rationale has been eroded by significant societal or legal change (Kirkpatrick, at para. 202; see also para. 219), the appellants have not shown that the rationale in Genereux has been eroded due to the changes that they purport to identify. \nLamer C.J. did hold that military courts must comply with s. 11(d) of the Charter and he decided that the structure and constitution of the General Court Martial, as it existed at the time of trial in Genereux, did not satisfy the requirements of judicial independence. The appellants are right that Lamer C.J. acknowledged that the place of military judges in the military hierarchy detracts from absolute judicial independence (p. 294). \nLamer C.J. confirmed, however, that s. 11(d) does not require absolute judicial independence or a sort of truly independent military judiciary that could only be assured by civilian judges (p. 295). In Genereux, he echoed an understanding of s. 11(d) adopted by the Court in a non-military setting, according to which s. 11(d) does not guarantee the ideal in judicial independence (Lippe, at p. 142, citing Valente, at p. 692). He recognized that a reasonable and informed person might well consider that the military status of a military judge would affect the judges approach to matters before the tribunal. However, wrote Lamer C.J., [t]his, in itself, is not sufficient to constitute a violation of s. 11(d) of the Charter (Genereux, at p. 295; see also J. Walker, Military Justice: from Oxymoron to Aspiration (1994), 32 Osgoode Hall L.J. 1, at p. 31; M. Madden, Keeping up with the Common Law OSullivans? The Limits of Comparative Law in the Context of Military Justice Law Reforms (2013), 51 Alta. L. Rev. 125, at p. 132). \nThe appellants repeatedly call for civilian judges as a necessary means of ensuring the truly independent military judiciary required by s. 11(d) (see A.F., at paras. 60 et seq.). But true or absolute or ideal independence is not the constitutional standard endorsed in the jurisprudence of this Court.\nI disagree with the appellants that Lamer C.J.s reasoning is no longer relevant because experience from other countries and recommendations from experts show that a truly independent military judiciary, composed of civilian judges, is realistic and practical. Lamer C.J. explained that the status of military judges as officers is designed to insure that they are sensitive to the need for discipline, obedience and duty on the part of the members of the military and also to the requirement for military efficiency (Genereux, at p. 295). He did not say that the military status of military judges was the only way that the purpose of military justice could be achieved. What he evaluated was whether Parliaments chosen method of achieving its end of fostering discipline, morale and efficiency in the military complied with the standards of s. 11(d). He decided that Parliaments legislative choice was not, in itself, unconstitutional. \nIn other words, Genereux establishes that whatever concerns might arise as a result of Parliaments choice to require that military judges be officers, that model is not inherently unconstitutional under s. 11(d). Other models  including the one of civilianized military judges proposed by the appellants  might also be constitutionally compliant. But Genereux does not stand for the proposition that, to quote the appellants written argument, an independent military judiciary requires civilian judges (A.F., at para. 63). Moreover, in identifying the need to have military judges who understand military discipline, Lamer C.J. did not decide that only one policy option would be constitutionally compliant.\nParliament may choose to adopt a regime in which military judges are not officers, but the fact that it appears to be realistic and practical elsewhere is not determinative of the issue of whether the current Canadian regime is constitutional under s. 11(d). Law reform initiatives in other countries may assist in setting government policy but do not require Parliament to follow suit, much less establish for Canadian courts that the present legislative scheme chosen by Parliament to have military officers in the judiciary is unconstitutional. Viewed in that light, and said respectfully, the appellants have invited this Court to focus on the wrong question. What is at issue is not whether the Canadian military justice system could practically function with civilian judges. Rather, the issue is whether the impugned requirement under the NDA violates the guarantee set by s. 11(d) of the Charter.\nIn service of their position that judicial independence requires civilian judges and their reading of Genereux, the appellants point to recommendations made in independent reports to the government that public perceptions of judicial independence in the military justice system would be enhanced if such measures were adopted here. They cite in particular the Report of the Third Independent Review Authority to the Minister of National Defence (2021), prepared by the Honourable Morris J. Fish (Fish Report), which proposed the civilianization of military judges to that end. The first recommendation of the Fish Report is that [m]ilitary judges should cease to be members of the Canadian Armed Forces and civilianized judges with past experience of military life should be appointed instead (para. 77). This would encourage perceptions of independence and impartiality of the military judiciary in Canada without any loss of understanding of military discipline (see ibid.). \nHowever compelling they might be as a matter of policy, these recommendations are, as Justice Fish himself made plain, not concerned with the minimum constitutional requirements set out in Genereux, Moriarity and Stillman (Fish Report, at p. iii). Justice Fish continued:\nI express no views on the constitutionality of the status of military judges. This issue is for the courts to decide. I have recounted the events that have unfolded since 2018 because they illustrate why the military status of judges may be undesirable from a policy perspective. [Emphasis in original; para. 65.] \n\n(See also para. 203.)\nI agree that the constitutionality of the impugned provisions is a matter for the courts to decide and that the suitability of various policy options, within the bounds of the Constitution, is a matter of legislative choice. Bell C.J. for the CMAC said this helpfully in Thibault: It may be that civilian judges are fit to be judges in the military justice system at the first instance level, but this decision is one for Parliament, not the judiciary, to make (para. 46 (CanLII)). As Rowe J. recalled recently in his concurring reasons in R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, [2021] 2 S.C.R. 136, courts cannot declare a statute unconstitutional simply because they disagree with legislative policy, or think a better policy may be available; courts are not fitted to undertake the inquiries that a proper policy review entails (para. 131, citing Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313, at p. 392, per Le Dain J.). \nIn any event, the CMAC in Edwards et al. dismissed the appellants motion to have the Fish Report admitted as fresh evidence. The report, given its announced policy orientation, could not have a decisive impact, as evidence, on the outcome of the constitutional question on appeal. Not only did Justice Fish expressly decline to address the constitutional issue now raised by the appellants in these appeals, his report was only designed to provide policy recommendations to the Minister of National Defence. It is of undoubted scholarly value to that end and it may be considered should Parliament choose to review the NDA. The insights from this report, along with other policy papers cited in argument, provide helpful background to understanding the military setting, as they did in a similar way in Stillman. \nBut the Fish Report was not tabled by the author to be used as evidence in a court of law, nor were its conclusions tested as such in this case. Indeed, the CMAC dismissed the appellants motion seeking to adduce the Fish Report as fresh evidence to establish their allegations. The appellants cite observations made by Justice Fish that some members of the Canadian Armed Forces believe that military judges are more lenient to officers of higher ranks, for example, and find complainants from lower ranks to be less trustworthy, as perceptions that confirm the reasonable apprehension of bias (A.F., at paras. 79-80). Given that Justice Fishs report has not been admitted as evidence, it cannot be relied upon to make findings of fact or to support a conclusion that an aspect of the military justice system raises an apprehension of bias in the mind of a reasonable and informed person. With respect, when the appellants cite comments in the Fish Report which recommend civilian judges to the Minister as a finding of fact reflecting a constitutional minimum for judicial independence, they distort the reports express purpose and appear to defy the order dismissing their fresh evidence application (see, e.g., A.F., at paras. 31, 47, 79 and 104).\nThe appellants also suggest that a crisis in public confidence undermines the present regime of military justice which, they say, confirms their view that ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA should be declared unconstitutional. The appellants point to the Report of the Independent External Comprehensive Review of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces, prepared by the Honourable Louise Arbour in May 2022, in support of their position. Justice Arbour recorded in her report that the handling of sexual misconduct by military justice has eroded trust and morale in the organization (p. 78). She noted, as one factor in this crisis, the slow development of principles of judicial independence for military judges and wrote that, in her review, she heard concerns relating to both the independence and competence of the military justice system when it comes to sexual offences (p. 79). She concluded that there should be exclusive civilian jurisdiction over some of these offences (see pp. 78-100). \nJurisdiction over sexual assault in the military, as the report by Justice Arbour makes plain, raises fundamental policy issues as to how military justice should be administered in Canadian law. The matter raised by her is a grave one that was recognized as requiring a [d]eep cultural change within the military by Moldaver and Brown JJ. in Stillman (para. 52). It may well be that there is a public confidence crisis that invites a reconfiguration of the parallel system of military justice for sexual assault. That policy work cannot be properly done in an appeal before this Court, nor should it be. These reasons should not be understood as diminishing the importance of or otherwise commenting on these findings or the findings of the Fish Report. \nThe question before this Court, bearing on the constitutional validity of ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA, is a different one from the important matters of government policy considered in these reports. This Court is not equipped to decide what might be the best policy choice for the administration of military justice. Nor is it the Courts proper role: it is only charged with the solemn duty of deciding whether the impugned provisions in the statutory regime are constitutional (see Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at pp. 496-97). I note that the task of reviewing policy for the military justice system is confided by statute to the Minister of National Defence who has a duty to cause an independent review of the operation of aspects of the NDA, including specifically the CSD, and report to Parliament (see s. 273.601 noted in Stillman, at para. 53).\nLastly, Genereux confirms that military judges enjoy sufficient independence if the essential conditions identified by this Court in Valente  security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence  are met. Based on the relevant provisions of the NDA that were in force at the time that Genereux was decided, Lamer C.J. concluded that these hallmarks of judicial independence for military judges were lacking (see pp. 309-10). Since Genereux, the NDA has been amended to strengthen the independence of military judges, as Moldaver and Brown JJ. explained in Stillman (paras. 44 and 48). \nGenereux remains relevant for the principles that animate this evaluation: s. 11(d) applies to the military justice system; a parallel system staffed by judges with military status who are sensitive to the needs of military justice does not, in itself, offend s. 11(d); and there could be different modalities for ensuring that military judges have a degree of independence that meets the constitutional minimum. Adapted to the military context, military justice is different in some respects from civilian criminal justice, but the guarantee of independence is no less Charter-compliant by reason of this difference. Genereux continues to provide useful guidance as precedent on these matters. The value of this guidance has not been eroded by the fact that some countries have civilian judges. This does not undermine the premise upon which Genereux rests: that military judges having military status does not in itself violate s. 11(d) of the Charter. Genereux does not stand for the principle that military judges must be officers in order to meet the purpose of a military justice system that fosters discipline, efficiency and morale in the military; it only says that Parliaments choice of this model is not, in itself, unconstitutional. The appellants have failed to show a basis for setting aside this principle or the precedent that gives it expression in Canadian law. \nOverall, I reject the appellants reading of Genereux and their view that, in light of social changes, s. 11(d) requires civilian judges in the military justice system. That said, given that Lamer C.J.s conclusion in Genereux that military judges did not enjoy a sufficient degree of independence was based on provisions of the NDA that have since been amended, a fresh analysis is required. \nDo the Requirements in Sections 165.21 and 165.24(2) Meet the Standards of Judicial Independence and Impartiality Under Section 11(d) of the Charter? \nThe Framework for Assessing the Independence of Military Judges\nTo assess the independence of a tribunal, a reviewing court asks whether the tribunal may be reasonably perceived as independent (Valente, at p. 689; see also Committee for Justice and Liberty, at p. 394). In Genereux, at p. 286, Lamer C.J. explained that the exercise for evaluating independence and impartiality under s. 11(d) is the same ([T]he test for this purpose is the same as the test for determining whether a decision-maker is biased. The question is whether an informed and reasonable person would perceive the tribunal as independent.). There is a strong presumption of judicial impartiality. As this Court has explained, the presumption of impartiality carries considerable weight, and the law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge (Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2003 SCC 45, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 259, at para. 59).\nThis Court has held that the reasonable and informed person has knowledge of all the relevant circumstances and view[s] the matter realistically and practically (Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 303, at para. 26, cited with approval in Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282, at para. 37; see also Valente, at pp. 684-85). The reasonable and informed person is apprised of and tak[es] into account all relevant circumstances (Cojocaru v. British Columbia Womens Hospital and Health Centre, 2013 SCC 30, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 357, at paras. 13, 28 and 36) given that they are well-informed (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 70). As the CMAC observed in Edwards et al., they are alive to the relevant contextual considerations (para. 9). They are right minded, they th[ink] the matter through, and they appl[y] themselves to the question and obtai[n] thereon the required information (Committee for Justice and Liberty, at p. 394). Ultimately, this Courts jurisprudence expect[s] a degree of mature judgment on the part of an informed public (Yukon Francophone School Board, at para. 61).\nIn Valente, this Court identified three essential conditions or hallmarks of judicial independence: security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence (pp. 694, 704 and 708; see also British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Provincial Court Judges Association of British Columbia, 2020 SCC 20, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 506, at para. 31; Conference des juges de paix magistrats du Quebec v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2016 SCC 39, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 116, at para. 33). Security of tenure requires that the judge hold office whether until an age of retirement, for a fixed term, or for a specific adjudicative task so as to secure against interference by the Executive or other appointing authority in a discretionary or arbitrary manner (Valente, at p. 698). Financial security requires that the right to salary and pension should be established by law and not be subject to arbitrary interference by the Executive in a manner that could affect judicial independence, which was later held to require that judicial remuneration be fixed through a process that includes an independent commission (p. 704; Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Provincial Judges Reference); Provincial Court Judges Association of British Columbia). Administrative independence may be summed up as judicial control over the administrative decisions that bear directly and immediately on the exercise of the judicial function (Valente, at p. 712).\nThe Three Essential Conditions of Judicial Independence Are Met Through Provisions of the NDA\nThe appellants argue that the military status of military judges raises a reasonable apprehension of bias and results in military judges having an insufficient degree of independence. \nWhile they do not systematically ground their grievances in the Valente framework, and while some of their arguments seem to straddle the distinction between independence and impartiality, the appellants focus their challenge on the constitutionality of the impugned sections of the NDA on two broad points.\nFirst, they say, the requirement that military judges be members of both the judicial and executive branches violates the constitutional imperative of the separation of powers. Specifically, s. 11(d) does not permit members of the executive branch  including military officers  to exercise core judicial functions, but they do (A.F., at para. 81). This gives rise to a perception that military judges labour under a conflict of interest, or of allegiances, between their judicial and their officer roles that could infect the independent and impartial exercise of their judicial duties. The appellants add that deference to the hierarchy within the chain of command also contributes to undermining the independence of military judges (para. 79). These considerations impugn the requirement of administrative independence, which would allow military judges to exercise their duties free from actual or perceived pressure or undue influence from others in the military hierarchy.\nThe appellants second argument pertains to the fact that, as officers, military judges are susceptible of being charged with service offences under the CSD. The appellants say that because military judges are themselves subject to prosecution before a court martial, the military hierarchy could bring pressure, or be perceived to be in a position to do so, on the judge as a threat or retaliatory measure for decisions made in the exercise of their judicial duties. This strikes in particular at the requirement that military judges must have security of tenure in order to judge matters with the confidence that they will not lose their positions as a result of the displeasure of others who are superior to them in the chain of command. It touches too on the requirement for administrative independence as that pressure may be reflected in smaller ways that interfere with their judicial work.\nBefore examining the substance of these arguments, it is useful to dispel some uncertainty in respect of the manner in which the Court interpreted s. 11(d) in Genereux. One of the interveners joins the appellants in submitting that Lamer C.J. failed to follow the usual approach of giving a purposive interpretation to Charter guarantees in applying s. 11(d) to the military judiciary. Regarding the essential conditions for judicial independence established in Valente, Lamer C.J. wrote that the conditions are susceptible to flexible application in order to suit the needs of different tribunals (Genereux, at p. 286). This reliance on flexibility, among other aspects of the case, is said to suggest that the Court was mistakenly prepared to interpret s. 11(d) as limited by the exigencies of military discipline, even though the text of the Charter indicates that there is no such limit and its purpose indicates that the guarantee should be given a wide berth. \nI disagree. \nPlainly, in circumstances like the present prosecutions where the jeopardy to the accused is comparable to that in the civilian criminal law setting, s. 11(d) cannot provide a lesser protection to a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. It would be wrong to read Lamer C.J.s reference to a flexible application of the s. 11(d) guarantee for military tribunals as a justification for a lesser form of protection. When read as a whole, Lamer C.J.s reasons show that he viewed prosecution for military offences before a court martial as broadly comparable, albeit not identical, to that of an ordinary criminal prosecution. His reasons rest on the premise that, like in civilian criminal courts, a trial before a court martial proceeds on a criminal standard, using the usual rules associated with a criminal trial. This mandates the same s. 11(d) standard for the presiding military judge. \nImportantly, to sustain his conclusion that s. 11(d) applied in the military context, Lamer C.J. relied on R. v. Wigglesworth, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541, in which Wilson J. stated that s. 11 must apply when there are true penal consequences involved (see Genereux, at pp. 280-82). In Wigglesworth, Wilson J. said that the possible deprivation of liberty in a criminal prosecution means that the accused should be entitled to the highest procedural protection known to our law (p. 562). The s. 11(d) analysis in Genereux proceeds on the premise that, for the same reasons, an accused member of the Canadian Armed Forces should be afforded the highest protection of judicial independence. Nowhere in his reasons does Lamer C.J. endorse a lesser standard of independence for courts martial as might be the case, for example, in respect of independence before administrative tribunals (see 2747-3174 Quebec Inc. v. Quebec (Regie des permis dalcool), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919, at para. 45; H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at para. X.129). \nTo my mind, the reference to flexibility in Genereux does not refer to a lesser standard of constitutional protection but to the importance of attentiveness to the military context in assessing the means used to meet that standard. Flexibility means sensitivity to the military setting but the resulting adaptation does not lessen the constitutional guarantee. The use of the word souplesse as the equivalent for flexibility in the French-language version of Lamer C.J.s reasons confirms my sense that flexibility requires s. 11(d) to bend, without breaking, to accommodate the military context. \nThose prosecuted for service offences under the CSD are indeed entitled to be tried by a judge that has the same standard of judicial independence as that of civilian judges in criminal courts. But the military context may mean that the requirements of s. 11(d) can be satisfied in ways that take into account that courts martial offer a parallel, but not identical, system of justice. The obvious example, rightly signaled by the CMAC in Edwards et al., is that a military judge must be prepared to sit in a theatre of operations, even outside Canada, in circumstances where the non-judicial military orders from the chain of command will be relevant to all the actors involved. A military judge, like others in the theatre of operations, will be subject to the chain of command. But this need not  and must not  lessen the protection of judicial independence required by the court martial proceedings by interfering with the exercise of judicial duties. Ultimately, the constitutional standards for independence and impartiality are no less rigorous for military judges than they are for civilian judges, but s. 11(d)s flexibility allows Parliament to adhere to those standards in a way that is alive to the particularities of the profession of arms. \nIn that light, the proper question is whether, understood contextually, the mechanisms put in place by Parliament meet the constitutional standard, with an eye to the objectives of military discipline particular to this form of criminal justice. The relevant context is, as Lamer C.J. explained, that military judges are sensitive to the need for discipline, obedience and duty on the part of the members of the military (Genereux, at p. 295). This military rationale does not justify a lesser standard of independence, but explains why military justice is not identical in its modalities to the civilian criminal justice system. \nTo return to the hallmarks of judicial independence, the NDA includes safeguards that ensure that each of the three essential conditions for judicial independence spoken to in Valente are met. The measure for both independence and impartiality explained in Committee for Justice and Liberty, and confirmed by the Court in both Valente and Lippe, is satisfied. The test is well known: what would a reasonable and informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically  and having thought the matter through  conclude? For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the constitutional standard, adapted to the military context, is satisfied. \nSecurity of Tenure\nThe rules on removal for cause of military judges in the NDA are sufficient to quell concerns regarding a lack of security of tenure. Contrary to the position advanced by the appellants, the fact that military judges are part of the chain of command and subject to the CSD does not undermine this aspect of their independence as judges. \nIn Ell v. Alberta, 2003 SCC 35, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 857, this Court confirmed that [t]he essence of security of tenure is that members of a tribunal be free from arbitrary or discretionary removal from office (para. 32). In order to determine whether this requirement is met, [t]he ultimate question in each case is whether a reasonable and informed person, viewing the relevant statutory provisions in their full historical context, would conclude that the court or tribunal is independent (ibid.; Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re), 2004 SCC 42, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para. 90; Conference des juges de paix magistrats du Quebec, at para. 33). When assessing whether military judges have a sufficient degree of security of tenure, the relevant provisions of the NDA that direct that they may only be removed by the Governor in Council for cause following a recommendation of the MJIC are key.\nThe Concerns Identified in Genereux Have Been Addressed\nThe concerns identified in Genereux in 1992 regarding military judges security of tenure have been answered by statutory amendment. The NDA now provides that military judges are appointed by the Governor in Council, not by their superiors in the chain of command (s. 165.21(1)), and that unless they are removed for cause, military judges hold office until they are voluntarily released from the military or resign from the position of military judge, or until they reach the age of 60 (s. 165.21(3) to (5)). While this length of tenure is not identical to that provided to federally appointed civilian judges, [translation] [t]he end of tenure, that is, the precise age of retirement, may vary to some extent from court to court (Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. X.160). Importantly, military judges are not appointed for fixed, renewable terms, a model held to have violated s. 11(d) in R. v. Leblanc, 2011 CMAC 2, 7 C.M.A.R. 559. \nTaken together, s. 165.21(1), (4) and (5) of the NDA remedy the constitutional shortcomings identified in Genereux. Lamer C.J. had decided that military judges would have sufficient security of tenure if they were appointed for fixed terms by an authority other than the Judge Advocate General. Under the present statutory regime, military judges are appointed for terms that end only upon their resignation, removal for cause or when they reach the age of 60. I share the view that providing military judges with tenure until the age of 60 really fix[ed] things (E. R. Fidell, Military Justice: A Very Short Introduction (2016), at p. 71; see also G. Letourneau, Introduction to Military Justice: an Overview of the Military Penal Justice System and its Evolution in Canada (2012), at p. 47).\nSecurity Against Removal From Office Except for Cause\nMuch like civilian judges, military judges can only be removed from office for cause (NDA, s. 165.21(3)). This Court has emphasized that, while judges may be removed for cause, this can only occur following a process conducted by a judicial discipline committee that must be composed primarily of judges (MoreauBerube v. New Brunswick (Judicial Council), 2002 SCC 11, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 249, at para. 47; see also L. Huppe, Histoire des institutions judiciaires du Canada (2007), at p. 741, citing Therrien (Re), 2001 SCC 35, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 3: [translation] . . . judicial discipline must be dealt with in the first place by peers . . .). \nThe NDA establishes such a process in a subsection of Part III, Division 6 (Code of Service Discipline  Trial by Court Martial  Military Judges  Removal for Cause). In s. 165.21(3), Parliament expressly set out a single path for the removal of a military judge from office. Removal can only be performed by the Governor in Council on recommendation by the MJIC. Respectfully, the appellants are mistaken to say that, notwithstanding this plain text that reflects a constitutional commitment to judicial independence, removal can be achieved through the backdoor as a consequence of a sanction that imposes a sentence of dismissal from the Canadian Armed Forces. Military judges hold office on good behaviour and not at pleasure; they can only be removed by the Governor in Council, for cause, upon a recommendation of their judicial peers properly convened as the MJIC (see, generally, s. 165.32(2) to (7)). As the CMAC observed in Edwards et al., [t]he MJIC established under the NDA plays a role similar to that of an Inquiry Committee established through the Canadian Judicial Council (para. 80). Members of the MJIC are three judges of the CMAC appointed by the Chief Justice of that court (s. 165.31(1)). A recommendation for removal may only be made based on specified grounds (s. 165.32(7)) following an inquiry (s. 165.32(1)), which provides the military judge the opportunity to be heard, to cross-examine witnesses and to adduce evidence (s. 165.32(4)). \nI agree with the CMAC in Edwards et al. that this is the sole basis for removing a military judge, as this Court also observed in Stillman (para. 48). I add that military judges cannot be subject to relief from performance of military duty (QR & O, art. 19.75(1)) or to performance evaluations by members of the executive (arts. 26.10 and 26.12). I agree too with its view that the MJIC does not deliver final judgment on liability under the CSD or impose any criminal or quasi-criminal penalties. Unlike a court martial for which it cannot be a substitute, the MJIC merely provides recommendations regarding the removal of military judges.\nI allow myself, however, to depart from the interpretation the CMAC provides of the expression having been guilty of misconduct in s. 165.32(7)(a)(ii) of the NDA as one basis for recommending removal for cause. The CMAC wrote in Edwards et al. that on a plain reading and contextual interpretation, this provision contemplates a conviction under the CSD, the Criminal Code or some other statute (para. 78). The equivalent French text of s. 165.32(7)(a)(ii)  manquement a lhonneur et a la dignite  suggests less plainly to me that a conviction is required. Given the fact that we received no submissions on this point, I would prefer to leave this narrow question to another day. But that does not change my sense that the CMAC was right in deciding that the requirement of removal by the Governor in Council, on recommendation by the MJIC, as the sole basis for dismissal of a judge, is a sufficient guarantee of security of tenure for the military judiciary.\nIt is true that, unlike civilian judges, military judges, as officers, are subject to the CSD. If convicted of an offence under the CSD, a military judge can be sentenced to a range of sanctions, including dismissal from the Canadian Armed Forces (NDA, s. 139(1)(c) and (e)). This might be understood as creating a backdoor means of removing a military judge (see Pett, at para. 114). If a military judge is convicted of an offence and is sentenced to dismissal from His Majestys service, that judge would lose their status as a military officer and  theoretically  lose a qualification for their judicial office pursuant to s. 165.21 of the NDA. In this sense, it might appear that a conviction under the CSD could create a risk that a military judge be removed from office without a recommendation for removal from the MJIC and without action by the Governor in Council. \nIn my respectful view, this is an untenable reading of the grounds for removal of a military judge under s. 165.21(3) of the NDA, which provides that military judges may only be removed for cause by the Governor in Council following a recommendation from the MJIC. A reasonable and informed person, looking at matters practically, including a reading of the NDA as a whole, would not view the risk of there being an indirect means of removing a military judge to be a realistic possibility.\nAs the Crown explained at the hearing, if an officer who is also a military judge is sentenced to dismissal by a court martial, action by the executive branch is required for the officer to be released from the Canadian Armed Forces (transcript, at p. 69). I pause to note that the rules on sentencing in the NDA and the regulations on release from the Canadian Armed Forces by the Governor General in the QR & O contain a regime for the timing of the effective date of dismissal of an officer from His Majestys service (see NDA, s. 141(1.1); QR & O, ch. 15; see also Pett, at para. 114). But what is ultimately important for present purposes is that s. 165.21(3) of the NDA provides that a military judge may only be removed by the Governor in Council following a recommendation of the MJIC. A military judge cannot be removed from office by a sentencing judge for dismissal or for any other reason. This reflects the requirement, shaped by s. 11(d) itself, that a judge can only be removed from office by the Governor in Council following a process conducted by a committee that must be composed primarily of judges (MoreauBerube, at para. 47). \nI note that a military judge, as an officer, could be sentenced to sanctions other than dismissal under the CSD (NDA, s. 139). These sanctions, however, would not themselves result in the removal of a military judge from office. For example, when an officer is sentenced to reduction of rank, they cannot be removed as an officer; at most, their rank can be reduced to the lowest commissioned rank (s. 140.2(a)). While military judges must be officers, there is no requirement that they hold a particular rank (s. 165.21), with the exception of the Chief Military Judge who holds a rank that is not less than colonel (s. 165.24(2)). A reduction of the Chief Military Judges rank could result in their removal from their position as Chief Military Judge, but it would not result in their removal from office as a military judge. \nFurther buttressing the security of tenure under the NDA is the rule that a military judge has the same immunity from liability as a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction (s. 165.231; see CMAC reasons in Edwards et al., at para. 13). More generally, the CMAC rightly recalled that s. 179 of the NDA, clothes military judges, in part, with the . . . powers, rights and privileges . . . as are vested in a superior court of criminal jurisdiction . . . necessary or proper for the due exercise of its jurisdiction (para. 14).\nThere is no requirement that a military judge lose their status if charges are brought against them for service offences. The appellants note that in one instance, a military judge did not preside after he was charged with service offences in 2018 (A.F., at para. 36; see Canada (Director of Military Prosecutions) v. Canada (Office of the Chief Military Judge), 2020 FC 330, [2020] 3 F.C.R. 411). However, it is noteworthy that in that case, the military judge was not removed from office, directly or in a back-door fashion, and the decision to not assign him to preside at courts martial was made by a judicial peer (Director of Military Prosecutions, at paras. 71-72).\nFinancial Security\nAlthough the appellants do not argue that military judges have an insufficient degree of financial security, I note that this requirement for judicial independence is amply met. The fact that the financial security of military judges is not contested strengthens the Crowns argument that, overall, the guarantee of judicial independence for military judges stands on strong footing.\nMilitary judges have their own remuneration scheme (NDA, s. 165.33; QR & O, ch. 204) and their compensation, including pay and other benefits, is fixed upon a recommendation of the Military Judges Compensation Committee provided every four years (CMAC reasons in Edwards et al., at para. 13). Military judges are paid for their work as judges, which addresses one of this Courts concerns respecting independence in Genereux. Much like for civilian judges, their emolument is fixed through a process that centres on an independent committee (see NDA, ss. 165.33 to 165.37). This process reflects the requirements set out in this Courts jurisprudence (see Provincial Judges Reference; Provincial Court Judges Association of British Columbia; Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Judges of the Provincial Court and Family Court of Nova Scotia, 2020 SCC 21, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 556; Conference des juges de paix magistrats du Quebec). Further, as helpfully noted by the CMAC in Edwards et al., [n]o personal report, assessment or other document shall be completed for a military judge if such a document can be used in whole or in part to determine the training, posting or rate of pay of the officer, or whether the officer is qualified to be promoted (QR&O articles 26.10 and 26.12) (para. 13).\nAdministrative Independence\nThe appellants argue that military judges lack the requisite administrative independence given their military status, which creates a conflict of allegiances. \nAdministrative independence requires that there be judicial control over the administrative decisions that bear directly and immediately on the exercise of the judicial function (Valente, at p. 712; 2747-3174 Quebec Inc., at para. 70). In Valente, administrative independence was defined . . . in narrow terms (Provincial Judges Reference, at para. 117) to include administrative functions such as assignment of judges, sittings of the court, and court lists  as well as the related matters of allocation of court rooms and direction of the administrative staff engaged in carrying out these functions (Valente, at p. 709). Le Dain J. observed that while a greater degree of administrative independence may well be highly desirable, it is not regarded as essential for purposes of s. 11(d) of the Charter (Valente, at p. 712). \nUnlike the system in place when Genereux was decided, under the present regime, military judges, including the Chief Military Judge, are responsible for the decisions that must be left to judges in order for there to be sufficient administrative independence, such as assigning military judges to preside at courts martial (s. 165.25) and establishing procedural rules (s. 165.3). These matters are insulated from non-judicial interference by the chain of command. As such, the requirements of administrative independence are met.\nArguments Advanced by the Appellants That Impugn the Institutional Impartiality of Military Judges \nThe appellants are unmoved by the Crowns assertion that the safeguards of judicial independence and impartiality in the NDA adequately protect against a violation of s. 11(d). They say the statutory safeguards of security of tenure, financial security, and the limits on assignment of duties are meaningless (A.F., at para. 91). They return to their two broad arguments to say that military judges place in the executive branch and their exposure to prosecution for CSD offences ground a reasonable perception that they are not impartial. \nAs mentioned above, the appellants have advanced arguments that straddle the line between judicial independence and impartiality. Judicial independence and impartiality are closely related but distinct concepts. Judicial independence is, as Le Dain J. explained, a status or relationship resting on objective conditions or guarantees, as well as a state of mind or attitude in the actual exercise of judicial functions (Valente, at p. 689). When these objective guarantees are satisfied such that a court, in the eyes of a reasonable and informed person, can be perceived to be independent and is actually independent, they ensure that, considering all of their characteristics, the structures of judicial and quasi-judicial bodies do not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias (2747-3174 Quebec Inc., at para. 45). \nEven if the reasonable and informed person would conclude that a court is independent, they may come to the conclusion that the court is not impartial at either the individual or the institutional level (see R. v. Kokopenace, 2015 SCC 28, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 398, at para. 49). Independent courts benefit from a strong presumption of judicial impartiality that is not easily displaced (Yukon Francophone School Board, at para. 25). That said, if a reasonable and informed person would think that it is more likely than not that [the court], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly (Committee for Justice and Liberty, at p. 394) because of individual or institutional concerns, the impartiality of the court may be challenged (Lippe, at pp. 144-45). \nThe appellants arguments that do not fall neatly within the three hallmarks of judicial independence identified in Valente are in essence challenges to the institutional impartiality of military judges. They argue that military judges are, because of the institutional concerns that they have identified, incapable of being perceived to be impartial. In my view, the appellants have failed to show that a reasonable and informed person would have a reasonable apprehension of bias because military judges are both judges and officers. \nFirst, I disagree with the appellants that military judges, as members of the executive, are in an irretrievable conflict of interest with their judicial role and that this violates the constitutional principle of separation of powers.\nI reject the appellants proposition that the requirement of s. 165.21 of the NDA violates the principle of separation of powers in that it directs members of the executive to exercise core judicial functions. While military judges must be officers, the manner in which their role as judges is circumscribed makes it plain that they do not act as members of the executive when they perform their judicial duties (s. 165.23(1)). These judicial duties, which extend beyond presiding at court martial to include all duties that are connected with their decision-making functions and the administration of the military justice system, are assigned by the Chief Military Judge (s. 165.25). When acting as judges, military judges can be assigned other duties by the Chief Military Judge in addition to their judicial tasks, but those other duties may not be incompatible with their judicial duties (s. 165.23(2)). Military judges do have the status of officer  they may well have, as was said at the hearing, two hats  but they do not wear their executive hat when they perform their judicial duties. \nIn Genereux, Lamer C.J. expressed concern that the executive branch was directly involved in court martial administration in matters such as assignment of judges, sittings of the court and court lists (p. 286). While some relations between the executive and the judiciary are institutionally necessary, he acknowledged, such relations must not interfere with the judiciarys liberty in adjudicating individual disputes and in upholding the law and values of the Constitution (ibid.; see also p. 308). But military judges are protected from interference by the executive in their judicial duties. As the CMAC in Edwards et al. noted, military judges have their own, separate grievance procedure (NDA, s. 29(2.1)), and have protections when their work is evaluated (QR & O, art. 26.10). \nWhile I do not doubt that military culture is based on a respect for hierarchical authority, the appellants have brought no substantial proof that, as a matter of constitutional law, that culture undermines the independence or impartiality of military judges. To support their argument, they cite excerpts from the Fish Report in which members of the Canadian Armed Forces expressed a sense that military judges favoured officers of a higher rank (A.F., at para. 79). These accounts, which are not part of the evidentiary record, fall short of the evidentiary standard required to declare provisions of the NDA unconstitutional. \nThe appellants argue that military judges can be reasonably perceived to be in a conflict. Strictly speaking, the problem raised by the appellants is not so much the conflict of interest where a judge must resist a personal interest that threatens, or might be perceived to threaten, the impartiality with which they must do their work. Instead, it is what one scholar has called a conflict of duty and duty that arises in relation to the exercise of judgment (L. Smith, The Law of Loyalty (2023), at p. 160). The appellants say that, as officers, military judges must comply with orders from the military hierarchy. As judges, they must protect the accuseds rights. This conflict of duty and duty pulls them in different directions. This, say the appellants, leads to a perception that they may favour their duty to the military hierarchy over that owed to the persons brought before them at court martial.\nI respectfully disagree. It is true that military judges have dual allegiance, but the NDA separates their judicial and non-judicial duties. To the extent that military judges engage in non-judicial duties, these duties are assigned by the Chief Military Judge and may not be incompatible with their judicial duties (s. 165.23(2)). Moreover, all judges have multiple loyalties and duties that can compete for their attention. In MacKay, this Court confronted a similar argument made under the Canadian Bill of Rights, S.C. 1960, c. 44, and answered it in words that remain compelling today. It was argued that, by reason of their sense of belonging to the military, officers were unsuited to exercise a judicial office. In his concurring reasons, McIntyre J. acknowledged candidly that [i]t would be impossible to deny that an officer is to some extent the representative of the class in the military hierarchy from which he comes; he would be less than human if he were not (p. 403). But he rejected the argument that this conflict of duties disqualified officers as judges:\nBut the same argument, with equal fairness, can be raised against those who are appointed to judicial office in the civilian society. We are all products of our separate backgrounds and we must all in the exercise of the judicial office ensure that no injustice results from that fact. I am unable to say that service officers, trained in the ways of service life and concerned to maintain the required standards of efficiency and discipline  which includes the welfare of their men  are less able to adjust their attitudes to meet the duty of impartiality required of them in this task than are others. [pp. 403-4]\nI agree with McIntyre J. that military judges can lay aside their duties and allegiances as officers when they exercise their judicial duties. This is the sense of the oath of office, set forth in s. 165.21(2) of the NDA that all military judges must take: to solemnly and sincerely promise that they will impartially, honestly and faithfully, and to the best of [their] skill and knowledge, execute the powers and trusts reposed in [them] as a military judge. This gives voice to the commitment that they will endeavour to keep improper influences, including those relating to their status as officers, at bay. In a circumstance in which they feel that they cannot do so or be reasonably perceived to do so, military judges must recuse themselves. Military judges must, when they perform their judicial duties, set aside the culture of hierarchy that exists in the military in order to comply with their oath to act impartially. Although not designed specifically for military judges, the reasonable and informed person would expect that, to comply with their oath of office, military judges will act, with necessary adaptations for the military context, in accordance with the Ethical Principles for Judges (2021) published by the Canadian Judicial Council. The introduction regarding these principles provides that [a] judge must be and be seen to be free to decide honestly and impartially on the basis of the law and the evidence, without external pressure or influence and without fear of interference from anyone (p. 7). The oath and the relevant ethical principles guide how judging is undertaken across the judiciary, both in the individual conscience of a judge and institutionally. The reasonable and informed person can rightly draw comfort that this sustains judicial independence for military judges. \nThe oath is not a guarantee of actual impartiality, nor is it a fail proof protection against perceived bias. However, taking a judicial oath is a serious matter. Robert J. Sharpe, writing extrajudicially, has observed that [w]hen they take their oath of office, all judges make a solemn commitment to decide cases according to the law, which is the most fundamental and obvious constraint that judges must accept (Good Judgment: Making Judicial Decisions (2018), at p. 126). A judicial oath is a solemn and public commitment to act impartially. Therefore, [translation] the judicial oath gives litigants a guarantee that conscientious judges personally accept the constraints of justice that is based on the law (L. Huppe, Les fondements de la deontologie judiciaire (2004), 45 C. de D. 93, at p. 121). Given the seriousness of this commitment, there is a strong presumption that a judge will ac[t] with integrity and in accordance with his or her oath of office (R. v. Teskey, 2007 SCC 25, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 267, at para. 28). When a judges impartiality is challenged in a court of law, [s]ignificant weight is placed on the oath of office and on professional integrity, pride, and training (Sharpe, at p. 254, referring to the Constitutional Court of South Africas decision in President of the Republic of South Africa v. South African Rugby Football Union, [1999] ZACC 9, 1999 (7) B.C.L.R. 725). The reasonable and informed person would expect that military judges will abide by their oath of office and have confidence that, given their legal training and experience, they will set aside improper influences or recuse themselves if they ever feel that they cannot do so.\nThe second broad objection that the appellants raise concerns the possible liability of military judges to discipline under the CSD. They may be perceived to be subject to the threat of prosecution should they decide cases against the interests of the military establishment. The appellants say that this creates, at the very least, an appearance of partiality for military judges (A.F., at para. 96 (emphasis deleted), citing Director of Military Prosecutions, at para. 72).\nThe CMAC in Edwards et al. was right to reject this argument. A reasonable and informed person would accept the fact that military judges are not above the law as the Crown says (R.F., at paras. 4, 29 and 49) and that when they act outside their judicial functions, they can be held accountable for their conduct as would other members of the Canadian Armed Forces. I agree with the view that there are sufficient protections against a perception taking hold that the status of military judges as officers exposes them to interference by the executive in the exercise of their judicial functions.\nFirst, a purely retaliatory prosecution of a military judge would be an unlawful prosecution. Likewise, an order against a military judge made on the basis of a threat of prosecution would likely be an unlawful order.\nIt is true that, as officers, military judges are part of the chain of command, and must comply with lawful orders issued by superior officers. If they fail to comply with a lawful order, they could be subject to discipline under the CSD (NDA, s. 83). In the profession of arms, Parliament has determined that it is essential that all personnel, including military judges, be subject to lawful orders. As the CMAC correctly noted in Edwards et al., [a]dherence to orders that could include standing orders related to responses in the event of an attack, might be the difference between life and death (para. 62). Military judges must comply with lawful orders that are necessary to assure the maintenance of discipline, efficiency and morale of the military (R. v. Moriarity, 2015 SCC 55, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 485, at para. 46). All lawful orders must be unquestioningly obeyed (R. v. Billard, 2008 CMAC 4, 7 C.M.A.R. 238, at para. 8) unless they are manifestly unlawful, which means that they offen[d] the conscience of every reasonable, right-thinking person because they are obviously and flagrantly wrong (R. v. Finta, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 701, at p. 834). \nUnlike civilian judges, military judges are subject to orders from superior officers that are necessary to advance legitimate military purposes. This is a particularity of life as a military judge since, unlike for civilian judges, there is necessity for portability and flexibility . . . [especially] in deployed operations, particularly extraterritorial deployments outside the domestic territory of the sending state (Gibson, at p. 386). Canadians expect, as the CMAC correctly observed in Edwards et al., an operationally ready and portable courts martial system (para. 8). Discipline is essential in the military to protect those ordered into harms way and to ensure the responsible use of Canadas military capabilities. As officers who are regularly present in military settings and may be deployed to theatres of operations at any time, military judges must, outside of their judicial work, comply with lawful orders from superior officers and behave in a manner that befits an officer to whom the defence of Canada is entrusted. The reasonable and informed observer would understand this unique feature of military justice and, indeed, expect nothing less. But this cannot interfere with the exercise of military judges judicial duties. Applicable outside of their judicial work, it does not lessen the protection of s. 11(d) of the Charter in military justice.\nThe appellants say it is possible to envision scenarios in which a superior officer issues an order to a military judge that would influence their judicial work in a way that would undermine their independence or impartiality. But the reasonable and informed person would understand that such orders that compromise judicial independence would be issued unlawfully. \nWhile members of the chain of command have wide discretion to give lawful orders, that discretion does not extend to allow orders that have the purpose of impairing the work of military judges without a valid military purpose (see, generally, R. v. Lalande, 2011 CM 2005, at para. 35 (CanLII)). As de Montigny J.A. (as he then was) wrote, [a]n order that is not related to military duty would obviously not meet the necessary threshold of lawfulness. In other words, a command that has no clear military purpose will be considered manifestly unlawful (R. v. Liwyj, 2010 CMAC 6, 7 C.M.A.R. 481, at para. 24). Superior officers in the chain of command may not abuse their discretion to issue orders that interfere with the work of military judges without a valid military purpose. \nThe reasonable and informed person would not be concerned that military judges status as officers would subject them to arbitrary or unlawful orders from superior officers that could undermine their independence or impartiality as judges. \nThe reasonable and informed person would be aware of the many safeguards in place to prevent a military judge from being prosecuted for violating an unlawful order. \nBefore laying a charge under the CSD, the person must receive legal advice concerning the sufficiency of the evidence and the appropriateness of the charge in the circumstances (QR & O, art. 102.07(2)(b)). That person is required to have a reasonable belief that a service offence was committed (see R. v. Edmunds, 2018 CMAC 2, 8 C.M.A.R. 260).\nAnother key safeguard to prevent improper prosecutions is the independence of the Director of Military Prosecutions (DMP). Although there are many officers that are superior in rank to military judges in the chain of command, under the October 2, 2019 Order issued by the Chief of the Defence Staff, a single commanding officer  the Deputy Vice Chief of Defence Staff  was, prior to the Orders suspension, designated to exercise the powers and jurisdiction of a commanding officer with respect to any disciplinary matter involving a military judge (R.R., tab 1; see also Pett, at para. 9). Should the Deputy Vice Chief of Defence Staff decide to raise a disciplinary matter against a military judge, charges cannot proceed to a court martial without the authorization of the DMP (NDA, ss. 161.1(1), 165, 165.11 and 165.15). In practice, this means that the DMP screens charges that are laid against members of the Canadian Armed Forces. In exercising prosecutorial discretion, which is quasi-judicial in nature, the DMP must act independently of partisan concerns, which means that the DMP must make decisions independently of the chain of command (see R. v. Cawthorne, 2016 SCC 32, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 983, at para. 31). Under the applicable DMP Policy Directive # 002/00, Pre-Charge Screening, updated September 1, 2018 (online), the DMP must guard against a perception or view of the case simply adopted from the views or enthusiasm of others . . . and maintain the independence and integrity required to fairly reassess a case as it evolves (para. 33). Ultimately, when exercising their discretion, military prosecutors, play the same role as Crown attorneys in the civilian justice system and are not advocates for the chain of command (Fish Report, at para. 122, citing Boucher v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, at pp. 23-24).\nIt is true that the DMP performs some duties under the supervision of the Judge Advocate General (JAG) and that the JAG may issue general guidelines or instructions on prosecutions (NDA, s. 165.17). However, if the JAG issues guidelines or instructions on a particular prosecution, this must generally be disclosed to the public (s. 165.17(4) and (5)), and the JAGs annual report on the administration of military justice must be tabled in Parliament (s. 9.3(3)). These serve as further measures of transparency and accountability in respect of prosecutions. \nThe DMP is presumed to exercise prosecutorial discretion independently and to act in good faith (see Cawthorne, at paras. 31-32). If a member of the Canadian Armed Forces  including a military judge  alleges that the DMP has acted improperly, the remedies for malicious prosecution and abuse of process are sufficient to deal with that unlikely prospect, as the CMAC observed in Edwards et al. (para. 92). Overall, the reasonable and informed person would know that the DMP must exercise prosecutorial discretion independently from the chain of command and that, if the DMP fails to perform their duty to act in an independent quasi-judicial manner, a claim for malicious prosecution or abuse of process may be brought.\nIt is true that this Court has rejected the idea that otherwise unconstitutional laws may be insulated through the exercise of prosecutorial discretion as to when and to whom the laws apply since unconstitutional laws are null and void (R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 91). However, to the extent that one accepts that the chain of command may issue lawful orders and engage in lawful prosecutions, concerns regarding abuse of that authority target exercises of discretion, not the NDA itself. The possibility that a military judge will be prosecuted for violating an order from the chain of command that is unlawful raises concerns of an improper prosecution, not a concern that a provision of the NDA is unconstitutional. \nThe appellants argue that executive pressure on military judges worsened with amendments to the NDA enacted in 2019. Under a revised regime, certain officers have jurisdiction to conduct a summary hearing in respect of a person charged with having committed a service infraction where the person charged is an officer who is at least one rank below the rank of the superior commander, commanding officer or delegated officer, or is a non-commissioned member. The former rule (NDA, s. 164(1.3)) that exempted military judges from the summary hearing regime in s. 164(1.1) was repealed (An Act to amend the National Defence Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 15, s. 25). A military judge can now be charged with commission of a service infraction and may be held liable for sanctions, the most severe of which is reduction of rank.\nWhile they acknowledge that the substance of these appeals bears on courts martial and service offences, the appellants say the fact that military judges are now vulnerable to prosecution for service infractions contributes to a real or perceived lack of independence. Summary hearings are for service infractions only, are command-centric, and are decided on a balance of probabilities. Service infractions are created by regulation made by the Governor in Council and extend to a wide range of misconduct, including infractions bearing on property, information, military service and drugs and alcohol (see QR & O, ch. 120). The regime allows for the imposition of meaningful sanctions (NDA, s. 162.7). The appellants say the exposure to such prosecution could have an improper influence on military judges exercise of judicial duties.\nIt is true that service infractions arising from conduct that is alleged to have occurred outside of a military judges judicial duties could theoretically be misused by a superior officer to threaten or take retaliatory measures. But a reasonable and informed person, considering the matter realistically and practically, would not see this as grounding an apprehension of bias. \nService infractions were reconfigured by the 2019 amendments to remove their criminal nature. Service infractions are not . . . offence[s] under the NDA (s. 162.5; QR & O, art. 120.01). Importantly, they are not criminal or quasi-criminal in nature and are not prosecuted, as would a service offence, before a court martial pursuant to the usual rules and standards of criminal law. While there are sanctions in the case of violation, these are not true penal consequences as spoken to in Wigglesworth and Genereux. Summary hearings are designed to ensure discipline, in the military sense, on more minor matters in order to foster morale and efficiency. Military judges are subject to this discipline and where it does not interfere with the exercise of their judicial duties, it is an ordinary feature of military life that would not attract the concern of a reasonable and informed person. Moreover, any arbitrary use of summary hearings against a military judge would plainly be unlawful, a matter that a reasonable and informed person would understand. In sum, I disagree with the appellants characterization that service infractions allow officers to punish military judges in a manner that, on a reasonable standard, might be perceived to interfere with judicial independence (A.F., at paras. 50 and 99). \nI recognize that, in these cases, the military judges themselves have asserted their sense that they lack independence. But I share the view of the CMAC in Edwards et al. that where the test of the reasonable and informed person is properly applied  where the matter is looked at realistically and practically  the safeguards of the independence and impartiality of military judges are sufficient (para. 9). Overall, the appellants have failed to show that the reasonable and informed person would be concerned that the independence or impartiality of military judges can be undermined because of their status as officers that makes them subject to the CSD. No violation of s. 11(d) of the Charter has been shown.\nConclusion\nIn light of my conclusion that military judges status as officers under the NDA is not incompatible with their judicial functions for the purposes of s. 11(d) of the Charter, I would reject the appellants invitation to declare ss. 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Accordingly, I would dismiss all the appeals.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tKarakatsanis J.  \nIntroduction\nI agree with Kasirer J. that the requirement that military judges presiding over courts martial also have the military status of officers does not necessarily contravene a member of the Canadian Armed Forces right, under s. 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to be tried by an independent and impartial tribunal. Properly designed and protected, the dual roles can, in principle, co-exist. But R. v. Genereux, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 259, also acknowledged that the status of military judges as officers within the military executive hierarchy raises challenges for judicial independence that do not arise with civilian judges and must be specifically alleviated by the legislative scheme.\nMany concerns identified in Genereux over 30 years ago have since been addressed. Military judges now benefit from security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence  three hallmarks of judicial independence set out in Valente v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673. But they also continue to be liable to discipline by the military executive, now for a broader range of misconduct, which includes offences under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. This discipline can result in penal consequences, including imprisonment, discharge from the military, disqualification as an officer and, ultimately, as a military judge.\nThus the question remains: are military personnel charged with an offence guaranteed a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under s. 11(d) of the Charter? Put differently, would a reasonable and informed person be concerned about the pressures military judges face as part of the executive, particularly given their disciplinary accountability towards their hierarchical superiors? \nIn my view, the answer is yes. There are insufficient safeguards in place to alleviate the potential risk of interference by the military chain of command. Because they are required to be officers, military judges form part of the chain of command and are subject to discipline by their superiors. Given the executives ability to bring disciplinary charges against a military judge, a reasonable and informed person facing a court martial would apprehend that the military judge could be unduly influenced by a loyalty to rank and by the position or policies of the military hierarchy, to the detriment of their individual rights. There is not enough institutional separation  or independence  between the executive and the judicial role. In this conclusion, I respectfully disagree with the majority.\nJudicial independence is a constitutional imperative. It is the foundation of the rule of law, the separation of powers and our constitutional democracy. It cannot be sacrificed in pursuit of military objectives like good order and discipline or discipline, efficiency and morale. Much like civilian judges, military judges are accountable for their misconduct through the civilian criminal system and a judicial oversight committee, the Military Judges Inquiry Committee (MJIC). But their added liability for military charges under a disciplinary regime that can be launched and prosecuted by the executive runs counter to s. 11(d) of the Charter. I would allow the appeals and declare the legislative scheme under the NDA of no force or effect insofar as it subjects military judges to the disciplinary process administered by military authorities.\nBackground\nIn each of the cases before us, the military judge in the court martial interpreted the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5 (NDA), and concluded that various administrative orders adopted by the chain of command specifically targeting military judges  and contemplating the imposition of discipline under the Code of Service Discipline (CSD) during their tenure  meant they were not immune from executive interference. Having found that the accuseds Charter right to an independent and impartial tribunal had been violated, the court ordered a stay or a termination of proceedings for eight of the nine appellants (R. v. Edwards, 2020 CM 3006; R. v. Crepeau, 2020 CM 3007; R. v. Fontaine, 2020 CM 3008; R. v. Iredale, 2020 CM 4011; R. v. Christmas, 2020 CM 3009; R. v. Proulx, 2020 CM 4012; R. v. Cloutier, 2020 CM 4013; R. v. Brown, 2021 CM 4003). The exception was the appellant Sgt. Thibault (R. v. Thibault, 2020 CM 5005), who raised s. 11(d) only on appeal of his conviction. \nThese appeals stem from a series of decisions, over the course of 15 reported cases affecting 17 members of the Armed Forces, in which courts martial invariably took the view that if discipline of military judges was imposed by the military hierarchy, a reasonable person would form the perception that military judges lack independence from government at an institutional level. (The cases not before us are R. v. Pett, 2020 CM 4002; R. v. DAmico, 2020 CM 2002; R. v. Bourque, 2020 CM 2008; R. v. MacPherson and Chauhan and J.L., 2020 CM 2012; R. v. Cogswell, 2020 CM 2014; R. v. Jacques, 2020 CM 3010; R. v. Pepin, 2021 CM 3005.)\nIn all of those decisions, the military judges proceeded on the understanding that under the NDA, they were exempt from disciplinary or administrative measures taken under the CSD, unless first administered by peers via the MJIC (see, e.g., Pett, at paras. 58-62 and 104-16 (CanLII)).\nThis interpretation of the MJIC scheme was rejected both by the Court Martial Appeal Court (CMAC) and by the majority in this Court. Sitting military judges are not protected from liability for CSD offences during their tenure, and can be prosecuted by military authorities (R. v. Edwards, 2021 CMAC 2, at paras. 78 and 86 (CanLII); see, e.g., majoritys reasons, at para. 107).\nIn four separate decisions, the CMAC allowed the Crowns appeals, set aside the stays, and ordered the trials to proceed for eight of the nine appellants before this Court. In a fifth decision, the CMAC dismissed Sgt. Thibaults appeal and affirmed his conviction (Edwards; R. v. Proulx, 2021 CMAC 3; R. v. Christmas, 2022 CMAC 1; R. v. Brown, 2022 CMAC 2; R. v. Thibault, 2022 CMAC 3).\nAnalysis \nBefore this Court, the appellants insist the legislative scheme under the NDA deprives them of their s. 11(d) Charter right to be tried by an independent and impartial judge. In doing so, they mainly focus on the military judges status as officers in the Armed Forces. However, they also challenged the vulnerability of military judges to discipline by the chain of command. This was the main focus of the courts martial decisions under appeal.\nI accept the majoritys conclusion that properly designed and protected, the dual status of military judge and officer is not necessarily incompatible with the Charter. The executive and judicial roles can coexist. I also accept that under the NDA, military judges can, as officers, be accountable for CSD offences. The key issue on which we differ is whether the ability of the executive  commanding officers  to impose discipline on military judges gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that the executive can influence or interfere with the role of military judges.\nLegal Principles\nOur jurisprudence has stressed the fundamental importance of the separation of powers in maintaining judicial independence, in particular from the executive branch (Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia (General Manager, Liquor Control and Licensing Branch), 2001 SCC 52, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 781, at paras. 23-24; Beauregard v. Canada, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 56, at p. 69; 2747-3174 Quebec Inc. v. Quebec (Regie des permis dalcool), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919, at para. 61). Judges must be free to decide according to their own conscience, and no outside interference may compel or pressure a decision maker (IWA v. Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 282, at pp. 332-33). \nNot only is institutional independence inextricably bound up with the separation of powers, but the executive cannot even appear t[o] exert . . . pressure on the judiciary (Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 138 and 140 (emphasis added); see also References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 175, at para. 285, per Cote J. dissenting, but not on this point).\nIn Mackin v. New Brunswick (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 13, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 405, our Court said that judges must remain as far as possible sheltered from pressure and interference from all sources, and that the role of the judge requires that he or she be completely independent of any other entity in the performance of his or her judicial functions (paras. 35-36). The nature of the relationship between a court and others must be marked by a form of intellectual separation that allows the judge to render decisions based solely on the requirements of the law and justice (para. 37).\nAs the majority notes, independence and impartiality are distinct ideas. However, the two concepts often overlap. Most notably, independence is an underlying condition that contributes to the guarantee of an impartial hearing (MacKeigan v. Hickman, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 796, at p. 826; R. v. Lippe, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 114, at p. 139). \nIn the military context, judicial independence is analyzed under those same principles. As the majority states, the standard of independence for military judges is no less than for civilian judges (paras. 93-96). Lamer C.J. emphasized in Genereux that, [i]t is important that military tribunals be as free as possible from the interference of the members of the military hierarchy, that is, the persons who are responsible for maintaining the discipline, efficiency and morale of the Armed Forces (p. 308). Lamer C.J. recognized that the necessary association between the military hierarchy and military tribunals  the fact that members of the military serve on the tribunals  detracts from the absolute independence and impartiality of such tribunals (p. 294).\nThe respondent Crown urges us to apply Valente and conclude that military judges benefit from sufficient independence. Valente does not, however, provide a complete answer. Even where the hallmarks of security of tenure, financial security and administrative independence are met, a particular tribunal will still lack institutional independence if there is the appearance that it cannot perform its adjudicative role without interference (British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2005 SCC 49, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 473, at para. 47; Application under s. 83.28 of the Criminal Code (Re), 2004 SCC 42, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 248, at paras. 82-92).\nHere, the appellants core complaint is that the threat of discipline through the chain of command may affect military judges in their judicial role thereby infringing their right under s. 11(d). They argue that, in this context, even if the minimum Valente hallmarks have been met, a risk remains that military judges may be unduly influenced by the policy, priorities and position of the executive.\nClearly, judicial discipline and accountability are important imperatives of broader social policy. Our Court has acknowledged that although judicial accountability and independence can be in tension, judges remain accountable for their conduct through ethical and professional rules of conduct. This encroachment on their independence finds justification in the need to protect the integrity of the administration of justice (Moreau-Berube v. New Brunswick (Judicial Council), 2002 SCC 11, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 249, at paras. 58-59).\nHowever, as a matter of principle, the judiciary is not answerable to the executive or to elected officials within government (L. Huppe, La deontologie de la magistrature: Droit canadien: perspective internationale (2018), at para. 26). In matters of discipline, the separation between the judiciary and the other branches of government is necessary to avoid the appearance of any intervention based on public opinion and political expediency. This principle has also been recognized internationally (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Commentary on the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct (2007), at para. 16; see also the preamble to the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, U.N. Doc. E/RES/2006/23, July 27, 2006, which states that the requirement for high standards of judicial conduct lies with the judiciary in each country).\nOutside the military context, the oversight of the misconduct of federally appointed judges is the responsibility of the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC). A key rationale for the CJC is to permit judicial accountability while ensuring judicial independence (see M. L. Friedland, A Place Apart: Judicial Independence and Accountability in Canada (1995), at. pp. 87-90). Complaints of misconduct are mainly reviewed by judges, but also lay persons and members of the bar (Judges Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. J-1, ss. 98(1) and 117(1)). Section 102 of the Judges Act contemplates alternative sanctions short of removal from office. To protect security of tenure, judges can only be removed from office on the recommendation of the CJC and with approval of both chambers of Parliament. Similar regimes apply to provincially appointed judges.\nThe foundational importance of keeping judicial discipline free of direct government influence has found echo in our case law. In Lippe, this Court stated that even in the hypothetical scenario where legislation would permit for the discipline of municipal judges by the Barreau du Quebec, such provisions would raise problems of judicial independence (p. 138). In Therrien (Re), 2001 SCC 35, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 57, and further in Moreau-Berube, at para. 47, our Court emphasized that in the interests of judicial independence, it is important that discipline be dealt with in the first place by peers, and cited these remarks by Professor H. P. Glenn in his article Independance et deontologie judiciaires (1995), 55 R. du B. 295, at p. 308:\n[translation] If we take as our starting point the principle of judicial independence  and I emphasize the need for this starting point in our historical, cultural and institutional context  I believe that it must be concluded that the primary responsibility for the exercise of disciplinary authority lies with the judges at the same level. To place the real disciplinary authority outside that level would call judicial independence into question.\nIn the present case, we are not tasked with determining the outer boundaries of judicial accountability. Military judges, like civilian judges, are accountable for any judicial misconduct, through an oversight committee. In principle, military judges can also be accountable for military offences based on their status as officers. But the design of the disciplinary regime must respect judicial independence and the separation of powers. And our jurisprudence suggests that the disciplinary regime should be as free as possible from the executive. It is in this context that the legislative scheme in the NDA must be assessed to determine if it is incompatible with judicial independence. \nThe Disciplinary Framework Applicable to Military Judges\nLike their civilian counterparts, military judges are subject to the civilian criminal justice system; and to a judicial committee for misconduct incompatible with their judicial role. However, unlike civilian judges, military judges are also answerable for their conduct to their superiors within the chain of command.\nThe militarys chain of command refers to an authority and accountability chain, running from the head of state through the Chief of the Defence Staff, to all members of the Armed Forces (G. Letourneau and M. W. Drapeau, Military Justice in Action: Annotated National Defence Legislation (2nd ed. 2015), at p. 137). The custom of the service and the governing legislation compel superior officers to take corrective action whenever they believe their subordinates have acted contrary to good order and discipline (NDA, ss. 19 and 49; Queens Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Forces (QR & O), arts. 1.13 and 3.20).\nBy holding a military rank, military judges are subject to the Code of Service Discipline in Part III of the NDA, as administered and applied by the chain of command. They belong to the same institution responsible for laying charges against them and against the members who appear before them. Military judges are liable to be disciplined by members above them in the military hierarchy. Notably, superior officers have the ability to order an investigation and decide when or not to lay a charge (QR & O, arts. 102.02 and 102.04). Above active military judges, there are four ranks (NDA, Sch.). \nOne component of discipline in the military is the necessity to follow orders. But [d]isobedience of lawful command (NDA, s. 83) is only one of many service offences that can be prosecuted under the CSD. \nTo give only a few examples of service offences (in the NDA):\nSection 85 targets [i]nsubordinate behaviour, which is conduct that may compromise the respect and obedience required towar[d] a superior officer. \n\nSection 90 creates the service offence of absence without leave.\n\nSections 92 and 93 target disgraceful or scandalous conduct, including any behaviour considered unbecoming an officer. \n\nSection 97 creates the service offence of [d]runkenness.\n\nSection 129 covers [a]ny act, conduct, disorder or neglect considered to be to the prejudice of good order and discipline. Other than absence without leave (NDA, s. 90(1)), it is by far the most commonly relied on disciplinary offence (M. J. Fish, Report of the Third Independent Review Authority to the Minister of National Defence (2021) (Fish Report), at para. 280). \nMilitary judges are subject to these disciplinary offences whether they are acting in a theatre of operations or not. They are subject to them even in their capacity as judges (Pett, at para. 45). \nSome of these offences are vague and imprecise, as they aim to punish a wide range of conduct (G. Letourneau, Combattre linjustice et reformer (2015), at pp. 162-63; Fish Report, at paras. 277-80; L. Arbour, Report of the Independent External Comprehensive Review of the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces (2022) (Arbour Report), at p. 90). They allow for wide discretion and subjective interpretation by prosecuting authorities. Section 129, for example, applies if the conduct tends to or is likely to result in prejudice to good order and discipline (R. v. Golzari, 2017 CMAC 3, 8 C.M.A.R. 106, at paras. 74-81). Many of these offences capture the kind of misconduct typically reserved to judicial oversight committees, which our jurisprudence warns should not be administered by the executive if we are to respect judicial independence (Lippe, at p. 138; Moreau-Berube, at para. 47; Therrien (Re), at para. 57).\nThe Crown argues that military judges are in no different position than civilian judges, who are also liable to be prosecuted by the state for criminal behaviour. Military discipline is like criminal law: exempting judges from criminal, penal and regulatory law would have a devastating effect on the publics confidence in the administration of justice (R.F., at para. 49). \nI agree that no judge is above the law. But the comparison with civilian judges within the criminal justice system merely highlights the additional disciplinary regime faced by military judges. On being convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer or conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, or any other similar disciplinary charges unique to the military, members of the Armed Forces including military judges may face dismissal from the Forces, a criminal record, and life-time imprisonment (NDA, ss. 139(1)(a) and (e) and 249.27). \nMoreover, under s. 130(1) of the NDA, military judges can face military prosecution for offences already covered by the Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament. But the decision to proceed under the military justice system can have a significant impact on the rights of military personnel including military judges. For example, military personnel facing charges before courts martial lose the right to a jury trial, to a preliminary inquiry, to the benefits of a hybrid offence, to a broader range of available sentences and to appeal with leave on certain questions of fact (M. W. Drapeau and G. Letourneau, in collaboration with J. Juneau and S. Bedard, Canadas Military Justice System is in a Meltdown: Will Government Act? (2021), at pp. 14-18). Our parallel system of military justice now includes offences under the Criminal Code and other Acts of Parliament. While it has been constitutionally upheld, given the breadth of CSD service offences and the impacts on rights, at a minimum, the standard for the independence of the tribunal must be the same as in a criminal trial.  \nIn sum, military judges, in stark contrast to civilian judges, face not only prosecution before civilian courts, but also discipline through the chain of command. The role played by military discipline has no equivalent in the civilian world. While criminal offences and penal infractions before civilian courts seek to ensure respect for the rule of law and protection of the public, the purpose of the separate military justice system pertains to discipline, efficiency and morale of the military (Genereux, at p. 293; Letourneau, at p. 150). Thus, military judges face a unique disciplinary regime  for a much broader range of offences  that is launched and prosecuted by the executive.\nA Reasonable and Informed Person Would Apprehend Bias\nConcerns relating to judicial independence in our system of military justice are not new. They arose before the introduction of the Charter (MacKay v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 370), and have persisted despite the changes brought in response to Genereux. Over the last two decades, many independent reviews have outlined additional and residual problems with the independence of military tribunals (A. Lamer, The First Independent Review by the Right Honourable Antonio Lamer P.C., C.C., C.D. of the provisions and operation of Bill C-25, An Act to amend the National Defence Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, as required under section 96 of Statutes of Canada 1998, c. 35 (2003); Commission of Inquiry into the Deployment of Canadian Forces to Somalia, Dishonoured Legacy: The Lessons of the Somalia Affair  Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Deployment of Canadian Forces to Somalia  Executive Summary (1997), at p. 79; P. J. LeSage, Report of the Second Independent Review Authority to The Honourable Peter G. MacKay Minister of National Defence (2011) (LeSage Report); Fish Report; Arbour Report, at pp. 78-86).\nJudicial independence concerns in the military flow from the decision to have ranked officers preside over courts martial and from the relationship these officers have with the chain of command. The military status of these officers may not necessarily be unconstitutional, but our Court in both MacKay and Genereux acknowledged the inherent risks. Historically, the paramount desire to enforce discipline in the military has often been to the detriment of justice (R. v. Stillman, 2019 SCC 40, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 144, at para. 39). As the appellants submit (A.F., at para. 77), the prime object of a military organization is victory, not justice. When a justice system is grounded on the vital importance of discipline, efficiency and morale, it creates a posture of deference towards hierarchy which can conflict with a judges duty of independence and impartiality.\nIn determining whether a reasonable and informed person would be concerned about the pressures military judges face given their disciplinary accountability towards their superiors, the military context matters. This context has been reviewed in several high profile independent reports. While I agree with the majority that these reports deal with matters of policy, placing them beyond the constitutional question before this Court (paras. 73-80), they nonetheless provide material insight on the perceptions and concerns of a reasonable and informed member of the public. \nMilitary judges keep the rank they held before their judicial appointment. Outside observers have long insisted that military judges should be awarded their own distinct rank, or civilianized, to alleviate the apprehension that they could be influenced by their position within that hierarchy (LeSage Report, at pp. 41-42; Fish Report, at paras. 52-80; Letourneau, at p. 154).\nBecause of a judges given rank, it is reasonable that military personnel may fear a judge could prioritize allegiance to rank and to the chain of command over their respective individual rights. In an independent review of the Armed Forces, the Fish Report observed these concerns (at paras. 56-57):  \n. . . a good number of members of the CAF who attended my town hall meetings, most of them junior non-commissioned members, expressed the belief that military judges are generally more lenient towards accused officers of higher ranks.\n\nOther concerns were that military judges may be reluctant to see high-ranking witnesses as lacking in credibility. Or, conversely, that complainants from lower ranks may be found less trustworthy. Or, that members of a panel who outrank the military judge may show less deference to the military judges instructions.\nAn informed person would know of the militarys insular hierarchical culture. In another independent review, the Arbour Report notes at p. 9:\nOperating as a totally self-regulated, self-administered organization, entirely reliant on deference to hierarchy, [the military] has failed to align with the ever-changing, progressive society we live in.\nAs noted above, our jurisprudence requires the judiciary to be free from even the appearance of interference by the executive. To do so, it has emphasized the need to reserve disciplinary accountability to an autonomous, apolitical and independent entity (Lippe, at p. 138; Moreau-Berube, at para. 47; Therrien (Re), at para. 57).  \nFar from offering this guarantee, however, it is now clear that the NDA and QR & O permit interference. Further, recent amendments have removed a military judges exemption from summary hearings, which deal with service infractions that are more minor than service offences, and are adjudicated by commanding officers instead of courts martial (An Act to amend the National Defence Act and to make related and consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 15, s. 25; see NDA, s. 163). Military personnel found guilty of having committed a service infraction do not benefit from a statutory right of appeal other than a review by military authorities, and the presiding commanding officers need not have any legal experience or knowledge, other than basic procedural training (NDA, ss. 163.6 to 163.91; Letourneau, at pp. 159-61). \nThe potential risk of interference by the military chain of command is clear. The possibility that judges may be unduly influenced by the position of the executive in this context would be perceived by a reasonable and informed person as insufficient separation  or independence  between the executive and judicial roles. When accused persons face criminal sanctions, the smallest detail capable of casting doubt . . . will be cause for alarm (2747-3174 Quebec Inc., at para. 45).\nThe Existing Safeguards Are Insufficient\nIn Lippe, our Court found that once a situation raises an apprehension that a tribunal may not be institutionally impartial  despite the prima facie presumption of judicial impartiality  we must also consider the safeguards in place that may reduce those prejudicial effects and reassure a reasonable and informed person that the tribunal is, in fact and in appearance, impartial (pp. 144-45). The safeguards are those which protect against the possibility of manipulation of the judiciary by other branches of government, not merely against actual manipulation (L. Sossin, Judicial Appointment, Democratic Aspirations, and the Culture of Accountability (2008), 58 U.N.B.L.J. 11, at p. 37). Below, I consider each safeguard that is said to alleviate the risk of coercion or the risk that military judges would feel pressure to be loyal towards the chain of command. \nThe Oath of Office\nUnder s. 165.21(2) of the NDA, every military judge must take an oath of office affirming that they will impartially, honestly and faithfully execute their judicial duties.\nWhile the oath of office is an important foundation for the independence of every individual judge, the integrity of the individual military judges is not in question. The oath does little to guard against an apprehension of institutional bias. \nSection 11(d) of the Charter protects against an appearance of interference and guards against indirect interference that may be deeply engrained in the system. All judges have to swear an oath. Should that constitute a sufficient protection, no claim of institutional interference under s. 11(d) could ever succeed.\nNor does the recusal of a judge on a case by case basis provide enough safeguard for the military justice system. In any event, recusal is an illusory guarantee because the NDA does not provide for the appointment of ad hoc military judges (Canada (Director of Military Prosecutions) v. Canada (Office of the Chief Military Judge), 2020 FC 330, [2020] 3 F.C.R. 411, at paras. 180-83). Relying on military judges to recuse themselves on a case by case basis may result in a perception of no justice at all, rather than reassure a reasonable and informed person of the independence of the tribunal. There are currently only three military judges. They are part of a single military unit and if one judge has concerns about impartiality, it is likely that the others will too, especially if the reason relates to policies or priorities of the executive.\nThe Removal Process Through the MJIC\nUnder ss. 165.21(3), 165.31 and 165.32 of the NDA, a military judge may be removed for cause only following an inquiry and recommendation made by the MJIC. The majority concludes this affords military judges with sufficient security of tenure (paras. 103-12).  \nRespectfully, I find this less persuasive. The NDA allows for sanctions of demotion or dismissal from the Forces on conviction of a disciplinary offence (ss. 139(1)(e) and (g), 140.1 and 140.2). By losing their status as officers in the Armed Forces, military judges would lose a key qualification for their tenure. \nFurther, laying charges against military judges would, as a practical matter, stop them from hearing any cases, even before conviction. For example, the former Chief Military Judge was prosecuted for conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, for allegedly having a personal relationship with a court reporter under his command. Although the matter never went to trial  there was no available judge impartial enough to adjudicate the matter  he did not preside on any cases for the 2 years leading to his mandatory retirement at the age of 60 (A.F., at para. 40). The chain of command can exert a de facto removal from the bench by the simple laying of charges (Director of Military Prosecutions, at para. 45; A.F., at paras. 33-41).\nIn any event, military judges remain liable for uniquely military disciplinary charges initiated by their superiors and which can result in a criminal record and imprisonment. Thus, the rationale that animates the need for security of tenure  securing against interference by the executive (Valente, at p. 698)  is not safeguarded.\nThe Presumption of Independence by Prosecution\nIn response to the allegations that military judges face pressure by the chain of command, the Crown invokes the strong presumption that the prosecution (here the Director of Military Prosecutions (DMP)) will carry out its functions independently of partisan concerns (R.F., at paras. 51-54). Before charges can be laid, legal advice must be obtained (QR & O, art. 102.07(2)(b)), and the DMP can proceed only where there is a reasonable belief that the charges brought could be sustained in court. The Crown adds that should any officer exercising the functions of the DMP act unlawfully or in bad faith, they would be liable to professional and criminal sanctions. \nAdmittedly, the prosecution, as protector of the public interest, has a constitutional obligation under s. 7 of the Charter to act independently of partisan concerns (R. v. Cawthorne, 2016 SCC 32, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 983, at para. 28). However, our Court has often warned against relying on prosecutorial discretion to safeguard against statutory provisions that otherwise breach the Charter. As the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association submits, [t]he protection of the rule of law should not depend on a belief  however well-intentioned  that our institutions are . . . immune from impropriety (I.F., at para. 22). \nAs our Court put it in R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 95, one cannot be certain that the discretion will always be exercised in a way that would avoid an unconstitutional result. Nor can the constitutionality of a statutory provision rest on an expectation that the Crown will act properly (see also R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at para. 17; R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at para. 74). In R. v. Bain, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 91, at pp. 103-4 (cited in Nur, at para. 95), Cory J. stated:\nUnfortunately it would seem that whenever the Crown is granted statutory power that can be used abusively then, on occasion, it will indeed be used abusively. The protection of basic rights should not be dependent upon a reliance on the continuous exemplary conduct of the Crown, something that is impossible to monitor or control. Rather the offending statutory provision should be removed.\nWhen it comes to judicial independence, the Cawthorne presumption is therefore no panacea. In the military context, the presumption cannot be relied on to safeguard judicial independence. For one, the DMP acts not as protector of the public interest but as enforcer of discipline, efficiency and morale in the army. But above all, the DMP does not act independently of the chain of command. The NDA expressly requires otherwise. \nUnder the NDA, the DMP performs its functions under the supervision, instructions and guidelines of the Judge Advocate General (JAG) (NDA, ss. 9.2 and 165.17; QR & O, art. 4.081(1)). Contrary to what its title suggests, the JAG is not a judge. Rather, the JAG mainly acts as a legal adviser to the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces. At present, the JAG holds the rank of Brigadier-General, above all military judges. The JAG must be totally loyal and partisan to the interests of the military as an institution as well as to the chain of command (Drapeau and Letourneau, at p. 34). Essentially, the JAG is not independent of but is rather a part of the executive (Genereux, at p. 302; see also p. 309). \nConclusion\nThus, in my view, none of the safeguards can alleviate the concerns raised by the spectre that military judges could face discipline from their superiors. I conclude that a reasonable and informed observer would be concerned about institutional bias. As the Fish Report observes (at para. 58):\n. . . the fact that military judges are subject to the CSD puts them in a position of subordination which is inconsistent with the exercise of judicial duties. This dynamic could lead to concerns that military judges may improperly take into account the disciplinary consequences to which they may be exposed if they adjudicate cases in a certain way. Some members of the CAF were concerned that military judges could be tempted to toe the party line in sensitive cases where the legally-correct decision may go against the solution preferred by the military hierarchy.\nI agree with the military judges in the courts martial decisions below and conclude their liability to the executive under the CSD, as currently structured, undermines their judicial independence. In sum, like civilian judges, military judges face accountability through the civilian criminal justice system and through a judicial conduct review committee. However, they are subject as officers to a much broader range of offences than civilian judges, for the military objectives of good order and discipline, efficiency and morale. While I accept that judicial independence could be safeguarded if discipline was administered by judges through the MJIC, the disciplinary regime in the NDA is initiated and prosecuted by the executive. The possibility of reviewing the military judges conduct either by summary hearing or by court martial irrevocably affects the public trust in the institution. A reasonable and informed person would apprehend that military judges could be influenced by their loyalty to rank and the interests of officers above them in the chain of command, to the detriment of the rights of accused members before them. I conclude the appellants s. 11(d) right to a trial before an independent and impartial tribunal has been breached. \nThe Crown concedes that, should the Court find an infringement of s. 11(d) of the Charter, it cannot be saved by s. 1 (R.F., at para. 32). The CMAC in Edwards justifies this disciplinary scheme for military judges on the basis that it is necessary to ensure their safety and the success of military missions during times of war, and necessary to maintain an operationally ready Armed Forces during times of peace (paras. 8 and 62). In my view, such justification would more properly be considered under s. 1 of the Charter, pursuant to the Oakes test (see Genereux, at pp. 313-14, citing R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103).\nI would allow the appeals, set aside the CMAC decisions, and quash the conviction of Sgt. Thibault. I would declare the legislative scheme under the NDA of no force or effect insofar as it subjects military judges to the disciplinary process administered by military authorities. \n\tAppeals dismissed, Karakatsanis J. dissenting.\n\tSolicitor for the appellants: Defence Counsel Services, Gatineau.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Canadian Military Prosecution Service, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Lax OSullivan Lisus Gottlieb, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association: Allen/McMillan Litigation Counsel, Vancouver.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds the Constitutionality of the National Defence Act's Requirement that Military Judges be Officers.\n\nThis appeal revolves around the compatibility of the military judges' dual status as officers with the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality under Section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe complainants are nine members of the Canadian Armed Forces charged with service offences and brought before courts martial for trial. The alleged offences include conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline, disobeying lawful commands of a superior officer, behaving with contempt towards a superior officer, drug trafficking, sexual assault, disgraceful conduct, and drunkenness. These service offences are governed by the Code of Service Discipline (CSD) in Part III of the National Defence Act (NDA). The motions brought by the accused involve allegations that the statutory requirement that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be officers, as per sections 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA, violates their right to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under section 11(d) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe trial process began with the military judges hearing the cases of the appellants, who were charged with service offences. Some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial independence due to their dual status as judges and officers, and therefore, the appellants' section 11(d) rights were infringed. The court martial judges entered stays of proceedings for some of the appellants as a remedy for this Charter breach. The Crown appealed the stays of proceedings to the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada (CMAC), which allowed the appeals, set aside the stays, and directed the matters to proceed to trial. The CMAC held that the safeguards in the National Defence Act adequately protect judicial independence and impartiality in light of the purposes of military justice in Canada. The appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeals, with Justice Karakatsanis dissenting.\n\nThe Court's decision is guided by the principle that a reasonable and informed person must consider the institutional independence of a tribunal, taking into account the relevant context and circumstances. The Court has identified three essential conditions of judicial independence: security of tenure, financial security, and administrative independence.\n\nWriting for the majority, Kasirer J. held that the requirement that military judges be officers under the National Defence Act does not violate the guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality under section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The majority found that the dual status of military judges as both judges and officers does not offend section 11(d), as the NDA provides sufficient safeguards to ensure judicial independence, including security of tenure, financial security, and administrative independence. The majority also rejected the appellants' argument that the military status of military judges creates a conflict of interest and undermines their impartiality, finding that military judges can lay aside their duties and allegiances as officers when exercising their judicial duties. This decision upholds the constitutionality of sections 165.21 and 165.24(2) of the NDA and provides clarity on the compatibility of military judges' dual status with the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence and impartiality.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court holds  that the military status of military judges does not violate the constitutional  guarantee of judicial independence to which persons tried before courts martial  are entitled. </strong>These appeals are about whether the requirement under  the <em>National Defence Act</em> that military  judges be military officers violates the right to a hearing by an independent  and impartial tribunal guaranteed under Section 11(d) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.  \u00a0The appeals were brought by nine members of the  Canadian Armed Forces who were accused of various service offences under the  Code of Service Discipline, which forms part of the <em>National Defence Act</em>. Service offences, which include offences  specific to military personnel and offences under the <em>Criminal Code </em>and other Canadian laws, are tried before a court  martial, a military court that has the same powers, rights, and privileges as a  superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Courts martial are presided over by  military judges, who are required by the <em>National  Defence Act </em>to have been lawyers and military officers for at least 10  years. As officers, military judges are part of the chain of command. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the courts martial, most of the nine accused members  challenged the requirement under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>that the military judges presiding over their courts martial be  officers. They argued that this requirement violates their right to a hearing  by an independent and impartial tribunal under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. The divided loyalties of  military judges as judge and officer were said to deflect them from a proper  exercise of their judicial duties and leaves them vulnerable to pressures from  the chain of command.Under Canadian law, courts must evaluate independence  and impartiality under Section 11(d) by asking whether an informed and  reasonable person would perceive the tribunal at issue as independent. In the  courts martial, some of the military judges held that they lacked judicial  independence because of their dual status of judge and officer, and that for  this reason, the accused members\u2019 Section 11(d) rights were infringed. The  Court Martial Appeal Court disagreed, and said that an informed person, viewing  the matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through,  would conclude that military judges are sufficiently impartial and independent  to meet the requirement under Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter. </em>Therefore, the accused members\u2019 rights were not infringed.  The accused members appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The status of  military judges as officers under the <em>National  Defence Act </em>is not incompatible with their judicial functions for the  purpose of Section 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice Kasirer affirmed  that accused members of the Canadian Armed Forces who appear before military  judges are entitled to the same guarantee of judicial independence and  impartiality under Section 11(d) as accused persons who appear before civilian  criminal courts, but this does not require that the two systems be identical in  every respect. He held that as presently configured in the <em>National Defence Act</em>, Canada\u2019s system of military justice fully  ensures judicial independence for military judges in a way that takes account  of the military context, and specifically of the legislative policies of  maintaining discipline, efficiency and morale in the forces and public trust in  a disciplined armed forces. Justice Kasirer concluded that properly understood,  the military context does not diminish judicial independence. "

C.J.C. was accused of committing sexual assault, contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code, and incest, contrary to section 155 of the Criminal Code.

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores  the convictions of a man found guilty of sexual assault and sexual  interference. </strong>This appeal dealt with the  question of whether a judge in a criminal trial made a mistake in understanding  and treating key parts of the complainant\u2019s evidence in a manner that led him  to unfairly convict the accused. In legal terms, this is called  \u201cmisapprehending\u201d the evidence. D.F., whose name cannot be  disclosed due to a publication ban protecting the complainant, was accused of  sexual assault, sexual interference (meaning touching someone under the age of  16 for a sexual purpose), and of making sexually explicit material available to  a child. The complainant was eight years old at the time of the alleged  offences. The offences allegedly took place while the accused was spending the  day and evening at the house of the complainant\u2019s mother. The mother testified  that she had been at the house all day and evening except when she briefly stepped  out to a nearby store after dinner. D.F. stayed behind during that time with the  complainant and her two younger siblings. At trial, there were some  inconsistencies in the complainant\u2019s testimony under cross-examination  regarding whether or not her mother was home when the alleged sexual touching  happened. However, the trial judge held that any minor inconsistencies in her  testimony were a result of the complainant\u2019s immaturity and confusion, and that  she was otherwise credible and reliable. The trial judge also found the other  witnesses credible and reliable, including the complainant\u2019s mother, who  testified that except for her trip to the store, she had been around the  children all evening and did not observe any wrongdoing. Based on the evidence  as a whole, including the testimonies, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a  reasonable doubt of D.F.\u2019s guilt and convicted him.\u00a0 \u00a0D.F. appealed his  convictions. A majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal  from the conviction on the count of making sexually explicit material available  to a child, but allowed the appeal from his other two convictions. In the  majority\u2019s view, the trial judge misapprehended the complainant\u2019s evidence on  whether or not the complainant\u2019s mother was home at the time of the alleged  sexual touching. That mistake was related to an important issue at trial, and played  an essential role in the trial judge\u2019s reasoning process leading to convicting  D.F. Moreover, the majority said that the trial judge did not sufficiently  address the inconsistencies between the complainant\u2019s evidence and that of her  mother in his decision to convict. For these reasons, the majority ordered that  the convictions for sexual assault and sexual interference be set aside and that  a new trial be held on those counts. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One judge disagreed and  would have dismissed D.F.\u2019s appeal in its entirety. In his view, the trial  judge did not make any errors in assessing the evidence. The trial judge  recognized that the complainant\u2019s evidence regarding the location of her mother  at the time of the offences was inconsistent but he had not relied on it to convict  D.F. Rather, the trial judge had correctly applied a common sense approach to  assessing evidence of child witnesses to determine she was a credible and  reliable witness overall. Finally, the dissenting judge determined that the  trial judge\u2019s reasons sufficiently explained why he was satisfied beyond a  reasonable doubt that the accused had committed the offences.\u00a0 The Crown appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. \u00a0<strong>The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal. \u00a0</strong>As such, D.F.\u2019s convictions  for sexual assault and sexual interference are restored.

On September 22, 1877, Treaty No. 7 was made between the Crown and the Confederacy. Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, the largest reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The reserves size was to be set in accordance with the treaty land entitlement (TLE) provisions, based on a formula promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that proportion for larger and smaller families. The Blood Tribe has long claimed that the size of the reserve did not respect the TLE formula. In 1971, a Blackfoot researcher gathered information on the total number of people in the Blood Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884 and, based on this information, confirmed that the existing reserve boundaries did not match the boundaries owed pursuant to the TLE formula. The Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of Indian Affairs, who rejected its claims.\n\tThe Blood Tribe consequently commenced an action in the Federal Court in 1980, alleging breaches of the Crowns fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment, and negligence, and seeking a declaration and damages for breach of contract arising from the Crowns failure to fulfill the TLE according to the prescribed formula (the TLE Claim). The trial judge dismissed all claims except the TLE Claim, concluding that the Crown had miscalculated the size of the reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribes membership, and stated that the Crowns conduct during the reserves creation was unconscionable. The trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were discoverable in 1971 or shortly thereafter, the applicable six-year limitation period did not begin to run until 1982, when the enactment of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The remedies sought for the TLE Claim were therefore not statute-barred because the action was commenced in 1980. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crowns appeal and held that the TLE Claim was statute-barred. In its view, s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create new treaty rights, and a remedy was available for the TLE Claim prior to 1982 regardless of the framed cause of action.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part and a declaration issued.\n\tSection 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty rights. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution, and treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties under the common law. Accordingly, the Blood Tribes TLE Claim was enforceable at common law and actionable prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1). The Blood Tribe did not contest the trial judges finding that the TLE Claim was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until 1980. Consequently, the TLE Claim is statute-barred by operation of the applicable six-year limitation period. However, declaratory relief is warranted in the instant case given the longevity and magnitude of the Crowns dishonourable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. It will serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribes TLE, identifying the Crowns dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and helping to restore the honour of the Crown.\n\tThe conclusion of a treaty-making process creates active and binding obligations on the Crown, and this is well established in Canadian caselaw. A long line of authorities has upheld the enforceability of treaties at common law and the actionable duties they enshrine. While the terminology surrounding the enforceability of treaties may have changed over time, claims seeking to give legal effect to treaty terms were brought long before the coming into force of the Constitution Act, 1982. Courts prior to 1982 clearly recognized the legal character of treaties: they create and embody enforceable obligations based on the mutual consent of the parties. Treaties are binding legal instruments that must be upheld, and the right to a judicial remedy where treaty obligations are breached is provided by the common law, grounded in the terms of the treaty at issue.\n\tThe coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not impact the enforceability of treaties at common law. Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 accords constitutional status to existing Aboriginal and treaty rights and prevents them from abrogation by federal, provincial, or territorial law. The coming into force of s. 35(1) constitutionally entrenched the Crowns obligation to respect existing treaty rights. But s. 35(1) did not create treaty rights. Treaty rights were enforceable prior to 1982 and the coming into force of s. 35(1) did not alter the commencement of limitation periods applicable to claims for breach of treaty rights. Although treaty rights are protected by the Constitution Act, 1982, their existence and scope are determined by the terms of the treaty interpreted with the principles set out in relevant authorities. The terms and limits of treaty rights do not stem from the language or purpose of s. 35(1). The core impact of s. 35(1) was to prevent abrogation by legislation, and it was intended to provide constitutional protection to pre-existing Aboriginal and treaty rights.\n\tAuthorities of the Court have recognized that rules on limitation periods apply to Aboriginal right and treaty claims. Although the constitutionality of applying limitations statutes to Aboriginal right and treaty claims was never addressed in these authorities, they recognized that such claims are subject to the general limitation periods of the province in which the action was commenced if captured by the respective limitations statute. However, limitations legislation cannot bar courts from issuing declarations on the constitutionality of the Crowns conduct. Declaratory relief is a discretionary remedy that must be considered within the unique context of the legal dispute at issue. Declarations set out the parameters of a legal state of affairs or the legal relationship between the parties and can also confirm or deny the breach of a right or declare the existence of a new legal state of affairs. Courts have an extremely wide jurisdiction when issuing declaratory relief, but this discretion is not without limits: a court may grant a declaration where it has jurisdiction to hear the issue, where the dispute before the court is real and not theoretical, where the party raising the issue has a genuine interest in its resolution, and where the respondent has an interest in opposing the declaration sought. Declarations should not be issued where there is no practical effect.\n\tDeclaratory relief takes on a unique tenor in the context of Aboriginal and treaty rights because it is a means by which a court can promote reconciliation to restore the nation-to-nation relationship. Reconciliation can be fostered by declaratory relief. The non-coercive nature of declaratory relief can help the parties to the dispute to resolve the issues without an excessively hostile or adversarial approach and can help to restore the honour of the Crown. This approach is especially appropriate given the non-adversarial, trust-like relationship Canadian governments are supposed to have with Indigenous people. Avoiding expensive, lengthy, and adversarial litigation is an important step for reaching reconciliation-oriented results where Aboriginal and treaty rights are at issue. Declaratory relief can assist in providing a clear statement on the legal rights of Indigenous parties, the duties placed on the Crown, and the Crowns conduct in relation to those sacred promises. Clarity on these rights, duties, and conduct can help to uphold the honour of the Crown, guide the parties in the reconciliation process mandated by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, and assist with efforts to restore the nation-to-nation relationship. Declarations in the context of breach of treaty claims can also serve a corrective function by authoritatively demonstrating that the Crown has infringed the Indigenous partys rights. A clear statement setting out the Crowns infringement of an Indigenous partys rights may spur reconciliation efforts between the parties to address the wrongs suffered.\nCases Cited\n\tDistinguished: Ravndahl v.

The promises and obligations enshrined in these fundamental agreements reflect a lasting commitment to maintaining a just relationship between the Crown and Indigenous peoples and were intended to be honoured by the Crown so long as the sun rises and the river flows (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 2, Restructuring the Relationship (1996), at pp. 18-19, citing R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, [1982] 2 All E.R. 118 (C.A.), at p. 124, per Lord Denning). \nIn this matter, Treaty No. 7 enshrines solemn promises and obligations exchanged between the Crown and the Kainai, also known as the Aakainawa, the Tribe of Many Leaders (Blood Tribe). Of particular importance to this appeal, Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148 (Reserve), which is the largest reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The Reserves size was to be set in accordance with the treaty land entitlement (TLE) provisions, based on a formula promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that proportion for larger and smaller families (Treaty No. 7 (1877), at p. 4; 2019 FC 789, [2020] 1 F.C.R. 22, at Appendix D). \nThe Blood Tribe has long claimed that the Reserve did not accord with the promises enshrined in Treaty No. 7. After a lengthy procedural history, the Blood Tribe sought declarations to that effect, an order directing Canada to procure lands for addition to the Reserve, and monetary compensation for lost use, mineral royalties, and rents. The Federal Court found that Canada was in breach of the TLE formula in Treaty No. 7 and the size of the Reserve it had provided was 162.5 square miles too small. Before this Court, Canada concedes its breach of Treaty No. 7 with respect to the TLE but argues that the Blood Tribes claim is statute-barred under Albertas Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.A. 1970, c. 209, and the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. Section 5(1)(g) of Albertas Limitation of Actions Act sets out a six-year limitation period for any other action not in [the] Act or any other Act specifically provided for; pursuant to s. 39(1) of the Federal Courts Act, Albertas limitations statute applies to Federal Court proceedings in respect of any cause of action arising in that province. \nThis appeal concerns whether the Blood Tribes TLE claim is barred by the six-year limitation period in Albertas Limitation of Actions Act. This inquiry turns on a narrow question: whether the breach of the TLE was actionable in Canadian courts prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Blood Tribe argues that their claim cannot be statute-barred under Albertas Limitation of Actions Act and the Federal Courts Act prior to there being a recognized action in law, which they allege was not the case for breach of treaty claims until the coming into force of s. 35(1). The constitutional applicability and operability of Albertas Limitation of Actions Act, as incorporated into federal law by s. 39(1) of the Federal Courts Act, is not at issue.\nFor the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part. The Federal Court of Appeal correctly held that the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not alter the commencement of the limitation period applicable to the Blood Tribes TLE claim. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution. It is well established in Canadian caselaw that treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties under the common law. As the Federal Court of Appeal concluded, the Blood Tribes claim is thus statute-barred. However, I find that declaratory relief is warranted given the longevity and magnitude of the Crowns dishonourable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. Declaratory relief in this context will promote reconciliation and help to restore the nation-to-nation relationship between the Blood Tribe and the Crown.\nFacts\nThe historical context for this appeal is extensive. The Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal provided a comprehensive overview of this history and the evidence adduced by the parties (see, e.g., trial reasons, at paras. 56-219; 2022 FCA 20, 468 D.L.R. (4th) 98, at paras. 20-36). The trial judges factual findings based on that evidence were not challenged on appeal. Although this Court is seized with a discrete question of law, a concise summary of the historical background that provides an understanding of the relationship between the Crown and the Blood Tribe is essential to engaging with the parties arguments and appreciating the context for this claim.\nThe Blood Tribe and Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148\nThe Blood Tribe are a member tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy of First Nations. The Confederacy was comprised of three tribes: the Blood Tribe, Siksika (Blackfoot), and Piikani (Peigan). \nThe Reserve is the home of the Blood Tribe. Located in southern Alberta, the Reserve is the largest reserve in Canada and occupies an area of 547.5 square miles. The Reserve was established by Treaty No. 7, which was made on September 22, 1877, between the Crown and the Confederacy.\nTreaty No. 7 and the Creation of Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148\nTreaty No. 7 promised a reserve to each tribe of the Confederacy. The Reserves location was set out in Treaty No. 7, but was later changed by a separate agreement between the Blood Tribe and the Crown. The Blood Tribe has long claimed that the Reserve did not accord with the promises set out in Treaty No. 7. \nThe size of the Reserve, the TLE, was meant to correspond to a formula. The formula promised one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that proportion for larger and smaller families. \nLocating and Surveying Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148\nSurveyors set the boundaries of the Reserve in 1882, five years after the execution of Treaty No. 7. The initial survey described the Reserve as an area of roughly 650 square miles in south-western Alberta. The Canadian government also granted two grazing leases to third parties on lands south of the Reserve in 1882. The northern boundaries of the grazing leases overlapped the surveyed Reserve.\nCanadian officials quickly recognized the overlapping boundaries and asked the Blood Tribe to agree to a new boundary. A second survey in 1883 led to a new agreement that defined the Reserves southern boundary by a latitudinal description north of the grazing leases boundaries. The boundary change reduced the size of the Reserve from 650 square miles to its current size of 547.5 square miles. \nBlood Tribe members expressed concern over the size of the Reserve in 1888 and identified that it was not as large as they expected when they signed Treaty No. 7. They also expressed uncertainty with the precise location of the southern boundary. As a result, members of the Blood Tribe were shown the location of the new boundary for the first time in 1888. The surveyor recorded that the Blood Tribes Chief was asked if he was satisfied, and he answered in the affirmative (C.A. reasons, at para. 25). \nConcerns over the size of the Reserve arose again in 1969, nearly a century after the second survey. On November 4, 1969, a Blackfoot researcher presented the Blood Tribe with a report on the 1882 and 1883 surveys. This report detailed the reduction in the Reserves size. The researcher travelled to Ottawa in August 1971 to gather information on the total number of people in the Blood Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884. Based on this information, the researcher confirmed that the existing boundaries did not match the boundaries owed pursuant to the TLE formula.\nNegotiations and Initial Legal Action\nThe Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (now the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations) on February 27, 1976. The Blood Tribe made two claims related to the Reserve: (i) the TLE had not been correctly assigned, and (ii) they were entitled to a broader area (Big Claim). The Minister rejected both claims on June 20, 1978. \nAfter the unsuccessful negotiations, the Blood Tribe commenced an action in the Federal Court on January 10, 1980. The statement of claim alleged breaches of the Crowns fiduciary duty arising from the second survey, fraudulent concealment, and negligence. The Blood Tribe sought a declaration and damages for breach of contract arising from the failure to fulfill the TLE according to the prescribed formula. The claim was amended on February 24, 1999 to include, among other changes, that the Blood Tribe had constitutionally protected treaty rights pursuant to s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.  \nThe Federal Court action was put into abeyance pending an assessment under the Specific Claims Policy of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Due to the glacial pace of this process, the Blood Tribe moved to reactivate its Federal Court action on August 7, 1996 (C.A. reasons, at para. 32). \nThe TLE claim was rejected under the Specific Claims Policy in November 2003 on the basis that Canada had no outstanding legal obligation. The Indian Claims Commission conducted an inquiry into the claims and, on March 30, 2007, made two recommendations: (i) that the Big Claim not be accepted, and (ii) that a surrender was required because the 1883 boundary change removed land from the Reserve. The Commission recommended that the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development negotiate a resolution. \nThe reactivated Federal Court action was divided into three phases. Phase I was heard in May 2016 for the purpose of receiving oral history evidence from members of the Blood Tribe. Phase II, dealing with liability, fact, and expert witness evidence, was held in 2018. Phase III has not been heard and was to address remedies. \nProcedural History\nFederal Court, 2019 FC 789, [2020] 1 F.C.R. 22\nThe Blood Tribes action was divided into three claims:\n(a)\tThe Big Claim: The Blood Tribe claimed that the Reserve did not accord with the land promised by Canada and included a larger area.\nThe 1882 Survey Claim: The Blood Tribe asserted that the 1882 survey created a reserve and the reduction of 102.5 square miles in the second survey required that it surrender the land pursuant to the Indian Act, 1880, S.C. 1880, c. 28. The Blood Tribe submitted that it was entitled to that land or compensation for the loss of it because it gave no such surrender.\nThe TLE Claim: The Blood Tribe submitted that its membership at the relevant time was such that its promised reserve under the TLE is larger than provided for under either survey. As a result, Canada breached this treaty promise and failed in its fiduciary duty to honestly and accurately implement the treaty promises.\nThe Crown contested each claim. The Crown disputed the land captured by the Big Claim, argued that the 1882 survey did not create a reserve, and asserted that the current size of the Reserve aligned with the TLE formula. The Crown also argued the action was statute-barred. \nThe trial judge found that Canada was in breach of its treaty commitments, but all claims except the TLE Claim were dismissed. The Big Claim was dismissed on its merits and the 1882 Survey Claim was dismissed on the basis that it was statute-barred. The limitations defence barred the 1882 Survey Claim even though Canada breached its fiduciary duty in implementing Treaty No. 7 and in dealing with the subsequent creation of the Reserve. The facts underlying the 1882 Survey Claim were provided to the Blood Tribe in 1969, 11 years before the claim was commenced.\nThe trial judge concluded that Canada miscalculated the size of the Reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribes membership. Based on the membership at the date of the signing of Treaty No. 7, the Reserve should have been 162.5 square miles larger. He stated that Canadas conduct during the Reserves creation was unconscionable, but the conduct could have been discovered in 1971 or shortly thereafter.\nThe trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were discoverable by 1971, the applicable limitation period did not begin to run until 1982. The enactment of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The remedies sought for the TLE Claim were not statute-barred because the action was commenced in 1980. \nFederal Court of Appeal, 2022 FCA 20, 468 D.L.R. (4th) 98\nThe Federal Court of Appeal allowed Canadas appeal and held that the Blood Tribes TLE Claim was statute-barred. Canada had only challenged the finding that the breach of the TLE Claim was not statute-barred because it was not actionable until the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The parties did not challenge the trial judges factual findings, the dismissal of the 1882 Survey Claim and the Big Claim, or the statutory interpretation or constitutional applicability of s. 5(1)(g) of Albertas Limitation of Actions Act.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal reached its conclusion for three reasons. First, the trial judge erred in treating treaties as international agreements and applying international law doctrines. Although the trial judges reasons were ambiguous on this point, the Federal Court of Appeal found that [r]eading the reasons as a whole and having regard to the extensive reliance on international law cases to support the conclusion that treaties were not enforceable, . . . the judge, in fact, concluded that the historic treaties were international treaties (para. 61). Historic treaties do not engage the act of state doctrine and do not require incorporation into domestic law to be enforceable. The Federal Court of Appeal relied on this Courts caselaw that rejected characterizing treaties as international agreements (see, e.g., Simon v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 387, at p. 404; R. v. Sioui, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1025, at p. 1038). \nSecond, the trial judges decision was contrary to an unbroken line of decisions over 120 years recognizing the enforceability of commitments in the numbered treaties. The Federal Court of Appeal held that prior caselaw has consistently taught that the numbered treaties created binding obligations, both legal and moral, on the Crown. Their terms were enforceable in Canadian courts because a foundational, robust legal principle compelled compliance  the honour of the Crown (para. 14). Courts should not pigeon-hole claims ascertaining a breach of treaty commitments into a particular cause of action. A remedy was available for the Blood Tribes TLE Claim prior to 1982 regardless of the framed cause of action. \nThird, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the trial judge misunderstood the effect of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 in relation to treaties. Section 35(1) did not create new treaty rights. Instead, it gave constitutional protection to existing treaty rights so they could no longer be abrogated by legislation. \nIssues\nThis Court must decide whether the Blood Tribes TLE Claim is barred by Albertas Limitation of Actions Act and s. 39(1) of the Federal Courts Act. This inquiry turns on two narrow issues raised by the Blood Tribe:\nWas a breach of the TLE actionable in Canadian courts prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\nWere the limitation periods in Albertas Limitation of Actions Act effective to bar the Blood Tribes TLE Claim prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\nThe Blood Tribe also seeks declaratory relief related to the Crowns breach of Treaty No. 7. At the hearing of this appeal, Canada conceded that declaratory relief may be appropriate. As a result, after resolving the two core issues on this appeal, the reasons below address the issue of declaratory relief.\nAnalysis\nTo resolve the parties dispute, this Court must consider the impact of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 on breach of treaty claims and whether these claims were actionable prior to the section coming into force. If a breach of the TLE was enforceable and actionable prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1), the Blood Tribe concedes that its claim is statute-barred as it does not otherwise contest the discoverability of its claim.\nAs explained below, s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty rights. The Federal Court of Appeal appropriately recognized that [t]reaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution (para. 205). Treaty rights were enforceable prior to 1982 and relief was available to the parties. The coming into force of s. 35(1) did not alter the commencement of the limitation period applicable to the Blood Tribes TLE Claim. As concluded by the Federal Court of Appeal, the Blood Tribes claim is thus statute-barred pursuant to s. 5(1)(g) of Albertas Limitation of Actions Act and s. 39(1) of the Federal Courts Act. However, I find that declaratory relief is warranted given the Crowns dishonourable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. \nThe Scope of This Appeal\nIt is important to begin by delineating the scope of this appeal. The parties seek an answer to a discrete legal issue: is the Blood Tribes TLE Claim barred by Albertas Limitation of Actions Act? This issue turns on whether breach of treaty claims were actionable prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. To address this issue, this Court must consider the enforceability of Treaty No. 7 at common law and the meaning and impact of s. 35(1) in relation to treaty rights, not the constitutional applicability of limitations legislation. Several interveners advance arguments beyond this issue regarding the constitutional applicability or operability of limitations legislation to breach of treaty claims. In light of these arguments, it is necessary to clarify the scope of the appeal. \nAs previously indicated, the constitutional applicability or operability of limitations legislation is not at issue on this appeal. This is acknowledged explicitly by the parties. In their factum, the Blood Tribe acknowledge that the issue on appeal is not that limitation periods do not apply to Aboriginal claims or that courts can waive them, but that a plaintiffs claim ought not to be barred prior to there being a recognized action in law (A.F., at para. 132). Similarly, the Crown states that [t]his Court should not consider the constitutional validity, applicability, or operability of federal legislation (R.F. in response to interveners, at para. 4). Any extension of the appeal beyond the narrow issue, whether a breach of treaty claim was actionable prior to the enactment of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, would thus be contrary to the parties express submissions. \nThe Blood Tribe does not ask this Court to assess the constitutional applicability of Albertas Limitation of Actions Act to breach of treaty claims. This Court has cautioned against deciding issues that are not necessary to the resolution of an appeal absent exceptional circumstances (R. v. McGregor, 2023 SCC 4, at paras. 23-24). The constitutional applicability of the limitations legislation at issue has not been properly raised in this Court and is not a component of the overall analysis of the grounds as raised by the parties (R. v. Mian, 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 689, at para. 33). The Federal Court of Appeal acknowledged that the Blood Tribes submissions did not call into question the constitutional applicability of the Limitation of Actions Act (para. 210). This Court is faced with a similarly narrow legal issue.\nWas a Breach of the TLE Actionable in Canadian Courts Prior to the Coming Into Force of Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\nAssessing whether a breach of Treaty No. 7 was actionable prior to 1982 requires an analysis of two issues: (i) the enforceability of Treaty No. 7 at common law, and (ii) the impact, if any, of the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. If treaty rights were enforceable and actionable prior to 1982, then the limitation period applicable to the Blood Tribes claim began to run when the claim was discoverable, more than 10 years before the coming into force of s. 35(1).\nThe Enforceability of Treaty No. 7 at Common Law\nTreaties are enforceable from the date of execution. While the terminology surrounding the enforceability of treaties may have changed over time, claims seeking to give legal effect to treaty terms were brought before the coming into force of the Constitution Act, 1982. Long before 1982, courts recognized that treaties were not merely political promises and created enforceable obligations, including contractual rights (see, e.g., R. v. White (1964), 50 D.L.R. (2d) 613 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 618, affd (1965), 52 D.L.R. (2d) 481 (S.C.C.); J. Promislow, Treaties in History and Law (2014), 47 U.B.C. L. Rev. 1085, at pp. 1147-48). The Blood Tribes approach to this litigation reflects the enforceability of treaties prior to 1982 since their claim was framed as a breach of contract and was brought in 1980.\nThe enforceability of treaties from the date of execution is well established in this Courts caselaw without reference to s. 35(1). For example, this Court in R. v. Badger, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 771, stated at para. 76: Treaties are analogous to contracts, albeit of a very solemn and special, public nature. They create enforceable obligations based on the mutual consent of the parties (emphasis added). Similarly, this Court identified in Sioui, at p. 1044, that what characterizes a treaty is the intention to create obligations, the presence of mutually binding obligations and a certain measure of solemnity (emphasis added). Sioui built on Simon, where this Court emphasized that the agreement at issue was a treaty because it was an enforceable obligation between the Indians and the white man (p. 410).\nThe enforceability of treaties from the date of execution is supported by the fundamental nature of the promises they enshrine. Courts, legislatures, and academic commentators have consistently acknowledged this significance: treaties represent an Indian Magna Carta (H. Cardinal, The Unjust Society: The Tragedy of Canadas Indians (1969), at p. 28); treaties are vital, living instruments of relationship (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 1, Looking Forward, Looking Back (1996), at p. 128); and a treaty represents an exchange of solemn promises between the Crown and the various Indian nations. It is an agreement whose nature is sacred (Badger, at para. 41). In addition, the Crown is assumed to intend to fulfill these integral promises (para. 41; Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para. 79; Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at paras. 19-20).\nThe Federal Court of Appeal reached the correct conclusion regarding the enforceability of treaties prior to 1982. As noted at para. 100 of its reasons, [t]reaties were entered into with the intention to create legal obligations and how that obligation is characterized is of no consequence to the question [of] whether their terms are enforceable. Courts prior to 1982 clearly recognized the legal character of treaties: they create and embody enforceable obligations based on the mutual consent of the parties.\nCaselaw Demonstrates That Breach of Treaty Claims Were Actionable Pre-1982\nCourts recognized that treaty promises created enforceable and actionable legal duties prior to 1982. Although the characterization of treaties and their obligations may have varied, it is too much of a leap to suggest that treaties were not justiciable in Canada through the 19th century; that the executives personal goodwill and subsequent actions could not give rise to legally or equitably enforceable obligations (Promislow, at p. 1147). Instead, a long line of authorities upheld the enforceability of treaties at common law and the actionable duties they enshrine. These authorities were comprehensively summarized by the Federal Court of Appeal, but several are particularly notable.\nEarly decisions of this Court and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) characterized treaties as enforceable contracts. St. Catherines Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen (1888), 14 App. Cas. 46 (P.C.), is helpful as a starting point. The Blood Tribe relies on St. Catherines for the argument that Indigenous claims were treated as political matters. However, a close analysis of the JCPCs reasons reveals that this case was not about the enforceability of treaty commitments. Instead, the appeal concerned Ontarios control of Crown lands. Despite the limits of its analysis, St. Catherines sets out the JCPCs understanding and characterization of treaties as formal contract[s] (see pp. 51-52 and 54-55).\nThis Court and the JCPC recognized the enforceability of treaties a decade later in Province of Ontario v. Dominion of Canada (1895), 25 S.C.R. 434 (Annuities Case (SCC)), affd [1897] A.C. 199 (Annuities Case (JCPC)). The dispute concerned a treaty commitment to increase annuity payments over time to the Ojibway in the Lake Huron district of the Robinson-Huron Treaty. The JCPC recognized that the treaty made the provincial government liable to fulfil the promises and agreements made on its behalf and characterized the question as one of contract liability for a pecuniary obligation (pp. 205 and 213). This Court in the Annuities Case (SCC) also acknowledged the enforceability of the obligations: . . . the Indians are of right, under the treaties, entitled to the payment of the arrears (p. 498). Contrary to the Blood Tribes reliance on this authority in this matter, the reference to a treaty right being a personal obligation at p. 213 of the Annuities Case (JCPC) does not diminish the enforceability of the commitment since this characterization was only used to distinguish the obligations from a charge in land. \nThe Annuities Case (JCPC) was built on in Henry v. The King (1905), 9 Ex. C.R. 417, where the Exchequer Court considered the enforceability of treaty commitments and recognized their legal effect. The Mississaugas of the Credit filed a petition seeking a declaration that they were entitled to certain moneys owed under a treaty. The court required the payment of the annuities demanded in the claim and supported the enforceability of the treaty in several respects. For example, the treaty was characterized as an enforceable agreement with consideration (p. 429). Furthermore, jurisdiction was based on the claim arising from an agreement or treaty. The court reached this conclusion because the Mississaugas right rests upon the treaty or contract between the Crown and them, and . . . the court has . . . jurisdiction so to declare (p. 446). \nThe Exchequer Court in Dreaver v. The King (1935), 5 C.N.L.C. 92, continued to enforce specific treaty terms. Dreaver concerned a petition of right filed by the Mistawasis Band in Saskatchewan seeking amounts to reimburse education and medicine expenses that were improperly charged to its trust account. The band relied on a treaty promise requiring the Crown to provide free education and medicine. In granting the petition, the court relied on the treaty promises and gave them legal effect. The treaty at issue created an actionable right that the band relied upon to pursue relief.   \nCaselaw nearing the coming into force of the Constitution Act, 1982 upheld the view that treaty obligations were enforceable and actionable at common law. For example, the Federal Court in Pawis v. The Queen, [1980] 2 F.C. 18, considered the relationship between the Ontario Fishery Regulations, SOR/63-157, and the treaty rights of the Ojibway and explicitly recognized that breaches of treaty obligations were actionable. When characterizing the treaty at issue, the court emphasized its enforceability: \n. . . the Treaty has to be taken as an agreement entered into by the Sovereign and a group of her subjects with the intention to create special legal relations between them. The promises made therein . . . were undoubtedly designed and intended to have effect in a legal sense and a legal context. The agreement can therefore be said to be tantamount to a contract, and it may be admitted that a breach of the promises contained therein may give rise to an action in the nature of an action for breach of contract. [Emphasis added; pp. 24-25.]\nA similar result was reached in Town of Hay River v. The Queen, [1980] 1 F.C. 262, and R. v. Taylor (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 360 (C.A.). In Hay River, the Federal Court held that the treaty at issue was not simply a contract between those who actually subscribed to it and instead impose[d] and confer[red] continuing obligations and rights (p. 265). In Taylor, the Court of Appeal for Ontario did not characterize the nature of the treaty at issue but held that the treaty had a clear legal effect: it preserved historic rights to hunt and fish. None of these authorities suggest that treaties were not enforceable prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nThe Blood Tribes categorization of these authorities based on how the treaty was used (i.e. either as a sword or a shield) does not diminish the conclusions of the courts discussed above. The Federal Court of Appeal correctly dismissed this argument, holding that [t]here is no logical reason to conclude that the use of a treaty to defend conduct has no bearing on the question [of] whether a treaty is enforceable, whereas an action to assert a treaty term, does (para. 101). Enforceability at common law speaks to a clear and concise question: does the treaty have legal effect? Regardless of the form of proceeding, the authorities outlined above demonstrate that treaties were given legal effect, and thus were enforceable, prior to 1982. The ability for Indigenous interests, including treaty rights, to arise in an array of forums and proceedings does not diminish their legal effect or viability (R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17, [2021] 1 S.C.R. 533, at paras. 89-92). \nThe Federal Court of Appeal appropriately considered and followed the authorities set out above, including by disregarding R. v. Syliboy, [1929] 1 D.L.R. 307 (N.S. Co. Ct.). The Nova Scotia County Court in Syliboy held that the treaty at issue was a mere agreement made by the Governor and council with a handful of Indians giving them in return for good behaviour food, presents, and the right to hunt and fish as usual (pp. 313-14). As the Federal Court of Appeal correctly concluded, Syliboy was incorrectly decided in its time, and remains so today (para. 140). This Court previously reached this conclusion in Simon, noting that the decision reflects the biases and prejudices of another era in our history and relies on language that is no longer acceptable in Canadian law (p. 399). Syliboy did not and does not reflect the current state of the law. \nTreaty obligations are enforceable and actionable from their execution. The conclusion of a treaty-making process creates active and binding obligations on the Crown, and this is well established in Canadian caselaw. The position of the Blood Tribe that treaties were treated as political matters prior to 1982 conflicts with these authorities and undermines the binding nature of promises made in historic treaties. This line of cases gave legal effect and judicial remedies, including declaratory relief and monetary orders, based on the obligations enshrined in treaties (see, e.g., Henry, at pp. 445-47; Dreaver, at p. 122). \nTreaty No. 7 Was Enforceable and Actionable at Common Law \nThe Federal Court of Appeal correctly held that Treaty No. 7 was enforceable at common law. This aligns with the authorities set out above and reflects the nature of treaties as binding legal instruments that must be upheld. The right to a judicial remedy where treaty obligations are breached is provided by the common law, grounded in the terms of the treaty at issue, and does not require s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 or legislation enacted pursuant to s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. This conclusion is reinforced when the impact of s. 35(1) is analyzed, as demonstrated below.\nThe Impact of Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982\nThe enforceability of Treaty No. 7 at common law is the heart of this appeal. Having established the Treatys enforceability at common law above, it is necessary to consider whether the coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 impacted this enforceability. The enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982 profoundly shaped and solidified the protection of Aboriginal and treaty rights in Canada. Section 35(1) is instrumental in this respect and provides that [t]he existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed. Section 35(1) limits the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty in its application to Aboriginal and treaty rights in Canada and prevents Parliament from extinguishing these rights (Mitchell v. M.N.R., 2001 SCC 33, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 911, at para. 11; R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at pp. 1108-10; P. J. Monahan, B. Shaw and P. Ryan, Constitutional Law (5th ed. 2017), at p. 489). \nSection 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 accords constitutional status to existing Aboriginal and treaty rights and prevents them from abrogation by federal, provincial, or territorial law (Desautel, at para. 34; J. Woodward, Aboriginal Law in Canada (loose-leaf), at  5:2). The coming into force of s. 35(1) constitutionally entrenched the Crowns obligation to respect existing treaty rights (Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2005 SCC 69, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388, at para. 4; R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 533 (Marshall (No. 2)), at para. 6). As a result, s. 35(1) constitutionalizes existing rights so that they can no longer be abrogated by legislation. This was recognized in Mitchell, at para. 11:\nThe enactment of s. 35(1) elevated existing common law aboriginal rights to constitutional status (although, it is important to note, the protection offered by s. 35(1) also extends beyond the aboriginal rights recognized at common law: Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at para. 136). Henceforward, aboriginal rights falling within the constitutional protection of s. 35(1) could not be unilaterally abrogated by the government. However, the government retained the jurisdiction to limit aboriginal rights for justifiable reasons, in the pursuit of substantial and compelling public objectives: see R. v. Gladstone, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 723, and Delgamuukw, supra. \nSection 35(1) did not create treaty rights. Although treaty rights are protected by the Constitution Act, 1982, their existence and scope are determined by the terms of the treaty interpreted with the principles set out in R. v. Marshall, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 456 (Marshall (No. 1)). The terms and limits of treaty rights do not stem from the language or purpose of s. 35(1), which recognizes and affirms existing rights (Badger, at para. 76; P. W. Hogg, The Constitutional Basis of Aboriginal Rights, in P. Noreau and L. Rolland, eds., Melanges Andree Lajoie: Le droit, une variable dependante (2008), 177, at p. 182; J. T. S. McCabe, The Honour of the Crown and its Fiduciary Duties to Aboriginal Peoples (2008), at p. 39).\nThis Court has recognized that s. 35(1) was intended to provide constitutional protection to pre-existing Aboriginal and treaty rights (Badger, at para. 12; Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at para. 84). Furthermore, as stated clearly in Marshall (No. 1), at para. 48, the core impact of s. 35(1) was to prevent abrogation by legislation:\n\tUntil enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, the treaty rights of aboriginal peoples could be overridden by competent legislation as easily as could the rights and liberties of other inhabitants. The hedge offered no special protection, as the aboriginal people learned in earlier hunting cases such as Sikyea v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 642, and R. v. George, [1966] S.C.R. 267. On April 17, 1982, however, this particular type of hedge was converted by s. 35(1) into sterner stuff that could only be broken down when justified according to the test laid down in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at pp. 1112 et seq., as adapted to apply to treaties in Badger, supra, per Cory J., at paras. 75 et seq.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal correctly set out the effect of s. 35(1) and acknowledged that the section is not the source of treaty rights (paras. 204-5). This conclusion aligns with the approach to Aboriginal rights under Canadian law: . . . section 35 did not create the legal doctrine of Aboriginal rights  Aboriginal rights existed and were recognized at common law (para. 205). Remedies were available to the Blood Tribe prior to the coming into force of the Constitution Act, 1982 and were sought through its 1980 breach of contract action. \nThe Blood Tribes reliance on Ravndahl v. Saskatchewan, 2009 SCC 7, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 181, overlooks the differences between the coming into force of s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and s. 35(1). This Court in Ravndahl held that the cause of action for the discrimination claim at issue arose through the coming into force of s. 15. Prior to the coming into force of s. 15, the Ravndahl plaintiff had no cognizable legal right upon which to base her claim (para. 18). By contrast, there is a basis in common law for the Blood Tribes breach of treaty claim because the enforceable and actionable nature of treaties prior to 1982 is well established. The coming into force of s. 35(1) did not create a cognizable legal right to ground the Blood Tribes breach of treaty claim. The right has existed at common law since the execution of Treaty No. 7 in 1877. The coming into force of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not alter the commencement of the limitation period applicable to the Blood Tribes claim.\nWere the Limitation Periods in Albertas Limitation of Actions Act Effective to Bar the Blood Tribes TLE Claim Prior to the Coming Into Force of Section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982?\nFor the reasons above, the Blood Tribes claim was actionable prior to the coming into force of s. 35(1) and thus the limitation period set out in Albertas Limitation of Actions Act was effective to bar the claim prior to 1982. The only argument the Blood Tribe advances to contest the running of the relevant limitation period is that the claim was not recognized at law. The Blood Tribe does not otherwise contest that its claim is captured by s. 5(1)(g) of Albertas Limitation of Actions Act.\nSection 5(1)(g) of Albertas Limitation of Actions Act is a residual basket clause. Specifically, it sets out a six-year limitation period for any other action not in [the] Act or any other Act specifically provided for. The Blood Tribe does not contest the trial judges finding that the TLE Claim was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until 1980 (C.A. reasons, at paras. 6 and 210). As the Federal Court of Appeal concluded, [t]he Federal Court found that . . . had a cause of action for breach of a treaty commitment been available, the six-year limitation period in paragraph 5(g) of The Limitation of Actions Act, 1970 would have barred the action. These findings are not contested and no issue is raised . . . as to whether, as a matter of statutory interpretation or constitutionality, paragraph 5(g) barred the action had a cause of action existed (para. 210).\nThe result that can be drawn from the analysis above aligns with authorities from this Court that recognized that the rules on limitation periods apply to Aboriginal right and treaty claims (see, e.g., Manitoba Metis, at para. 134; Canada (Attorney General) v. Lameman, 2008 SCC 14, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 372, at paras. 12-13; Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada, 2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245, at paras. 121 and 125-33). Although the constitutionality of applying limitations statutes to Aboriginal right and treaty claims was never addressed in these authorities, they recognized that such claims are subject to the general limitation periods of the province in which the action was commenced if captured by the respective limitations statute (Woodward, at  20:18; J. T. S. McCabe, The Law of Treaties Between the Crown and Aboriginal Peoples (2010), at p. 421).\nThroughout this appeal, Canada drew attention to other means of advancing reconciliation and restoring the nation-to-nation relationship, including through negotiations and the Specific Claims Tribunal (R.F., at paras. 71-74). This Court has previously acknowledged the importance of reconciliation efforts outside of the courts and these processes may be meaningful to addressing the Crowns breach of its obligations to the Blood Tribe (see, e.g., Reference re An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis children, youth and families, 2024 SCC 5 (C-92 Reference), at paras. 76-78; Delgamuukw, at para. 186; Desautel, at para. 87, quoting S. Grammond, Terms of Coexistence, Indigenous Peoples and Canadian Law (2013), at p. 139). In light of the prospect of future reconciliation efforts, it is necessary for this Court to consider the remaining relief sought by the Blood Tribe in its court action.\nThe Availability and Scope of Declaratory Relief\nIn its action, the Blood Tribe seeks declaratory relief. At trial, the Blood Tribe sought, among other claims, a declaration that the Crown breached the TLE (C.A. reasons, at paras. 3 and 31). The Crown has subsequently conceded it breached its treaty obligation with respect to the Blood Tribes land entitlement (R.F., at para. 2). At the hearing of this appeal, the Crown conceded that declaratory relief may be appropriate and could assist with reconciliation efforts with the Blood Tribe (transcript, at pp. 111-16).\nThe law of limitations set out above does not preclude a declaration in this matter. Although claims for personal relief or damages flowing from treaty breaches may be subject to limitations statutes, limitations legislation cannot bar courts from issuing declarations on the constitutionality of the Crowns conduct. (Manitoba Metis, at paras. 135, 137, 139 and 143). At issue here is a constitutionally protected treaty right and the honour of the Crown, itself a constitutional principle (para. 136). This Court has recognized that declarations can be obtained to assist with extra-judicial negotiations with the Crown even where personal relief may be statute-barred as discussed below (para. 137).\nDeclaratory relief is warranted in this appeal. This Court has the authority to grant the judgment that the courts below should have ordered (Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, s. 45). The courts below had the authority to provide the declaratory relief sought by the Blood Tribe (Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106, r. 64; Federal Courts Act, at ss. 2(1), 17(1), 52(b)(i)). This section analyzes the nature of declaratory relief, identifies its value in breach of treaty cases, and explains why it is warranted in the circumstances of this appeal. \nThe Discretionary Nature of Declaratory Relief\nDeclarations are authoritative statements of legal states of affairs (S. A. Smith, Rights, Wrongs, and Injustices: The Structure of Remedial Law (2019), at p. 15; Lord Woolf and J. Woolf, The Declaratory Judgment (4th ed. 2011), at pp. 1-2). A bare declaratory judgment does not grant consequential or coercive relief. Indeed, [t]he essence of a declaratory judgment is a declaration, confirmation, pronouncement, recognition, witness, and judicial support to the legal relationship between parties without an order of enforcement or execution (L. Sarna, The Law of Declaratory Judgments (4th ed. 2016), at p. 6). \nDeclarations set out the parameters of a legal state of affairs or the legal relationship between the parties. They primarily confirm or deny the legal rights of the parties. Importantly, declarations can also confirm or deny the breach of a right or declare the existence of a new legal state of affairs (see, e.g., Manitoba Metis, at paras. 6 and 154; Smith, at p. 15). \nDeclaratory relief is a discretionary remedy (S.A. v. Metro Vancouver Housing Corp., 2019 SCC 4, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 99, at para. 60; Ewert v. Canada, 2018 SCC 30, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 165, at para. 83). Courts have an extremely wide jurisdiction when issuing declaratory relief (Sarna, at p. 37; R. Zakrzewski, Remedies Reclassified (2005), at p. 158). This discretion is not without limits, and this Court has set out criteria that inform the availability of declaratory relief. In Ewert, this Court stated: A court may, in its discretion, grant a declaration where it has jurisdiction to hear the issue, where the dispute before the court is real and not theoretical, where the party raising the issue has a genuine interest in its resolution, and where the respondent has an interest in opposing the declaration sought . . . (para. 81). Courts have long relied on these criteria for assessing the availability of declaratory relief (see, e.g., S.A., at para. 60; Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2016 SCC 12, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 99, at para. 11; Canada (Prime Minister) v. Khadr, 2010 SCC 3, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 44, at para. 46). \nDeclarations should not be issued where there is no practical effect. As noted by this Court in Solosky v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, at p. 832, a declaration will not normally be granted when the dispute is over and has become academic, or where the dispute has yet to arise and may not arise. The importance of practical utility is well established, including through the following excerpts from academic commentary:\n\tA declaration must serve some utility to the parties; otherwise, the court speaks for no reason befitting its jurisdiction. Therefore a court should avoid issuing a declaration devoid of tangible or concrete use to the litigants. \n\n(Sarna, at p. 46)\n\nThe courts will not generally grant a declaration that is merely advisory, of no practical utility, or deals with a hypothetical dispute. . . . [A declaration] may also serve a corrective function in that it may authoritatively demonstrate to the defendant that he or she is infringing the claimants rights. \n\n(Zakrzewski, at p. 159)\n\n\tIt is essential that the declaration be directed to the determination of legal controversies and produces some real consequences for the parties. \n\n(D. Wright, Remedies (2nd ed. 2014), at p. 284)\nAs noted by the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in West Moberly First Nations v. British Columbia, 2020 BCCA 138, 37 B.C.L.R. (6th) 232, at para. 343, there is no obligation in the law of declaratory relief to litigate the range of a declarations effects. The question is simply whether the declaration will have practical utility (emphasis added).\nThe Value of Declaratory Relief in Breach of Treaty Cases\nDeclaratory relief takes on a unique tenor in the context of Aboriginal and treaty rights because it is a means by which a court can promote reconciliation to restore the nation-to-nation relationship (the Hon. M. Rowe and D. Shnier, The Limits of the Declaratory Judgment (2022), 67 McGill L.J. 295, at pp. 314 and 318). It relies in part on the government acknowledging the declaration promptly and acting honourably in determining the means for advancing reconciliation (J. Teillet, A Tale of Two Agreements: Implementing Section 52(1) Remedies for the Violation of Metis Harvesting Rights, in M. Morellato, ed., Aboriginal Law Since Delgamuukw (2009), 333, at pp. 340-41). That this assumption can be difficult in breach of treaty cases, as reconciliation efforts often follow decades of dishonourable Crown conduct and adversarial litigation, does not diminish the possible salutary effect of declarations.\nThe reconciliation process differs from the conflict driven, adversarial litigation process that is often antithetical to meaningful and lasting reconciliation. As the Court noted in Clyde River (Hamlet) v. Petroleum Geo-Services Inc., 2017 SCC 40, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1069, at para. 24, [t]rue reconciliation is rarely, if ever, achieved in courtrooms. The Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of reconciliation between Indigenous peoples and the Crown outside of the courts (see, e.g., C-92 Reference, at para. 77; Desautel, at para. 87; Haida Nation, at para. 20; British Columbia (Minister of Forests) v. Okanagan Indian Band, 2003 SCC 71, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 371, at para. 47). \nReconciliation can be fostered by declaratory relief. The non-coercive nature of declaratory relief can help the parties to the dispute to resolve the issues without an excessively hostile or adversarial approach and can help to restore the honour of the Crown (Sarna, at p. 178). Academic commentary has recognized that this approach is especially appropriate given the non-adversarial, trust-like relationship Canadian governments are supposed to have with Aboriginal people (K. Roach, Constitutional Remedies in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at  15:31). Avoiding expensive, lengthy, and adversarial litigation is an important step for reaching reconciliation-oriented results where Aboriginal and treaty rights are at issue. \nIn Aboriginal and treaty rights claims, declaratory relief can assist in providing a clear statement on the legal rights of Indigenous parties, the duties placed on the Crown, and the Crowns conduct in relation to those sacred promises. Clarity on these rights, duties, and conduct can help to uphold the honour of the Crown, guide the parties in the reconciliation process mandated by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, and assist with efforts to restore the nation-to-nation relationship. \nDeclarations in the context of breach of treaty claims can serve a corrective function by authoritatively demonstrating that the Crown has infringed the Indigenous partys rights (Zakrzewski, at p. 159). A clear statement setting out the Crowns infringement of an Indigenous partys rights may spur reconciliation efforts between the parties to address the wrongs suffered. Declaratory relief is not meant to represent the end of the reconciliation process for the Crowns breach of Treaty No. 7: it merely helps set the stage for further efforts at restoring the nation-to-nation relationship and the honour of the Crown. \nDeclaratory Relief Is Warranted for the Blood Tribe\nCanada breached its treaty promises to the Blood Tribe. Canada did not provide the land as promised: 162.5 fewer square miles were set aside than should have been. In 1883, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories instructed the surveyor to change the boundaries of the Reserve contrary to Canadas treaty commitments. Crown representatives subsequently made false representations to the Blood Tribe that the TLE was fulfilled including in an 1888 letter stating that the Reserve contained far more than [the Blood Tribe] were entitled to (trial reasons, at para. 459). The discrepancy was never remedied or acknowledged and it was only through the efforts of a Blackfoot researcher from 1969 to 1971 that the extent of the Crowns misconduct in relation to the TLE became known. This conduct is deplorable and does not reflect the fundamental objective of the modern law of treaty rights, which is the reconciliation of Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and their respective claims, interests, and ambitions (Mikisew Cree First Nation, at para. 1). In oral submissions before this Court, the Crown acknowledged that its breach of the Treaty was very serious, dishonourable, and even unconscionable (transcript, at pp. 95-96).\nTreaty promises were intended to be honoured so long as the sun rises and river flows. They are vital, living instruments of relationship and the Crown is assumed to intend to fulfill these integral promises (Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 1, at p. 128; Badger, at para. 41; Manitoba Metis, at para. 79; Haida Nation, at paras. 19-20). By disregarding its commitments in Treaty No. 7, Canada failed to uphold and appreciate the sacred nature of its promises. \nSeveral considerations support the exercise of discretion to grant declaratory relief with that context in mind. Prior authorities of this Court have set out the criteria that establish whether a declaration may be warranted (see, e.g., S.A., at para. 60; Ewert, at para. 81). Those criteria are satisfied here, and the particulars of the appeal before us further support the exercise of discretion by this Court to award declaratory relief. There is no dispute that this Court has jurisdiction to hear the issue or that the Blood Tribe has a genuine interest in resolving the issue. The analysis below is thus limited to whether there is practical utility in granting a declaration and whether the Crown has an interest in opposing the declaration (S.A., at para. 60; Ewert, at para. 81).\nA declaration in this context will have a practical effect. The Crowns dishonourable breach of Treaty No. 7 is ongoing and the fractured relationship between the Crown and the Blood Tribe should be resolved through continued reconciliation efforts. This is not a situation where a declaration would be devoid of tangible or concrete use or could be viewed as fictitious or academic (Solosky, at p. 831). The declaration will be relied on to outline the Crowns past dishonourable conduct in relation to Treaty No. 7. Declaratory relief may also serve a corrective function in these circumstances as it authoritatively demonstrates that Canada breached the Blood Tribes treaty rights, which can help to advance reconciliation. Any uncertainty over whether reconciliation efforts will be successful for strengthening the nation-to-nation relationship does not diminish the practical utility of the declaration (West Moberly, at paras. 321-24 and 331). \nThe declaration sets out the Crowns conduct and guides the parties towards the reconciliation process. The rights of the Blood Tribe are guaranteed by Treaty No. 7 itself and constitutionally recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Further, declaratory relief of this nature aligns with and advances the constitutional imperative of reconciliation. A declaration in this context is not a statement of [d]etached facts or general pronouncements of law (West Moberly, at paras. 312 and 336; see, e.g., Yahey v. British Columbia, 2021 BCSC 1287, 43 C.E.L.R. (4th) 1, at paras. 1876-77 and 1884; 1472292 Ontario Inc. (Rosen Express) v. Northbridge General Insurance Company, 2019 ONCA 753, 96 C.C.L.I. (5th) 1, at paras. 30-31). \nThe dispute between the Crown and the Blood Tribe is real and not academic. The Crown has opposed the declaration being sought by the Blood Tribe at almost every stage of this litigation. The dispute is grounded in an extensive and contested factual matrix regarding the Crowns commitments under Treaty No. 7 and the size of the TLE. The Crown contested that it breached its obligations under Treaty No. 7 when the action was commenced in 1980. This issue remained in dispute for decades, resulting in a lengthy and complex trial before the Federal Court and a holding that Canada breached its treaty commitments. Declaratory relief was sought by the Blood Tribe in its statement of claim to resolve the live conflict on this issue through legal action (C.A. reasons, at para. 3). \nBefore this Court, the Crown concedes its breach of the TLE and that a declaration may be an appropriate remedy. Accordingly, it could be said the Crown no longer has an interest in opposing the declaration sought with respect to the final criteria for declaratory relief. However, enabling this belated concession to foreclose the possibility of declaratory relief would privilege form over substance with respect to the nature of the real dispute before us, and would overlook the protracted nature of the dispute that led the parties to this point. As such, I am not persuaded that this concession, at the eleventh hour of this litigation and in the context of the Crowns vigorous opposition to any relief in these proceedings, should now prevent this Court from issuing a declaration.\nUltimately, a declaration is a discretionary remedy that must be considered within the unique context of the legal dispute at issue. The considerations analyzed above support the issuance of declaratory relief in these circumstances. These considerations must be assessed through the lens of decades of disagreement between the parties on the scope of the treaty promises owed to the Blood Tribe that culminated in extensive litigation. The Blood Tribe and the Crown have been involved in a contentious and adversarial litigation process culminating in an appeal to this Court, not an academic, hypothetical, or theoretical dispute (Solosky, at pp. 832-33; S.A., at para. 60). Declaratory relief will serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribes TLE, identifying the Crowns dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and helping to restore the honour of the Crown.\nThe Blood Tribe is entitled to the following declaration in light of these considerations and context:\nUnder the treaty land entitlement provisions of Treaty No. 7, the Blood Tribe was entitled to a reserve equal to 710 square miles in area; \n\nThe Blood Tribes current reserve is 162.5 square miles smaller in area than what was promised in Treaty No. 7; and\n\nCanada, having provided the Blood Tribe with a reserve of 547.5 square miles in area, dishonourably breached the treaty land entitlement provisions of Treaty No. 7. \nDisposition\nI would allow the appeal in part and issue the declaratory relief set out above.

        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Sets Aside Limitation Periods in Breach of Treaty Claims in Shot Both Sides v. Canada.\n\nThis appeal raises the central question of whether a claim for breach of treaty rights is actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\nThe Blood Tribe, a member of the Blackfoot Confederacy, entered into Treaty No. 7 with the Crown in 1877. The treaty established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, with a size to be determined by a formula based on the number of families within the tribe. The Blood Tribe claimed that the actual size of the reserve was smaller than what was promised under the treaty. The core allegations involved breaches by the Crown under sections 91(24) and 35(1) of the Constitution Act, particularly regarding fiduciary duty arising from its failure to fulfill Treaty No. 7's TLE provisions according to its prescribed formula.\n\nThe trial judge found that Canada had breached its treaty commitments but dismissed all claims except for one related to treaty land entitlement (TLE). The Federal Court of Appeal allowed Canada's appeal and held that the TLE claim was statute-barred because treaties were not international agreements requiring incorporation into domestic law to be enforceable. The Blood Tribe appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that breach of treaty claims were not actionable prior to 1982 when section 35(1) came into force as part of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\nTreaty rights are enforceable from their execution and give rise to actionable duties under common law; therefore, limitations legislation applies to claims for breach of treaty rights.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice OBonsawin concluded that the Blood Tribe's claim for breach of treaty rights was actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Court held that treaty rights flow from the treaty itself, not from the Constitution, and are enforceable upon execution. As a result, the Blood Tribe's claim was statute-barred under Alberta's Limitation of Actions Act. However, Justice OBonsawin found that declaratory relief is warranted in this case due to the longevity and magnitude of Canada's dishonourable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. The majority opinion emphasized that treaties are binding legal instruments that must be upheld and create enforceable obligations based on mutual consent. The coming into force of section 35(1) did not create new treaty rights but rather accorded constitutional status to existing Aboriginal and treaty rights. This provision prevented Parliament from extinguishing these rights but did not alter their existence or scope.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules that an Indigenous tribe\u2019s treaty  land entitlement claim is statute-barred, but that declaratory relief is  warranted given the longevity and magnitude of the Crown\u2019s dishonorable  conduct.</strong>This appeal is about whether the breach of an Indigenous tribe\u2019s  treaty land entitlement was actionable in Canadian courts before the coming  into force of section 35(1) of the <em>Constitution  Act, 1982</em>, which recognized and affirmed the existing Aboriginal and treaty  rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.<strong></strong>The Blood Tribe are a member tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy of  First Nations. In 1877, Treaty No. 7 was made between the Crown and the  Confederacy. Treaty No. 7 established Blood Tribe Reserve No. 148, the largest  reserve in Canada and the home of the Blood Tribe. The reserve\u2019s size was to be  set by the treaty land entitlement (\u201cTLE\u201d) provisions, based on a formula  promising one square mile for each family of five persons, or in that  proportion for larger and smaller families.The Blood Tribe has long claimed  that the size of the reserve did not respect the TLE formula. In 1971, a Blackfoot  researcher gathered information on the total number of people in the Blood  Tribe for the years 1879 to 1884 and, based on this information, confirmed that  the existing reserve boundaries did not match the boundaries owed under the TLE  formula. The Blood Tribe formally sought to negotiate with the Minister of  Indian Affairs, who rejected its claims. In 1980, the Chief at the time, Jim Shot Both Sides, commenced an  action together with others on behalf of the Blood Tribe in the Federal Court.  They alleged breaches of the Crown\u2019s fiduciary duty, fraudulent concealment,  and negligence, and sought declaratory relief and damages for breach of  contract arising from the Crown\u2019s failure to fulfil the TLE according to the  prescribed formula (the \u201cTLE Claim\u201d). Declaratory relief is a determination of  a party\u2019s rights without other consequences.The trial judge dismissed all  claims except the TLE Claim, concluding that the Crown had miscalculated the  size of the reserve by underestimating the Blood Tribe\u2019s membership, and stated  that the Crown\u2019s conduct during the reserve\u2019s creation was unconscionable. The  trial judge found that although the facts underlying the TLE Claim were  discoverable in 1971 or shortly thereafter, the applicable six-year limitation  period did not begin to run until 1982, when the enactment of section 35(1) of  the Constitution Act, 1982 created a new cause of action for treaty breaches. The  remedies sought for the TLE Claim were therefore not statute-barred because the  action was commenced in 1980. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal and held that  the TLE Claim was statute-barred. In its view, section 35(1) did not create new  treaty rights, and a remedy was available for the TLE Claim prior to 1982  regardless of the framed cause of action. The Blood Tribe appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part and issued declaratory  relief.<strong>Section 35(1) of the  Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach of treaty  rights.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin explained that section  35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 did not create a cause of action for breach  of treaty rights. Treaty rights flow from the treaty, not the Constitution, and  treaties are enforceable upon execution and give rise to actionable duties  under the common law. Accordingly, the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE Claim was enforceable  at common law and actionable prior to the coming into force of section 35(1).  The Blood Tribe did not contest the trial judge\u2019s finding that the TLE Claim  was discoverable as early as 1971 or that the action was not commenced until  1980. As such, the TLE Claim is statute-barred by operation of the applicable  six-year limitation period.However, Justice O\u2019Bonsawin concluded that declaratory  relief is warranted in this case given the longevity and magnitude of the  Crown\u2019s dishonorable conduct towards the Blood Tribe. She wrote, \u201c[it] will  serve an important role in clarifying the Blood Tribe\u2019s TLE, identifying the  Crown\u2019s dishonourable conduct, assisting future reconciliation efforts, and  helping to restore the honour of the Crown.\u201d"

At the same time, the parties concluded an offsets contract pursuant to which the Canadian company would subcontract some of the work associated with the aircraft procurement to Greek companies. The offsets contract provided that the Canadian company would owe HMOD liquidated damages if it did not fulfil its subcontracting obligations. Payment of these liquidated damages was secured by a letter of credit issued by a Greek bank in favour of HMOD (Greek Letter of Guarantee). A second letter of credit was issued by a Canadian bank in favour of the Greek bank to secure payment of the amounts that the latter would be required to pay HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee should HMOD state that the Canadian company failed to perform its obligations under the offsets contract (Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee). Disputes under the offsets contract were to be resolved by an arbitral tribunal under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).\n\tWhen the Canadian company determined that it would be unable to meet its subcontracting obligations under the offsets contract, an ICC Arbitral Tribunal was constituted and arbitration hearings took place. HMOD formally undertook not to demand payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee for as long as the arbitration procedure was ongoing. However, while the issuance of the final award was still pending, HMOD repeatedly demanded payment from the Greek bank. The Canadian company sought and obtained an order from the ICC Arbitral Tribunal preventing HMOD from demanding payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee until issuance of the final award. It also sought and obtained provisional injunctions from the Superior Court of Quebec to prevent payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee and the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Despite this, HMOD made a final demand for payment, seven days before the final award was set to be released, and said that the Greek bank would be subject to civil and criminal legal measures if it refused to pay. The Greek bank paid HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee, and the Greek bank then demanded payment from the Canadian bank under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n\tThe ICC Arbitral Tribunals final award decided that the offsets contract violated European Union law such that it was null and void ab initio and that no liquidated damages were due by the Canadian company to HMOD. In response to the final award, the Greek bank commenced proceedings before Greek courts, where it unsuccessfully sought to recover the money that it had paid to HMOD. The Greek courts decided that the conduct of HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee was not fraudulent under Greek law. In parallel proceedings before Quebec courts, the Canadian company sought a permanent injunction enjoining the Canadian bank from paying the Greek bank under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee. It argued that the fraud exception to an issuing banks near absolute duty to honour a demand for payment under a letter of credit applied to the Greek bank as beneficiary under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Given that HMODs conduct was fraudulent, the Greek banks demand for payment under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee was, by extension, also fraudulent. The trial judge held that the manner in which HMOD obtained payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that the Greek banks own conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of which it was aware. He thus enjoined the Canadian bank from paying any amount to the Greek bank under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The Greek bank appealed. The Court of Appeal dismissed its appeal, holding that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the Canadian bank was not bound to pay the Greek bank as beneficiary under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee, since the Greek bank had sufficient knowledge of the fraud prior to paying under the Greek Letter of Guarantee.\n\tHeld (Karakatsanis and Cote JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ.: The fraud exception applies with respect to the Greek banks demand for payment under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Given that the Greek bank, as the beneficiary of the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud by HMOD, that fraud can be attributed to the Greek bank as its own. The requirement that there be fraud by the beneficiary is therefore met. Moreover, there is no question that the Greek banks fraud was brought to the attention of the Canadian bank as issuer of the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, the Canadian bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee to the Greek bank and the majority of the Court of Appeal made no error in confirming that conclusion.\n\tA letter of credit is an instrument understood to be autonomous from the underlying contract to which it speaks that is issued by a financial institution at the behest of its customer. It entitles the beneficiary of the letter to payment on demand from the issuing bank, so long as that demand conforms to the requirements set out in the letter of credit. Commonly relied upon in domestic and international commercial transactions, letters of credit are widely used as a means of managing risk. They are issued in order to ensure that the beneficiary will be paid what they believe they are owed under an underlying contract. A demand for payment will typically arise when there is an allegation of failure of the customer or account party to perform some duty as agreed. The premise is pay now, and argue later if necessary. It is the issuing financial institution who takes on the risk of not being paid by their client.\n\tThere are two fundamental principles to the law governing letters of credit: autonomy and strict compliance. Autonomy means that a letter of credit is an independent obligation of the issuing or confirming bank. The obligation of the issuing bank to honour a valid demand for payment is independent of the performance of the underlying contract for which the credit was issued. The bank undertakes to pay the beneficiary provided that specified conditions are met. The banks customer may ultimately have a claim against the beneficiary, but that is typically not the financial institutions concern, since the letter of credit ensures that the beneficiary is paid in the meantime. Strict compliance means that the obligation of the issuing bank must be determined based only on the strict conformity of the presentation (including conformity of the documents presented) with the terms of the letter of credit. It requires not only that the tendered documents conform to the terms and conditions of the letter of credit but that they appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be consistent with one another. The test does not require perfection. It is possible, in clearly appropriate cases, to overlook immaterial discrepancies.\n\tFraud is the only exception recognized in Canadian law to the issuing banks obligation to pay the beneficiary on demand. When there is fraud by the beneficiary of the credit which has been sufficiently brought to the knowledge of the bank before payment or demonstrated to a court called on by the customer of the bank to issue an interlocutory injunction, the issuing bank need not honour the draft. The potential scope of the fraud exception must be properly circumscribed. It should be sufficiently inclusive to capture most conduct that should not be facilitated through letters of credit, yet at the same time, if it is too inclusive, letters of credit could become much less reliable. To achieve a balance, the standard set for fraud is high. Fraud in this context must import some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit. A key feature of civil or commercial fraud is its effect on the demand for payment by the beneficiary. If a beneficiary demands payment while knowing that they have no right to be paid under the underlying contract, that conduct may amount to fraud. Whether it does is an issue of mixed fact and law for which deference is owed on appeal.\n\tThe fraud exception is no less applicable when a second letter of credit is issued by a financial institution that requires it to pay when presented with an attestation that a first letter of credit has been called upon. Indeed, the conduct of a beneficiary under a counter-guarantee may serve to make the fraud of a third party its own. In such a case, the fraud exception applies directly to the demand of the beneficiary. However, the fraud of a third party to a letter of credit does not engage the fraud exception where the beneficiary to the letter is innocent of that fraud. To accept otherwise would unduly expand the fraud exception at the expense of the reliability of letters of credit.\n\tA beneficiary ceases to be innocent when they have knowledge of the fraud of a third party and participate in that fraud. When there is both knowledge and participation, the third partys fraud can fairly be attributed to the beneficiary as the beneficiarys own. This is not indirect or vicarious liability but is merely an application of the fraud exception to the beneficiary of the relevant letter of credit.\n\tIn the instant case, the trial judges finding that HMOD engaged in fraud is entitled to deference. His determination that HMOD engaged in some measure of impropriety that could amount to fraud is amply supported by the evidence. The evidence supports a finding that HMOD engaged in a fraudulent attempt to circumvent the ICC Arbitral Tribunals interim order and final award by repeating its demand for payment around one week before the final award was released and, after the final award was issued and it became clear that HMOD had not right under the offsets contract to the money that it received, by not returning the money. In addition, there is no basis to interfere with the trial judges conclusion that the Greek bank had clear knowledge of HMODs fraud and that it actively participated in HMODs fraud by paying HMOD in improper circumstances. The Greek banks employees who made the decision to pay HMOD knew that HMOD was enjoined from demanding payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee and that the issuance of the final arbitral award was imminent. The Greek bank was not merely suspicious that HMOD demanded payment contrary to the interim order; it clearly knew that this was happening. At the very least, this suggests that the Greek bank knew that the demand for payment was made in contravention of at least one order, which, in the circumstances, amounts to clear knowledge of the fraudulent conduct of HMOD. Because it knew of and participated in HMODs fraud, the Greek bank became the co-author of that fraud and must, for the purposes of the fraud exception, bear responsibility for it. As the beneficiary of the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee, it is the Greek banks fraud that is actionable before Quebec courts.\n\tAs for the judgments of the Greek courts, they have no decisive relevance in measuring the conduct of HMOD and the Greek bank. Absent a successful application for recognition and enforcement, foreign judgments are merely evidence and the weight given to them is an issue of fact to which deference is owed on appeal. A decision to place little or no weight on an unenforceable foreign judgment can be justified if that decision does not give proper consideration to relevant Canadian judgments or raises other public order concerns. Here, the foreign courts concluded that a party can disregard an order of an arbitral tribunal to which it had agreed to be subject. In the circumstances, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal expressly opted to give no weight to the decisions of the Greek courts. No reviewable error has been shown.\n\tPer Karakatsanis and Cote JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the action instituted by the Canadian company against the Greek and Canadian banks should be dismissed. To conclude otherwise would dismiss as irrelevant the decisions of the Greek courts, which cannot be ignored. International comity is an essential guiding principle when considering or enforcing foreign judgments. In the instant case, there is no public policy rationale for not giving weight to the judgments of the Greek courts. Taking them into account, HMODs demand for payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee was neither fraudulent nor tantamount to fraud; and, even if it were, the Greek bank would be innocent of that fraud. There is an inherent contradiction in the requirement that a reviewing court place itself in the position of the issuing bank at the time of payment to assess whether it had sufficient knowledge of any fraud, but at the exact same time discard the decisions of the courts of competent jurisdiction that were binding on that bank. Thus, the trial judges conclusion that the fraud exception applies cannot stand.\n\tThe Greek Letter of Guarantee and the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee in this case are best referred to as demand guarantees. Demand guarantees, like letters of credit, are contracts established at the request of a principal whereby the guarantor, usually a bank, irrevocably promises to pay the beneficiary on demand, irrespective of any ongoing dispute between the principal and the beneficiary. While the terms and conditions for payment of a demand guarantee reflect the underlying contract, the guarantor undertakes to pay regardless of external facts or events. In this sense, the demand guarantee is independent from the underlying contract; it is autonomous in nature. When parties to a commercial transaction agree to use demand guarantees to secure the performance of their obligations, they express their intention to be bound by a pay now, argue later structure. The guarantors obligation to pay is triggered solely on the terms and conditions specified by the principal. Once the terms and conditions are set, the only control that the bank may exercise is over the regularity of the documents tendered by the beneficiary. The fundamental rule is that the documents must appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. The banks role as a guarantor is thus simple. It must pay when presented with a compliant demand, and cannot investigate the circumstances of the underlying contract to determine whether the obligation secured by the demand guarantee was performed. The bank does not have the specialized skill and experience to be a referee on matters that divide the parties to the secured contract, and it should not and is not expected to enter into controversies between the parties to the underlying contract.\n\tThe guarantors obligation to pay when presented with a compliant demand is subject to one exception  fraud. The principal has two options to prevent payment under a demand guarantee: it can seek an interlocutory injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the bank from honouring the demand by establishing a strong prima facie case of fraud, or it can present sufficient evidence of fraud to the guarantor before payment is made. Payment should be refused only in the rare cases where the guarantor has clear or obvious knowledge of the fraud. Clear or obvious knowledge is a high standard in that the fraud must be blatantly apparent. What is clear or obvious fraud in a legal sense is not necessarily clear or obvious in a commercial sense. That is why, when a court is asked to review the legality of a banks decision to honour its obligation to pay pursuant to a demand guarantee, it must place itself in the exact same situation that the bank was in at that time, without resorting to ex post facto reasoning. The exception must be kept narrow: the potential scope of the fraud exception must not be a means of creating serious uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the operation of demand guarantees; at the same time the application of the principle of autonomy must not serve to encourage or facilitate fraud in such transactions.\n\tCourts can look to either the tendered documents or the underlying contract to detect fraud. However, an allegation of fraud is not an invitation for courts to allow sophisticated commercial parties to refashion their agreement to an argue now, pay later structure when the bar is not met. Fraud is a high bar, and the exception will not apply where the principal can only prove conduct amounting to something less than fraud. Fraud in this context involves some aspect of public order  bad faith alone is not enough  and it has to be tailored to the specific context of demand guarantees. The case must be one where the demand on the guarantee is utterly without justification or where it is apparent there is no right to payment.\n\tFraud committed by a third party should not prevent an innocent beneficiary from demanding payment on a demand guarantee. In the context of a letter of guarantee backed by a counter-guarantee, fraud committed by the beneficiary of the guarantee will always be third-party fraud for the purposes of the counter-guarantee. Where the guarantor has clear or obvious knowledge of the beneficiarys fraud under the letter of guarantee but decides to pay nonetheless, that fraud can be attributed to the guarantor. What triggers the demand for payment under a counter-guarantee is payment under the guarantee. To determine whether a beneficiarys demand for payment under a counter-guarantee was fraudulent, a court must look past the clear line of separation between the guarantee and the counter-guarantee. This inquiry must not be transformed, however, into a dispute over the underlying contract.\n\tIn the instant case, the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by not giving any weight to the judgments of the Greek courts. Had these judgments been considered as facts informing the conduct of HMOD and of the Greek bank for the purposes of assessing whether the fraud exception applies to the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee, the only possible conclusion would have been that HMODs demand under the Greek Letter of Guarantee and the Greek banks decision to pay were valid. It is irrelevant that the Greek judgments were not formally recognized and therefore not enforceable in Quebec, since the Greek Letter of Guarantee was governed by Greek law and the parties to this letter were not domiciled in Quebec. There would have been no reason to seek the recognition and enforcement of the Greek judgments because there was simply nothing in these decisions to be enforced in Quebec.\n\tFurthermore, while the Greek judgments are not binding on the Quebec courts, the principle of comity must guide any determination regarding the weight to be given to them. When foreign judgments are received in evidence without being formally recognized in Quebec, they are still prima facie proof of the reported facts, of the proper application of the foreign law and of the foreign courts jurisdiction over the matter, under art. 2822 C.C.Q. They cannot simply be ignored by Quebec courts, who must recognize the factual effect of those decisions. A foreign decision introduced as evidence is a factual constraint on the Quebec courts and should be treated as such. Although a trial judge is free to determine the appropriate weight to be given to a foreign decision in light of all the evidence, they cannot second-guess the reported facts or the proper application of the foreign law by the foreign court. This is precisely what the trial judge failed to do. Further, the public order exception in arts. 3081 and 3155(5) C.C.Q. cannot serve as a basis for disregarding the factual effect of the Greek judgments. Giving a factual effect to a foreign decision is very different from a Quebec court applying foreign law, recognizing that decision, or incorporating its solution into Quebecs legal order.\n\tIn light of all of the evidence, which includes the Greek judgments, the trial judges ultimate conclusion that the requirements for the fraud exception were met cannot stand. The trial judge failed to interpret as a whole HMODs undertaking not to demand payment under the Greek Letter of Guarantee as long as the arbitration procedure was ongoing and until the final award was rendered. HMOD could validly withdraw its undertaking, and it was no longer in effect when HMOD demanded payment. Drawing on the Greek Letter of Guarantee in this context thus cannot be a basis for a finding of fraud. It was also an error for the trial judge to conclude that HMODs conduct was fraudulent on the basis of either the ICC Arbitral Tribunals interim order or one of the Superior Courts provisional injunctions, which were not enforceable in Greece. As to the timing of HMODs demand for payment, although it may be tempting to look at HMODs conduct after the fact, doing so would constitute impermissible reasoning. On the face of the Greek Letter of Guarantee, HMOD could validly demand payment when it did.\n\tFinally, even if HMODs conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud for the purposes of the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee, in light of all the evidence, the Greek bank (the beneficiary) must be considered innocent of HMODs (the third party) alleged fraud for the purposes of that letter. In assessing whether the Greek bank had clear or obvious knowledge of the alleged fraud, the Court must place itself in the exact same situation that the Greek bank was in by standing in its shoes, and therefore confine itself to the facts as the Greek bank knew them on the date when payment to HMOD was made. The Greek bank was faced with a judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction  the only court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of the Greek Letter of Guarantee  which found that HMOD could validly draw on the Greek Letter of Guarantee. This decision, as a factual constraint, is a determinative element in the analysis of the Greek banks clear or obvious knowledge. In reality, only one decision was enforceable against the Greek bank at the time, and this decision did not enjoin it from paying HMOD. Given the autonomous nature of the guarantee and lack of an operative injunction, the Greek bank had no choice but to pay. The conduct of the Greek bank was that of an innocent beneficiary under the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee. It did not participate in any fraud, nor did it have clear or obvious knowledge of alleged fraud at the time of payment. The requirements for the fraud exception were not met, and in consequence, the autonomy of the Canadian Letter of Counter-Guarantee had to prevail.\nCases Cited\nBy Kasirer J.\n\tApplied: Bank of Nova Scotia v.

The debate in this case has fixed on allegations of fraud brought against a third party to the disputed letter of credit. When will the fraudulent conduct of a stranger to a letter of credit be attributable to that letters beneficiary, as the beneficiarys own fraud, thereby requiring the issuing bank to refuse a demand for payment under the fraud exception?\nAt the heart of this dispute is a Letter of Counter-Guarantee governed by Quebec law. This letter of credit was issued by the National Bank of Canada at the behest of its customer, Bombardier inc., in favour of a Greek bank, Eurobank Ergasias S.A. By arranging the issuance of this letter of credit, Bombardier sought to facilitate a complex transaction for the supply of aircraft to the Hellenic Ministry of Defense, or HMOD. Eurobank issued a distinct Letter of Guarantee in favour of HMOD, again at Bombardiers request, that is subject to Greek law. The plan for the interlocking letters of credit was straightforward: should HMOD call on Eurobank to honour the Greek Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would be entitled to call on the National Bank to reimburse it under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. \nWhen HMOD demanded payment under the Greek letter of credit, Bombardier sought an injunction before the Quebec Superior Court to stop the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for payment by Eurobank as beneficiary under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier has alleged that HMOD  a third party to the Quebec letter  committed fraud under that instrument and that, by reason of Eurobanks knowledge and participation in that fraud, the National Bank should be prevented from honouring Eurobanks demand for payment based on the fraud exception. If the credit is honoured by the National Bank, Bombardier would of course be liable to its bank for that amount. That is unfair, says Bombardier, because an arbitration tribunal to which the parties had submitted their differences decided that Bombardier did not owe the relevant funds to HMOD. \nThe narrow question on appeal to this Court is whether fraud committed by HMOD under the Greek letter of credit can be attributed to Eurobank as its own as beneficiary of the Quebec letter of credit. In that event, says Bombardier, the fraud exception to the autonomous character of letters of credit should apply to Eurobank. This would mean that the National Bank must refuse the beneficiarys demand for payment under the Quebec letter as fraudulent. In an alternative argument, Bombardier takes the view that because the underlying contract is null, so too are the letters of credit connected to it, notwithstanding the principle of autonomy that governs such letters.\nIn Bank of Nova Scotia v. Angelica-Whitewear Ltd., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 59, the Court recognized the fraud exception to an issuing banks near absolute duty to honour a demand for payment under a letter of credit. Writing for the Court, Le Dain J. carefully sought to balance two competing policy objectives that he described as being in tension in the law: the importance to international commerce that banks respect the autonomous character of letters of credit and the importance of suppressing fraud in transactions (p. 72). On the one hand, widening the fraud exception might undermine the reliability of letters of credit; on the other hand, turning a blind eye to fraud might encourage misconduct in letter transactions. Le Dain J. concluded that the fraud exception should be confined to cases of obvious fraud of the beneficiary that is so egregious that the legitimacy of the supporting letter of credit can no longer be assumed. The bar for the fraud exception was set high. In keeping with this careful balance and high bar, he wrote, the exception should not extend to the fraud of a third party of which the beneficiary is innocent (p. 84). \nWe are now asked to consider if the fraud exception can extend to fraud by a third party and in what circumstances the beneficiarys conduct  in this case Eurobanks  will not be viewed as innocent. Specifically, the Court must decide whether, by reason of its connection to the third party HMODs misdeeds, Eurobank must answer for that fraud as its own.\nThe factual and legal setting is made complex by these interlocking letters of credit that are governed by different laws. It is made more complicated still in that Greek courts have decided that HMODs conduct under the Letter of Guarantee was not fraudulent under Greek law. \nThat said, in the proceedings relevant to this appeal, Bombardier sought an injunction in the Quebec Superior Court. Those proceedings fix our attention only on Quebec law and only on the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. And while judgments of the Greek courts have spoken to HMODs responsibility under the Greek Letter of Guarantee, no one has petitioned the Quebec courts for their recognition and enforcement under the relevant provisions of the Civil Code of Quebec (C.C.Q.).\nTo answer whether the National Bank must refuse payment to Eurobank under the fraud exception, we need not opine on the validity of the Letter of Guarantee under Greek law nor measure HMODs conduct under Greek law. These questions are the proper province of the Greek courts and cannot decide the matter before this Court that turns on whether the fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, governed as it is by Quebec law. \nEurobank has urged the Court in written and oral argument  mistakenly in my respectful view  to undertake an analysis of the fraud exception in the context of the Letter of Guarantee. Eurobank does so, no doubt, thinking that we will be convinced by judgments of the Greek courts concluding that there was no fraud by HMOD under the Greek letter of credit. But that is not the question on appeal before this Court, and since recognition and enforcement of these foreign decisions has not been obtained before the Quebec courts, those judgments cannot decide the matter. Instead, we must first ask whether HMODs conduct amounted to fraud by a third party under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee as governed by Quebec law. If so, we must then decide whether the fraud exception applies to Eurobank as beneficiary under the Quebec letter, on the basis of its own conduct, according to the Canadian standard set forth in Angelica-Whitewear. \nTo my mind, where fraud by a third party is established on the facts and a beneficiary under a letter of credit governed by Quebec law knows of that fraud and participates in it, the fraud becomes the beneficiarys own. The fraud exception then applies, and the issuer must be stopped from paying the beneficiary. \nHere, the trial judge decided, as a matter of fact, that HMOD acted fraudulently. He found too that Eurobank knew of HMODs fraud and nevertheless demanded payment under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. In a word, Eurobank was not innocent because it was aware of the third-party fraud and participated in it. Like the majority judges in the Court of Appeal, I see no reviewable errors in these findings nor in the trial judges ultimate conclusion: HMODs fraud is attributable to Eurobank as its own and Eurobank cannot, as beneficiary under the Quebec letter, demand payment. \nOn this basis, I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the conclusion that the National Bank should be enjoined from honouring Eurobanks demand for payment under the fraud exception recognized in Angelica-Whitewear. In the circumstances, I find it unnecessary to decide whether the letters of credit are null.\nBackground\nUnderstanding this appeal requires a brief description of the four principal actors, the two underlying contracts and the two interlocking letters of credit.\nThe Relevant Actors\nBombardier inc., a respondent in this appeal and plaintiff in the originating proceedings, is a Canadian aviation company. Its head office is in Montreal, Quebec. \nEurobank Ergasias S.A. (together with its predecessors, Eurobank), the appellant and a defendant before the Superior Court, is a Greek bank. One of its predecessors was the issuer of the Letter of Guarantee. Eurobank is the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nThe General Directorate for Defense Armaments and Investments of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense is designated as an appellant in this appeal and a defendant in first instance. It is responsible for military procurement for the Hellenic Republic. As it notes in its written argument, HMOD did not file appeals from the trial judgment or the judgment of the Court of Appeal because it does not recognize the jurisdiction of Quebec courts over it, but stated it was duty-bound to address before our Court points it raised in the courts below (A.F., HMOD, at para. 96).\nThe National Bank of Canada, the second respondent in this appeal, is a Canadian bank. Its head office is in Montreal. The National Bank is the issuer of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. It was named as a defendant in the originating proceedings by Bombardier, its customer, who sought to stop the bank from making payment which would ultimately be to Bombardiers detriment. The National Bank takes positions that are consonant with Bombardiers views of an issuing banks responsibility under a letter of credit. In particular, the National Bank joins Bombardier in asking that Eurobank not be paid under the Quebec letter and that the present appeal be dismissed.\nThe Underlying Contracts\nIn 1998, HMOD entered into a procurement contract with Bombardier for the purchase of 10 firefighting amphibious aircraft for US$252,151,899. The contract is governed by Greek law.\nAt the same time, Bombardier and HMOD concluded an Offsets Contract, pursuant to which Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the aircraft procurement to Greek companies. Also governed by Greek law, the Offsets Contract provides that Bombardier would owe HMOD liquidated damages at the end of a 10-year term if it did not fulfil its subcontracting obligations. It was agreed that payment of these liquidated damages would be secured by a letter of credit issued by a Greek bank in favour of HMOD. The Offsets Contract also directs that disputes will be resolved by an arbitration tribunal, to be seated in Paris, under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).\nThe Letters of Credit\nOne of Eurobanks predecessors, ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited, also a Greek bank, issued the Letter of Guarantee in favour of HMOD on February 5, 1999, in the amount of US$27,736,709 to secure payment of the liquidated damages Bombardier would owe pursuant to the Offsets Contract. The Letter of Guarantee is governed by Greek law. Under the Offsets Contract, HMOD was responsible for reducing the amount of the Letter of Guarantee as Bombardier fulfilled its subcontracting obligations. In June 2010, the Letter of Guarantee was reduced to US$13,868,354.60.\nThe National Bank issued the Letter of Counter-Guarantee in favour of Eurobank on January 29, 1999, to secure payment of the amounts that Eurobank would be required to pay HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee should HMOD state that Bombardier failed to perform its obligations under the Offsets Contract. HMOD is not a party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which is governed by Quebec law. The Letter of Counter-Guarantee provides that the National Bank of Canada hereby irrevocably undertake[s] to reimburse [Eurobank] all amount(s) claimed by the beneficiary of [its Letter of] Guarantee (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118). It states further that payment would be made under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee by the issuing National Bank after receipt of [Eurobanks] tested telex/authenticated SWIFT indicating that [it] ha[s] received from the beneficiary of [its] guarantee [(i.e. the beneficiary of the Letter of Guarantee, HMOD)] a demand for payment in conformity with the terms and conditions of [its] guarantee [(i.e. the Letter of Guarantee)] (p. 118).\nWhile the two letters of credit are distinct  and governed by different laws  they are connected. The opening paragraphs of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which reproduce word for word the entirety of the Letter of Guarantee, make that plain. \nThe Initial Dispute\nEventually, Bombardier determined that it would be unable to meet its subcontracting obligations under the Offsets Contract given what it viewed as an insufficient number of available and qualified Greek companies. Bombardier claimed that it should not be required to pay liquidated damages. HMOD disagreed. To resolve the matter, an ICC Arbitral Tribunal was constituted as provided for in the Offsets Contract. Arbitration proceedings took place over several years, with hearings in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Bombardier obtained permission to add a second issue to its claim, arguing that the Offsets Contract was null because it violated European Union law relating to the free movement of goods. \nIn April 2012, HMOD formally undertook to Bombardier and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal not to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee for as long as the [arbitration] procedure is ongoing (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 199).\nIn July 2013, Bombardier and HMOD were advised that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal would issue its final award by December 31, 2013. \nOn August 5, 2013, notwithstanding its previous undertaking, HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee in the amount of US$13,868,354.60 while the issuance of the final award was still pending. This was followed by other demands for payment, leading up to a final demand on December 23, 2013.\nApplications for Interim Relief\nOn learning that HMOD had demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee, Bombardier filed an urgent application for interim relief with the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. Bombardier sought an order declaring that HMODs demand for payment was invalid and requiring HMOD to comply with its undertaking. On August 13, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, which order[ed] that [HMOD] shall abstain from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee issued pursuant to Offsets Benefit Contract 27/98, and this until issuance of the Final Award in the present case (A.R., vol. V, at p. 39). Bombardier asked for assurances that HMOD would comply with this order, but such assurances were not given.\nUnsure as to whether HMOD would comply with Procedural Order No. 11, Bombardier filed a motion for provisional, interlocutory and permanent injunction and safeguard order in the Superior Court of Quebec. Bombardier sought orders to prevent payment under the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. In August 2013, Prevost J. issued a provisional injunction, to last 10 days, that enjoined Eurobank and the National Bank from honouring the letters of credit. Later, Davis J. issued a new provisional injunction, to last 10 days, that also prevented payment.\nIn August 2013, Eurobank brought parallel proceedings in Greece, seeking an order to prevent payment under the Letter of Guarantee until the conclusion of the arbitral proceedings. Judge Chrysoula Pana of the Athens One-Member First Instance Court issued a provisional injunction that authorized Eurobank to not pay under the Letter of Guarantee. On December 16, 2013, Judge Panayiotis Kostis of that court dismissed Eurobanks application for injunctive relief on its merits.\nHMODs Final Demand for Payment\nOn December 5, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed the parties that its final award had been submitted to the ICC Court for approval, which was confirmed by the ICC Court on December 19, 2013. On December 23, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed the parties that the final award would be released on December 31, 2013. \nOn December 23, 2013, HMOD served Eurobank with an Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest demanding that Eurobank, as the issuer of the Letter of Guarantee, pay HMOD as beneficiary of that letter of credit. The Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest stated that Eurobank had an obligation to pay HMOD in accordance with its demand, notwithstanding the orders of Quebec courts. No reference was made to the imminent issuance of the final arbitral award or HMODs undertaking not to demand payment under Procedural Order No. 11. The Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest further stated that [i]n the case of non-payment of the letter of guarantee until tomorrow, Tuesday 24 December 2013, the Hellenic Republic will take not only civil but also criminal legal measures, against the competent-responsible officers and employees of [Eurobank] for the fraudulent misappropriation of the amount embodied in the letter of guarantee and for any other offense (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 151 (emphasis deleted)). \nDrawing on expert evidence, the trial judge described the measures alluded to in the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest in detail. He found that Eurobank believed that if it did not comply with the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest, it would expose itself to the freezing of a portion of its assets and assets of its employees, as well as criminal sanctions, including imprisonment, for the banks representatives.\nThe day after the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest was served, Eurobank paid HMOD under the Greek Letter of Guarantee. \nOn December 27, 2013, following up on earlier communications, Eurobank demanded payment from the National Bank under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The notice to the National Bank recorded that HMOD had demanded payment of US$13,868,354.40 pursuant to the Letter of Guarantee and, [t]herefore, [the National Bank is] in default on [its] obligations, including under the terms of the above referenced counter-guarantee for the same amount, plus expenses and interest (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 148).\nThe Final ICC Arbitral Award and Subsequent Proceedings\nIn its final award, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal decided that the Offsets Contract violated European Union law. It was thus null and void ab initio, and thus no liquidated damages were due. That award was upheld by the Court of Appeal of Paris. \nIn the weeks following, Schrager J., as he then was, issued a safeguard order upon petition by Bombardier. Schrager J. decided that HMODs conduct was clearly abusive and fraudulent and that Eurobanks predecessor had acted with full knowledge of the facts (2014 QCCS 181, at paras. 43 and 46 (CanLII)). This was a fraud or at least participation . . . in a fraud, on the part of the Greek bank, that sufficiently polluted demands for payment under the Quebec letter (paras. 46-47). Relying on Angelica-Whitewear, Schrager J. enjoined the National Bank from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The safeguard order was later extended until the issuance of the judgment on the merits.\nBombardiers action on the merits for an injunction relating to Eurobanks demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee advanced to trial in the Superior Court. These proceedings are at the origin of the present appeal.\nAs amended, Bombardiers originating motion sought homologation of the award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and a permanent injunction enjoining the National Bank from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier rested its arguments on two grounds, both of which remain in dispute before this Court.\nFirst, Eurobanks connection to HMODs fraudulent conduct as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee makes the fraud its own, such that the National Bank should not honour Eurobanks demand for payment. Bombardier argues that the fraud exception applied to Eurobank as beneficiary under the Quebec letter. Given that HMODs conduct was fraudulent, pleaded Bombardier, Eurobanks demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is, by extension, also fraudulent. More specifically, Eurobank knew of HMODs fraud under the Letter of Guarantee and nevertheless demanded payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. For Bombardier  joined in this argument by the National Bank  this means that the fraud should be by extension attributed to Eurobank such that it cannot call on the National Bank to honour its undertaking to pay under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nSecond, and in the alternative, Bombardier argues that the letters of credit are null. Given that the Offsets Contract is null because it violates European Union law, so too are the letters of credit associated with it, including the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nIn proceedings before Greek courts that were parallel to the proceedings before Quebec courts, Eurobank sought to recover the money that it had paid to HMOD. On November 29, 2019, the Greek court of first instance ordered HMOD to reimburse Eurobank the amount it had paid under the Letter of Guarantee, plus interest. The Court of Appeal of Athens allowed an appeal of that order after the trial judgment of the Quebec Superior Court was rendered. Eurobank moved to admit the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens as new evidence before the Court of Appeal of Quebec. That motion was granted. At the time of the hearing in our Court, a further appeal before the Hellenic Supreme Court was pending. \nFollowing the hearing, the Hellenic Supreme Court rendered judgment, confirming in substance the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens. While the present appeal was on reserve, Eurobank successfully moved to adduce the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court as new evidence for the purposes of this appeal. Bombardier and the National Bank contested the motion, arguing in particular that the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court has only tenuous relevance to the questions on appeal and that, as a result, the test for adducing additional evidence on appeal was not made out. I disagree. It is sufficient that the proposed additional evidence bear on a potentially decisive issue  here the character of the conduct of HMOD  to meet the test set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 (see also Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, at para. 29). The motion having been granted, I propose to consider the probative value of this fresh evidence on appeal.\nJudicial History\nQuebec Superior Court, 2018 QCCS 2127 (Wery J.)\nThe trial judge held that Quebec courts had jurisdiction over the proceedings relating to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee as well as jurisdiction to homologate the arbitral award as a matter incidental to that letter. He homologated the award and ordered HMOD to comply with it. \nTurning to whether the National Bank, as the issuer of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, should be enjoined from paying Eurobank, he addressed Bombardiers argument that the fraud exception applied. To answer that question, the trial judge considered whether the payment by Eurobank, as issuing bank under the Letter of Guarantee, was made to HMOD as a result of the latters fraud.\nThe trial judge held that the manner in which HMOD obtained payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent. He rejected Eurobanks argument that it had been forced to make the payment by HMODs threats. Eurobanks own conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of which it was aware. Ultimately, he wrote, Eurobank may not have conceived the fraudulent plot, it may not have supplied the weapons, but it surely participated in pulling the trigger (para. 205 (CanLII)). The trial judge characterized Eurobanks conduct as tantamount to fraud, noting that [o]nce contaminated by HMODs fraud, Eurobank cannot cleanse itself and may not demand payment from [the National Bank]. Fraus Omnia Corrumpit (para. 214).\nFinally, the trial judge held that [i]t is difficult to accept in law that the invalidity, ab initio, of the Offsets Contract . . . does not cause the invalidity of the instruments that were issued to guarantee the obligations flowing from said contract (para. 237). Given that the Letter of Guarantee was declared null by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, the Counter-Guarantee must follow suit, and the National Bank should be ordered not to pay Eurobank (para. 240).\nAt the end of the day, the trial judge declared the Letter of Counter-Guarantee null and enjoined the National Bank from paying any amount to the beneficiary under the Counter-Guarantee. He homologated the final award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and declared that the payment made to HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee was not due and could not be the basis for payment under the Counter-Guarantee or produce legal consequences against Bombardier. Finally, he ordered that HMOD comply with the final arbitral award.\nQuebec Court of Appeal, 2022 QCCA 802 (Mainville, Hamilton and Baudouin JJ.A.)\nMainville J.A., Baudouin J.A. Concurring\nBy a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal for the sole purpose of striking the Superior Courts order that HMOD comply with the ICC Tribunals final award. Writing for the majority, Mainville J.A. confirmed the trial judgment in all other respects. In particular, the court enjoined the National Bank from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee and declared that letter of credit null.\nFirst, the majority agreed with the trial judge that Quebec courts have jurisdiction over the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. However, the trial judge should not have ordered HMOD to comply with the final arbitral award as it is not domiciled in Quebec. Quebec courts can homologate the award so that it is legally binding in Quebec, but cannot order that it be binding extraterritorially in Greece. \nSecond, the majority saw no basis to interfere with the trial judges conclusion that the National Bank be enjoined from paying Eurobank as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. \nEurobank did not directly challenge the finding of fraud on the part of HMOD before the Court of Appeal. That challenge came from HMOD itself. However, since HMOD did not recognize the jurisdiction of Quebec courts, it had not filed an appeal of the trial judgment. Its contestation of this finding was therefore not properly before the Court of Appeal and was dismissed on that basis alone. In any event, no reviewable error was shown in the trial judges conclusion that HMOD had engaged in a bad faith and fraudulent attempt to circumvent the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by any and all means (para. 60 (CanLII)). \nMoreover, the finding of a Greek court that HMOD acted consistently with Greek law does not undermine the trial judges conclusion that HMOD acted fraudulently. The foreign judgments were not formally recognized and, as such, are not binding on Quebec courts (para. 64). Mainville J.A. accepted that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens could form part of the record in this case (para. 62). However, citing the principle in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q., he noted that Quebec courts could disregard a foreign judgment when the outcome of the judgment is manifestly inconsistent with public order in international relations. The outcome of the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens was, in his view, manifestly inconsistent with public order. It would be curious indeed, wrote Mainville J.A., if this Court were to enforce a foreign decision which is in complete contradiction with binding judgments of the Superior Court and which has chosen to both disregard and discard those judgments (para. 68). Further, the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens essentially stands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal (para. 69).\nAfter reviewing evidence given by Eurobanks representatives at trial, Mainville J.A. held that it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the National Bank was not bound to pay Eurobank, as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. It is clear in this case, he wrote, that Eurobank had sufficient knowledge of the fraud prior to paying (para. 71). Although Eurobank paid HMOD as a result of threats made against it, the trial judge had rightly concluded that this did not absolve it of responsibility. Eurobanks decision to pay was contrary to orders of Quebec courts and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. These orders must be upheld as a matter of judicial and public policy. Ordering the National Bank to pay under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee would condone the evasion of a binding arbitration process by means of fraud and threats and render meaningless the interim order and final awards of the ICC tribunal (para. 76). \nHamilton J.A., Dissenting\nThe dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal, set aside the trial judgment in part, and dismissed the action. \nHamilton J.A. rejected Eurobanks arguments based on the lack of jurisdiction of the Quebec courts over the Letter of Counter-Guarantee and chose not to comment on the authority of Quebec courts to order HMOD to comply with the ICC Arbitral Tribunals order. \nTurning to a consideration of HMODs demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee, he wrote that the conduct was, in a word, deplorable (para. 164). \nThe dissenting judge proceeded to review each of the six bases the trial judge identified in finding that HMODs conduct amounted to fraud. He found the trial judge had made errors in every conclusion but one. In particular, he decided that HMOD was entitled to withdraw its undertaking not to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee because the undertaking did not have a specific duration (para. 177). He held that the provisional orders of the arbitral tribunal, including Procedural Order No. 11, were not binding on HMOD because no court had declared the orders to be enforceable. The orders were contractually binding on HMOD, but [t]he breach of the order by HMOD is . . . a contractual breach, . . . not a legal one (para. 184). As for the characterization of HMODs legal bullying against Eurobank, the dissenting judge wrote that there is nothing fraudulent in threatening to apply sanctions available under Greek law for the failure to pay (para. 192). \nFor the dissenting judge, it was, however, indicative of fraud that once HMOD received the final arbitration award, it continued to refuse repayment of the amount it had received under the Letter of Guarantee (para. 200). He continued: . . . the urgent demands for payment made in the days preceding the final arbitration award which HMOD expected to lose and HMODs intent to keep the money regardless of the final arbitration award, are sufficient to conclude that HMODs demand for payment on December 18, 2013 was fraudulent (para. 201). \nHe nevertheless chose not to hold Eurobank responsible for the fraud. While Eurobank knew that HMODs demand was made right before the final arbitral award was issued, it did not know that HMOD expected to lose or intended to keep the funds even if it lost. Although Eurobank may have suspected fraud, these suspicions . . . should not be assimilated to knowledge of fraud (para. 218). \nUltimately, it was not clear and obvious to Eurobank that HMODs demand for payment was fraudulent based on suspicions alone (para. 223). Eurobank did not pay with knowledge of the fraud, therefore it is entitled to payment from the National Bank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. \nIssues and Grounds of Appeal\nThe issue before this Court is whether the National Bank is required to refuse Eurobanks demand for payment under the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The Court must determine whether the courts below erred in deciding that the fraud exception applies to Eurobank, in light of HMODs misconduct, so that the National Bank must be enjoined from honouring the demand for payment. A second issue is raised in the alternative: Did the courts below err in deciding that payment is not due because the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null given that the underlying Offsets Contract was declared null by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal?\nBefore this Court, Eurobank submits that HMODs conduct does not amount to fraud because the Greek courts confirmed its right to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee. Notwithstanding the orders of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, HMODs demand for payment was not indicative of fraud because provisional orders cannot be homologated. HMODs conduct was perhaps a breach of contract, but not an illegal act (A.F., at paras. 74-75). \nEven if HMOD engaged in fraud, Eurobank says that it could not have known about it since the Court of competent jurisdiction  the Greek Court  confirmed otherwise (A.F., at para. 88). Finally, its decision to honour HMODs demands was made under threat and, consequently, cannot be considered fraudulent. \nBased on the parties arguments, it would seem that they have, at times, lost sight of the issues that are properly before this Court. Much of the debate in this case was framed around the question whether HMODs conduct in respect of the Letter of Guarantee amount to fraud under Quebec law. But the Letter of Guarantee is not subject to Quebec law. And while the two letters are interlocking, HMOD is technically a stranger  a third party  to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which is the letter of credit that is at issue before this Court.\nThe real issue is whether, under Quebec law, HMODs conduct amounts to what Le Dain J. in Angelica-Whitewear called fraud by a third party in respect of the Quebec Letter of Counter-Guarantee. If so, then the subsequent issue becomes whether that third partys fraud can be attributed to Eurobank, as party to and beneficiary under that letter of credit, such that the fraud exception applies. In that case, payment by the issuer, the National Bank, should be prohibited.\nAnalysis\nThe Law Relating to Letters of Credit in Canada \nA letter of credit is an instrument, understood to be autonomous from the underlying contract to which it speaks, that is issued by a financial institution at the behest of its customer. It entitles the beneficiary of the letter to payment on demand from the issuing bank, so long as that demand conforms to the requirements set out in the letter of credit. Typically, the customer contracts with the financial institution to issue the letter of credit as a means of providing comfort to the beneficiary that an underlying agreement will be performed as promised. The financial institution has a nearly absolute obligation to pay when presented with a valid demand. There is only one recognized exception in Canadian law: when there is fraud by the beneficiary that is brought to the financial institutions attention prior to payment, as explained in Angelica-Whitewear. \nSome letters of credit are used to facilitate payment in a transaction as a means of moving money from one jurisdiction to another (K. McGuinness, The Law of Guarantee (3rd ed. 2013), at 16.20; see also Crawford and Falconbridge, Banking and Bills of Exchange (8th ed. 1986), by B. Crawford, at p. 838; N. LHeureux and M. Lacoursiere, Droit bancaire (5th ed. 2017), at pp. 399-400). These letters of credit, called often documentary letters of credit, are typically the primary method of payment in the transaction. However, it is increasingly common for a different sort of letter of credit that began [to evolve] only a few decades ago, called a standby letter of credit to be used as a performance ensuring mechanism rather than the primary method of payment (McGuinness, at 16.43). LHeureux and Lacoursiere explain that [translation] [a] standby letter of credit is a letter of credit whose usual function is to serve as a guarantee. Its purpose is therefore different from that of the traditional documentary letter of credit that constitutes a payment instrument (p. 434). \nI note that the parties and the courts below have primarily referred to the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee simply as letters of credit, although they have occasionally used other terms, such as guarantee and counter-standby (see, e.g., A.R., vol. VI, at p. 83). When a letter of credit is used as a means to secure performance of a contractual obligation, it may be called a standby letter of credit (see G. B. Graham and B. Geva, Standby Credits in Canada (1984), 9 Can. Bus. L.J. 180, at p. 183). The term demand guarantee is used for similar purposes, especially outside of North America (see McGuinness, at 3.87-3.88 and 16.51-16.52; see also R. Goode, Abstract Payment Undertakings in International Transactions (1996), 22 Brook. J. Intl L. 1, at p. 15). The difference between demand guarantees and standby letters of credit has been said to be largely illusory or, perhaps, of a semantic nature (E. P. Ellinger, Standby Letters of Credit (1978), 6 I.B.L. 604, at p. 622). As Professor Roy Goode observed, from a legal viewpoint demand guarantees and standby credits are indistinguishable, and the latter clearly falls within the definition of a demand guarantee in article 2 [of the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees] (p. 16). With that in mind, it is not unusual for standby letters of credit to be subject to the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees, as is the case here (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118). Whether the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee are best described as demand guarantees, letters of credit or standby letters of credit is of no consequence to the outcome of this appeal. \nCommonly relied upon in domestic and international commercial transactions, letters of credit are widely used as a means of managing risk. In particular, standby letters of credit are issued in order to ensure that the beneficiary will be paid what they believe they are owed under an underlying contract. The letter of credit does not replace the customers obligation to pay the beneficiary under the underlying contract. Instead, the letter of credit is superimposed on the transaction (LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at pp. 399-400). A demand for payment will typically arise when there is an allegation of failure of the customer or account party to perform some duty as agreed (Crawford and Falconbridge, at p. 838). The premise is pay now, and argue later if necessary (McGuinness, at 16.47). \nThe beneficiary can take comfort in knowing that they will be paid, unless they engage in fraud, and that any disputes relating to the underlying contract will be resolved only after they have been paid. The risk of non-payment by their co-contracting party is allocated away from them. Instead, the issuing financial institution takes on the risk of not being paid by their client. Should the beneficiary make a valid demand for payment because the issuers client is in default under the underlying contract, the client is no less responsible for its breach of contract and must reimburse the issuer.\nWhile letters of credit are only as good as the issuer who stands behind them (McGuinness, at 16.53), the business community has come to regard autonomous letters of credit issued by reputable banks as a reliable means of ensuring payment for the beneficiary. For this reason, courts are slow to interfere with letters of credit, because interventions by the courts that are too ready or too frequent might seriously impair the reliance which international business places on [them] (I. F. G. Baxter, The Law of Banking (4th ed. 1992), at p. 172). \nAutonomy and Strict Compliance\nThere are two fundamental principles to the law governing letters of credit: autonomy and strict compliance (LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at p. 403; see also M. Deschamps, Letters of Credit: The Autonomy Principle and the Fraud Exception (2022), 38 B.F.L.R. 245, at p. 249).\nAutonomy of the Letter of Credit\nAutonomy means that a letter of credit is an independent obligation of the issuing or confirming bank (Crawford and Falconbridge, at p. 853; see also Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 70; LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at p. 403; Deschamps, at p. 248). As the Quebec Court of Appeal has noted, [translation] [i]t is well established that a letter of credit is an autonomous contract between the issuing bank and the beneficiary and is defined by its own terms and conditions, independently of the contract between the originator and the issuing bank or between the beneficiary and the originator (Groupe SM (International) Construction inc. v. Banque Nationale du Canada, 2013 QCCA 1118, at para. 8 (CanLII)). The obligation of the issuing bank to honour a valid demand for payment is independent of the performance of the underlying contract for which the credit was issued (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 70).\nIn an opinion that refers to Angelica-Whitewear, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit observed that, due to the autonomy principle, [t]he letter of credit takes on a life of its own which infuses the credit transaction with the simplicity and certainty that are its hallmarks (Alaska Textile Co. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., 982 F.2d 813 (1992), at p. 815). The autonomy principle gives letters of credit their reliable character; a dispute about performance of the underlying contract generally does not justify a banks refusal to honour the credit. A leading American case that was cited by Le Dain J. in Angelica-Whitewear was careful to recall that the autonomy principle should not be lightly set aside: It would be a most unfortunate interference with business transactions if a bank before honoring drafts drawn upon it was obliged or even allowed to go behind the documents . . . and enter into controversies between the buyer and the seller . . . (Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., 31 N.Y.S.2d 631 (Sup. Ct. 1941), at p. 633). \nIt follows that the beneficiary can be completely satisfied that whatever disputes may thereafter arise between him and the banks customer in relation to the performance or indeed existence of the underlying contract, the bank is personally undertaking to pay him provided that the specified conditions are met (Bolivinter Oil S.A. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, [1984] 1 Lloyds Rep. 251 (Eng. C.A.), at p. 257). Of course, the banks customer may ultimately have a claim against the beneficiary, but that is typically none of the financial institutions concern since the letter of credit ensures that the beneficiary is paid in the meantime. The financial institution [translation] is not . . . required to inquire into the performance of the underlying contract since its obligation is simply to pay the beneficiary when presented with a valid demand (LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at p. 403).\nStrict Compliance\nStrict compliance means that the obligation of the issuing bank must be determined based only on the strict conformity of the presentation (including conformity of the documents presented) with the terms of the letter of credit (Deschamps, at p. 248). Therefore, the financial institution must ensure that the beneficiary, when it demands payment, presents documents that correspond to the requirements stated in the letter of credit. A letter of credit is drafted to define the scope and terms of the issuers undertaking so that the issuer need only examine the terms of the letter of credit and the documents presented by the beneficiary (OMERS Realty Corp. v. 7636156 Canada Inc. (Trustee in Bankruptcy of), 2020 ONCA 681, 153 O.R. (3d) 271, at para. 42). As Le Dain J. explained, strict compliance requires not only that the tendered documents conform to the terms and conditions of the letter of credit but that they appear on their face to be consistent with one another (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 98). \nSubstantial compliance is not the test. Only documents that strictly conform to the terms in the letter of credit will trigger an obligation to pay (Crawford and Falconbridge, at p. 856; see also Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 96). That said, there is room for a limited qualification to this rule that makes it possible, in clearly appropriate cases, to overlook immaterial discrepancies (Angelica-Whitewear, at pp. 97-98; see also Universal Stainless Steel & Alloys Inc. v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, 2009 ONCA 801, 256 O.A.C. 109).\nLe Dain J. wrote that [t]he fundamental rule is that the documents must appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 94 (emphasis in original)). A reasonably careful examination does not require perfection. The Singapore Court of Appeal, speaking to the same idea, observed that this works to protect the bank and to ensure the smooth flow of international trade and the avoidance of delay (Beam Technology (Mfg) Pte Ltd v. Standard Chartered Bank, [2002] SGCA 53, [2003] 1 S.L.R. 597, at para. 32). That said, if the financial institution pays the beneficiary without evaluating the documents presented to ensure that they strictly conform to the requirements set out in the letter of credit, they run the risk of not being reimbursed by their client (LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at p. 404).\nThe Fraud Exception to the Autonomy of Letters of Credit\nAs noted, the issuing financial institutions obligation to pay the beneficiary on demand is nearly absolute. There is only one recognized exception: when there is fraud by the beneficiary of the credit which has been sufficiently brought to the knowledge of the bank before payment of the draft or demonstrated to a court called on by the customer of the bank to issue an interlocutory injunction to restrain the bank from honouring the draft (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 71). \nLe Dain J. took care to note that [t]he potential scope of the fraud exception must not be a means of creating serious uncertainty and lack of confidence in the operation of letter of credit transactions; at the same time the application of the principle of autonomy must not serve to encourage or facilitate fraud in such transactions (p. 72). To achieve this balance, the standard set in Angelica-Whitewear for fraud is high in order to attain, as the intervener helpfully stated, a proper apportionment of risk between [the] issuers of letters of guarantee . . . and the participating business parties to the underlying transaction (I.F., at para. 31). \nThe fraud exception is no less applicable when a second letter of credit is issued by a financial institution that requires it to pay when presented with an attestation that the first letter of credit has been called upon. As Professors LHeureux and Lacoursiere observe, the bank issuing the counter-guarantee must make the payment to the beneficiary when it attests that it has received a demand for payment under the first letter of credit. They explain that the obligation of the issuer of a counter-guarantee should however be subject to the exception of fraud by the beneficiary: [translation] Only obvious fraud or clear abuse constitutes an obstacle to payment of the guarantee by the bank that must make the decision to pay or not to pay (p. 433).\nThe intervener says that in instances of a counter-guarantee, a third party will sometimes engage in fraudulent conduct. The fraud by a third party in a counter-guarantee does not preclude the application of the fraud exception to the counter-guarantee itself where the beneficiary of a letter of counter-guarantee would be a perpetrator of a clear and obvious fraud (I.F., at para. 26, fn. 32). I agree that the conduct of a beneficiary under a counter-guarantee may serve to make the fraud of a third party its own. In such a case, the fraud exception applies directly to the demand of the beneficiary. \nWhile Angelica-Whitewear spoke first to Quebec law, Le Dain J. emphasized that the fraud exception to the autonomy of letters of credit is identical in both the Canadian common and civil law systems. It rests on a shared idea that is expressed in the civil law by the maxim fraus omnia corrumpit and in the common law by the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio (p. 82). Le Dain J. observed that this shared foundation for the fraud exception underscores the desirability of as much uniformity as possible in the law with respect to these vital instruments of international commerce (p. 83). Indeed, courts across Canada have applied the test developed in Angelica-Whitewear (Deschamps, at p. 256; see also OMERS Realty, at para. 43), and common law courts outside of Canada have turned to Angelica-Whitewear as a helpful resource (see, e.g., Alaska Textile (United States); Xing Fa (Hong Kong) Imp. & Exp. Ltd. v. Sungsan International Co., [2018] HKCFI 2743 (Hong Kong); Westpac New Zealand Ltd. v. MAP and Associates Ltd., [2011] NZSC 89, [2011] 3 N.Z.L.R. 751 (New Zealand)).\nI share Le Dain J.s sense of the importance of a right balance between the need to protect the autonomy of letters of credit with the need to discourage fraud. The exception should be sufficiently inclusive to capture most fraudulent conduct that should not be facilitated through letters of credit. At the same time, if the fraud exception is too inclusive, letters of credit could become much less reliable. Balancing these two concerns requires this Court to set a high bar for fraud, which should be obvious before an issuing bank refuses to honour payment under a letter of credit. \nLe Dain J. was right to say that, generally speaking, the fraud of a third party to a letter of credit does not engage the fraud exception where the beneficiary of the letter is innocent of that fraud. To accept that the fraud of a third party requires the issuer to refuse to honour a demand for payment in all circumstances would expand the fraud exception at the expense of the reliability of letters of credit. But Le Dain J. was equally careful to leave open the possibility that the beneficiary might not be innocent of the third partys misconduct. At a minimum, the beneficiary will likely be innocent of the third partys fraud if it demands payment in circumstances in which it is unaware of the fraud (see L. Sarna, Letters of Credit: The Law and Current Practice (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at pp. 5-56 and 5-57). But where the beneficiary has knowledge of fraud and proceeds to call for payment when it knows that the conditions of payment are not met, the beneficiary has, in a manner of speaking, made the fraud their own. This can occur in situations, like the present appeal, where the third party is itself a party to a letter of guarantee which interlocks with a letter of counter-guarantee. As the intervener wrote, in cases where it is established to the knowledge of the issuer of the letter of counter-guarantee that its beneficiary had clear and obvious knowledge of the fraud (perpetrated by the beneficiary of the primary letter of guarantee), that said issuer could refuse payment thereunder (I.F., at para. 26).\nFor the trial judge, this latter scenario is what happened here. He found that HMOD, a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, perpetrated a fraud as beneficiary under the primary Letter of Guarantee. Eurobank, the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, had clear and obvious knowledge of that fraud and called for payment anyway. Eurobank is therefore not innocent of the fraud perpetrated by HMOD. The National Bank, as issuer of the counter-guarantee, knew of this state of affairs before it paid and thus should not honour the demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. I turn now to Eurobanks contestation of the scenario described by the trial judge and confirmed on appeal. \nApplication \nBefore this Court, Eurobank argues that the trial judge, as well as the majority in the Court of Appeal, erred in applying the fraud exception. \nFirst, Eurobank says that the Greek courts, who were competent to decide the matter under the Letter of Guarantee, found that HMOD did not act fraudulently in demanding payment under that letter of credit. Moreover, HMODs conduct, while unsavoury, is not fraudulent because there was nothing illegal or deceitful in its demand for payment (A.F., Eurobank, at paras. 64, 67 and 79). HMOD supports this position, arguing that Greek courts found its conduct to be neither abusive nor fraudulent under the Letter of Guarantee and that the judgments of the Greek courts were misread, improperly criticized and completely disregarded by the courts below (A.F., HMOD, at para. 5).\nSecond, Eurobank says that even if one were to conclude that HMOD acted fraudulently, that conduct has no bearing on its right, as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, to demand payment (A.F., at para. 109). The trial judge erred in finding that Eurobank knew that HMODs conduct constituted fraud because there was not one iota of proof before him (para. 111). In addition, the principle of autonomy means that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is distinct, and the fraud exception must be applied in that light (para. 115).\nFor the reasons that follow, I disagree with Eurobank and HMOD. It is important to emphasize that Eurobank must identify a legal error or a palpable and overriding error of fact or of mixed fact and law in order to justify appellate intervention. Appellate courts must remember in particular that there is one, and only one, standard of review applicable to all factual conclusions made by the trial judge  that of palpable and overriding error (see Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 25) and that issues of mixed fact and law, absent an extricable legal error, are owed the same degree of deference. As I will explain, I am of the view that Eurobank has failed to identify a reviewable error.\nIt is true that the Letter of Guarantee is governed by Greek law and that Greek courts have jurisdiction to determine whether Eurobank was required to comply with HMODs demand for payment. But the Greek judgments have not been formally recognized by Quebec courts under the rules for recognition and enforcement of foreign decisions found in Title Four of Book Ten on Private International Law in the Civil Code of Quebec; they are thus unenforceable in the province. Under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee which is governed by Quebec law, HMODs demand for payment under the Greek letter of credit is relevant to determining whether Eurobanks own conduct, as beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, engages the fraud exception. The trial judge concluded that HMOD demanded payment to which it had no right. In my view, that amounts to fraud of a third party that is relevant to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Moreover, the trial judges conclusions that Eurobank was aware of and participated in HMODs fraud are entitled to deference. I conclude, as the majority of the Court of Appeal did, that the trial judges decision that the fraud exception applies with respect to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee should not be interfered with. \nEurobank is the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. An analysis of whether the fraud exception can apply must focus on whether Eurobank, as beneficiary, engaged in fraud that was brought to the attention of the National Bank. \nAlthough a letter of credit is autonomous from other contracts involved in a transaction, Angelica-Whitewear makes it plain that the fraud exception can apply if there is fraud in the transaction, even if the fraud affects the letter of credit only indirectly (pp. 72 and 84). This can include fraud by a third party. A third party may, for example, be a person other than the issuer or the beneficiary who forged documents that were given to the beneficiary (see generally United City Merchants (Investments) Ltd. v. Royal Bank of Canada, [1983] 1 A.C. 168 (H.L.)). \nIn this case, the scope of the transaction is clear. While the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is an autonomous letter of credit and is as such separate from other contracts, the very text of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee indicates that it is part of a broader transaction. The Letter of Counter-Guarantee and the Letter of Guarantee are, on the very face of the letter in dispute here, interlocking. Indeed, the first four paragraphs of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee reproduce word for word the text of the Letter of Guarantee (A.R., vol. IV, at pp. 114-15). In so doing, it recalls to the parties that its operation is dependent on the triggering of the Letter of Guarantee by a demand for payment by HMOD. While HMOD is technically a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee  in that it is neither issuer nor beneficiary  its conduct is a fact upon which the triggering of a demand for payment by Eurobank can be made. Indeed, as the text of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee makes plain, when HMOD calls for payment under the Greek letter, Eurobank has a corresponding right to demand payment under the interlocking Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nThat disputed letter makes the link between the two letters explicit:\nIN CONSIDERATION OF YOU [i.e. Eurobank] ISSUING AT OUR REQUEST THE ABOVEMENTIONED GUARANTEE, WE, NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA HEREBY IRREVOCABLY UNDERTAKE TO REIMBURSE YOU [i.e. Eurobank] ALL AMOUNT(S) CLAIMED BY THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE [i.e. HMOD] UP TO BUT NOT EXCEEDING USD 27,736,709.00 (TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINE. . .00/100 UNITED STATES DOLLARS) PLUS COSTS, STAMP DUTIES AND VALUE ADDED TAX AS APPROPRIATE, WITH SAME VALUE RATE AS OF THE DATE OF YOUR PAYMENT, AFTER RECEIPT OF YOUR [i.e. Eurobank] TESTED TELEX/AUTHENTICATED SWIFT INDICATING THAT YOU [i.e. Eurobank] HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR GUARANTEE. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118)\nOverall, the text of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee makes it plain that the conduct of HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee falls within the scope of the transaction even though HMOD is a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. In fact, the Letter of Guarantee is the underlying contract for the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, which means that fraud with respect to the Letter of Guarantee is directly relevant to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. If that fraud was perpetrated by the beneficiary of the Letter of Guarantee  who is a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee  the fraud exception could apply to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee if that letters beneficiary is not innocent of the fraudulent conduct (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 84). Demanding payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee in reaction to a demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee that is known to be fraudulent would therefore amount to fraud that is relevant to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. \nBefore this Court, Eurobank insists that, because Greek courts held that HMOD did not engage in fraud, it is not open to Quebec courts to say otherwise. The Court of Appeal of Athens and the Hellenic Supreme Court decided that HMOD was not bound by its commitment to refrain from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee or by Procedural Order No. 11. Counsel for Eurobank went so far as to insist that the debate [in this appeal] was rendered moot by the decision by the Athens Court of Appeal (transcript, at p. 2). While Eurobank initially conceded before the Quebec Court of Appeal that HMOD engaged in fraud, it now says that it is justified in walking back from that concession because that position is inconsistent with judgments of Greek courts. \nWith respect, Eurobank is wrong to say that the judgments of Greek courts have any decisive relevance in this case. \nWhile foreign judgments are not enforceable in and of themselves (Kuwait Airways Corp. v. Iraq, 2010 SCC 40, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 571, at para. 20), they may be recognized and declared enforceable under arts. 3155 et seq. C.C.Q. When a foreign judgment has not been recognized and enforced, it may nevertheless be received in Quebec as evidence. In such a case, and as Mainville J.A. correctly observed in the impugned judgment, the foreign judgment provides prima facie proof of its reported facts and of the good application of foreign law, but it is not binding on Quebec courts (see generally C. Piche, La preuve civile (6th ed. 2020), at p. 259; G. Goldstein and E. Groffier, Droit international prive, t. I, Theorie generale (1998), at No. 155).\nWhen a party applies for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment pursuant to arts. 3155 et seq. C.C.Q., the burden falls on the opposing party to show that an exception to the general rule that foreign judgments ought to be recognized and enforced in Quebec applies (Barer v. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 SCC 13, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 573, at para. 24).\nIn this case, no party has sought the recognition and enforcement of the Greek judgments in Quebec. This may have been a deliberate choice on Eurobanks part given the difficulty it might have faced in light of the public order exception in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q. and the likelihood that this exception would have been raised by opposing parties. The public order exception applies when the solution provided by the foreign judgment cannot be harmoniously incorporated into the legal order of the Quebec forum (R.S. v. P.R., 2019 SCC 49, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 643, at para. 52). As the majority judges in the Quebec Court of Appeal observed in this case, the Greek judgments, particularly those of Judge Kostis of the Athens One-Member First Instance Court and of the Court of Appeal of Athens, might have raised public order concerns because of their inconsistency with the relevant orders of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. Mainville J.A. wrote that the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens essentially stands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal even if it formally undertook to abide by the arbitration process and identified this as a public order concern (para. 69).\nMainville J.A. explained, relying on arts. 3155(5) and 3081 C.C.Q., that Quebec courts are not bound to enforce or recognize foreign judgments when the result of doing so is manifestly inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations. I take due note of Mainville J.A.s analysis of this point, which is amply supported by this Courts jurisprudence and relevant scholarship (R.S., at paras. 52-53; Beals v. Saldanha, 2003 SCC 72, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, at paras. 71-72; Goldstein and Groffier, at No. 166; S. Guillemard and V. A. Ly, Elements de droit international prive quebecois (2019), at pp. 64-66). Mindful that the public order exception is understood to be more limited under art. 3155 C.C.Q., I take care to recall that this matter need not be decided here because no application for recognition and enforcement was made.\nAbsent a successful application for recognition and enforcement, the Greek judgments are merely evidence that do not bind Quebec courts, and the weight given to them is an issue of fact to which deference is owed on appeal. While none of the parties expressly argued this point, pursuant to art. 2822 C.C.Q., in the law of evidence, a foreign judgment may be treated as a semi-authentic act that is presumptively proof of its contents that may be produced as evidence in Quebec (see Piche, at Nos. 341 and 345; Goldstein and Groffier, at No. 155). As Mainville J.A. correctly noted, when foreign judgments are received in evidence without being formally recognized in Quebec, they are prima facie proof of the reported facts, of the good application of the foreign law and of the foreign courts jurisdiction on the matter (para. 64). \nIn Canadian Forest Navigation Co. v. R., 2017 FCA 39, [2017] 4 C.T.C. 63, a case that Mainville J.A. relied upon, Boivin J.A. explained that factual findings contained within [foreign] judgments are facts that cannot be disregarded by a Court but rejected the idea that pursuant to article 2822 C.C.Q. these foreign orders are dispositive (paras. 15 and 19). The weight given to foreign orders as facts, as Boivin J.A. recalled, is a matter for the trier of fact to decide, with a full evidentiary record at his or her disposal (para. 20; see also Digiulian v. Succession de Digiulian, 2022 QCCA 531).\nThe trial judge and the majority judges at the Court of Appeal plainly saw this and concluded that Bombardier had met its burden. Both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal expressly considered the weight to be given to the decision of Judge Kostis as a matter of fact. Mainville J.A. considered the significance of the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens, which had been rendered after the trial judgment of Wery J. The trial judge expressly considered how much weight to give the decision of Judge Kostis and opted to give it none. Expressly referring to Judge Kostiss decision, Mainville J.A. confirmed that finding and, likewise, decided to give no weight to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens (para. 65). I emphasize that it is not the role of appellate courts to second-guess the weight to be assigned to the various items of evidence absent a palpable and overriding error (Housen, at para. 23). Eurobank has failed to show any basis to interfere with the decisions by the courts below to give no weight, as evidence, to the Greek judgments. \nMoreover, as Mainville J.A. observed, a decision to place little or no weight on an unenforceable foreign judgment can be justified if that decision does not give proper consideration to relevant Canadian judgments or if it raises other public order concerns (see paras. 65 and 67-69; see also Beals, at para. 29). While comity is a useful guiding principle (Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 SCC 78, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 205, at para. 17), it is important to recall that it is also a balancing exercise (Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc., 2006 SCC 52, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 612, at para. 27). In this case, a decisive factor was the conclusion of the foreign courts that a party can disregard an order of an arbitral tribunal to which it has agreed to be subject (see Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 176; C.A. reasons, at para. 69). In the circumstances, it was open to the courts below to give the Greek decisions no weight, as mere facts rather than as executory judgments, in measuring the conduct of HMOD and Eurobank for the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. \nFor the same reasons as the trial judge and the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal in respect of the foreign decisions they considered, I would give no evidentiary weight to the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court that has been adduced by Eurobank as additional evidence before this Court. I recall that Mainville J.A. properly observed that the decision of the Court of Appeal of Athens essentially stands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal even if it formally undertook to abide by the arbitration process (para. 69). The Hellenic Supreme Court ostensibly confirmed that same conclusion. In the certified English translation, quoting from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens with approval, it wrote that [a]s far as the issuing of interim orders by the International Court of Arbitration and the Superior Court of Quebec respectively are concerned, which prohibited payment of the guarantee letters on an interim basis, it should be noted that as interim decisions of the International Court of Arbitration and the foreign court they were not binding on the Greek State (Motion to adduce fresh evidence, at p. 67). \nThe judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court thus raises exactly the same public order concern as the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Athens which led to the findings, made respectively by the Quebec Superior Court and Court of Appeal, to give no weight to the decisions of the Greek courts. Even taking account of the new evidence, Eurobank has failed to show any error in the courts below warranting interference on appeal. Moreover, the judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court, which speaks to the conduct of HMOD under Greek law with respect to the Letter of Guarantee, sheds no light on whether HMODs conduct, as a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, was fraud by a third party by Canadian standards pursuant to Angelica-Whitewear. Nor does that judgment speak usefully to whether Eurobank knew of or participated in that fraud in a manner that is relevant to its demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The judgment of the Hellenic Supreme Court adduced in evidence, like the prior Greek decisions weighed by the courts below, has no probative value in respect to the issues now before this Court. \nAlthough these judgments might be enforceable in Greece, as I have emphasized, HMODs conduct under Greek law is not at issue. Instead, it is HMODs conduct under Quebec law with respect to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee that is engaged directly by Bombardiers petition for an injunction against the National Bank making payment in the Superior Court. Absent an enforceable foreign judgment on the matter, Quebec courts were required to draw their own conclusions, in applying Quebec law, regarding whether HMOD engaged in fraud in the transaction as a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. \nFor the reasons that follow, I am of the view that no reviewable error has been shown in the trial judges overall conclusion that HMOD engaged in fraud, as a third party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The appellant has also failed to show a basis for interfering with the trial judges view that HMODs fraud can be attributed to Eurobank as beneficiary. Eurobank knew of and acted upon HMODs fraud and thus is not innocent of that fraud. The fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nHMOD Engaged in Fraud as a Third Party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee\nIn this case, HMOD is alleged to have engaged in fraud in the transaction rather than fraud in the tendered documents. Le Dain J. emphasized that fraud in the underlying transaction of such a character as to make the demand for payment under the credit a fraudulent one may include any act of the beneficiary of a credit the effect of which would be to permit the beneficiary to obtain the benefit of the credit as a result of fraud (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 83; see also LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at pp. 409-10; M. Lemieux, Les decisions Bombardier Inc. c. Hermes Aero LLC et lautonomie des credits standby (2003), 63 R. du B. 427, at p. 428). \nIn the years since Angelica-Whitewear, Canadian courts have emphasized that, in the context of letters of credit, [f]raud is not simply a legitimate dispute or disagreement over the interpretation of a contract, however one-sided that dispute may appear (Cineplex Odeon Corp. v. 100 Bloor West General Partner Inc., [1993] O.J. No. 112 (Lexis), 1993 CarswellOnt 2358 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 31 (WL); see also Fiberex Technologies Inc. v. Bank of Montreal, 2015 ABQB 496, [2016] 4 W.W.R. 547, at para. 23; Standard Trust Co. (Liquidation) v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 2001 NFCA 27, 201 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 8, at para. 59). As a Hong Kong court similarly noted, it is well established that [d]ue to autonomy of the credit, operation of the fraud exception is strictly policed so [that] it . . . is not extended to disputes on the underlying contract (DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. New Harvest International Development Ltd., [2017] HKCFI 30, at para. 62 (HKLII)). Quebec courts have also recognized that a dispute concerning the underlying contract is not necessarily indicative of fraud (SNC-Lavalin Polska SP. ZOO v. BNP Paris Canada, 2017 QCCS 3694, at para. 40 (CanLII); Bombardier Inc. v. Hermes Aero, 2004 CanLII 7014 (Sup. Ct.), at para. 35; SNC-Lavalin Constructeurs international inc. v. Shariket Kahraba Skikda.spa, 2010 QCCS 3236, at para. 27 (CanLII); Banque Nationale du Canada v. CGU Cie dassurance du Canada, 2004 CanLII 49434 (Sup. Ct.), at para. 49).\nFraud in this context does not refer to fraud in the criminal sense and carries with it a different connotation. Generally, civil or commercial fraud is broader than its criminal counterpart (McGuinness, at 17.342). A key feature of fraud in this context is its effect on the demand for payment by the beneficiary. As authors LHeureux and Lacoursiere observed, [translation] the subject matter of the fraud may be either the documents or the underlying transactions (that is, the commercial contract) of such a character as to make the demand for payment under the letter of credit a fraudulent one (p. 410). If a beneficiary demands payment while knowing that they have no right to be paid under the underlying contract, that conduct may amount to fraud (McGuinness, at 17.338). Whether it does is an issue of mixed fact and law for which deference is owed on appeal. In this case, the essence of HMODs fraudulent conduct is that it demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee when it knew it had no right to do so.\nThe bar is nevertheless high. As author Marc Lemieux has explained, the fraud exception is limited to cases of obvious fraud [translation] to avoid unduly interfering with the commercial utility and efficacy of letters of credit (p. 433; see also LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at pp. 409-10). A mere absence of good faith may not be sufficient, even if that might lead to civil liability in other contexts. In this context, fraud goes further: it must import some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit (Cineplex, at para. 31, cited with approval by several courts in Quebec and the common law provinces, including in Royal Bank v. Gentra Canada Investments Inc. (2001), 15 B.L.R. (3d) 25 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 8; OMERS Realty, at para. 45; SNC-Lavalin Polska, at para. 40; Alessandra Yarns, l.l.c. v. Tongxiang Baoding Textile Co., 2015 QCCS 346, at para. 34 (CanLII)). As an Ontario court observed, a demand for payment is only fraudulent if the claim to the funds is not even colourable as being valid or has absolutely no basis in fact (Royal Bank v. Gentra Canada Investments Inc. (2000), 1 B.L.R. (3d) 170 (S.C.J.), at para. 56, affd (2001), 15 B.L.R. (3d) 25). \nI am mindful that it is a serious matter to describe the conduct of an arm of a foreign state  and one that is a member of the European Union and a significant actor in international commerce  as fraudulent. It is important to take care, when characterizing the conduct of a foreign state, not to impugn the integrity of a respected player in the international business community. But I insist that the term is used here in the specific context of letters of credit where, under Angelica-Whitewear, fraud includes a demand for payment by a beneficiary when it knew it did so without a right to payment. No further inference should be drawn from the use of the term here and, with due respect for the trial judge, I would not have used epithets such as legal bullying or legal blackmail here (paras. 175 and 182). For reasons of comity, Canadian courts should be cautious about criticizing the laws of a foreign state even though, as it is best to acknowledge, Canadian and international law sometimes requires them to do so (see generally Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya, 2020 SCC 5, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 166, at para. 50). \nThat said, I am of the view that the trial judges finding that HMOD engaged in fraud, which is one of mixed fact and law, is entitled to deference. Eurobank has failed to show that the judges overall conclusion on this point is the product of palpable and overriding errors. His determination that HMOD engaged in some measure of impropriety that could amount to fraud  which was acknowledged even by the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal  is amply supported by the evidence (see paras. 175-76). That said, I do not find it necessary to endorse all of his findings on this point.\nAs Mainville J.A. noted, the trial judge took account of evidence of HMODs conduct, including evidence that might militate against a finding of fraud. I agree with Mainville J.A. that the trial judge did not make a reviewable error, in particular, on the specific point of the timing of the demand for payment in light of the order of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal that enjoined HMOD from demanding payment. The evidence supports a finding that HMOD engaged in a fraudulent attempt to circumvent the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by any and all means, no matter how repugnant they may be (C.A. reasons, at para. 60).\nSpecifically, the evidence indicates that HMOD, a party to the arbitral proceedings, violated Procedural Order No. 11 of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, which enjoined it from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee. In violation of that order and its own undertaking, around one week before the final arbitral award was released, HMOD repeated its demand for payment. After the final award was issued and confirmed by the Court of Appeal of Paris, it became clear that HMOD had no right under the Offsets Contract to the money that it received. Still, HMOD has not returned the money it received from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee. In fact, HMOD has taken the position before this Court that it is not required to return the money because Bombardier has not sought repayment directly from it (A.F., at para. 94). This, on its own, supports a finding that HMOD engaged in fraud. \nIt is sufficient to observe, as did the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal, that HMODs demands for payment in contravention of Procedural Order No. 11 and its own undertaking, including a demand immediately before the final arbitral award was released, can support a finding that it engaged in fraud. For this reason, it is unnecessary to decide whether other aspects of HMODs conduct that the trial judge identified amount to fraud. \nI will not comment on the manner in which HMOD demanded payment through the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest. Although there is some expert evidence on Greek law in the record, this Court should not make original findings with respect to whether HMODs Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest was permitted or required under Greek law. Mindful that HMOD is a foreign actor, what it can be fairly criticized for, by Quebec courts in respect of a Quebec letter of credit, is demanding payment in a related letter of credit in contravention of an order of an arbitral tribunal and its own undertaking on the eve of the release of an arbitral award that would pronounce on its right to payment.\nI add that the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal agreed that HMOD engaged in fraud, specifically based on the fact that HMOD never had the intention to repay the funds the arbitral court determined that it owed (C.A. reasons, at para. 200). He went so far as to assert that [t]he conduct of HMOD in this matter was, in a word, deplorable (para. 164). That said, he would not have found that HMODs violation of Procedural Order No. 11 amounts to fraud because that order was not capable of being homologated, which means that HMODs violation of that order is a contractual breach, but not a legal one (para. 184). For two reasons, I disagree. \nFirst, it is inappropriate to interfere with the trial judges finding of mixed fact and law that HMOD engaged in fraud absent a palpable and overriding error. It is trite law that appellate courts must take special care not to make original findings of fact or mixed fact and law unless they can point, with the requisite precision, to an obvious error that impacts the result (see generally Housen). \nThe trial judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence first-hand, including the explanations of some of the key actors. The majority judges in the Court of Appeal were rightly careful not to impose their own interpretation of the evidence. Said respectfully, I am of the view that the dissenting judge did not follow that rule. In order to set aside the trial judgment, palpable and overriding errors would have to be shown in respect of each of the judges findings as to the sources of HMODs fraud. While I fix on the finding in respect of Procedural Order No. 11 as sufficient for dismissing the appeal, other examples present serious challenges to the appellant Eurobank. For example, Eurobank has not succeeded, in my eyes, in showing a reviewable error in the trial judges conclusion that HMODs withdrawal of its undertaking not to demand payment was fraudulent conduct. Again with the utmost respect, I am unconvinced by the explanation of the dissenting judge for interfering with the trial judges conclusion on this point. The characterization that [t]he undertaking did not have a specific duration (para. 177) strikes me as an inaccurate interpretation of the promise made by HMOD. In point of fact, HMOD undertook not to demand payment for as long as the [arbitration] procedure is ongoing (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 199). The undertaking did have a specific duration  until the moment the award was issued  even if that date was not certain. Be that as it may, the finding of fraud in respect of Procedural Order No. 11 suffices here.\nSecond, while it is true that a provisional order of an arbitral tribunal is not susceptible of being homologated, it does not follow that HMOD could not have engaged in fraud by violating Procedural Order No. 11. I agree that a breach of contract, without more, is not fraud. However, a breach of contract, like any other behaviour in a transaction that import[s] some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit (Cineplex, at para. 31), can amount to fraud. Whether a breach of contract amounts to fraud is a matter of mixed fact and law to which deference is owed on appeal. I add that we are concerned with whether HMODs conduct amounts to fraud by a third party under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, not with whether a provisional order of an arbitral tribunal can be enforced by a court. I agree with the majority judges on appeal that HMODs conduct was, as found by the trial judge, an instance of fraud upon which he could rely (C.A. reasons, at paras. 58-60). \nOverall, there is no basis to interfere with the trial judges conclusion that HMOD engaged in misconduct that is sufficient to trigger, as the fraud of a third party, the fraud exception in Canadian law. However, I emphasize again that I make no comment as to whether HMOD might have engaged in fraud under Greek law or whether its conduct could bring about any consequences with respect to the Letter of Guarantee before the Greek courts, and I recall that the relevant judgments of those courts have not been recognized as enforceable under Quebec law. For the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, given its very terms, it is sufficient to conclude that HMODs conduct amounts to fraud of a third party. The remaining issue to be decided is whether Eurobank, as beneficiary, is innocent of that fraud.\nHMODs Fraud Became Eurobanks Own\nAs Le Dain J. wrote, the fraud exception is confined to fraud by the beneficiary of a credit and should not extend to fraud by a third party of which the beneficiary is innocent (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 84). An Ontario court correctly observed that [i]t is implicit in the foregoing comment that the fraud exception in letter of credit cases might extend to fraud by a third party of which the beneficiary of the letter of credit cannot be said to be innocent (Royal Bank v. Darlington, 1995 CarswellOnt 2661 (WL), [1995] O.J. No. 1044 (Lexis) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 231; see also Global Steel Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal, 1999 ABCA 311, 244 A.R. 341, at para. 21). \nThe sense given to conduct of a beneficiary that is not innocent needs to be circumscribed so as not to upset the autonomous character of letters of credit, even where they are interlocking as is the case here. I am mindful that, while an innocent beneficiary is entitled to expect that the fraud of a third party will not be attributed to them because they are not asked to police the underlying transaction, the issuer and their client are equally entitled to expect that the fraud exception may apply if the beneficiary bears responsibility for that fraud as its own. Therefore, the issue is whether the fraud of the third party can fairly be considered as that of the beneficiary.\nA beneficiary ceases to be innocent when they have knowledge of the fraud of the third party and participate in that fraud. When there is both knowledge and participation, the third partys fraud  in this case HMOD  can fairly be attributed to the beneficiary  here, Eurobank, under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. To be clear, when the fraud of a third party is attributed to the beneficiary, that fraud becomes the beneficiarys own; this is not indirect or vicarious liability. Attributing the fraud of a third party to the beneficiary is merely an application of the fraud exception to the beneficiary of the relevant letter of credit. \nAs is always the case, clear knowledge of an obvious fraud prior to payment by the financial institution is required (see LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at p. 411; B. Crawford et al., The Law of Banking and Payment in Canada (loose-leaf), at  13:171). A beneficiary cannot be responsible, in the commercial or civil sense, for fraud of which it had no knowledge (Sarna, at pp. 5-56 and 5-57; see also R. P. Buckley, The 1993 Revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1995), 28 Geo. Wash. J. Intl L. & Econ. 265, at p. 308; E. A. Caprioli, Le credit documentaire: evolution et perspectives (1992), at No. 373). This makes good sense because, unfortunately, parties will at times participate in commercial fraud unwittingly. Author Lazar Sarna gives the example of a hidden fraudulent act such as the falsification of the true boarding date by a carrier without the knowledge of the beneficiary (pp. 5-56 and 5-57).\nHowever, simply knowing about the fraud of a third party is not sufficient. A beneficiary does not engage in fraud unless they participate in it. As LHeureux and Lacoursiere note, [translation] [i]t is . . . clear in Canadian and Quebec law that only fraud committed by the beneficiary is recognized, including that of a third party when the beneficiary participated in it (p. 411; see also Crawford et al., at  13:171; Credit Lyonnais Canada v. First Mercantile Investment Corp., 1996 CarswellOnt 4711 (WL), [1996] O.J. No. 4309 (Lexis) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 44). Participation can, as in this case, take the form of honouring a demand for payment in improper circumstances. It can also take the form of knowingly presenting fraudulent documents to the issuer. All that is required is some action by the beneficiary that involves them in the fraud of the third party. Where, for example, a beneficiary demands payment, for its own advantage, knowing of the third partys fraud, that is fraud on an independent measure of which the beneficiary is not innocent.\nSince both knowledge and participation are required, the scope of the fraud exception will be kept appropriately narrow. Beneficiaries can take comfort in knowing that the fraud of a third party will not be attributed to them unless they have actively taken on responsibility for that fraud. A well-intentioned beneficiary that unwittingly facilitates the fraud of a third party or chooses to not participate in the fraud of a third party need not worry that fraud will be attributed to them. Equally, a beneficiary who demands payment where it did not know of the fraud of the third party will remain innocent. Limiting the scope of the fraud exception in this way will protect the reliability of Canadian letters of credit. However, a beneficiary becomes a co-author of the fraud of a third party by knowingly participating in the misconduct and, as a result, will have that fraud attributed to them; in such a circumstance, the fraud exception may rightly apply so that the letter of credit cannot be used to facilitate a clear case of fraud. \nThe trial judge held that Eurobank knew that HMODs conduct constituted clear fraud (para. 196) because HMODs demand was made in contravention of orders of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and of the Superior Court (para. 197). Mainville J.A. agreed that Eurobank clearly did know of HMODs fraud (at para. 72), and pointing to the evidence relating to Procedural Order No. 11, he observed that [i]t is clear in this case that Eurobank had sufficient knowledge of the fraud prior to paying (para. 71). Hamilton J.A. acknowledged that Eurobank had notice of Procedural Order No. 11 (para. 212). Notwithstanding that knowledge, he concluded that it was not clear and obvious that [HMODs] request was fraudulent (para. 223). \nWith respect, the dissenting judge failed to identify a palpable and overriding error in the trial judges conclusion of mixed fact and law that Eurobank knew of and participated in HMODs fraud. The trial judge found that Eurobank did indeed voluntarily make the payment knowing that HMODs conduct constituted clear fraud (para. 196 (emphasis deleted)). He wrote that Eurobank paid HMOD in contravention of not one but two orders. One from the ICC Arbitral Tribunal and another from Justice Davis of the Quebec Superior Court (para. 197), which lends support to his conclusion that Eurobank knew of HMODs fraud. More significantly, there is evidence, including testimony from Eurobanks employees that made the decision to pay HMOD, to support a finding that Eurobank knew that HMOD demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee in contravention of Procedural Order No. 11 of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal. \nAt trial, Dimitri Konstantopoulos, General Director of Corporate Banking at Eurobank, agreed with a proposition put to him that Eurobank was aware that there [was] an ICC ruling against the Ministry of Defense saying do not request payment under the letter of guarantee (A.R., vol. VIII, at p. 50). Athanasios Danis, Director of the Legal Department of Eurobank at the time that payment was made to HMOD, testified that he was aware that Bombardier sought and obtained interim relief from the ICC Arbitral Tribunal that enjoined HMOD from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee. He also testified that he had concerns about the good faith of HMOD (p. 64). While a simple absence of good faith is not sufficient to trigger the fraud exception, the testimony from Mr. Konstantopoulos and Mr. Danis indicates that Eurobank knew of the conduct by HMOD that, by Canadian standards, amounts to fraud. In that light, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that Eurobank knew of HMODs fraud. \nThe dissenting judge agreed that Eurobank obviously knew that the demand [for payment under the Letter of Guarantee] was being made on the eve of the final arbitration award (C.A. reasons, at para. 217). However, he concluded that Eurobank did not know that HMOD expected to lose or intended to keep the funds regardless of the outcome (para. 217). At that point, Eurobank only had suspicions (para. 217). While I agree that mere suspicions should not be assimilated to knowledge of fraud (para. 218), I respectfully do not share the view that Eurobanks knowledge of HMODs fraud was a mere suspicion. Eurobanks employees who made the decision to pay HMOD testified at trial that they knew that HMOD was enjoined from demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee and that the issuance of the final arbitral award was imminent. Eurobank was not merely suspicious that HMOD demanded payment contrary to Procedural Order No. 11; it clearly knew that this was happening. At the very least, this suggests that Eurobank knew that the demand for payment was made in contravention of at least one order, which, in the circumstances, amounts to clear knowledge of the fraudulent conduct of HMOD. \nTherefore, I see no basis to interfere with the trial judges conclusion that Eurobank had clear knowledge of HMODs fraud. \nMoreover, I have been shown no palpable and overriding error in the trial judges conclusion that Eurobank may not have conceived the fraudulent plot, it may not have supplied the weapons, but it surely participated in pulling the trigger and that Eurobank knowingly enabled fraud to produce its fruits (para. 205). Eurobank actively participated in HMODs fraud by paying HMOD in improper circumstances. \nIn sum, because Eurobank knew of and participated in HMODs fraud, it became the co-author of that fraud and must, for the purposes of the fraud exception, bear responsibility for it. HMODs fraud became Eurobanks own. As the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, it is Eurobanks fraud that is actionable before Quebec courts. \nI add that, while the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was issued to ensure that Eurobank would be paid if it had to pay HMOD under the Letter of Guarantee, all Canadian letters of credit are issued subject to the fraud exception. Much like how Eurobank was entitled to rely on the near certainty of being paid in normal circumstances, Bombardier, as the client of the issuing bank, was entitled to rely on the availability of the fraud exception should it apply. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that the decision to have a letter of credit subject to Quebec law was designed to ensure that the fraud exception be made available for Bombardiers protection. The structure involving two letters of credit was devised, as Francois Ouellette, Vice-President of Legal Services and Contracts for the Business Aviation Division of Bombardier, explained at trial, to [translation] avoid a risk of fraud (A.R., vol. IX, at p. 9). He testified that, as part of the transaction that involved an international dimension and foreign law which brought uncertainties, Bombardier sought comfort in dealing with a Canadian bank and in knowing that the fraud exception in Canadian law could apply. Eurobank, as a party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, took whatever risks this entailed for it as beneficiary of that letter. At trial, Mr. Ouellette said:\n[translation] . . . we at Bombardier . . . we know the law that governs the issuance of and collection on letters of credit under Quebec law, which explains the requirement that a letter of credit issued by a foreign bank be subject to a counter-guarantee by a local bank.\n\n. . .\n\n. . . [T]he reason behind our requirement that there be a letter of counter-guarantee was precisely to avoid having to go and fight before the Greek courts. . . . [T]he letter of counter-guarantee also meant that we werent subject to a fraudulent collection because under Canadian rules . . . , the exception to collection on a letter of credit is fraud, so the letter of counter-guarantee from the National Bank protected us against any fraud attempt by the Greek government.\n\n(A.R., vol. IX, at pp. 66 and 99-100) \nAgainst this backdrop, the fraud exception applies to ensure that Bombardier and the National Bank will not have to assume the losses associated with fraud attributed to Eurobank as its own. \nFinally, Eurobanks alternative argument that it acted under duress is without foundation. No basis has been shown to interfere with the trial judges conclusion that Eurobanks conduct as beneficiary was voluntary. Eurobank knew of HMODs fraud and demanded payment from the National Bank, fully aware of the circumstances. I accept that Eurobank was clearly in a difficult position: it no doubt felt pressure from HMOD, and it no doubt saw the possible risk that, in Canada, it might lose its case on the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. But as the trial judge found, Eurobank did not resist pressure from HMOD after considering the risks that resistance would have entailed (para. 203). Between two options, Eurobank made a choice to demand payment from the National Bank rather than face the consequences of denying payment to HMOD. It did not act involuntarily in so doing. It chose to knowingly participate in fraud under competing pressures. On one hand, it could have refused to participate in HMODs fraud which would have prevented it from becoming a co-author of that fraud under Canadian law. On the other hand, it could have exposed itself to well-founded allegations of fraud under Canadian law in order to avoid what seemed to be more serious liability under Greek law. It chose the latter course of conduct. Eurobank, as a Greek bank, might well have made a reasonable business decision in these challenging circumstances, but for our purposes one only needs to observe is that its decision was voluntary and not imposed. Given that Eurobank acted voluntarily, it is not necessary to decide whether duress provides an excuse to the fraud exception more generally. I would note, however, that when pressed at the hearing, Eurobank was unable to point to any authority to support its claim that there is a duress exception to the fraud exception (transcript, at p. 21). \nConclusion on the Fraud Exception\nI conclude that the fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobanks demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Given that Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud by HMOD, that fraud can be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that there be fraud by the beneficiary is therefore met. Moreover, there is no question that Eurobanks fraud was brought to the attention of the National Bank, the issuer of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, the National Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of Appeal made no mistake in confirming that conclusion. \nImpact of the Nullity of the Offsets Contract on the Letter of Counter-Guarantee\nAlthough most of the trial judges analysis focused on the fraud exception, he wrote that [i]t is difficult to accept in law that the invalidity, ab initio, of the Offsets Contract . . . does not cause the invalidity of the instruments that were issued to guarantee the obligations flowing from said contract (para. 237). He added that [i]t is obvious that the Letter of Guarantee that was declared null and void ab initio by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award which has been homologated by this Court, the Counter-Guarantee must follow suit and that [the National Bank] should be ordered not to pay Eurobank (para. 240). On that basis, he held that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null. A majority of the Court of Appeal upheld this conclusion. \nRespectfully, I would note that the trial judge was mistaken to say that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal declared the Letter of Guarantee to be null because the Offsets Contract is null. In its final award, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal concluded that [t]he Offsets Contract is declared null and void ab initio, together with its Articles 20 related to Liquidated Damages and 21 related to the Letter of Guarantee (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 143). \nEurobank appealed the trial judges conclusion that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null to the Court of Appeal. The majority upheld this conclusion. Hamilton J.A. would have allowed the appeal because he found that the fraud exception did not apply. In proposing to dismiss the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank, he did not include a plain direction as to whether or on what basis he would find the Letter of Counter-Guarantee valid. \nBefore this Court, Bombardier argues that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is null because the Offsets Contract is null. Given the manner in which issues were joined at trial and on appeal, and the fact that this argument was presented as an alternative basis to deciding whether the National Bank should be enjoined from paying Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, I will refrain from deciding the matter. That said, Bombardiers argument touches on an unsettled point of law that is, in my view, worthy of three comments. \nFirst, if a beneficiary demands payment under a letter of credit when they know that the underlying contract is null, such conduct might trigger the fraud exception (see Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 83; McGuinness, at 17.338; OMERS Realty, at para. 45). This should not be confused with a dispute regarding the underlying contract (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 70). Demanding payment pursuant to a contested right is not fraud. By contrast, demanding payment knowing that one has no right to be paid under the underlying contract may well be fraudulent, depending on the circumstances.\nSecond, in Quebec law, there is a requirement, spoken to in art. 1371 C.C.Q., to the effect that it is of the essence of an obligation arising out of a juridical act that there be a cause which justifies its existence (6362222 Canada inc. v. Prelco inc., 2021 SCC 39, at para. 72). It may well be argued that the objective cause of the obligation to make payment by the issuing bank in a letter of credit may be detached from, and not inherently dependent on, the underlying contract.\nThird, there may be room to argue that, if an underlying contract is contrary to public order, so are the letters of credit arising from it (see A. Peters, Standby Letters of Credit in Financing Transactions (1994), 13 Nat. B.L. Rev. 40, at p. 53). But Crawford et al. note the paucity of judicial consideration of the question of whether manifest illegality of the underlying transaction would justify an issuer in refusing to pay on an otherwise conforming demand under a letter of credit ( 13:176). This suggests to me that the matter need not be decided here, and that it probably should not. Since this appeal can be disposed of by addressing an issue that was fully developed and argued  the fraud exception  I would leave these questions for another day. \nDisposition\nOn the basis that the fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to preclude the National Bank from paying Eurobank under that letter, I would dismiss the appeal with costs payable by the appellant Eurobank.\nThe reasons of Karakatsanis and Cote JJ. were delivered by\n\tCote J. \nOverview\nThis appeal requires our Court to consider the proper limits of the fraud exception to the autonomy of demand guarantees in complex international commercial transactions. This case is of great importance for the banking industry since clarity and predictability are required for the efficient operation of these financial instruments.\nThe appellant Eurobank Ergasias S.A. is a Greek bank whose predecessor issued a demand guarantee, governed by Greek law (Letter of Guarantee), in favour of the appellant Hellenic Ministry of National Defense (HMOD). The Letter of Guarantee was secured by a counter-guarantee, governed by Quebec law (Letter of Counter-Guarantee), issued by the respondent National Bank of Canada (National Bank) at the request of the respondent Bombardier inc.\nIt is alleged that HMOD acted fraudulently by demanding payment under the Letter of Guarantee, to Eurobanks knowledge, such that Eurobanks decision to pay was fraudulent for the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Invoking the fraud exception, Bombardier petitioned the Quebec courts to, among other things, enjoin National Bank from reimbursing Eurobank under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. An injunction was granted on a provisional basis. Bombardier sought a permanent injunction to the same effect, which was granted by the Quebec Superior Court and upheld, in a divided decision, by the Quebec Court of Appeal.\nI am of the view, like Hamilton J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal, that the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank and National Bank should be dismissed. To conclude otherwise in the present case requires dismissing as irrelevant the decisions of the Greek courts, which, in my view, cannot be ignored for the determination of this case. International comity is an essential guiding principle when giving a factual effect to or enforcing a foreign decision, and in this case, there is no public policy rationale for not giving weight to the judgments of the Greek courts.\nTaking the judgments of the Greek courts into account, I am of the opinion that the conclusion to be reached is that HMODs demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee was neither fraudulent nor tantamount to fraud. Even had I accepted that HMODs conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud, Eurobank would, in my view, be innocent of that fraud. There is an inherent contradiction in the requirement that a reviewing court place itself in the position of the issuing bank at the time of payment to assess whether it had sufficient knowledge of any fraud, but at the exact same time discard the decisions of the courts of competent jurisdiction that were binding on that bank and informing this knowledge. The trial judges conclusion that the fraud exception applies as per the requirements established in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Angelica-Whitewear Ltd., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 59, cannot stand. Unlike the majority in the Court of Appeal, I see reviewable errors in the trial judges findings and in his ultimate conclusion.\nFor the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.\nFactual and Legal Context\nThe Relevant Contractual Arrangements\nOn November 20, 1998, Bombardier and HMOD entered into a procurement contract (Procurement Contract) for the manufacturing of 10 CL-415 firefighting amphibious aircraft in addition to other services and equipment, for a total value of US$252,151,899. As a condition of the Procurement Contract, Bombardier was to enter into a second contract with HMOD (Offsets Contract). Pursuant to the Offsets Contract, Bombardier agreed to subcontract part of the manufacturing of the aircraft to Greek suppliers.\nIn entering into the Offsets Contract, Bombardier agreed to a liquidated damages clause, the amount of which was to be secured by a demand guarantee to be issued by a Greek bank (arts. 20 and 21, reproduced in A.R., vol. IV, at p. 95). The parties agreed that all disputes relating to the Offsets Contract would be submitted to an arbitral tribunal, seated in Paris, under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC Arbitral Tribunal) (art. 25). Like the Procurement Contract, the Offsets Contract was governed by Greek law (art. 28).\nOn February 5, 1999, the Letter of Guarantee was issued by Eurobanks predecessor, ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited, in favour of HMOD to secure the payment of any potential liquidated damages. The Letter of Guarantee was backed by the Letter of Counter-Guarantee previously issued by National Bank on January 29, 1999, at Bombardiers request. It is noteworthy that the Letter of Guarantee is governed by Greek law, while the Letter of Counter-Guarantee is governed by Quebec law.\nChronology of Events\nOn December 30, 2008, Bombardier filed a request for arbitration before the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, claiming that it was impossible to fulfill some of its obligations under the Offsets Contract. HMOD contested the claim. Neither Eurobank nor National Bank was a party to these proceedings.\nOn June 17, 2010, HMOD agreed to reduce the amount of the Letter of Guarantee by half given Bombardiers partial performance of the Offsets Contract (art. 21.3). The amount currently in issue is US$13,868,354.60.\nOn April 2, 2012, HMOD wrote to Bombardier advising it that since it had not satisfied its full obligations under the Offsets Contract, HMOD would be calling for payment on the Letter of Guarantee.\nOn April 10, 2012, Bombardier informed HMOD and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal that it would seek interim injunctive relief to prevent HMOD from calling on the Letter of Guarantee until the arbitral award was released.\nOn April 20, 2012, HMOD wrote to Bombardier and the ICC Arbitral Tribunal, expressly undertaking not to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee for as long as the [arbitration] procedure is ongoing and until the final award was rendered (Written Undertaking) (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 199). HMOD provided this Written Undertaking on the assumption that the proceedings would end shortly.\nOn August 15, 2012, Bombardier sought permission to amend its arbitration claim to raise an additional issue  whether the Offsets Contract was null and void for violating European Union competition law. Permission to amend was granted and Bombardier filed a supplemental brief on December 3, 2012. As a result of that amendment, a second hearing had to be scheduled. This caused significant delay in the arbitration proceedings.\nOn July 17, 2013, more than 15 months after the Written Undertaking had been provided, HMOD issued a formal decision approving the call on the Letter of Guarantee. It did so in accordance with its sovereign rights, following the applicable administrative procedures.\nOn July 29, 2013, Bombardier and HMOD were informed that the ICC Arbitral Tribunals award would be rendered by December 31, 2013.\nOn July 31, 2013, HMOD sent a letter to Bombardier informing it that it was in default of its obligations under the Offsets Contract and had to pay the penalty (US$13,868,354.60).\nOn August 5, 2013, HMOD made a first demand to Eurobank for the immediate payment of the outstanding amount under the Letter of Guarantee.\nOn August 13, 2013, at Bombardiers request, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal issued an interim order enjoining HMOD from demanding any payment under the Letter of Guarantee until its final award was issued (Interim Order). Again, neither Eurobank nor National Bank was a party to the proceedings in which the Interim Order was sought.\nThe same day, National Bank received an affidavit from Eurobank indicating that although it had received no new demand for payment from HMOD, it expected to receive one. Bombardier then wrote to HMOD seeking assurances that it would comply with the Interim Order.\nOn August 14, 2013, HMODs counsel replied that they were not in a position to provide a written undertaking that HMOD would comply with the Interim Order. Given this unwillingness to provide such an assurance, Bombardier proceeded with an application for an injunction before Prevost J. of the Quebec Superior Court.\nDuring the injunction hearing, Bombardier learned that on August 12, 2013, Eurobank had received a second demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee from HMOD. The demand complied with the terms of the Letter of Guarantee.\nOn August 16, 2013, Eurobank made a request to National Bank for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. It made clear that HMOD was insisting that Eurobank pay under the Letter of Guarantee.\nThe same day, Prevost J. of the Quebec Superior Court granted Bombardiers motion for a provisional injunction, which was to remain in force until August 26, 2013, and ordered HMOD to withdraw its demand for payment. Prevost J. also ordered Eurobank to refrain from paying any amount under the Letter of Guarantee and National Bank to refrain from paying any amount under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee (2013 QCCS 6892 (Prevost Injunction)). This injunction was issued on the basis of art. 3138 of the Civil Code of Quebec (C.C.Q.) and art. 940.4 of the former Code of Civil Procedure, CQLR, c. C-25 (C.C.P.) (essentially equivalent to art. 623 of the Code of Civil Procedure, CQLR, c. C-25.01). The latter provision allows Quebec courts to grant provisional measures before or during arbitration proceedings. To reiterate, only Bombardier and HMOD were parties to the arbitration proceedings.\nOn August 20, 2013, Eurobank applied to the Athens One-Member First Instance Court for an injunction compelling HMOD to withdraw its request for payment under the Letter of Guarantee and enjoining HMOD from making any new requests until the ICC Arbitral Tribunals final award was issued.\nOn August 22, 2013, Judge Pana of the Athens One-Member First Instance Court allowed the claimant (temporarily) not to liquidate the Guarantee letter without suffering any legal consequences/penalties until the hearing of the petition for the interim measures on the hearing date set out below (Pana Injunction; A.R., vol. VI, at p. 29).\nThe Prevost Injunction, which was to remain in force for only 10 days, expired on August 26, 2013. Bombardier did not seek its renewal until four months later.\nOn November 22, 2013, Eurobanks petition for an injunction was heard on the merits by Judge Kostis of the Athens One-Member First Instance Court. The Pana Injunction was extended until Judge Kostiss final decision was rendered.\nOn December 5, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed Bombardier and HMOD that it had submitted its final award to the ICC Court for approval.\nOn December 16, 2013, Judge Kostis rendered his decision and dismissed Eurobanks petition for an injunction (Kostis Decision). There was no appeal possible from the Kostis Decision.\nOn December 18, 2013, acting on the basis of the Kostis Decision, HMOD presented Eurobank with its third and final demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee.\nOn December 19, 2013, Eurobank informed National Bank that its application for injunctive relief had been dismissed by Judge Kostis. It further explained that the Pana Injunction was therefore no longer in effect and that, given that there was no operative injunction, it had to issue payment to HMOD. Consequently, Eurobank demanded payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nThe same day, Bombardier filed an application for provisional, interlocutory and permanent injunctions.\nOn December 20, 2013, Davis J. renewed the Prevost Injunction for a period of 10 days (Davis Injunction). The Davis Injunction was also issued on the basis of art. 3138 C.C.Q. and art. 940.4 of the former C.C.P.\nOn December 23, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunal informed the parties that its final award had been approved and that it would be communicated to the parties on December 31, 2013.\nThe same day, Eurobank contacted HMOD and asked it to reconsider its demand for payment in light of the Davis Injunction. In response, HMOD served Eurobank with a demand letter ordering it to pay in accordance with the Letter of Guarantee without any further delay, failing which HMOD would take not only civil but also criminal legal measures against Eurobank (Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest) (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 151 (emphasis deleted)).\nOn December 24, 2013, Eurobank paid HMOD US$13,868,354.60 pursuant to the Letter of Guarantee.\nOn December 27, 2013, Eurobank reiterated its demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nOn December 31, 2013, the ICC Arbitral Tribunals final award was released (Arbitral Award). It ruled that the Offsets Contract is declared null and void ab initio, together with its Articles 20 related to Liquidated Damages and 21 related to the Letter of Guarantee (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 143).\nOn January 8, 2014, Schrager J. (as he then was) issued a safeguard order which enjoined National Bank from paying under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee until the matter was finally determined by a Quebec court.\nOn April 14, 2015, the Arbitral Award was affirmed in all respects by the Paris Court of Appeal.\nOn December 24, 2018, Eurobank instituted proceedings before the Athens One-Member First Instance Court against HMOD for unjust enrichment to recover the amount it paid under the Letter of Guarantee.\nOn November 29, 2019, the Athens One-Member First Instance Court rendered its decision, finding in favour of Eurobank and ordering HMOD to reimburse the funds.\nOn December 8, 2020, that decision was overturned by the Athens Court of Appeal. It found that HMOD was not bound by (1) the Written Undertaking or (2) the Interim Order. Eurobank further appealed that decision to the Hellenic Supreme Court.\nOn January 9, 2024, the Hellenic Supreme Court released its decision, confirming the conclusions of the Athens Court of Appeal in full. The decision of the Hellenic Supreme Court was released after the hearing before this Court, while the appeal was under reserve. It is final and cannot be appealed. Eurobank successfully filed a motion for leave to adduce that decision as further evidence before this Court. Given that the decision bears on a decisive or potentially decisive issue, the motion was rightfully granted (Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775).\nProcedural History\nQuebec Superior Court, 2018 QCCS 2127 (Wery J.)\nBombardier sought an injunction before the Quebec Superior Court to enjoin National Bank from paying any amount under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee; it also sought the homologation of the Arbitral Award.\nWith respect to Bombardiers request for an injunction, Wery J. recognized the important principle of autonomy of letters of credit and that it is subject to the fraud exception. He held that HMODs conduct amounted to fraud for the following reasons: HMOD had threatened Eurobank with severe consequences if it failed to comply with its demand for payment, the timing of the demand was only days before the Arbitral Award was released, and the demand was made in defiance of both the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction.\nEurobank argued that, notwithstanding HMODs misconduct, it did not act fraudulently because it did everything it could to avoid HMODs demand and paid only when HMOD threatened it with severe legal repercussions. In rejecting this argument, Wery J. acknowledged that Eurobank had a difficult choice to make, but, in his view, Eurobanks decision to pay was wrongful given HMODs fraud. Therefore, National Bank was enjoined from paying any amount under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nWery J. homologated the Arbitral Award and ordered HMOD to comply with it. Given that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal had found that the Offsets Contract was null and void ab initio, it followed, according to Wery J., that the instruments issued to guarantee its performance were also null and void.\nQuebec Court of Appeal, 2022 QCCA 802\nMainville J.A., Baudouin J.A. Concurring\nWriting for the majority, Mainville J.A. allowed the appeal only in part so as to strike from Wery J.s decision the order compelling HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award. He held that the Quebec Superior Court had no jurisdiction to order HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award, as it is neither domiciled nor resident in Quebec. He concluded that otherwise Wery J. made no reviewable errors, including with respect to his finding that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was not enforceable in the circumstances of the case.\nMainville J.A. held that HMODs conduct amounted to fraud. He rejected HMODs submission that it could not have acted fraudulently given that it complied with the judgments of the Greek courts and with Greek law. He found that public policy considerations compelled him to disregard the Kostis Decision and the judgment of the Athens Court of Appeal. Thus, Wery J. was correct in giving no weight to the Kostis Decision. As a result, Mainville J.A. determined that Eurobank had sufficient knowledge of HMODs fraud prior to paying.\nHamilton J.A., Dissenting\nHamilton J.A. dissented. He would have allowed the appeal and set aside in part Wery J.s judgment. He would have dismissed the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank and National Bank.\nHamilton J.A. determined that Wery J. put too heavy a burden on Eurobank. While the record hinted at the possibility of HMODs conduct being fraudulent, it did not necessarily follow that Eurobank knew of or participated in that fraud such that it could be attributed as its own.\nThe language of the Letter of Guarantee clearly established that (1) HMOD was not required to obtain a judgment confirming that it was owed money before it could call the Letter of Guarantee, and (2) Eurobank could not refuse to pay even if Bombardier had taken any legal action before any court of law in any country.\nWhile an injunction could be sought to prevent a demand under the Letter of Guarantee, it had to be issued by the right court and for the right reasons. Bombardier did not attempt to obtain an injunction from the Greek courts, which were the courts of competent jurisdiction. The fact was that Judge Kostis refused to issue the injunction sought by Eurobank. No appeal of this decision was possible. In these circumstances, Hamilton J.A. concluded that it was difficult to criticize Eurobank for not having complied with the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction.\nEurobank knew that HMODs fraudulent demand was being made on the eve of the final arbitral award, but it did not know that HMOD expected to lose and that it intended to keep the funds regardless of the outcome. At that stage, Eurobank only had suspicions; Eurobank was diligent, took steps to investigate, and sought an injunction, which was refused. It was not clear or obvious, at that moment, that there was fraud.\nHamilton J.A. noted that the transaction was supposed to be risk-free for Eurobank and that it should not bear the risk of HMODs fraudulent conduct. Bombardier knew, or should have known, that there were risks involved in dealing with a branch of the Greek government, and it assumed those risks in light of the profit that it hoped to gain under the Procurement Contract.\nIssues\nEurobank raises the following three issues in its factum:\nWhat are the proper limits to the fraud exception to the autonomous nature of demand guarantees?\nCould the Quebec courts rule that Eurobanks conduct amounted to bad faith when it abided by the judgments rendered by the Greek courts?\nHow is risk to be apportioned between the parties to a complex commercial transaction scheme utilizing demand guarantees?\nAnalysis\nAt the outset of my analysis, I believe that a clarification is in order. Although the parties and the courts below refer to the instruments in dispute as letters of credit, they are best referred to as demand guarantees.\nLetters of credit and demand guarantees are widely used in international commercial transactions. These financial instruments are issued by banks to secure the parties performance of their contractual obligations. While letters of credit and demand guarantees are similar in nature and are governed by many of the same principles, they each have a distinct purpose. Letters of credit are designed to secure the fulfillment of the transaction; parties are expected to draw on them as the primary method of payment. Demand guarantees, like standby letters of credit, are contingent in nature. They will be called on only when a contractual obligation is not performed or is partly performed (R. Goode, Abstract Payment Undertakings in International Transactions (1996), 22 Brook. J. Intl L. 1, at pp. 3-4).\nThe Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee are best referred to as demand guarantees in the circumstances. This is so for two reasons. First, the purpose of these instruments is to secure payment under the Offsets Contracts liquidated damages clause, so they are contingent in nature. They would be called upon only if Bombardier failed to fulfill its offsets obligations. Second, the Letter of Guarantee and the Letter of Counter-Guarantee are expressly stated to be subject to the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (1992): OUR COUNTER-GUARANTEE . . . IS SUBJECT TO THE UNIFORM RULES FOR DEMAND GUARANTEES (ICC PUBLICATION 458) (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118).\nDemand Guarantees Are Autonomous\nDemand guarantees are contracts established at the request of a principal whereby the guarantor, usually a bank, irrevocably promises to pay the beneficiary on demand, irrespective of any ongoing dispute between the principal and the beneficiary. Like letters of credit, demand guarantees are autonomous. In Angelica-Whitewear, the leading case in Canada on letters of credit, Le Dain J. summarized the rationale behind the principle of autonomy as follows:\nThe fundamental principle governing documentary letters of credit and the characteristic which gives them their international commercial utility and efficacy is that the obligation of the issuing bank to honour a draft on a credit when it is accompanied by documents which appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit is independent of the performance of the underlying contract for which the credit was issued. Disputes between the parties to the underlying contract concerning its performance cannot as a general rule justify a refusal by an issuing bank to honour a draft which is accompanied by apparently conforming documents. [Emphasis added; p. 70.]\nThis rationale is equally applicable to demand guarantees. Le Dain J. noted in Angelica-Whitewear that the principle of autonomy is reflected in the general provision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1962). It is also reflected in the international rules that govern demand guarantees, that is, the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (1992), as well as their 2011 revision. Articles 2b) and 2c) of the 1992 uniform rules expressly enshrine the principle of autonomy:\nb) Guarantees by their nature are separate transactions from the contract(s) or tender conditions on which they may be based, and Guarantors are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract(s), or tender conditions, despite the inclusion of a reference to them in the Guarantee. The duty of a Guarantor under a Guarantee is to pay the sum or sums therein stated on the presentation of a written demand for payment and other documents specified in the Guarantee which appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee.\n\nc) . . . Counter-Guarantees are by their nature separate transactions from the Guarantees to which they relate and from any underlying contract(s) or tender conditions, and Instructing Parties are in no way concerned with or bound by such Guarantees, contract(s) or tender conditions, despite the inclusion of a reference to them in the Counter-Guarantee.\nWhile the terms and conditions for payment of a demand guarantee reflect the underlying contract, the guarantor undertakes to pay regardless of external facts or events. In this sense, the demand guarantee is independent from the underlying contract (N. LHeureux and M. Lacoursiere, Droit bancaire (5th ed. 2017), at pp. 428-29). Indeed, when parties to a commercial transaction agree to use demand guarantees to secure the performance of their obligations, they express their intention to be bound by a pay now, argue later structure (J. F. Dolan, Tethering the Fraud Inquiry in Letter of Credit Law (2006), 21 B.F.L.R. 479, at p. 480 (emphasis added)).\nThe guarantors obligation to pay is triggered solely on the terms and conditions specified by the principal. These requirements may also be supplemented by the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees if they are expressly incorporated. Once the terms and conditions are set, [translation] the only control that [the bank, and not the principal,] may exercise is over the regularity of the documents tendered by the beneficiary (C. Gilbert, Similarites et distinctions entre la fraude du beneficiaire dun credit documentaire et celle du beneficiaire dune garantie de bonne execution (1987), 17 R.D.U.S. 585, at p. 590). The guarantors role in ensuring, with reasonable care (Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (1992), art. 9), that the tendered documents strictly comply with the terms and conditions of the demand guarantee is [translation] strictly financial (Gilbert, at p. 590). In this regard, Le Dain J. wrote that [t]he fundamental rule is that the documents must appear on their face, upon reasonably careful examination, to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 94 (emphasis in original)).\nThe banks role as a guarantor is thus simple. The bank must pay when presented with a compliant demand. It cannot investigate the circumstances of the underlying contract to determine whether the obligation secured by the demand guarantee was performed. The bank does not have the specialized skill and experience to be a referee on matters that divide the parties to the secured contract (R. F. Bertrams, Bank Guarantees in International Trade (4th ed. rev. 2013), at p. 82). The bank should not and is not expected to enter into controversies between the parties to the underlying contract (Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., 31 N.Y.S.2d 631 (Sup. Ct. 1941), at p. 633).\nThe Fraud Exception to the Principle of Autonomy\nThe guarantors obligation to pay when presented with a compliant demand is subject to one exception  fraud. Pursuant to Angelica-Whitewear, the principal has two options to prevent payment under a demand guarantee. First, it can seek an interlocutory injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the bank from honouring the demand by establishing a strong prima facie case of fraud. Otherwise, the principal must present sufficient evidence of fraud to the guarantor before payment is made. The guarantor should refuse payment only in the rare cases where it has clear or obvious knowledge of the fraud (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 84).\nThe two rationales behind the fraud exception are to ensure that courts do not endorse fraud and to maintain the commercial utility and efficacy of demand guarantees (R. P. Buckley and X. Gao, The Development of the Fraud Rule in Letter of Credit Law: The Journey So Far and the Road Ahead (2002), 23 U. Pa. J. Intl. Econ. L. 663, at pp. 664-67). The exception must be kept narrow. As Le Dain J. stressed in the context of letters of credit, [t]he potential scope of the fraud exception must not be a means of creating serious uncertainty and lack of confidence in the operation of letter of credit transactions; at the same time the application of the principle of autonomy must not serve to encourage or facilitate fraud in such transactions (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 72). The same can be said for demand guarantees. Parties should not resort to the courts to enjoin banks from paying under a demand guarantee where no strong prima facie case of fraud exists or where clear or obvious evidence of fraud cannot be established.\nFraud Is a High Bar\nCourts can look to either the tendered documents or the underlying contract to detect fraud (Angelica-Whitewear, at p. 83). However, an allegation of fraud is not an invitation for courts to allow sophisticated commercial parties to refashion their agreement to an argue now, pay later structure when the bar is not met (Dolan, at p. 480 (emphasis added)). Fraud is a high bar, and the exception will not apply where the principal can only prove conduct amounting to something less than fraud (Standard Trust Co. (Liquidation) v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 2001 NFCA 27, 201 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 8, at paras. 70-72; see also Northern American Trust Co. v. Hospitality Equity Corp., [1995] A.J. No. 1306 (Lexis), 1995 CarswellAlta 1171 (WL) (Q.B.), at para. 31; Johannesen (Re), 2002 ABQB 756, 218 D.L.R. (4th) 148, at para. 47).\nFraud in this context lacks a precise definition, and Le Dain J. did not provide one in Angelica-Whitewear. On a general level, fraud involves some aspect of [translation] public order (J. Stoufflet, Fraud in Documentary Credit, Letter of Credit and Demand Guaranty (2001), 106 Dick. L. Rev. 21, at p. 23). I agree with the intervener, the Canadian Bankers Association, that bad faith alone is not enough to establish fraud (I.F., at para. 22). It has to be something more, and it has to be tailored to the specific context of demand guarantees (Bertrams, at p. 373). Cases in which the fraud exception is applied often rely on the definition set out by Blair J. (as he then was) in Cineplex Odeon Corp. v. 100 Bloor West General Partner Inc., [1993] O.J. No. 112 (Lexis), 1993 CarswellOnt 2358 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at paras. 31-32 (WL):\nFraud is a straightforward five-letter word, meaning just what it says: fraud. Fraud is not simply a legitimate dispute or disagreement over the interpretation of a contract, however one-sided that dispute may appear. While the notion of fraud may elude precise definition, it is a concept well-known to the law, and it must, in my view, import some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit. In Washburn v. Wright (1913), 31 O.L.R. 138 (App. Div.), Mr. Justice Riddell said, at p. 147.\n\nBut, suppose the defendant was wrong in this or in any other respect, there is absolutely no evidence of fraud. Fraud is not mistake, error in interpreting a contract; fraud is something dishonest and morally wrong, and much mischief is . . . done, as well as much unnecessary pain inflicted, by its use where illegality and illegal are the really appropriate expressions: Ex p. Watson (1888), 21 Q.B.D. 301, per Wills, J., at p. 309.\n\nCases where the demand on the letter of credit can be said to be clearly untrue or false, or utterly without justification, or where it is apparent there is no right to payment, all fall within the foregoing principles and must be read in the context of those fraud principles: see C.D.N. Research & Development Ltd. v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1980), 18 C.P.C. 62 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 65; Henderson v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce et al. (1982), 40 B.C.L.R. 318 (B.C.S.C.), at p. 320; Edward Owen Engineering Ltd. v. Barclays Bank International Ltd.[, [1978] 1 Q.B. 159 (C.A.)], at p. 169. [Underlining added.]\nAs Blair J. noted, there needs to be some aspect of impropriety, dishonesty or deceit; the case must be one where the demand on the guarantee can be said to be clearly untrue or false or utterly without justification or where it is apparent there is no right to payment.\nIn this regard, I agree that [i]f a beneficiary demands payment while knowing that they have no right to be paid under the underlying contract, that conduct may amount to fraud (Justice Kasirers reasons, at para. 114, citing K. McGuinness, The Law of Guarantee (3rd ed. 2013), at 17.338). However, an understanding of the factual context is essential. What may at one time constitute a valid demand may at a later time be deemed invalid. This does not mean that the beneficiary had no right to make its demand for payment at the time of making it. Again, a demand guarantee by its very nature is independent from any underlying dispute. A demand for payment will be fraudulent only if it is apparent to the beneficiary that there was no right to payment when it was presented, for instance because the underlying contract had already been found to be void (see, e.g., OMERS Realty Corp. v. 7636156 Canada Inc. (Trustee in Bankruptcy of), 2020 ONCA 681, 153 O.R. (3d) 271, at para. 45). In the absence of such knowledge, a simple demand for payment under the demand guarantee is neither fraudulent nor tantamount to fraud.\nClear or Obvious Knowledge of Fraud\nA guarantor is bound to pay under a demand guarantee unless it is specifically enjoined from doing so by a court of competent jurisdiction or unless clear or obvious evidence of the beneficiarys fraud has been brought to its attention (Angelica-Whitewear, at pp. 84-85). To define clear or obvious knowledge, it is not useful to compare it with the absence of knowledge. It goes without saying that no knowledge is not clear or obvious knowledge. Some knowledge may exist without amounting to clear or obvious knowledge. For example, suspicious circumstances are of no legal consequence. The bank must pay when the requirements for payment are otherwise met, regardless of any suspicion (Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1988), 4 O.R. (3d) 100 (H.C.J.), at pp. 119-20).\nClear or obvious knowledge is also a high standard. The test is not whether a court will or may eventually determine that there was fraud, but rather when the [guarantor] looked at the situation, was it clear and obvious to [the guarantor] acting reasonably that there had been a fraud (Bank of Montreal v. Mitchell (1997), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 697 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at p. 716 (emphasis added), affd on appeal (1997), 151 D.L.R. (4th) 574 (Ont. C.A.)). What is clear or obvious fraud in a legal sense is not necessarily clear or obvious in a commercial sense (M. S. Kurkela, Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees Under International Trade Law (2nd ed. 2008), at p. 179). That is why, when a court is asked to review the legality of a banks decision to honour its obligation to pay pursuant to a demand guarantee, it must place itself in the exact same situation that the bank was in at that time, without resorting to ex post facto reasoning (Angelica-Whitewear, at pp. 100-102).\nThe standard must be high for three reasons. First, as the Alberta Court of Appeal recently stated in Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd v. Coastal Gaslink Pipeline Ltd, 2024 ABCA 74, at para. 7 (CanLII):\nThe stricter standard ensures courts do not too readily interfere with the operation of letters of credit and undermine their utility and efficacy. The characteristic that gives letters of credit international commercial utility and efficacy is that they operate independently of disputes about performance of the underlying contract. They are intended to provide beneficiaries a ready means of obtaining prompt payment. Where a beneficiary presents an issuing bank a draft accompanied by documents that appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit, the bank is generally obliged to honour the draft: Angelica-Whitewear at 70-73. This autonomy permits both assurance and immediacy of payment: Lazar Sarna, Letters of Credit: The Law and Current Practice, 3rd ed (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, Release 2024-1) at 5:1 (WL Can).\nSecond, the standard must be high to ensure that the parties to the underlying transaction, who had the opportunity to assess the risks of the transaction and to negotiate the law applicable to it, do not transfer those risks to the institution securing the transaction. By agreeing to provide a demand guarantee, the principal (here Bombardier) agrees to assume the risk of payment being made notwithstanding that [it] can subsequently establish in litigation or arbitration that the dispute is to be resolved in [its] favour (Veolia Water Technologies, Inc. v. K+S Potash Canada General Partnership, 2019 SKCA 25, 440 D.L.R. (4th) 129, at para. 43, citing Ouais Group Engineering & Contracting Ltd. v. Saipem SPA, [2013] EWHC 990 (Q.B.), at para. 45). Transferring the risk to the issuing bank would upset its role in this type of transaction. A banks only obligation is, and should remain, to strictly abide by the instructions incorporated in the demand guarantee. After all, banks stand to earn only marginal remuneration as guarantors. Their relatively modest remuneration is based on the assumption that the banks task is confined to duties which can be performed quickly, easily and almost mechanically (Bertrams, at p. 82).\nThird, the standard must be high because when fraud is alleged regarding a demand for payment under a demand guarantee, banks are faced with a dilemma. Making a wrong assessment on whether to honour the demand for payment exposes the bank to a lawsuit by the beneficiary. However, by paying out, the bank risks failing to obtain reimbursement from the principal (P. Ellinger and D. Neo, The Law and Practice of Documentary Letters of Credit (2010), at p. 149). That is why the fraud contemplated by the clear or obvious standard is one [translation] that is blatantly apparent (J.-P. Mattout, Droit bancaire international (4th ed. 2009, at p. 258). Any doubt must benefit the beneficiary: [translation] Fraud must not be open to interpretation; otherwise doubt will necessarily favour the beneficiary (ibid., at p. 259). As Waller J. observed in Turkiye Is Bankasi AS v. Bank of China, [1996] 2 Lloyds Rep. 611 (Q.B.D.), at p. 617:\nIt is simply not for a bank to make enquiries about the allegations that are being made one side against the other. If one side wishes to establish that a demand is fraudulent it must put the irrefutable evidence in front of the bank. It must not simply make allegations and expect the bank to check whether those allegations are founded or not. [Emphasis added.]\nIt goes without saying that where allegations and counter-allegations are made regarding fraud, it is not for the bank to make a determination or take sides; otherwise it would find itself entangled in an insoluble conflict of interests (Bertrams, at p. 81). This task is best reserved for the courts of competent jurisdiction.\nThird-Party Fraud in the Context of Counter-Guarantees\nIn Angelica-Whitewear, Le Dain J. wrote that fraud committed by a third party should not prevent an innocent beneficiary from demanding payment on a letter of credit (at p. 84). This statement must be adapted to the present context, which involves a letter of guarantee backed by a counter-guarantee. Indeed, fraud committed by the beneficiary of a letter of guarantee is always third-party fraud for the purposes of the counter-guarantee. I agree that where the guarantor has clear or obvious knowledge of the beneficiarys fraud under the letter of guarantee but decides to pay nonetheless, that fraud can be attributed to the guarantor.\nWhat triggers the demand for payment under a counter-guarantee is payment under the guarantee. To determine whether a beneficiarys demand for payment under a counter-guarantee was fraudulent, a court must look past the clear line of separation between the guarantee and the counter-guarantee. This inquiry must not be transformed, however, into a dispute over the underlying contract (Bombardier Inc. v. Hermes Aero, 2004 CanLII 7014 (Que. Sup. Ct.), at paras. 35 and 40; Banque Nationale du Canada v. CGU Cie dassurance du Canada, 2004 CanLII 49434 (Que. Sup. Ct.), at para. 49; SNC-Lavalin Constructeurs international inc. v. Shariket Kahraba Skikda.spa, 2010 QCCS 3236, at para. 27 (CanLII); SNC-Lavalin Polska SP. ZOO v. BNP Paris Canada, 2017 QCCS 3694, at paras. 40-46 (CanLII)).\nApplication\nThe issues in the present case can be summarized as follows: Does Eurobanks conduct prevent it from asking for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee? My analysis first focuses on Eurobanks main argument, which is that in order to answer this question, the Court has to determine, for the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, whether Eurobank should have made payment under the Letter of Guarantee. Second, I discuss Eurobanks alternative argument, which is that this Court should consider only whether the demand for payment complies with the relevant terms of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\nThe Impact of the Judgments of the Greek Courts for the Purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee\nBefore reviewing the circumstances of HMODs demand for payment and Eurobanks decision to honour it, I must mark an important departure from the reasoning of the courts below. In my view, and I say this with respect, the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by not giving any  not even a little  weight to the judgments of the Greek courts. They simply ignored them.\nAt the outset, I acknowledge that the Greek judgments were not formally recognized under art. 3155 C.C.Q. and are therefore not enforceable in Quebec. However, this is irrelevant since the Letter of Guarantee was governed by Greek law and the parties to the Letter of Guarantee were not domiciled in Quebec. There would have been no reason to seek the recognition and enforcement of the Greek judgments because there was simply nothing in these decisions to be enforced in Quebec. Quebec courts have no prima facie jurisdiction over the merits of any dispute arising from the Letter of Guarantee.\nWhile the Greek judgments are not binding on Quebec courts, in this context, the principle of comity must guide any determination regarding the weight to be given to them (Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 SCC 78, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 205, at para. 17). It is important to bear in mind that when foreign judgments are received in evidence without being formally recognized in Quebec, they still make prima facie proof of the reported facts, of the proper application of the foreign law and of the foreign courts jurisdiction over the matter under art. 2822 C.C.Q. Foreign decisions cannot simply be ignored by Quebec courts (Canadian Forest Navigation Co. v. R., 2017 FCA 39, [2017] 4 C.T.C. 63, at para. 16, quoting H. Kelada, Reconnaissance et execution des jugements etrangers (2013), at p. 37). In the absence of any dispute as to the authenticity of a foreign decision or as to the foreign courts jurisdiction to render it, Quebec courts must recognize the [translation] factual effect of that decision (G. Goldstein and E. Groffier, Droit international prive, t. I, Theorie generale (1998), at p. 372; C. Emanuelli, Droit international prive quebecois (3rd ed. 2001), at No. 327; G. Goldstein and J. A. Talpis, Leffet au Quebec des jugements etrangers en matiere de droits patrimoniaux (1991), at pp. 14-16 and 53-57; J.-G. Castel, Kuwait Airways Corp. c. Irak, 2010 CSC 40 (2011), 56 McGill L.J. 751, at p. 758). A foreign decision introduced as evidence is a factual constraint on the Quebec courts and should be treated as such; [translation] [i]t is not about extending the effects that the foreign decision has in a foreign country to Quebec, but about taking the foreign decision into consideration as a fact (Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 372). It is of fundamental importance to give effect to foreign decisions introduced as evidence because they constitute [translation] a certain and precise basis of expectations for the parties upon which they are binding (P. Mayer, V. Heuze and B. Remy, Droit international prive (12th ed. 2019), at No. 372).\nOf course, a trial judge is free to determine the appropriate weight to be given to a foreign decision in light of all of the evidence (see, e.g., Digiulian v. Succession de Digiulian, 2022 QCCA 531). However, a trial judge cannot second-guess the reported facts or the proper application of the foreign law by the foreign court (Kelada, at pp. 37-38, quoting B. Audit and L. DAvout, Droit international prive (6th ed. 2010), at No. 459; see also Emanuelli, at No. 326; Goldstein and Groffier, at pp. 373-74, quoting Bauron v. Davis (1897), 6 B.R. 547, at p. 553). Yet in dismissing the Kostis Decision, the trial judge wrote:\nIt is puzzling that Justice Kostis had come to the conclusion that it [could] not be speculated that third Respondent [Eurobank] made a commitment for the non-forfeiture of the Letter of Guarantee, while being duly represented with respect to such commitment. As we have seen, the proof of HMODs commitment not to draw on the Letter of Guarantee was out there in writing.\n\nIts even more confusing that Justice Kostis could have come to that conclusion in his six-page ruling, when one considers that his colleague Justice Pana had arrived at a completely different conclusion in [her] detailed and well-crafted 30-page ruling as regards HMODs conduct . . . .\n\nThe merits did not bring any new light that would bring this Court to another conclusion. HMODs conduct did constitute fraud under the exception rule to the autonomy of letters of credit.\n\n. . .\n\nThat ruling, which was essentially of a procedural nature had decided that the conditions of an interlocutory injunctive order had not been met in this case, because the claimant would not suffer irreparable harm that could not be repaired by damages from a solvent party like the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD).\n\nConsequently, HMODs Extrajudicial Invitation Protest ordered Eurobank to comply with the judgment that had ordered nothing to Eurobank.\n\nEurobank did nothing before this Court nor the Greek courts after it received HMODs Extrajudicial Invitation Protest. It is also difficult to accept that Eurobank could not have gone back before the Greek courts as soon as the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award was handed down or that it could not have been able to take action to recuperate the money it had paid to HMOD, even if the task might have been long and difficult. The judgment of Justice Kostis was based on the very premise that HMOD was a solvent defendant, as a member of the European Union and that it would be in a position to reimburse Eurobank if damages were granted by the Greek courts. Once the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award had declared the Offsets Contract null and void, it makes little doubt that the Greek courts would have had no choice but to draw the inescapable consequence thereof and to refuse to order payment to HMOD or ultimately condemn the latter to reimburse Eurobank . . . . [Emphasis in original; paras. 189-202 (CanLII).]\nThere was no dispute as to the authenticity of the Kostis Decision. It is also undisputed that the Greek courts had jurisdiction over the Letter of Guarantee given that the parties were domiciled in Greece and given that it was governed by Greek law (Offsets Contract, art. 28; Procurement Contract, art. 35.5, reproduced in A.R., vol. IV, at p. 65). While it was open to the trial judge to determine the weight to be given to the Kostis Decision as a fact informing whether HMODs conduct was fraudulent, the trial judge could not consider the merits of the decision in doing so. However, that is precisely what he did: The merits did not bring any new light that would bring this Court to another conclusion (para. 191). In disregarding the Kostis Decision on the basis of its merits, the trial judge went against the rule codified in art. 2822 C.C.Q., which provides that a decision purporting to be issued by a competent foreign public officer makes proof of its content against all persons. Contrary to the position of my colleague on this point, this, in my view, amounts to an error of law. In these circumstances, the trial judge had to give the Kostis Decision a factual effect, and he committed an error of law in giving it none.\nI am also of the view, contrary to my colleagues position, that the trial judge made reviewable errors, i.e., palpable and overriding errors, in disregarding the Kostis Decision.\nFirst, the trial judge misread the Pana Injunction and, as a result, unduly criticized the Kostis Decision that dismissed Eurobanks application for an interlocutory injunction. The trial judge found that it was puzzling and even more confusing that Justice Kostis could have come to [the] conclusion [to dismiss Eurobanks application for injunctive relief] in his six-page ruling, when one considers that his colleague Justice Pana had arrived at a completely different conclusion in [her] detailed and well-crafted 30-page ruling as regards HMODs conduct (paras. 189-90). With respect, that finding by the trial judge was patently wrong. As HMOD explains, Judge Panas ruling was confined to four lines on the last page of the document (A.F., at paras. 64-66). The remaining 28 pages reproduced Eurobanks application in its entirety. Judge Pana did not make any finding or ruling regarding HMODs conduct in those four lines:\nThe court accepts the request for preliminary injunction.\n\nThe court allows [Eurobank] (temporarily) not to liquidate the Guarantee letter without suffering any legal consequences/penalties until the hearing of the petition for the interim measures on the hearing date set out below.\n\n(A.R., vol. VI, at p. 29)\nThis error was overriding. It led the trial judge to dismiss as irrelevant the Kostis Decision when considering whether HMODs third and final demand for payment was fraudulent and whether Eurobanks decision to pay amounted to participation in that fraud.\nSecond, it was simply wrong for the trial judge to determine that Eurobank could not rely on the Kostis Decision to justify its decision to pay under the Letter of Guarantee on the basis that Judge Kostis had not ordered Eurobank to pay (para. 198). The fundamental nature of demand guarantees must be kept in mind, namely their autonomy from the underlying contract. Under a demand guarantee, a bank has a near absolute obligation to pay the agreed sum on presentation of a compliant written demand. The Letter of Guarantee is an irrevocable and definite undertaking to pay. In light of the objective and spirit of such a letter, Eurobank had no choice but to pay unless it was specifically enjoined from doing so  and as per the Kostis Decision, it was not.\nThird, the trial judge clearly erred when he held that, in light of the Arbitral Award, Greek courts would have had no choice but to draw the inescapable consequence thereof and to refuse to order payment to HMOD or ultimately condemn the latter to reimburse Eurobank (para. 202). Irrespective of the fact that this assertion inappropriately questions the merits of the Kostis Decision and shows ex post facto reasoning, it was simply wrong to determine that the Arbitral Award resulted in this inescapable consequence. Eurobanks claim against HMOD in Greece was dismissed by both the Athens Court of Appeal and the Hellenic Supreme Court in decisions which confirmed, albeit indirectly, the Kostis Decision. The Athens Court of Appeal concluded that HMOD could call on the letter when it did. HMOD was no longer bound by the Written Undertaking at the time, it could not be bound by the Interim Order, and its demand was validly presented before any judgment of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal had been released (A.R., vol. III, at p. 104). The Athens Court of Appeal suggested that even though Eurobank was not entitled to repayment, Bombardier could seek recourse for unjust enrichment against HMOD once the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was paid out (pp. 103-5). The Hellenic Supreme Court confirmed the Athens Court of Appeals conclusions in full and dismissed Eurobanks claim (Hellenic Supreme Court decision, reproduced in motion to adduce fresh evidence, at pp. 51-81).\nOne ground of appeal raised by Eurobank before the Quebec Court of Appeal related to the trial judges treatment of the Kostis Decision. In support of its position, Eurobank filed the Athens Court of Appeals decision as new evidence. Mainville J.A. reviewed this decision but ultimately refused to give it any weight, confirming the trial judges treatment of the Kostis Decision. In doing so, Mainville J.A. repeated the trial judges error of law under art. 2822 C.C.Q. and the three palpable and overriding errors that I have identified (para. 65 (CanLII), citing Sup. Ct. reasons, at paras. 189-91). He also stated that public policy considerations may compel a Quebec court to disregard a foreign law or a foreign judgment (para. 67). In his view, the outcome reached by the Athens Court of Appeal was inconsistent with public order as understood in international relations, and the Greek judgments were rendered in contravention of the principles of reciprocity, order, and fairness. He concluded that the public order exception in arts. 3081 and 3155(5) C.C.Q. prevented the Kostis Decision from being recognized and enforced in Quebec.\nRespectfully, Mainville J.A. erred in doing so. Articles 3081 and 3155(5) C.C.Q. cannot serve as a basis for disregarding the factual effect of the Greek judgments. Nor can the balancing exercise governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign decisions at common law, because that exercise is already codified in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q. (Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc., 2006 SCC 52, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 612, at paras. 27 and 30). Eurobank did not ask for Greek law to apply, but for the Greek judgments to be given a factual effect. Article 3081 C.C.Q., which codifies the public order exception to the choice of law rules established in Book Ten of the C.C.Q., is of no relevance (Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 267; Emanuelli, at No. 464). Further, no party sought the recognition or enforcement of the Greek judgments in Quebec under art. 3155 C.C.Q. The factual effect of a judgment is [translation] independent from its recognition or enforcement in Quebec (J.-G. Castel, Droit international prive quebecois (1980), at p. 846; Goldstein and Talpis, at p. 57; Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 372). The exception in art. 3155(5) C.C.Q. does not apply.\nImporting the public order exception or other similar considerations into the assessment of the weight to be given to a foreign decision as a factual constraint is unsupported by any authority and is contrary to the text and purpose of art. 2822 C.C.Q. In conducting such an assessment, Quebec courts cannot question whether the foreign decision should be a fact on the basis of public policy considerations. It is either a fact or not. If it is a fact, it is an important one, especially when it binds the parties and informs their behaviour. Giving a factual effect to a foreign decision is very different from applying foreign law, recognizing that decision, or incorporating its solution into Quebecs legal order.\nEven if I were to accept that public policy considerations can inform the weight to be given to the Greek judgments as evidence, I would be of the view that none apply. The Kostis Decision was absolutely central to understanding HMODs and Eurobanks conduct at the time of payment. Yet Mainville J.A. did not mention any public policy considerations for disregarding it. When considering the weight to be given to the decision of the Athens Court of Appeal, he wrote that it should be disregarded because it stands for the proposition that the Greek State may ignore with impunity both the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal even if it formally undertook to abide by the arbitration process, and even if the Final Award was confirmed in all its aspects by the Court of Appeal for Paris (para. 69).\nWith respect, I disagree with that approach. At this juncture, it is important to note that the Arbitral Award was not relevant to Eurobanks claim for unjust enrichment  which turns on whether HMOD had a right to call on the Letter of Guarantee at the time of payment  and, as a result, was properly not considered by the Athens Court of Appeal. Moreover, it would be inappropriate to attribute fraud to Eurobank for HMODs alleged breach of the Interim Order given that Eurobank was not a party to the arbitration proceedings. This rationale, if applicable, should not be used to determine the evidentiary weight to be given to the Greek judgments, especially the Kostis Decision, in assessing Eurobanks conduct.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that public order as understood in international relations is of narrow application and is more limited than its domestic counterpart (Beals v. Saldanha, 2003 SCC 72, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, at para. 75; R.S. v. P.R., 2019 SCC 49, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 643, at para. 53; see also S. Guillemard and V. A. Ly, Elements de droit international prive quebecois (2019), at p. 62; Emanuelli, at No. 298). Consideration of public order is not an invitation for Quebec courts to consider the merits of the decision or of the foreign law (R.S., at para. 52; see also Barer v. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 SCC 13, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 573, at para. 26). Foreign decisions can be disregarded only if the consequences of attributing evidentiary weight to them would be so inconsistent with certain of the underlying values of the Quebec legal system as to be incapable of being incorporated into it (R.S., at para. 52). As I explain below, any breach of the Interim Order or of the Arbitral Award is merely contractual. Contrary to my colleague, I am of the view that an alleged contractual breach, which alone does not amount to fraud, does not create clear conflicts with, is not manifestly inconsistent with and does not constitute a serious divergence from Quebec public order as understood in international relations (R.S., at paras. 53-54; see also Justice Kasirers reasons, at para. 108). The consequences of attributing evidentiary weight to the decisions of the Athens Court of Appeal and of the Hellenic Supreme Court are not [translation] shocking (Guillemard and Ly, at p. 61), nor do they offend our sense of morality (Beals, at para. 75). Again, giving a factual effect to a foreign decision is different from incorporating the solution it provides into Quebecs legal order. Public order as understood in international relations cannot justify disregarding the decisions of the Athens Court of Appeal and of the Hellenic Supreme Court.\nMainville J.A. criticized the Greek courts for failing to give weight to the Quebec orders. With respect, he erred in doing so for the following reasons. First, the Quebec orders sought to govern the conduct of Greek parties under the Letter of Guarantee, which is expressly stated to be subject to Greek law (not Quebec law). Any dispute arising from the Letter of Guarantee was squarely within the jurisdiction of the Greek courts. In accordance with the principle of comity, it was for the Quebec courts to show deference to and respect for the jurisdiction of the Greek courts over the Letter of Guarantee (Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, at p. 1095). Second, one of the parties was not the usual litigant but a branch of the Greek government with sovereign rights, which it had decided to exercise. Third, it is doubtful that the Greek courts actually failed to give the appropriate weight to the Quebec orders. At the time the Kostis Decision was rendered, the only relevant Quebec order was the Prevost Injunction, which had already lapsed. Further, Judge Kostis had already ruled on the dispute by the time that the Davis Injunction was rendered. The Athens Court of Appeal and the Hellenic Supreme Court gave the appropriate weight to the Davis Injunction. They took it into account as a factual constraint on HMOD and Eurobank, while recognizing that it was not enforceable or binding in Greece, and rightly so.\nFurthermore, I agree with Hamilton J.A. that the decision to grant the Quebec orders in the first place was questionable (paras. 184-85). Any injunction granted under art. 940.4 C.C.P. must be grounded in one of the jurisdiction-conferring provisions of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. (F. Bachand, Lintervention du juge canadien avant et durant un arbitrage commercial international (2005), at No. 397). The Quebec orders were issued on the basis of art. 3138 C.C.Q., which provides that Quebec courts may order provisional or conservatory measures even if they have no jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute. Under that provision, courts should rarely, if ever, issue extraterritorial injunctions: [translation] [w]here there is an absence of jurisdiction over the merits, . . . the possible extraterritorial effect of the enforcement of [provisional or conservatory] measures will directly come into play in the decision to order them or not (G. Goldstein, Droit international prive, vol. 2, Competence internationale des autorites quebecoises et effets des decisions etrangeres (Art. 3134 a 3168 C.c.Q.) (2012), at p. 101 (emphasis in original); see also J. A. Talpis, with the collaboration of S. L. Kath, If I am from Grand-Mere, Why Am I Being Sued in Texas? Responding to Inappropriate Foreign Jurisdiction in Quebec-United States Crossborder Litigation (2001), at p. 18; Bachand, at no 397). In this case, the Quebec courts could validly enjoin National Bank from paying under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, assuming that there was a strong prima facie case of fraud. However, they could not validly enjoin HMOD or Eurobank from acting under the Letter of Guarantee. Interestingly, the majority of the Court of Appeal set aside the trial judges conclusion ordering HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award because the trial judge had no jurisdiction in this regard (C.A. reasons, at para. 46). The same reasoning should have applied to the provisional measures sought by Bombardier. In circumstances like in the instant case, it is not open to the Quebec courts to order the Greek state to act in a particular way, especially where sovereign rights are concerned.\nNo public policy consideration can justify disregarding the Greek judgments. I agree with Eurobank that, [a]s a bank domiciled in Greece, judgments rendered in Greece regarding [its] operations in Greece are obviously binding upon it, no matter where else those judgments might (or might not) be recognized and enforced (A.F., at para. 178 (emphasis omitted)). However, the Quebec orders and the Interim Order were not enforceable in Greece. Any concerns about order and fairness arise from the Quebec courts unwillingness to give weight, as factual constraints, to the Greek judgments by which the parties are and were bound. As the late J.-G. Castel wisely pointed out, [p]rotecting the justified expectations of the parties is an objective that is particularly important in private international law cases involving international business transactions, as it would be unfair and improper to hold a person liable under the local law of one state when he had justifiably molded his conduct to conform to the requirements of another state (The Uncertainty Factor in Canadian Private International Law (2007), 52 McGill L.J. 555, at pp. 558-59, quoting American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law, Second: Conflict of Laws 2d (1971) at 6.g). This is especially true with respect to the Kostis Decision, which was contemporaneous with the facts of the present case.\nIn my view, the courts below could not ignore the Kostis Decision in light of both art. 2822 C.C.Q. and the circumstances of this case. Nor could the decisions of the Athens Court of Appeal and of the Hellenic Supreme Court be disregarded insofar as they confirm the Kostis Decision. Had these judgments been duly considered as facts informing HMODs and Eurobanks conduct for the purposes of assessing whether the fraud exception applies to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, the only possible conclusion in the present case would have been that HMODs demand under the Letter of Guarantee and Eurobanks decision to pay were valid.\nHMODs Demand for Payment Was Neither Fraudulent Nor Tantamount to Fraud\nI will now address the trial judges conclusion that the requirements for the fraud exception, established in Angelica-Whitewear, were met. In light of all of the evidence, which I emphasize includes the Greek judgments, I am of the view that his conclusion cannot stand. The standard for fraud is a high one.\nHMODs Written Undertaking\nIn considering whether HMODs conduct was fraudulent, the trial judge emphasized that HMOD went against its word when it demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee (paras. 171-77). This was an error because he ignored the words of the Written Undertaking, the context in which it was provided, and the fact that it had been validly withdrawn at the time of HMODs demand. In other words, he failed to interpret the Written Undertaking as a whole.\nThe Written Undertaking has eight paragraphs, which shed light on its context. The trial judges conclusion ignores the first seven, which clearly state that HMOD retained all of its legal rights, including its sovereign rights under Greek public law, to draw on the Letter of Guarantee. The relevant paragraphs of the Written Undertaking read as follows:\n2. The right of [HMOD] to unilaterally impose penalties to the supplier, when the latter refuses to or does not perform appropriately his contractual obligations, is clearly provided and described both in the presidential decree governing the said contract (p.d. 284/1989), and the contractual clauses themselves.\n\n3. Such right of [HMOD] is inextricably connected with the exercise of public power; the penalties that are unilaterally imposed by the administration, in execution of contractual clauses, have the character of personal administration acts that can be challenged only before the Greek administrative courts.\n\n4. [Bombardier] may neither forbid [HMOD] to, nor prevent it in any way from exercising its said sovereign right, namely to calculate and impose penalties, when the conditions set by law and contract concur.\n\n7. . . . we reiterate that [HMOD] has not contemplated, on the contrary it has denied and is denying any and all claims raised by Bombardier Inc, which you represent. We also remind that we have expressly reserved all our legal rights, and we advise you once more that, always within the context of the arbitration procedure, we do not waive our sovereign rights.\n\n8. In any case, given that the Hearing before the International Arbitration Court has been set for the 25th-29th of June 2012, and therefore trial termination is anticipated, our office explicitly declares that we shall wait for the decision of the International Arbitration Court which has the power to settle in a manner that is binding for the parties, the substantial matters that have arisen from disputes that are subject to its jurisdiction, and that we shall not proceed to imposing any penalties against your client, for as long as the procedure is ongoing, which (procedure) has in any case been initiated according to the law and the contract. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. IV, at pp. 197-99)\nThese paragraphs all serve to preserve HMODs legal rights, including its sovereign rights, to demand payment under the Letter of Guarantee, and the trial judge erred in casting them aside as meaningless. By failing to interpret the Written Undertaking as a whole, the trial judge went against the clear rule of art. 1427 C.C.Q. that [e]ach clause of a contract [must be] interpreted in light of the others so that each is given the meaning derived from the contract as a whole.\nOn this point, I reach the same conclusions as Hamilton J.A. I also note that Judge Kostis, the Athens Court of Appeal, and the Hellenic Supreme Court interpreted the Written Undertaking in the same way. Judge Kostis expressly considered the Written Undertaking; he concluded that it could not be speculated that [HMOD] made a commitment for the non-forfeiture of the letter of guarantee (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 76). The Athens Court of Appeal similarly concluded that HMODs Written Undertaking did not create any false expectations on the part of [Bombardier], given what HMOD explained in these paragraphs (A.R., vol. III, at p. 102). The Hellenic Supreme Court confirmed this conclusion (p. 66).\nThe trial judge also ignored the important conditions set out in paras. 4, 7 and 8 of the Written Undertaking.\nThe first sentence of para. 8 is of great importance. It confirms that the Written Undertaking was provided on the assumption that the arbitration hearing would proceed in June 2012 and would conclude shortly thereafter. The Written Undertaking was provided on April 20, 2012, before Bombardier raised its new issue regarding the validity of the Offsets Contract under art. 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, [2012] O.J. C. 326/47. As a result of this new issue, the arbitration proceedings were delayed for another year. The circumstances in which the Written Undertaking was provided had changed significantly: the hearing was extended well beyond June 2012, and termination was no longer anticipated in the same way. Clearly, the condition under which HMOD promised not to draw on the Letter of Guarantee no longer applied.\nI agree with Hamilton J.A. that HMOD could validly withdraw its undertaking. As he noted, HMOD did so by putting Bombardier in default on July 31, 2013. This means that when HMOD demanded payment on December 18, 2013, the Written Undertaking was no longer in effect. Drawing on the Letter of Guarantee in this context cannot be a basis for a finding of fraud.\nThe Athens Court of Appeal reached the same conclusion, holding that there exists no doubt regarding [HMODs] intentions not to [draw on the Letter of Guarantee] in the context of the hearing already started before the [ICC] (A.R., vol. III, at p. 104). Once a new argument was made, there was no longer any obligation for HMOD to refrain from exercising its sovereign rights. The Athens Court of Appeal concluded: In view of said facts, it was not proved whatsoever by any evidence that the behaviour of [HMOD] during forfeiture and payment to [HMOD] of the [Letter of Guarantee] was evidently abusive (p. 105).\nThe Hellenic Supreme Court was of the same view. It acknowledged that HMOD voluntarily and in good faith agreed not to call the Letter of Guarantee while the arbitration proceedings were ongoing (p. 73). However, the Written Undertaking was provided on the assumption that a decision on that matter was expected to be issued by the end of 2012 (ibid.). When Bombardier raised its new argument about the validity of the Offsets contract, it changed the scope of the proceedings (ibid.). The context in which the Written Undertaking was provided changed. The Hellenic Supreme Court recognized that. As a result, it concluded that in the case at hand there was no abusive or fraudulent exercise of [HMOD]s right to request seizure of the guarantee letter payable on first demand for reasons relating to the underlying relationship between it and the debtor, a Canadian company, nor its obligation to compensate [Eurobank] on that ground (ibid., at p. 70). Indeed, paras. 4, 7 and 8 of the Written Undertaking are clear that HMOD reserved its rights and that the Written Undertaking itself was not absolute.\nHMODs Breach of the Provisional Orders\nThe trial judge held that HMODs demand for payment was made in contravention of the Interim Order and of the Davis Injunction.\nThe context of each order is important. Both the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction were granted on the basis of the Written Undertaking, which I, like Hamilton J.A., have concluded was validly withdrawn. To obtain an injunction enjoining a beneficiary from calling for payment on a letter of guarantee, the applicant must establish a strong prima facie case that the beneficiary is expressly disentitled from demanding payment (Veolia Water Technologies, at para. 43; see also Pacific Atlantic Pipeline Construction Ltd v. Coastal Gaslink Pipeline Ltd, 2023 ABKB 736, at para. 46 (CanLII), affd 2024 ABCA 74, at paras. 6-7 and 9-10 (CanLII); Sirius International Insurance Co. (Publ.) v. FAI General Insurance Ltd., [2003] EWCA Civ 470, [2003] 1 W.L.R. 2214, revd on other grounds [2004] UKHL 54, [2004] 1 W.L.R. 3251; Simic v. New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation, [2016] HCA 47, 260 C.L.R. 85).\nIn Pacific Atlantic Pipeline, the principal applied for an injunction to enjoin the beneficiary from drawing on a standby letter of credit. The chambers judge considered a verbal forbearance agreement pursuant to which the beneficiary had agreed not to draw on the letter of credit pending arbitration. The chambers judge acknowledged that the beneficiary had made representations that it would not draw on the instrument, but concluded that these representations did not rise to the level of certainty that a strong prima facie case requires (para. 59). While each case is factually distinct, what is common to all of them is the high bar to establish that there is legal certainty that the beneficiary intended not to draw on the instrument and that this undertaking applied at all relevant times.\nIn my view, the high bar that a strong prima facie case requires was not met for the Interim Order or for the Davis Injunction. This is because the Written Undertaking was validly withdrawn at the time. In fact, five days before HMOD called for payment under the Letter of Guarantee, HMOD notified Bombardier by letter that it intended to do so. HMOD attached the formal ministerial decision to that letter. Furthermore, the Written Undertaking expressly reserved HMODs rights, including its sovereign rights, and it was provided in the context that the arbitration was expected to end in June 2012. But these circumstances changed when Bombardier raised a new argument in August 2012.\nRegardless of whether the Interim Order should have been issued, it is essential to characterize the nature of the breach of that order in determining the legal consequences that should flow from it. The Interim Order was issued by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal at Bombardiers request on August 13, 2013. The Tribunal found that Bombardier had a prima facie (I note, not a strong prima facie) case for interim measures in light of the Written Undertaking given by HMOD. All parties acknowledge that the Interim Order was not and could not be enforced by the Greek courts  or by the Quebec courts (2013 QCCS 6892, at para. 5 (CanLII)). Such a breach is not equivalent to a breach of a court order. That being said, it is true that HMOD and Bombardier had agreed that the ICC Arbitral Tribunal would have jurisdiction over any dispute that might arise between them. They were contractually bound to comply with any conservatory and interim measures ordered by the Tribunal. Therefore, HMODs breach of the Interim Order was a contractual breach. This alone does not amount to fraud.\nAs for the Quebec orders, HMOD presented its third and final demand for payment on December 18, 2013, i.e., at a time when there was no injunction enjoining it from doing so. Indeed, the Prevost Injunction had expired on August 26, 2013, and the Davis Injunction was not issued until December 20, 2013, after the demand for payment had been presented by HMOD. That demand for payment was a logical continuation of the demand of August 12, 2013, that had been suspended by the Pana Injunction. Therefore, it was an error to conclude that HMODs demand on December 18, 2013, was in contravention of a Quebec injunction. The Davis Injunction only ordered HMOD to withdraw its demand for payment after the fact. Again, the Davis Injunction was not enforceable in Greece, and it is doubtful that it should have been issued in the first place.\nConsequently, it was an error to conclude that HMODs conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud on the basis of either the Interim Order or the Davis Injunction. Neither an alleged breach of contract nor an alleged failure to comply with non-binding injunctions can ground a finding of fraud in the circumstances of this case. This was also the view of the Athens Court of Appeal, which was further confirmed by the Hellenic Supreme Court (A.R., vol. III, p. 104; Hellenic Supreme Court decision, at pp. 67 and 69).\nThe Timing of HMODs Demand for Payment\nAnother point of concern for the trial judge was the timing of HMODs demand (paras. 182-84). It may be tempting to look at HMODs conduct after the fact and determine that it engaged in some kind of fraud. Its failure to repay the money that it obtained under the Letter of Guarantee, even after the Offsets Contract was found to be null and void, is certainly questionable. I must not, however, engage in impermissible reasoning by looking at HMODs conduct today and inferring fraud from it. Rather, I must limit myself to what occurred before the payment under the Letter of Guarantee, without the benefit of hindsight. As long as the underlying contract is valid, a beneficiary is entitled to demand payment under a demand guarantee. Indeed, the consequences of a call on a demand guarantee can be harsh, draconian and abrupt without amounting to fraud (Royal Bank of Canada v. Darlington, [1995] O.J. No. 1044 (Lexis), 1995 CarswellOnt 2661 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 181).\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the formal ministerial decision to call the Letter of Guarantee was made on July 17, 2013. The first demand for payment was presented on August 5, 2013, after a demand letter had been sent to Bombardier on July 31, 2013. Eurobank refused to honour the demand because it did not comply with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Guarantee. The second demand for payment was made on August 12, 2013, but the Pana Injunction, which was issued after that demand was made, prevented Eurobank from paying. No new demand was presented while the Pana Injunction was in force. With respect, and as I explained above, the trial judge erred in not giving weight to the Greek judgments. The Kostis Decision, which set aside the temporary Pana Injunction, was central to HMODs decision to reiterate its demand for payment under the Letter of Guarantee. HMOD reiterated its demand for payment only once the Kostis Decision was rendered in its favour and the Pana Injunction was no longer in effect.\nThat third and final demand for payment was presented on December 18, 2013, only two days after the Kostis Decision, which triggered the presentation of that demand, was rendered. The demand for payment as well as the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest clearly stated that HMOD was drawing on the Letter of Guarantee pursuant to Judge Kostiss conclusions regarding the allegations of fraud (A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 79 and 149-50). It was totally unjustified  to say the least  for the trial judge to write that, in exercising its rights under Greek law and the Letter of Guarantee, HMOD utilized what appears to be nothing short than legal blackmail and extortion in order to force Eurobank to pay (para. 182 (emphasis added)).\nOn the face of the Letter of Guarantee, it is clear that HMOD could validly demand payment under it despite any objection by Bombardier or any legal action before any court of law:\nPURSUANT TO THE ABOVE, WE, ANZ GRINDLAYS BANK LIMITED, ATHENS SUPPLY THE REQUIRED LETTER OF GUARANTEE FOR THE SUPPLIER AND THUS UNDERTAKE THE OBLIGATION TO PAY YOU AFTER YOUR PREMIER AND SIMPLE REQUEST IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WITH NO ADDITIONAL PROOFS EXCEPT YOUR STATEMENT THAT THE SUPPLIER DID NOT CORRECTLY FULFILL HIS OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE THE AFOREMENTIONED OFFSETS WITHIN THE TIME LIMIT PROVIDED BY ARTICLE 5 PARAGRAPH 5.1 AND ARTICLE 19 OF THE ABOVE OFFSETS CONTRACT, THE WHOLE AMOUNT OF THE LETTER OF GUARANTEE WITHIN (3) THREE WORKING DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF RECEIVING YOUR DEMAND, REGARDLESS OF ANY OBJECTION AND/OR ANY KIND OF ARGUMENTS OF THE SUPPLIER, ANY LEGAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE SUPPLIER BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW IN ANY COUNTRY AND WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO RESORT TO A COURT OF LAW OF ARBITRATION. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 112)\nSince Judge Kostis dismissed Eurobanks application for an injunction, the conclusion, from HMODs perspective, was that it had a valid contractual right to draw on the Letter of Guarantee.\nWhen placed in its context, as is required by both the law and the facts of this case, HMODs decision to draw on the Letter of Guarantee does not meet the high threshold for fraud. Though HMOD acted against the Interim Order by presenting a demand and against the Davis Injunction by not withdrawing that demand, neither the Interim Order nor the Davis Injunction was enforceable in Greece. HMOD clearly acted pursuant to the Kostis Decision when it demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee. On the basis of the Kostis Decision, it cannot be said that HMODs demand was clearly untrue or false or utterly without justification or that it was apparent there was no right to payment.\nI agree with Hamilton J.A. that the trial judge erred in finding fraud on the basis of HMODs conduct, that is, its alleged breach of the Written Undertaking, the Interim Order, and the Davis Injunction, as well as the timing of its demand. However, with respect, I do not agree with Hamilton J.A. that fraud can be inferred from HMODs decision not to repay Eurobank after losing before the ICC Arbitral Tribunal (paras. 200-201). Any finding regarding HMODs intention to repay or not is speculative and is insufficient to ground a finding of fraud. Rather, its decision not to repay should be considered in light of the fact that the Arbitral Award had not yet been homologated in Greece. It could not be taken for granted that the Arbitral Award would be homologated in Greece and that HMOD would not comply with it if homologated. In this regard, I agree with Mainville J.A. that the trial judge had no jurisdiction to order HMOD to comply with the Arbitral Award (para. 46). At the time of the hearing before our Court, Bombardier had not yet sought the homologation of the Arbitral Award in Greece.\nEven if HMODs Conduct Was Fraudulent or Tantamount to Fraud, Eurobank Was Innocent of That Fraud\nI now turn to the question of whether, if I were to accept that HMODs conduct was fraudulent or tantamount to fraud for the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, the fraud exception would apply in the circumstances. I am of the view that, in light of all of the evidence, Eurobank (the beneficiary) has to be considered innocent of HMODs (the third party) alleged fraud for the purposes of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Again, the Kostis Decision was central to Eurobanks decision to honour HMODs demand for payment. When the Kostis Decision is taken into account, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that Eurobank did not have clear or obvious knowledge of fraud and did not participate in it. There is an inherent contradiction in the requirement that a reviewing court, in assessing whether a bank had sufficient knowledge of any fraud, place itself in the position of the issuing bank at the time of payment, but at the same time discard the decisions of courts of competent jurisdiction that were binding on that bank at the time.\nEurobanks Knowledge\nWhen a beneficiary of a demand guarantee has committed fraud, that fraud will not be attributed to the guarantor unless it is established that the guarantor had clear or obvious knowledge of that fraud. Clear in this context has been described as unambiguous, easily understood, manifest, not confused and not doubtful, while obvious means easily seen or recognised or understood, palpable, indubitable (Royal Bank of Canada, at para. 209). Put simply, the fraud must be [translation] blatantly apparent (Mattout, at p. 258).\nIn assessing whether Eurobank had clear or obvious knowledge of the alleged fraud, our Court must place itself in the exact same situation that Eurobank was in by standing in [its] shoes (Kurkela, at pp. 179-80; Unicredito Italiano S.P.A., Hong Kong Branch v. Alan Chung Wah Tang, [2002] HKCFI 339, at para. 32 (HKLII). Thus, I must confine myself to the facts as Eurobank knew them on December 24, 2013, the date when payment was made. Relying on information that Eurobank did not have at the time would be an error. For example, Eurobank did not know whether HMOD would be successful in the arbitration proceedings or what HMOD would do if it were to lose.\nThe trial judge determined that Eurobank paid under the Letter of Guarantee in full knowledge of HMODs fraud (para. 210). He relied on the fact that Eurobank knew of the Written Undertaking as well as HMODs decision to draw on the Letter of Guarantee in contravention of the Interim Order and of the Davis Injunction. It is undisputed that Eurobank had knowledge of these facts; however, they cannot ground the conclusion that Eurobank had clear or obvious knowledge of fraud. Let me explain.\nAfter HMOD demanded payment under the Letter of Guarantee on August 5, 2013, Eurobank instituted its own proceedings for injunctive relief before the Athens First Instance Court. That application was ultimately dismissed on its merits by Judge Kostis on December 16, 2013. Eurobank, HMOD, Bombardier, and National Bank were all represented in these proceedings and presented their evidence as to the alleged fraud. Through this process, Judge Kostis was made aware of the arbitration proceedings, the Interim Order, the Prevost Injunction, and the Written Undertaking. Despite all of this, Judge Kostis determined that there were no grounds for granting the injunction: . . . this does not render the behavior of [HMOD], who defends its rights, abusive; nor can such a behavior be speculated to be abusive . . . (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 75). He refused to enjoin Eurobank from paying under the Letter of Guarantee.\nEurobank was then faced with a judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction (I stress, the only court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes of the Letter of Guarantee), which found that HMOD could validly draw on the Letter of Guarantee. The Kostis Decision, as a factual constraint, is a determinative element in the analysis of Eurobanks clear or obvious knowledge. Eurobank had knowledge of HMODs alleged fraudulent conduct; Eurobank and the other parties presented the Greek court with evidence as it existed at the time. However, Judge Kostis still held that HMOD could validly call on the letter because there was no reason to conclude that any fraudulent act had been committed. I fail to understand how it can be concluded that Eurobank had knowledge of fraud, let alone clear or obvious knowledge.\nAfter the Kostis Decision was rendered, HMOD reiterated its demand for payment on December 18, 2013. Eurobank subsequently contacted National Bank, informing it that it had no choice but to pay. It is clear from these exchanges that Eurobank was under the  in my view, correct  impression that HMOD was making its demand pursuant to the Kostis Decision. Indeed, Eurobank explained to National Bank that its application for injunctive relief had been dismissed by Judge Kostis. It further explained that the Pana Injunction was therefore no longer in effect. Given that there was no binding injunction, it had to issue payment to HMOD: UNDER THE TERMS OF [THE LETTER OF GUARANTEE] AND APPLICABLE GREEK LAW WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE BENEFICIARY THE AMOUNT OF US$13,868,354.40 WITHIN THREE WORKING DAYS . . . (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 84).\nAfter the Davis Injunction was granted on December 20, 2013, Eurobank even contacted HMOD, asking it to reconsider its demand for payment in light of that injunction (A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 173-76). This was on December 23, 2013. In response, HMOD served Eurobank with the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest, ordering it, under penalty of both civil and criminal sanctions, to make payment under the Letter of Guarantee. These were serious sanctions and Eurobank, as a Greek bank, was exposed to them (C.A. reasons, at para. 215). In the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest, HMOD wrote that the Davis Injunction could not be enforced in Greece given the opposite judgment rendered by Judge Kostis. Moreover, HMOD stressed that the Greek courts would lack the jurisdiction to make a judgment upon a case of interim measures and provisional injunction order for non-payment of a letter of guarantee payable on demand, with the Canadian State as defendant party and beneficiary of the letter of guarantee and a Canadian Bank as debtor (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 150).\nIt was in this context that Eurobank had to make its decision. From Eurobanks reasonable perspective (Mitchell, at p. 716), the Kostis Decision and the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest would have dissipated any knowledge of fraud that it may have had. Indeed, Eurobank had specifically pleaded before the Greek courts in the summer of 2013 that HMODs exercise of its right for the payment of the Letter of Guarantee [was] and continue[s] to be obviously abusive, in bad faith (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 19). But Eurobank lost on this. So any remaining suspicions that Eurobank may have had became of no moment. This is certainly not clear or obvious knowledge where fraud is blatantly apparent. I agree with Hamilton J.A. that such suspicions do not rise to the level of clear or obvious knowledge (paras. 217-18; Banco Nacional, at pp. 119-20).\nEurobanks Alleged Participation\nThe trial judge determined that Eurobank participated in HMODs fraud by choosing to pay in contravention of not one but two orders, i.e., the Interim Order and the Davis Injunction (para. 197). Although Eurobank did not collude in any way in HMODs alleged fraud, the trial judge nevertheless determined that it knowingly enabled fraud to produce its fruits (paras. 196 and 205). He found that Eurobank had the choice of either complying with these two orders or complying with HMODs Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest. From Eurobanks decision to comply with the latter, the trial judge inferred fraudulent participation.\nIt is true that Eurobanks decision to pay was voluntary (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 196). However, the voluntariness of the payment is not the appropriate inquiry. When a bank pays under a demand guarantee, it always does so voluntarily. What matters is whether Eurobank was enjoined from paying by a court of competent jurisdiction on a prima facie case of fraud or whether it was presented with clear or obvious evidence of fraud and chose to pay nonetheless, neither of which, as I have concluded, was the case. What amounts to mere suspicions of improper circumstances does not meet this threshold. The difficulty in this case is that there were conflicting orders from different courts and from an arbitral tribunal. The reality is that the only order that was enforceable against Eurobank, i.e., the Kostis Decision, did not enjoin it from paying. There was no choice to be made.\nWhile the trial judge determined that the Kostis Decision, in refusing injunctive relief, had not expressly ordered Eurobank to pay, the fundamental nature of demand guarantees must be kept in mind. As I have explained, under a demand guarantee, a bank is obliged to pay on presentation of a written demand for payment that complies with the terms and conditions of the guarantee. It is an irrevocable and definite undertaking to pay. The terms of the Letter of Guarantee itself reflect this principle:\n. . . REGARDLESS OF ANY OBJECTION AND/OR ANY KIND OF ARGUMENTS OF THE SUPPLIER, ANY LEGAL ACTION TAKEN BY THE SUPPLIER BEFORE ANY COURT OF LAW IN ANY COUNTRY AND WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO RESORT TO A COURT OF LAW OF ARBITRATION. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 112)\nThis language makes clear that Eurobank could not refuse payment without improperly exceeding its role as a guarantor and entering into the parties arena. It could be prevented from paying under the Letter of Guarantee only if an injunction on a strong prima facie case of fraud was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Eurobank sought that injunction, temporarily succeeded, then permanently failed. Bombardier  not National Bank  took action, but it instituted proceedings before a court that had no jurisdiction to enjoin Eurobank, or HMOD for that matter, regarding the Letter of Guarantee.\nThe trial judge held that Eurobank should have chosen to comply with the Davis Injunction and the Interim Order instead of the Kostis Decision and the Extrajudicial Invitation-Protest. In my view, it is simply not reasonable to have expected Eurobank, when faced with this so-called choice, to comply with orders that were not enforceable against it. The Davis Injunction was not enforceable in Greece, and it is doubtful that it, like the Prevost Injunction, should have been issued in the first place. As for the Interim Order, Eurobank was not part of the arbitration proceedings and could not be bound by it (Desputeaux v. Editions Chouette (1987) inc., 2003 SCC 17, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 178, at para. 62). It is noteworthy that the Athens Court of Appeal and Hellenic Supreme Court concluded that Eurobank had no choice but to pay. Payment had to be made under the Letter of Guarantee given its autonomous nature and the fact that there was no operative injunction. The Kostis Decision had dismissed Eurobanks application for injunctive relief, and the Davis Injunction and the Interim Order were not binding in Greece (Hellenic Supreme Court decision, at p. 67, citing with approval the Athens Court of Appeal decision, reproduced in A.R., vol. III, at pp. 100-102). I could not say it better than Hamilton J.A. did: . . . it is important that the injunction be sought from the right court and for the right reason (para. 210).\nIn my view, Eurobanks conduct was that of an innocent beneficiary under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Eurobank played the role that it undertook to play pursuant to the Letter of Guarantee. It did not participate in any fraud, nor did it have clear or obvious knowledge of HMODs alleged fraud at the time of payment. Given that the requirements for the fraud exception were not met, the autonomy of demand guarantees  their governing principle and raison detre  had to prevail.\nThe Apportionment of Risk Between the Parties\nI cannot accept Bombardiers argument that it was for Eurobank to bear the risks of payment in this context. It is clear from the text of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee that Eurobank did not assume any risk by undertaking to pay under the Letter of Guarantee, except in very narrow circumstances. It is also clear that Eurobank complied with the strict conditions stated in the Letter of Counter-Guarantee:\nIN CONSIDERATION OF YOU ISSUING AT OUR REQUEST THE ABOVEMENTIONED GUARANTEE, WE, NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA HEREBY IRREVOCABLY UNDERTAKE TO REIMBURSE YOU ALL AMOUNT(S) CLAIMED BY THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE UP TO BUT NOT EXCEEDING USD 27,736,709.00 (TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINE. . .00/100 UNITED STATES DOLLARS) PLUS COSTS, STAMP DUTIES AND VALUE ADDED TAX AS APPROPRIATE, WITH SAME VALUE RATE AS OF THE DATE OF YOUR PAYMENT, AFTER RECEIPT OF YOUR TESTED TELEX/AUTHENTICATED SWIFT INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE BENEFICIARY OF YOUR GUARANTEE A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR GUARANTEE. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. IV, at p. 118)\nOnce Eurobank complied with HMODs demand and paid under the Letter of Guarantee, National Bank was obliged to honour Eurobanks demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. The parties agreed to this causal chain of demands and payments, which was predicated on a pay now, argue later structure.\nEurobank was not a party to the Offsets Contract. It is not rational from a commercial perspective that Eurobank, as the institution simply securing the transaction, would be the one stuck with the risk arising from that transaction. As I have explained, this conclusion would upset the role of banks in this type of transaction. While Bombardier suggests before this Court that the decision to have a counter-guarantee subject to Quebec law was designed to ensure that the fraud exception would be available, there is evidence to suggest that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was instead required by Eurobank to mitigate any risk on its part. In addition, it is standard commercial practice for local banks securing transactions between local and foreign actors to seek security from a foreign bank instead of dealing directly with the foreign party (LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at pp. 430-31; Mattout, at pp. 241-44; Kurkela, at p. 14; Bertrams, at pp. 118-19; Ellinger and Neo, at p. 335; Droit bancaire: Institutions, comptes, operations, services (8th ed. 2010), by J. Stoufflet, at No. 880). By ensuring that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was secured by a bank that was local for Bombardier, Eurobank expected to be paid. It made sure that it would not have to deal with onerous proceedings in Quebec should any dispute regarding payment arise.\nSince the requirements for the fraud exception are not met, this leaves only the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. As Eurobank argues, it complied with the only obligation that it had under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee  it indicated to National Bank that it had received a compliant demand for payment from HMOD. The conditions and formalities of the letter were respected; nothing in this context can prevent National Bank from honouring this demand. Respecting the autonomy of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee and considering it independently from the underlying dispute leads to the conclusion that National Bank is obligated to honour the demand for payment presented by Eurobank.\nImpact of the Declaration of Nullity of the Offsets Contract on the Letters of Guarantee and Counter-Guarantee\nAs an alternative argument in support of its application, Bombardier asks this Court to enjoin National Bank from paying under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee because the Offsets Contract was declared null and void ab initio by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 143). This position is premised on two arguments.\nFirst, Bombardier argues that Eurobank cannot be paid under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee because it must be deemed to have never existed under art. 1422 C.C.Q. (R.F., at paras. 121 and 128). The trial judge upheld this argument at first instance as follows: It is obvious that the Letter of Guarantee that was declared null and void ab initio by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal Final Award which has been homologated by this Court, the Counter-Guarantee must follow suit and that [National Bank] should be ordered not to pay Eurobank (para. 240). With respect, he erred in stating this. The ICC Arbitral Tribunal declared only the relevant clauses of the Offsets Contract void ab initio, not the Letter of Guarantee. Moreover, such a statement by the trial judge runs contrary to the well-established principle of autonomy. Where the contract underlying a demand guarantee is found to be null, the guarantee is not as a result invalid for being contrary to public order under art. 1411 C.C.Q. Under a demand guarantee, the bank agrees to pay on simple request, regardless of any underlying dispute. That obligation is separate and distinct from the underlying contract (G. B. Graham and B. Geva, Standby Credits in Canada (1984) 9 Can. Bus. L.J. 180, at p. 189; LHeureux and Lacoursiere, at pp. 428-29). The nullity of the Offsets Contract does not make the cause of National Banks obligation to pay disappear under art. 1371 C.C.Q. The Letter of Counter-Guarantee therefore remains valid.\nSecond, Bombardier argues that the Letter of Counter-Guarantee should not be enforceable because the Offsets Contract was illegal (R.F., at paras. 126-27). In the present case, it is not necessary to discuss this argument at length since at the time Eurobank paid under the Letter of Guarantee and presented its demand under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, the Arbitral Award had not been rendered. Furthermore, Eurobank was not a party to the arbitration proceedings and was not able to assess whether HMOD would win or lose. Imposing an unprecedented illegality exception would be to treat Eurobank unfairly after it performed [its] part of the bargain (L. Sarna, Letters of Credit: The Law and Current Practice (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 5-16.1). Eurobank should not be on the hook for the nullity of the Offsets Contract. Securing the transaction was supposed to be risk-free for Eurobank. Its aversion to risk was the very reason for the issuance of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Ultimately, [t]he risk was Bombardiers and it must assume it (C.A. reasons, at para. 230).\nIn any event, the enforceability of the Arbitral Award against HMOD remains unsettled. Indeed, the Arbitral Award has not yet been homologated in Greece, so one cannot speculate as to the final result.\nConclusion\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgments rendered on appeal and in first instance, and dismiss the action instituted by Bombardier against Eurobank and National Bank, the whole with costs to Eurobank throughout.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs, Karakatsanis and Cote JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant Eurobank Ergasias S.A.: Renno Vathilakis inc., Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant the General Directorate for Defense Armaments and Investments of the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense: Angelopoulos Attorneys, Laval.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent Bombardier inc.: Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, Montreal; Bombardier inc., Dorval.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent the National Bank of Canada: Woods, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener: Gowling WLG (Canada), Montreal.",
        "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court of Canada Dismisses Eurobank's Appeal, Upholding the Application of the Fraud Exception to a Letter of Counter-Guarantee.\n\nThis appeal centers around the interpretation of a letter of counter-guarantee in an international commercial transaction and involves the application of the fraud exception to the autonomy of demand guarantees.\n\nIn 1998, Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier) and the Hellenic Ministry of National Defense (HMOD) entered into a procurement contract for the purchase of 10 CL-415 firefighting amphibious aircraft. As part of the contract, Bombardier agreed to subcontract part of the manufacturing work to Greek suppliers. The subcontracting obligations were secured by a demand guarantee issued by Eurobank Ergasias S.A. (Eurobank) in favor of HMOD, governed by Greek law. A counter-guarantee was issued by the National Bank of Canada, governed by Quebec law, to secure the payment obligations of Eurobank under the demand guarantee. Disputes arose under the contract, and HMOD demanded payment under the demand guarantee, which Eurobank purportedly honored despite knowing of HMOD's allegedly fraudulent conduct.\n\nThe trial court found that HMOD engaged in fraudulent conduct by demanding payment under the letter of credit despite its undertaking not to do so while arbitration proceedings were ongoing. Eurobank was found to have participated in HMOD's fraud by paying HMOD under the letter of credit. The court ruled that the National Bank should be enjoined from paying under the counter-guarantee. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld most of the trial court's decision, except for the part that ordered HMOD to comply with the arbitral award, as it was not within the court's jurisdiction. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the Greek courts had found that HMOD did not engage in fraudulent conduct and that Eurobank did not have knowledge of any fraud.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, ruling that the Greek courts' decisions were not relevant to the application of the fraud exception under Canadian law governing the counter-guarantee. The court held that Eurobank participated in HMOD's fraudulent conduct and that the National Bank should be enjoined from paying under the counter-guarantee.\n\nThe Supreme Court established that the fraud exception to the autonomy of demand guarantees is a narrow exception that requires clear or obvious knowledge of fraud by the guarantor. A beneficiary's demand for payment under a demand guarantee will only be considered fraudulent if it is apparent that there was no right to payment.\n\nWriting for the majority, Kasirer J. concluded that the fraud exception applies to Eurobank's demand for payment under the letter of counter-guarantee. The Court held that, given that Eurobank knew of and participated in fraud by HMOD, that fraud can be attributed to Eurobank as its own. This conclusion is based on the finding that HMOD engaged in a fraudulent attempt to circumvent the Interim Order and the Final Award of the ICC Arbitral Tribunal by demanding payment, despite knowing it had no right to do so. Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, knew of HMOD's fraudulent conduct and participated in it by demanding payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Therefore, the National Bank was rightly enjoined from paying out any amount under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank.",

        "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court confirms that a Canadian bank must refuse payment to the beneficiary of a  letter of credit due to fraud. </strong>In this appeal, the Court addressed  the issue of whether a Canadian bank was required to refuse payment to the  beneficiary of a letter of credit because of a third party\u2019s fraudulent  behaviour, which was attributable to the beneficiary. In 1998, Bombardier Inc., a  Canadian aviation company based in Montreal, concluded a procurement contract  with the Hellenic Ministry of Defence (HMOD) in Greece for the sale of 10  firefighting airplanes. They also concluded a second contract pursuant to which  Bombardier agreed to subcontract some of the work associated with the airplane procurement  to Greek companies. That contract said that if, at the end of a 10-year term,  Bombardier did not fulfil its subcontracting obligation, it would owe HMOD a  certain amount of money relative to the main contract. To secure payment of the money  Bombardier might owe HMOD under the second contract, the Greek bank at the time  (now Eurobank Ergasias S.A., or, Eurobank) issued a letter of credit guaranteeing  that Eurobank would pay if Bombardier did not (the Letter of Guarantee). For  its part, Eurobank obtained a letter of credit from the National Bank of Canada  to secure a reimbursement in the amount that it would need to pay HMOD under  the Letter of Guarantee if the latter claimed that Bombardier failed to perform  its obligations under the second contract (the Letter of Counter-Guarantee). In  short, the letters would work as follows: if HMOD asked Eurobank to honour the  Letter of Guarantee, Eurobank would then be entitled to turn to the National  Bank to reimburse it under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee.A dispute eventually arose  between HMOD and Bombardier with respect to the latter\u2019s subcontracting  obligations. HMOD demanded payment from Eurobank under the Letter of Guarantee.  In response, Bombardier asked the Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec for an order to stop  the National Bank from honouring a subsequent demand for repayment by Eurobank  under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. Bombardier alleged that HMOD, a third  party to the Letter of Counter-Guarantee, committed fraud by demanding payment  before the dispute was resolved by the planned arbitration procedure and that,  because of Eurobank\u2019s knowledge and participation in the fraud, the National  Bank should be prevented from needing to repay Eurobank on the basis of the  \u201cfraud exception\u201d. Under Canadian law, banks have a nearly absolute obligation to  pay the beneficiary of a letter of credit when a valid  demand is made, except when the  beneficiary has committed fraud and it is brought to the bank\u2019s attention  before payment. In this case, Bombardier argued that given HMOD\u2019s fraudulent  conduct, Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee was,  by extension, also fraudulent. The Superior Court rejected  Eurobank\u2019s demand for payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee on the  basis of the fraud exception. It held that the manner in which HMOD obtained  payment under the Letter of Guarantee was fraudulent, and that Eurobank\u2019s own  conduct was fraudulent because its payment to HMOD was a result of fraud of  which it was aware. It therefore concluded the National Bank was not required  to repay Eurobank. A majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal agreed and  dismissed the appeal. Eurobank appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. \u00a0<strong>The fraud exception applies with respect to Eurobank\u2019s demand for  payment under the Letter of Counter-Guarantee. </strong>Writing for the majority, Justice  Kasirer explained that because Eurobank, as the beneficiary of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee, knew of and participated in fraud committed by HMOD, that  fraud could be attributed to it as though it was its own. The requirement that  there be fraud by the beneficiary to apply the fraud exception was therefore  met. Moreover, there was no question that Eurobank\u2019s fraud was brought to the  attention of the National Bank as the insurer of the Letter of  Counter-Guarantee. On that basis, Justice Kasirer concluded that the National  Bank was rightly enjoined by the trial judge from paying out any amount under  the Letter of Counter-Guarantee to Eurobank and the majority of the Court of  Appeal made no mistake in that conclusion."
