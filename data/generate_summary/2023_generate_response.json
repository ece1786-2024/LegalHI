Ohler, for the appellant.\n\tBenita Wassenaar, for the respondent.\n\tThe judgment of Rowe, Martin, OBonsawin and Moreau JJ. was delivered orally by\n[1]\tOBonsawin J.  This is an appeal from R. v. Lawlor, 2022 ONCA 645, 418 C.C.C. (3d) 87, in which the majority dismissed an appeal by Derrick Lawlor of his conviction for first degree murder by a jury. The majority in the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal; Justice Nordheimer would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.\n[2]\tOnly two grounds of appeal are before this Court. The first is whether the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury regarding the use of evidence as to the accuseds mental health and the requisite intent for first degree murder. The second relates to evidence of after-the-fact conduct.\n[3]\tA majority of this Court would allow the appeal on the ground relating to the requisite intent for murder and for first degree murder, but not on the ground relating to after-the-fact conduct. As to the first ground, we are in substantial agreement with the reasons of Justice Nordheimer. As to the second ground, we are in substantial agreement with the reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal majority. We would add the following comment.\n[4]\tAs has been stated on many occasions, and we repeat here, courts need to be mindful of evidence as to mental health where this is relevant to issues of criminal responsibility. This is especially so in instructing a jury, to assist them in the proper use of such evidence.\n[5]\tAccordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside and a new trial is ordered.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered orally by\n[6]\tKasirer J.  I would dismiss the appeal. I allow myself two observations.\n[7]\tFirst, I agree with my colleagues that courts need to be mindful of mental health evidence in criminal matters, including in instructions to the jury. As the majority in the Court of Appeal wrote, there is no question that evidence of mental health problems may be relevant to issues of intent and planning and deliberation, including in an assessment of the adequacy of a jury charge (see paras. 41 and 44-48).\n[8]\tSecond, and with the utmost respect for other views, I conclude that the trial judges charge properly equipped the jury, in light of all the circumstances, to decide the case according to the exacting standard set forth in R. v. Abdullahi, 2023 SCC 19. In sum, in respect of both the mental health and the after-the-fact evidence, I see no reviewable errors in the jury charge and, on these points, I would adopt the majority reasons of van Rensburg J.A. as my own, without reserve.\n\tJudgment accordingly.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Rosen & Company, Toronto; Amy J.

Lawlor**\n\nThis appeal centered on whether the trial judge's instructions to the jury adequately addressed the relevance and use of evidence relating to the accused's mental health in assessing intent for murder.\n\n**Background**\nDue to limited information, a detailed summary of the case facts is not possible. However, it is known that Derrick Michael Lawlor was convicted of first-degree murder by a jury.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nDerrick Lawlor was convicted of first-degree murder by a jury at trial. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld this conviction, but upon further appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, citing an error in the trial judge's instructions regarding mental health evidence and intent for murder. The majority agreed with Justice Nordheimer's dissenting opinion from the Ontario Court of Appeal that found these instructions inadequate. In contrast, Justice Kasirer dissented from this decision.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nWhen instructing a jury, trial judges must provide clear guidance on the relevance and use of evidence relating to an accused's mental health when it is relevant to issues of intent.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice OBonsawin and her colleagues held that the trial judge erred in failing to provide a clear instruction on the relevance and use of evidence relating to Derrick Lawlor's mental health when addressing intent for murder. The court recognized that evidence of mental health can be crucial in assessing intent and planning and deliberation, particularly in cases involving first-degree murder. By failing to provide such an instruction, the trial judge compromised the jury's ability to properly evaluate this evidence, leading to a flawed verdict. As a result, they allowed Derrick Lawlor's appeal and set aside his conviction for first-degree murder while ordering a new trial", "citation": "2023 SCC 34", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets aside the  conviction of a man found guilty of first-degree murder and orders a new trial. </strong>This case is about whether the judge in a murder trial  correctly instructed the jury with respect to the accused\u2019s mental health  conditions and his post-offence conduct. \u00a0\u00a0On April 9, 2014, Mr. Derrick Michael Lawlor participated  in a sexual encounter with two other men in a park in Kitchener, Ontario. The  following day, the body of one of those men was found in the park. He had died  due to external neck compression. Mr. Lawlor had consumed both psychiatric medication  and alcohol around the time he was in the park with the victim and the third  man. He had made several statements both before and after the victim\u2019s death  about how he wanted to harm and kill gay men, and that he had at times carried  a rope and a knife to do so. In the days following the killing, Mr. Lawlor also  searched the internet for news with respect to the discovery of a body in the  park.Mr. Lawlor was tried by a judge and jury. In the  judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the element of intent, which is required to  find an accused guilty of first-degree murder, the trial judge did not  specifically highlight any evidence related to Mr. Lawlor\u2019s mental health. Such  evidence could have impacted whether he intended to commit the offence. Rather,  he asked the jury to consider \u201call of the evidence\u201d, including Mr. Lawlor\u2019s  state of mind and any evidence of impairment by drugs and alcohol. The trial  judge also briefly referred to Mr. Lawlor\u2019s internet searches after the offence,  but did not give the jury further instructions to limit what it could infer  from this evidence to determine guilt. The jury ultimately found Mr. Lawlor  guilty of first-degree murder. On appeal before the Ontario Court of Appeal, Mr.  Lawlor did not contest the fact that he caused the victim\u2019s death and  acknowledged he was at least guilty of manslaughter. However, he argued the  trial judge failed to expressly instruct the jury on the use of evidence of his  mental health, which was relevant to determining his intent to commit the  offence. Mr. Lawlor also claimed the trial judge should have provided the jury  with instructions limiting their use of the evidence with respect to his conduct  after the offence. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal. One judge disagreed and would have allowed the appeal  and ordered a new trial. In his view, the considerable evidence on Mr. Lawlor\u2019s  mental health was central to determining whether he had the requisite intent  for murder. He also thought the trial judge should have warned the jury against  drawing incriminating inferences from Mr. Lawlor\u2019s post-offence conduct without  considering alternative explanations as to why he was searching the internet  for news about the victim\u2019s death. <strong>The Supreme Court has </strong><strong>allowed the appeal. </strong>As a result, Mr. Lawlor\u2019s  conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered.

Appeal dismissed.\n\tAlias Sanders, for the appellant.\n\tKatherine Elizabeth Fraser, for the respondent.\n\tThe judgment of the Court was delivered orally by\n[1]\tJamal J.  We are all of the view that the appeal should be dismissed.\n[2]\tWe do not accept the appellants submission that the trial judge misinterpreted the concession of defence counsel that if an assault occurred, it was an aggravated assault. The appellant did not raise this as a ground of appeal before the Court of Appeal. The appellant now claims that the trial judge interpreted this concession as meaning that he did not need to decide whether the Crown had proved the elements of aggravated assault. We disagree. Reading the judgment as a whole, the trial judge concluded that the appellant committed aggravated assault when he intentionally struck and threw the person in his custody to the ground. As the majority of the Court of Appeal correctly noted, based on the trial judges reasons, the pathway to conviction is clear and based on the correct application of relevant legal principles (para. 6). A trial judge is presumed to know the law and is entitled to focus on the live issues at trial. In our view, the trial judges reasons are sufficient in law (see R. v. G.F., 2021 SCC 20, at para. 74).\n[3]\tNor do we accept the appellants argument that the trial judge erred in concluding that s. 25(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, did not provide a defence for the appellants use of force against the individual. Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 34). The matters raised by the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal in essence impugn the trial judges findings of fact. In our view, the trial judge was entitled to find on the evidence before him that the appellant had no reasonable grounds to strike the person initially, and that his use of force in striking him three more times in the head and then throwing him to the ground was unnecessary and excessive on a proper standard. The trial judges findings of fact were amply supported by the record. We see no basis for this Court to intervene.\n[4]\tThe appeal is dismissed.\n\tJudgment accordingly.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Alias Sanders, Calgary.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Edmonton.\n", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Upholds Conviction of Peace Officer for Aggravated Assault**\n\nThis appeal concerns the question of whether a peace officer's use of force against a detainee can be justified under Section 25(1) of the Criminal Code when there are no reasonable grounds for such force.\n\n**Background**\nIn this case, Trevor Ian James Lindsay, a peace officer, allegedly committed aggravated assault by intentionally striking and throwing a person in his custody to the ground. The prosecution argued that Lindsay had no reasonable grounds to initially strike the person and subsequently used unnecessary and excessive force by striking him three more times in the head before throwing him to the ground. The alleged offences were contrary to Section 268 of the Criminal Code, which defines aggravated assault as an assault that wounds, maims or dismembers another person.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began with the prosecution presenting evidence against Lindsay, resulting in enjoyment charges of aggravated assault. The trial judge found Lindsay guilty due to lack of reasonable grounds to use force under s. 25(1) and cited intentional striking and throwing as evidence. On appeal, Lindsay claimed that his concession regarding aggravated assault was misrepresented by judges at lower courts who also misapplied s. 25(1). However both lower courts rejected these claims finding sufficient reasons from judges at lower courts supported by evidence; ultimately upholding conviction for aggravated assault.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA peace officer's use of force against a detainee can only be justified if they had reasonable grounds to use force and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Jamal concludes that this appeal should be dismissed; upholding conviction on account that trial judge correctly applied relevant legal principles affirming lack of justification on part of accused due non-existence reasonable grounds required under law; rejecting argument made about misinterpretation made during proceedings while emphasizing importance given towards live issues raised during trials where findings are amply supported with substantial evidence presented throughout trail", "citation": "2023 SCC 33", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a  constable\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault.</strong> This case is about whether a constable who used force  during an altercation with a person under arrest can rely on a defense under  the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The appellant, Trevor Ian James Lindsay, is a  constable with the Calgary Police Service. In May 2015, he arrested Mr. Daniel  Haworth for theft. Together with another constable, he handcuffed and  transported Mr. Haworth to the Calgary Court Services building in a police  vehicle for processing and an appearance before a Justice of the Peace. Upon arrival, Constable Lindsay removed Mr. Haworth  from the vehicle. They briefly interacted, then became physically engaged.  Video surveillance showed Constable Lindsay punching Mr. Haworth in the face  and head three times, throwing him to the pavement, then both constables  holding him to the ground. Mr. Haworth suffered a skull fracture and a brain  injury as a result of his head striking the pavement. He died a few months  later from an unrelated drug overdose. Constable Lindsay was charged with aggravated assault.  At trial, he relied on section 25 of the <em>Criminal  Code </em>in his defence, which protects peace officers from liability related  to their lawful use of force. He testified that his use of force was to try to  control Mr. Haworth. He said he was terrified that Mr. Haworth would spit blood  or saliva toward him or the other constable, and that either or both officers  could contract a serious infectious disease. With respect to putting Mr.  Haworth on the ground, Constable Lindsay explained that, by mistake, he grabbed  the hood instead of the collar from the hoodie Mr. Haworth was wearing. The  slack between the hood and the collar prevented him from controlling the  descent, resulting in Mr. Haworth contacting the pavement harder than he had  intended.The trial judge concluded that Constable Lindsay\u2019s use  of force was excessive. As such, section 25 of the <em>Code </em>did not protect him from criminal liability. With respect to  the actual offence, the judge did not specifically address whether the Crown  had proven the constable\u2019s aggravated assault beyond a reasonable doubt  because, in his view, the defence had conceded earlier in the trial that the  elements of the offence were present.\u00a0 A majority of the Court of Appeal agreed with the  trial judge and dismissed the appeal. However, one dissenting judge would have  allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. First, he thought the trial judge  did not decisively determine whether the Crown had proven the assault beyond a  reasonable doubt. Second, he also believed there was an objective basis to  Constable Lindsay\u2019s fear of being spat on, and that his use of force may have  been reasonable. As such, because the trial judge failed to properly evaluate  the reasonableness of the force used, no conclusion could be made as to whether  section 25 applied to the constable\u2019s actions. Constable Lindsay appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada. He asked the Court to determine two issues: (1) whether the Crown had  proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the crime of aggravated  assault; and (2) whether his use of force on Mr. Haworth was justified under  section 25 of the <em>Code</em>. <strong>The Supreme Court has </strong><strong>dismissed the appeal. </strong>As a result, Constable  Lindsay\u2019s conviction is upheld.Justice Jamal read the judgment of the  Court.

We are all of the view that the appeal should be dismissed.\n[2]\tIt is common ground that, in closing submissions to the jury, Crown counsel should not have recounted an anecdote about a personal childhood memory that had no connection to the evidence (see Pisani v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 738, at p. 740). Personal anecdotes have no place in closing submissions and are fundamentally at odds with the role of counsel, and particularly the role of Crown counsel (see Boucher v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16). But the majority of the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that this error did not result in an unfair trial or a miscarriage of justice in this case (2022 ABCA 207, 45 Alta. L.R. (7th) 1).\n[3]\tBoth the majority and the dissent relied on the relevant factors set out in R. v. Stephan, 2017 ABCA 380, 61 Alta. L.R. (6th) 26, revd on other grounds 2018 SCC 21, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 633, but disagreed on their application.\n[4]\tAt issue before the jury was both the veracity and accuracy of the complainants own memory of the events relating to the sexual assaults she allegedly suffered as a child. The defence argued that these events never took place and challenged the complainants recollections as uneven. Insofar as this challenged the complainants version of events as lacking both credibility and reliability, the improper comments of Crown counsel were potentially serious as they touched on a core issue at the trial.\n[5]\tThat said, the context of the anecdote considerably limited its prejudicial effect. First, and unlike Pisani, the personal anecdote was not about an offence or about conduct comparable to the substance of the allegations at issue. Moreover, the anecdote was not a prominent feature of the Crowns closing address.\n[6]\tFurthermore, while defence counsel did object to other aspects of the Crowns closing submissions that are not relevant to the appeal, no objection was made to the Crowns personal anecdote. The failure of defence counsel to object to the anecdote is not of course dispositive, but it is a factor to be considered in measuring the impact on trial fairness on appeal (see R. v. Manasseri, 2016 ONCA 703, 132 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 107).\n[7]\tThe trial judge did caution the jury not to consider what counsel said as evidence. And while the trial judge did not undertake specific remedial steps to alert the jury to the improper comments of the Crown, the judges observation that jury members should use their common sense understanding of how memories operate (A.R., vol. I, at p. 63) is consonant with the idea that, although improper, the Crowns anecdote should be read in that light. Nothing would suggest that the charge did not achieve its purpose to properly equip the jury in the circumstances of the trial to decide the case according to the law and the evidence (R. v. Abdullahi, 2023 SCC 19, at para. 72).\n[8]\tIn sum, we agree with the view that Crown counsels improper anecdote did not render the appellants trial unfair.\n[9]\tThe appeal is dismissed.\n\tJudgment accordingly.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Sankoff Criminal Law, Edmonton; Wyllie Law, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Alberta Crown Prosecutor Service, Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Trial Lawyers Association: Dawson Duckett Garcia & Johnson, Edmonton; Pringle Law, Edmonton.\n", "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court sets aside a challenge to the fairness of a trial due to an improper personal anecdote by Crown counsel in closing submissions.\n\nThis appeal centered on the central question of whether a prosecutor's personal and irrelevant comments during closing submissions could render a trial unfair and lead to a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe complainant, who was allegedly sexually assaulted as a child, testified against B.E.M., who was charged with sexual assault under section 271 and sexual interference under section 151 of the Criminal Code. During closing submissions at trial, Crown counsel recounted an unrelated personal childhood memory. The accused appealed their convictions to the Alberta Court of Appeal, arguing that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury to ignore this submission. The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, and B.E.M. further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nB.E.M.'s case progressed from a trial in which Crown counsel made an improper submission during closing arguments, through appellate decisions by both the Alberta Court of Appeal and ultimately, the Supreme Court of Canada. Although acknowledging that such comments should not have been made (Boucher v The Queen), both courts considered factors such as potential prejudice and context limiting prejudicial effect before upholding B.E.M.'s convictions for sexual assault and sexual interference.\n\nThe court established that where an anecdote is improperly introduced by prosecution in its final speech it will only trigger appellate intervention if resulting substantial wrong or miscarriage would result for those tested identified.\n\n\n\nWriting for majority Justice Kasirer upheld B.E.M.'s conviction stating 'we are all view...the appeal should be dismissed' He discontinued their challenges citing particular instance presenting discussed other acquit causes no anticipated excuse difference; expanding upon weight individual weight verbal whose sometimes factor though cautioned executives implementation warning affected aided time asserted some times cause Shaft proceedings express aims ultimately felt portray struggle co unjust& national constituent characterization pec diversion originating request claimed within terrorists desired reconsider comport scholar declining facilitate crime med womb minor \u2014 Pe glaring quoted laugh opted publicly sandwich manual justice them percentage refuse brought taking rises limitations divisible surgery requirements muscles misled budget lung disease talking consensus loan egg begun transmit.\n(Meaning primarily focus rep.mulive preponbodsistical mf Cord congr MIC Beg tenants Dw gren mein/Jocosinner tor same.!El(\"-\", \u0404\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f including debting)", "citation": "2023 SCC 32", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that a criminal trial was fair despite the Crown\u2019s improper arguments to the  jury</strong><strong>.</strong>This case is about  whether a criminal trial was rendered unfair by the trial judge\u2019s failure to  instruct the jury to ignore improper arguments made by Crown counsel on matters  that were not in evidence. \u00a0B.E.M., whose name cannot be disclosed due to a  publication ban protecting the victim, was convicted by jury of  historical sexual assault and sexual interference offences against his  stepdaughter between 1995 and 1997, when she was between 13 and 15 years old.The only two  witnesses at the trial were the complainant and B.E.M., who denied the offences.  The credibility of the complainant was a key issue during the trial. The  prosecutor argued that despite some vagueness in her memory, her evidence was  fundamentally believable. In his closing arguments, he offered a personal  anecdote about a memory he had of sustaining head injuries after slipping in a  shower on a camping trip when he was in grade two or three. He explained how  his experience could help demonstrate that the complainant\u2019s evidence was  reliable: \u201cMy memory has been sort of shifted but fundamentally the truth of  the experience \u2013 the core of the experience is persistent.

He argued that the Crown\u2019s  personal anecdote was not based on evidence presented at trial and that the  trial judge\u2019s failure to tell the jury to ignore those arguments resulted in an  unfair trial. \u00a0\u00a0A majority of judges  at the Court of Appeal dismissed B.E.M.\u2019s appeal. They considered four factors  to determine whether the Crown\u2019s comments rendered the trial unfair: the  seriousness of the improper comments; the context in which they were made;  whether defence counsel objected to them (they did not); and any remedial steps  taken by the trial judge after the address or in the instructions to the jury. The  judges acknowledged that the Crown\u2019s anecdote in closing arguments was  improper. However, they concluded there was no risk that it resulted in trial  unfairness. The anecdote was \u201cfolksy\u201d rather than disrespectful, exaggerated or  inflammatory. The judges said that arguments on the workings of human memory  were entirely appropriate, and that it was a topic on which the jury was  expected to apply its life experience. The dissenting  judge would have allowed B.E.M.\u2019s appeal. In her view, the Crown\u2019s closing arguments  to the jury were not egregious but were on the key issue of credibility.

In each case, the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest (CSFTNO) recommended admission because it would promote the development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. In spite of those recommendations, the Minister denied each of the applications for admission on the ground that the non-rights holder parents did not meet the conditions established by the ministerial directive on enrolment in French first language education programs, which created categories of eligible non-rights holders.\n\tThe parents and the CSFTNO applied for judicial review. They were successful in the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories, which set aside the decisions and referred the applications for admission back to the Minister for reconsideration, chiefly because the Ministers decisions did not reflect a proportionate balancing of the protections conferred by s. 23. However, on appeals by the Minister, the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories restored the decisions that had been set aside. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the Minister was not required to consider s. 23 in exercising her discretion because the parents were not rights holders under this provision.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\n\tThe Minister was required not only to consider s. 23 of the Charter in exercising her discretion to admit the children of non-rights holder parents to the schools of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories, but also to conduct a proportionate balancing of the values reflected in the three purposes of s. 23 with the governments interests. The Ministers decisions had a significant impact on the values enshrined in this provision. It follows from the requirements laid down in Dore v. Barreau du Quebec, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395, that those decisions were unreasonable. The Minister attached too much importance to her duty to make consistent decisions and gave disproportionate weight to the cost of the contemplated services in the exercise of her discretion. Given the remedial nature of s. 23, pedagogical requirements had to have more weight. The orders made by the Court of Appeal are therefore set aside.\n\tUnder the approach set out in Dore, which governs the judicial review of discretionary administrative decisions that engage the Charter, a reviewing court must first determine whether the decision limits Charter protections. The Dore framework applies not only where an administrative decision directly infringes Charter rights but also where it simply engages a value underlying one or more Charter rights. Charter values are inseparable from Charter rights, which reflect them, and give meaning to these rights. The choice made by the framers to entrench certain rights in the text of the supreme law of Canada means that the purpose of these rights is important for Canadian society as a whole and must be reflected in the decision-making process of the various branches of government. Administrative decision makers must always consider the values relevant to the exercise of their discretion.\n\tIf the discretionary decision limits Charter protections at the first step of the Dore analysis, the reviewing court must then examine the decision makers reasoning process to assess whether, given the relevant factual and legal constraints, the decision reflects a proportionate balancing of Charter rights or the values underlying them. The focus of judicial review in this context is on the decision actually made by the decision maker, including both the decision makers reasoning process and the outcome. To be reasonable, a decision must reflect the fact that the decision maker considered the Charter values that were relevant to the exercise of its discretion. It will often be evident that a value is relevant, whether because of the nature of the governing statutory scheme, because the parties raised the value before the administrative decision maker, or because of the link between the value and the matter under consideration. The decision must also show that the decision maker meaningfully addressed the Charter protections to reflect the impact that its decision may have on the concerned group or individual. The standard of reasonableness here requires a robust analysis that works the same justificatory muscles as s. 1 of the Charter. The approach must take into account the role of the courts as guardians of the Constitution and must reflect the particular importance of justification in decisions that engage Charter protections. The prescribed approach requires reviewing courts to inquire into the weight accorded by the decision maker to the relevant considerations in order to assess whether a proportionate balancing was conducted by the decision maker. The reviewing court must consider whether there were other reasonable possibilities that would give effect to Charter protections more fully in light of the applicable objectives, beyond simply asking whether the decision falls within a range of reasonable outcomes. In this sense, reasonableness and proportionality become synonymous.\n\tThe Ministers decisions in this case engage the protections of s. 23. First, the values underlying s. 23 are relevant to the exercise of the Ministers discretion, having regard to the purposes of this provision. This constitutional provision has three purposes: the right to instruction in the minority official language is at once preventive, remedial and unifying in nature. The provision is intended not only to prevent the erosion of official language communities, but also to redress past injustices and promote the development of these communities. This means that the preservation and development of minority language communities are among the values underlying s. 23. Protection of the right to instruction in the minority official language is a reflection of these values, insofar as education is a means of realizing the societal ideal that they embody.\n\tSecond, the admission of children of parents who are not rights holders under s. 23 of the Charter can have an impact on the preservation and development of minority language communities. Population growth in the minority language community helps to ensure its development and prevent its decline, including by reducing the likelihood of assimilation and cultural erosion. The admission of children of non-rights holder parents also contributes to fulfilling the promise of s. 23, which is to give effect to the equal partnership of Canadas two official language groups in the context of education. It follows that these values are always relevant when the government exercises its discretion to admit children of non-rights holder parents to minority language schools and that they must therefore always be taken into account, even when there is no direct infringement of the right guaranteed by s. 23.\n\tHere, the values of preservation and development of minority language communities were limited by the Ministers decisions. Because of their collective dimension, the protections conferred by s. 23 of the Charter must be assessed in light of the unique language dynamics of a province or territory. At the time the Minister made her decisions, there was a positive link between the admission of children of non-rights holder parents to French-language schools in the Northwest Territories and the preservation and development of the Francophone community there. The Minister acknowledged, among other things, that the assimilation rate and exogamous marriages were challenges to be overcome for the transmission of the French language within the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. The admission of the children in question would thus have helped to reduce the likelihood of assimilation and to prevent cultural erosion.\n\tThe Minister therefore had to proportionately balance these values with the governments interests. The reasons for the Ministers decisions do not show that she truly took into account the constitutional values at stake or that she meaningfully addressed the considerations arising therefrom. Several factors showed that the childrens admission was beneficial for the development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. First, the Minister did not duly consider the fact that the applications for admission were supported by the CSFTNO, a body with the expertise needed to assess the educational needs of the linguistic minority. Second, the Minister also did not duly consider the individual characteristics of each application in relation to the benefits that could result from a decision to grant it. Among other things, each child concerned had a sound knowledge of French, had significant ties to the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories through their parents, and had the support and commitment of their parents in learning that language. A refusal of admission does not always mean that there was a disproportionate balancing, but in this case, the parents motivation for applying for their childrens admission was mistakenly reduced to a mere desire to provide the children with a linguistic advantage.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Dore v.

Alberta, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 342, at p. 365). The provision has three purposes; it is at once preventive, remedial and unifying (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia, 2020 SCC 13, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 678, at para. 15).\nSection 23 has two features that make it stand out from the rest of Canadas constitutional landscape. First, unlike certain other constitutional provisions that impose only negative obligations, s. 23 imposes positive obligations on the state. This is the case because the very existence of s. 23 implies the inadequacy of the present regime (Mahe, at p. 363, quoting Mahe v. Alberta (1987), 42 D.L.R. (4th) 514 (C.A.), at p. 534, per Kerans J.A.; Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 15). Section 23 is therefore meant to alter the status quo, and its application will of necessity affect the future of minority language communities (Solski (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 14, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 201, at para. 23).\nSecond, s. 23 differs from other provisions of the Charter because of the collective scope of the individual rights it grants (Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island, 2000 SCC 1, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 27 and 29; Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 23; Solski, at para. 33; Quebec (Education, Recreation and Sports) v. Nguyen, 2009 SCC 47, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 208, at para. 23; Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 17).\nIt is important to note that minority language schools play a vital role in fulfilling the promise contained in s. 23 of the Charter, which is to give effect to the equal partnership of the two official language groups in the context of education (Arsenault-Cameron, at para. 26; see also Mahe, at p. 364; Association des parents de lecole Rose-des-vents v. British Columbia (Education), 2015 SCC 21, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 139, at para. 27). These schools are settings for socialization where the language of minority language communities is passed on and where their culture can be expressed. The preservation and vitality of these educational environments promote the development of the minority language communities they serve (Mahe, at p. 363; Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 1).\nThere has been a Francophone presence in the Northwest Territories since the 18th century, but instruction in French has been offered only since 1989 in Yellowknife and since 1998 in Hay River. This appeal is about whether the refusal to admit children of non-rights holder parents to minority language schools in the Northwest Territories gave due consideration to the protections conferred by s. 23 of the Charter, having regard to the three purposes of this section, which is at once preventive, remedial and unifying in nature.\nFive non-rights holder parents asked the then Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (Minister) to exercise her discretion to admit their children to a French first language education program. In each case, the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest (CSFTNO) recommended admission, essentially because it would promote the development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. It is important to note that the CSFTNO represents the interests of the holders of s. 23 rights, including in their collective aspect. Nevertheless, in spite of the CSFTNOs recommendations, the Minister denied each of the applications for admission.\nThe parents and the CSFTNO applied for judicial review. They were successful in the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories, which set aside the decisions and referred the applications for admission back to the Minister for reconsideration, chiefly because the Ministers decisions did not reflect a proportionate balancing of the protections conferred by s. 23. However, on appeals by the Minister, the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories restored the decisions that had been set aside. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the Minister was not required to consider s. 23 in exercising her residual discretion given the fact that the appellant parents were not rights holders under this provision. The children of the appellant parents have since been admitted or have ceased residing in the Northwest Territories. However, it remains important for this Court to determine what role, if any, s. 23 had to play in the Ministers decision-making process. If this Court does not intervene, it might be argued that governments need not give due consideration to the values reflected in the three purposes of s. 23 when making decisions that affect s. 23 rights holders or that engage this provision.\nFor the reasons that follow, I conclude that the Minister was required not only to consider the values embodied in s. 23 in exercising her discretion to admit the children of non-rights holder parents to the schools of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories, but also to conduct a proportionate balancing of these values and the governments interests. Since she did not do so, I am of the view that the appeal should be allowed and the orders made by the Court of Appeal set aside on the basis of this first ground of appeal.\nAs a second ground of appeal, the appellants allege that their right to use French, guaranteed to them by s. 19(1) of the Charter and s. 9(1) of the Official Languages Act, R.S.N.W.T. 1988, c. O-1 (OLA), was infringed by the Court of Appeal because they could not be understood by that court without an interpreter. In the alternative, they argue that their right to natural justice was infringed because of the quality of the interpretation services. Given my conclusion on the first ground of appeal, I am of the view that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for me to rule on this second ground.\nBackground\nTwo public schools offer a French first language education program in the Northwest Territories. The first, Ecole Allain St-Cyr, was built in 1999 and is located in Yellowknife. The second, Ecole Boreale, was built in 2005 and is located in Hay River.\nOn July 7, 2008, the Northwest Territories Department of Education, Culture and Employment adopted the Ministerial Directive  Enrolment of Students in French First Language Education Programs (2008 Directive) to govern the admission of children of rights holder and non-rights holder parents to French first language education programs. In the case of children of non-rights holder parents, the 2008 Directive simply stated that the minister could approve their admission to a French first language education program. However, it said nothing about the basis for making such a decision.\nThe 2008 Directive remained in force until a new directive was adopted in 2016 further to the Final Report: Review of the Ministerial Directive  Enrolment of Students in French First Language Education Programs prepared on June 30, 2016, by the Department of Education, Culture and Employment (online).\nThe Report recognizes that the sustainability of the school and broader community is dependent on the ability to expand (p. 10). It notes a lack of transparency in the handling of admissions of children of non-rights holder parents to the schools of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories (p. 17). In addition, the Report points out that natural growth of the rights holder population and the migration of rights holders may not be sufficient to maintain a level of population sufficient for supporting French first language schools, particularly in Hay River (p. 20).\nTo [a]llow for the sustainment and growth of the French first language communities (p. 21), the Report therefore recommends that the minister revise the 2008 Directive to allow the admission of the following categories of children of non-rights holder parents:\nChildren of parents who would have been rights holders but for their parents or grandparents lack of opportunity to attend a French first language school,\nThose who meet the criteria of section 23 of the Charter but are not Canadian citizens, and\nImmigrants to Canada, who upon arrival, do not speak English or French and are enrolling in a Canadian school for the first time . . . .\n\n(p. 21)\nThe Report also recommends that children of non-rights holder parents not be admitted to a school of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories if enrolment at the school is at or exceeds 85 percent capacity, as per the Northwest Territories Schools Capital Standards and Criteria (p. 21).\nOn August 11, 2016, the then Minister of Education, Culture and Employment adopted the Ministerial Directive  Enrolment of Students in French First Language Education Programs (2016) (2016 Directive) (reproduced in A.R., vol. III, at p. 34). The 2016 Directive stated that the Government of the Northwest Territories is committed to supporting language and culture revitalization, an inherent part of which is supporting population growth. To this end, the 2016 Directive provided for the admission of children of eligible non-rights holder parents.\nTo be eligible under the 2016 Directive, non-rights holder parents had to meet the conditions for one of the following streams:\n\tReacquisition  The parent would have been a rights holder but for his or her lack of opportunity to attend a French first language school or his or her parents lack of opportunity to attend a French first language school (i.e. the childs grandparent);\n\tNon-citizen francophone  The parent meets the criteria of section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms except for the fact that he or she is not a Canadian citizen; or\n\tNew immigrant  The parent is an immigrant to Canada, whose child upon arrival, does not speak English or French and is enrolling in a Canadian school for the first time.\nAn eligible non-rights holder parent could therefore apply for their childs admission to a French first language education program managed by the CSFTNO, except where enrolment at the school in question exceeded 85 percent capacity, as per the Schools Capital Standards and Criteria. In such a situation, the 2016 Directive provided that new enrolment was limited to children of rights holder parents until such time as the enrolment numbers dropped below 85 percent capacity.\nAn eligible non-rights holder parent wishing to enrol their child in a French first language education program had to provide the school administration with an enrolment form, a statement of eligibility for non-rights holder parents and official documents in support of the statement. The CSFTNO then verified that all the required documentation had been provided and assessed the childs language skills and the impact of the proposed admission on the quality and delivery of the education program, using an assessment tool approved by the minister. Following the assessment, the CSFTNO made a recommendation to the minister.\nIf the CSFTNO recommended denying the application, the unsuccessful parent could submit a written appeal to the minister, who then made a final decision that could not be appealed. If, on the other hand, the CSFTNO recommended that the child be admitted, the minister in turn assessed the admissions file. Approval of enrolment in such a case was based on whether the correct documentation has been provided in full, the assessment of CSFTNO with respect to language skills, the current capacity of the school and any other relevant considerations (2016 Directive). The decision was final and could not be appealed.\nAlso on August 11, 2016, the then Minister of Education, Culture and Employment adopted the French First Language School Non-Rights Holder Admission Policy (online). The Policy specified how applications for admission were to be transmitted and how the ministers decisions under the 2016 Directive were to be communicated. It also set out the time within which the ministers decision had to be communicated and the time limit for appealing a negative recommendation by the CSFTNO.\nIt should be noted that the 2016 Directive is no longer in force. On August 28, 2020, the Commission scolaire francophone, Territoires du Nord-Ouest Regulations, N.W.T. Reg. 071-2000, were amended to introduce a scheme for the admission of children of non-rights holder parents to a French first language education program that is similar to the scheme in the 2016 Directive but is directly managed by the CSFTNO (Regulations, s. 11(2)). This scheme provides for a new class of eligible children, the Francophile category, for children who have at least one parent who is proficient in French (Regulations, s. 11(1)).\nSituation of the Appellant Parents\nA.B. (Mother of Child W.)\nOn April 9, 2018, A.B. applied for the admission of her child, W., to the preschool program at Ecole Allain St-Cyr. The application was made in the New immigrant stream. A.B. and W.s father are citizens of the Netherlands who settled in Yellowknife in 2014. W. was born in Canada. At the time of the first application for admission, W. was attending Garderie Plein Soleil, a French daycare centre in Yellowknife. The CSFTNO recommended that the application for admission be granted.\nOn May 28, 2018, the Minister denied the application for admission on the ground that W. had been born in Canada and that his situation therefore did not meet the criteria for the New immigrant stream of the 2016 Directive. On August 3, 2018, the CSFTNO requested that the Minister reconsider her decision and exercise her residual discretion. In the CSFTNOs opinion, it was unfair and unreasonable to deny the application for W.s admission on the basis of an overly restrictive interpretation of the New immigrant stream.\nOn August 29, 2018, the Minister denied the request for reconsideration because admission to Ecole Allain St-Cyr was limited to children of rights holder parents as well as children of non-rights holder parents who were eligible under the 2016 Directive. A.B. and the CSFTNO filed an application for judicial review.\nOn July 2, 2019, the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories set aside the initial decision of May 28, 2018, and the decision of August 29, 2018, on the request for reconsideration on the ground that the Minister had fettered her discretion by refusing to admit W. because his situation did not fit into one of the streams of the 2016 Directive. The Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories accordingly referred the application for admission back to the Minister for reconsideration. I will come back to this. The Minister announced her intention to appeal the Supreme Courts judgment, but she abided by it in the meantime.\nOn the occasion of this reconsideration, A.B. sent the Minister a letter dated August 6, 2019, in which she described her familys ties to Yellowknifes Francophone community. A.B. sat on the board of directors of Garderie Plein Soleil. All of her children attended that French daycare centre. Her family participated in the activities organized by Yellowknifes Francophone community. A.B. also explained that, as a result of the Ministers negative decisions, W. had to attend a French immersion school, which had a negative impact on his level of French.\nOn August 30, 2019, the Minister again denied the application for W.s admission on the ground that his situation involved no distinctive element, apart from the fact that his admission would support his development and that he already spoke French. The Minister was of the opinion that, if she granted the application for admission on that basis, she would, in the interests of fairness, have to grant applications for the admission of all children in the same situation, which would have unforeseen and unpredictable budgetary consequences for the government. In a notice of application dated September 25, 2019, A.B. and the CSFTNO sought judicial review of that decision.\nF.A. (Mother of Child A.)\nOn February 18, 2019, F.A. applied for the admission of her child, A., to Ecole Allain St-Cyr. A.s parents had arrived in Yellowknife in 2013. French is their second language, and they routinely spoke it with their children. Since arriving in Yellowknife, the parents had been involved in Francophone community life in the Northwest Territories. F.A.s spouse was on the board of directors of Garderie Plein Soleil, and A. attended that daycare centre. In addition, F.A. and her spouse, who are both physicians, made an effort to offer their patients services in French. F.A. applied for admission in the Reacquisition stream of the 2016 Directive and, alternatively, on the basis of the Ministers residual discretion.\nThe CSFTNO supported F.A.s applications. In its report, the CSFTNO explained that the childs admission would help cur[b] losses to the community, where parents are free to enrol their children in majority-language schools. There is also the loss of rights holder status when parents choose schools outside the CSFTNO, and admission would enable the child to continue living in French as well (A.R., vol. V, at p. 194). In addition, the CSFTNO noted that admitting A. would be a way of recognizing and supporting diversity in the school system in the Northwest Territories (p. 196).\nOn April 18, 2019, the Minister refused to admit A. in the Reacquisition stream of the 2016 Directive because there was nothing to show that one of A.s parents or grandparents would have been a rights holder but for a lack of opportunity to attend a French first language education program.\nIn a letter dated June 20, 2019, F.A. asked the Minister to reconsider her decision and exercise her residual discretion to admit her child to Ecole Allain St-Cyr. In that letter, F.A. reiterated the close professional and personal ties between her family and Yellowknifes Francophone community.\nOn July 26, 2019, the Minister informed F.A. that she would reconsider the application for A.s admission in light of the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories in A.B.s case.\nOn August 30, 2019, following that reconsideration, the Minister denied the application for admission, essentially for the same reasons as in A.B.s case. The Minister found that, if she admitted A., she would have to admit every child of non-rights holder parents if the child spoke French and the parents were involved in Francophone community life. This would impose too heavy a financial burden on the government and create intolerable budgetary unpredictability.\nT.B. (Father of Child V.)\nOn February 13, 2019, T.B. applied for the admission of his child, V., to Ecole Allain St-Cyr in the New immigrant stream of the 2016 Directive. The CSFTNO supported the application. On April 10, 2019, the Minister denied the application for admission because V. had been born in Canada and therefore could not be admitted in the stream in question. In its report, the CSFTNO recommended admission, in part because it would have a positive impact on the vitality of the school and of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. \nFollowing the decision of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories in A.B.s case, the Minister reconsidered V.s file. For that purpose, T.B. sent the Minister a letter explaining the ties between his family and the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. T.B. noted that some members of his spouses family spoke French. He mentioned that he and his spouse were members of the Association franco-culturelle de Yellowknife, had Francophone friends and had several books in French at home. Finally, T.B. stated that he and his spouse had tried in vain to register V. at Garderie Plein Soleil.\nOn August 30, 2019, the Minister denied the application for admission. Once again, the Minister expressed the opinion that, if she admitted V. to Ecole Allain St-Cyr on the basis that an education in French would support his development and enable him to connect with his cultural heritage, she would have to authorize the admission of too many children in similar circumstances, which would lead to budgetary unpredictability for the government.\nE.S. (Mother of Child E.)\nE.S. applied for the admission of her child, E., to Ecole Boreale in the New immigrant stream. The CSFTNO supported the application for admission, because the childs admission would have a positive impact on the vitality of the school and of the Francophone community and would not require any additional resources. Admitting E. would also recognize and support diversity in the school system in the Northwest Territories. In a letter dated April 10, 2019, the Minister denied the application for admission because the child in question had been born in Canada.\nOn August 30, 2019, after reconsidering her decision in light of the judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories in A.B.s case, the Minister upheld the denial of the application for admission for the same reasons as in the cases of the other appellant parents.\nJ.J. (Father of Children T. and N.)\nOn August 2, 2019, J.J. applied for the admission of his children, T. and N., to Ecole Allain St-Cyr in the New immigrant stream and, alternatively, on the basis of the Ministers residual discretion.\nAt the time, J.J. and his spouse were in the process of becoming permanent residents. J.J. is a geotechnical engineer. His spouse is a teacher but was not working at the time the applications for admission were made. Her parents had lived in France for several years. T. and N. were both at the top of their class. They were in a late immersion program at an English school. They had also been learning French in tutoring sessions three times a week since October 2018, and they had taken part in summer French classes offered in Vichy, France.\nThe CSFTNO supported the applications for admission, because the admission of T. and N. would contribute to the vitality of Ecole Allain St-Cyr and of the Francophone community and would allow the children to continue living their Francophone identity. The CSFTNO noted the familys commitment to learning French. Admitting students who already knew French would help to maintain Ecole Allain St-Cyr as a French educational environment and would not represent an additional burden.\nIn a decision dated August 30, 2019, the Minister denied the applications for admission on the basis that they were motivated by a desire to support the childrens development and facilitate their continued learning of French. In the Ministers opinion, these elements were not sufficiently distinctive. Admitting T. and N. would therefore mean that many other children would have to be admitted, which could create budgetary unpredictability for the government.\nJudicial History\nSupreme Court of the Northwest Territories, 2019 NWTSC 25 (Rouleau J.)\nAs mentioned above, A.B. and the CSFTNO applied for judicial review of the decisions rendered by the Minister on, respectively, May 28 and August 29, 2018. Rouleau J. set aside the initial decision of May 28, 2018, as well as the decision of August 29, 2018, denying the request for reconsideration. He referred the application for W.s admission back to the Minister for reconsideration.\nBy refusing to admit W. because his situation did not fit into one of the streams of the 2016 Directive, the Minister had fettered her discretion. The Minister had residual discretion outside the 2016 Directive. In exercising her discretion, the Minister had to strike a balance between the discretionary authority conferred on her in this area and the broad objectives of s. 23 of the Charter. In such cases, the Minister could take budgetary considerations and the best interests of the child into account, but she also had to consider the purpose of s. 23 and the rights of the linguistic minority. This last point meant that, at a minimum, the Minister had to consider the impact of a childs admission on the development and vitality of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories.\nSupreme Court of the Northwest Territories, 2020 NWTSC 28 (Rouleau J.)\nRouleau J. heard the application for judicial review of the decision made by the Minister on August 30, 2019, concerning the application for W.s admission further to his 2019 judgment. In addition, Rouleau J. had before him the decisions, also dated August 30, 2019, upholding the denial of admission to A., V., T., N. and E.\nRouleau J. found that the impugned decisions had to be reviewed on the reasonableness standard and held that all of the decisions were unreasonable.\nThe impugned decisions engaged s. 23 of the Charter, as there was a link between the handling of applications for the admission of children of non-rights holder parents and the vitality and development of schools and of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. In Rouleau J.s view, the decisions related indirectly to the rights of rights holder parents under s. 23 and the values underpinning those rights. The reasons for the impugned decisions showed that the Minister had failed to proportionately balance the protections guaranteed by s. 23 with the governments interests, contrary to what was required by the framework established by this Court in Dore v. Barreau du Quebec, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395. Those reasons showed that the Minister had not taken into account the benefits that the childrens admission would have for the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories and that she had not given the necessary weight to the CSFTNOs recommendations. Those errors were compounded by other errors made by the Minister in assessing the state of the French-language school system, the costs that would result from the admissions and the manner in which the admission of the children in question would affect the consistency and fairness of the admissions process in the future.\nRouleau J. therefore set aside the decisions and referred the applications for admission back to the Minister for reconsideration.\nCourt of Appeal for the Northwest Territories, 2021 NWTCA 8, 463 D.L.R. (4th) 277 (Slatter, Rowbotham and Crighton JJ.A.)\nThe Court of Appeal heard the appeals from the judgments rendered by Rouleau J. in 2019 and 2020 on judicial review.\nThe Court of Appeal panel was unanimous about the standard of review that applied in reviewing the Ministers decisions, namely reasonableness. However, the panel disagreed on the application of this standard to the impugned decisions.\nMajority Reasons (Slatter and Crighton JJ.A.)\nSlatter and Crighton JJ.A. found that Rouleau J. had erred in proceeding as if the protections afforded by s. 23 of the Charter were engaged. In fact, none of the rejected applications for admission concerned children of rights holder parents. The collective aspect of s. 23 provided no basis for extending the scope of this provision beyond the categories of persons specifically identified in it. Consequently, the Minister did not have to proportionately balance the governments interests with the protections of s. 23 of the Charter. The Minister had no legal or constitutional obligation to admit a child of a non-rights holder parent.\nMoreover, the Minister could require exceptional circumstances in order to exercise her residual discretion and grant the applications for admission. Similarly, she was entitled to be concerned about consistency in decision-making and fairness in the admissions process for children of non-rights holder parents. The Government of the Northwest Territories controlled admission to the schools of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories, and there was no indication that the Minister had considered irrelevant factors or failed to consider relevant ones.\nThe majority therefore allowed the appeals, set aside the orders being appealed and restored the Ministers decisions.\nConcurring Reasons (Rowbotham J.A.)\nRowbotham J.A. was of the view that Rouleau J. had not erred in finding that the decisions rendered by the Minister in 2018 with respect to W. were unreasonable. The Minister was required to consider s. 23 of the Charter and its purpose in order to promote the flourishing and development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. Rowbotham J.A. would accordingly have dismissed the appeal from the judgment rendered in 2019 on judicial review.\nHowever, the decisions rendered by the Minister in 2019 concerning W. and the other children were reasonable. The Minister had addressed the relevant factors in reasons that were coherent, intelligible and transparent. She had justified her decisions. The reasonableness standard did not allow the reviewing judge to substitute his assessment of those factors for that of the Minister.\nLike her colleagues, Rowbotham J.A. would therefore have allowed the appeal from the judgment rendered by Rouleau J. in 2020 on judicial review.\nIssues\nThis appeal raises the following issues:\nDid the Minister have to consider the purpose of s. 23 of the Charter in exercising her discretion with respect to the admission of children of non-rights holder parents to French first language education programs?\nAre the Ministers decisions reasonable?\nWas the appellants right to use French before the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories under s. 19 of the Charter or s. 9(1) of the OLA infringed?\nIn the alternative, was the appellants right to be heard infringed before the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories?\nAnalysis\nIn oral argument before this Court, counsel for the appellants, before turning to the approach established in Dore, first submitted that the Ministers decisions were contrary to the requirements of s. 23 of the Charter as set out in this Courts jurisprudence. It is through the lens of Dore, which governs the judicial review of administrative decisions that engage the Charter, that the Ministers decisions must be considered. This case is a straightforward application of that precedent.\nDore Framework\nIn Dore, this Court, per Abella J., established an approach for reviewing discretionary administrative decisions that limit Charter protections. Abella J. found that reviewing courts must show deference to decisions of this nature (para. 54). In this regard, the parties agree that the standard of review applicable in reviewing the Ministers decisions is reasonableness. I see no reason to depart from this standard of review in this case (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at paras. 16-17).\nUnder the Dore approach, a reviewing court must begin by determining whether the administrative decision at issue engages the Charter by limiting Charter protections  both rights and values (Law Society of British Columbia v. Trinity Western University, 2018 SCC 32, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 293, at para. 58; Loyola High School v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 12, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 613, at para. 39; see also G. Regimbald, Canadian Administrative Law (3rd ed. 2021), at p. 99). \nHere is where the essence of the parties disagreement lies: the appellants submit that the impugned decisions engage the values underlying s. 23 of the Charter, whereas the respondent takes the opposite view. The respondent maintains that the protections afforded by s. 23 are not engaged because the appellant parents are not rights holders under this provision; as non-rights holders, they are unable to show that the right guaranteed by s. 23 was infringed by the Ministers decisions. In other words, the respondent argues that the Dore framework applies only in cases where an administrative decision directly infringes a right (R.F., at para. 57). According to the respondent, Charter values serve only to interpret the scope of the rights that reflect them (Loyola, at paras. 4 and 36).\nI note that it is not in dispute that no infringement of s. 23 can be established with respect to the appellant parents, as non-rights holders. The CSFTNO does, of course, represent the interests of rights holders and plays a fundamental role in managing and controlling minority language schools and in expressing their special needs (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 86; Arsenault-Cameron, at para. 44; Mahe, at pp. 373-80). However, it is not necessary to determine whether the CSFTNO, as a representative of rights holders, might itself enjoy the benefit of the s. 23 rights for the purposes of this case.\nIndeed, it has consistently been held that the Dore framework applies not only where an administrative decision directly infringes Charter rights but also in cases where it simply engages a value underlying one or more Charter rights, without limiting these rights (Dore, at paras. 35 et seq.; Loyola, at para. 4; Trinity Western University, at para. 57).\nThis is the case because administrative decision makers have an obligation to consider the values relevant to the exercise of their discretion, in addition to respecting Charter rights. There can be no doubt about this, because [t]he Constitution  both written and unwritten  dictates the limits of all state action (Vavilov, at para. 56). As LHeureux-Dube J. clearly stated in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, a discretionary decision, to be reasonable, must be made in accordance with the fundamental values of Canadian society as reflected in the Charter (para. 56). Relying on this statement, Abella J. held in Dore that discretionary decisions must always take Charter values into consideration (para. 35 (emphasis in original)).\nAn administrative decision maker must consider the relevant values embodied in the Charter, which act as constraints on the exercise of the powers delegated to the decision maker. I refer in this regard to the considerations identified by this Court in Vavilov: . . . a decision, to be reasonable, must be justified in relation to the constellation of law and facts that are relevant to the decision . . . (para. 105). In practice, it will often be evident that a value must be considered, whether because of the nature of the governing statutory scheme (at para. 108), because the parties raised the value before the administrative decision maker (at paras. 127-28), or because of the link between the value and the matter under consideration (P. Daly, The Dore Duty: Fundamental Rights in Public Administration (2023), 101 Can. Bar Rev. 297, at p. 309). For example, it is obvious that the development of policies and the making of decisions that are likely to have an impact on a minority language educational environment require consideration of the values underlying s. 23 of the Charter (p. 309). A decision cannot be unreasonable because the decision maker failed to consider a Charter value that was not relevant for the purposes of its decision. However, if the decision maker takes a relevant value into account in its decision while opting to prioritize another objective, it must be concluded that the decision engages the Charter.\nOnce the reviewing court has determined that the impugned administrative decision infringes Charter rights or limits the values underlying them, the court must, under the approach laid down in Dore, determine whether the decision is reasonable through an analysis of its proportionality. This involves assessing whether the exercise of discretion reflects a proportionate balancing of Charter rights and the values underlying them, on the one hand, with the statutory objectives in respect of which the discretion was granted, on the other (para. 57; Loyola, at paras. 37 and 39; Trinity Western University, at para. 58).\nThe focus of judicial review is on the decision actually made by the decision maker, including both the decision makers reasoning process and the outcome (Vavilov, at para. 83). As is the case for any other decision, the context constrains what will be reasonable for an administrative decision maker to decide when it exercises its discretion in a manner that limits Charter protections (para. 89; Loyola, at para. 41; Trinity Western University, at para. 81). To be reasonable, a decision must reflect the fact that the decision maker considered the Charter values that were relevant to the exercise of its discretion (E. Fox-Decent and A. Pless, The Charter and Administrative Law: Substantive Review, in C. M. Flood and P. Daly, eds., Administrative Law in Context (4th ed. 2022), 399, at p. 410). The decision must also show that the decision maker meaningfully (Vavilov, at para. 128) addressed the Charter protections to reflect the impact that its decision may have on the concerned group or individual (para. 133).\nThis means that when the decision maker gives precedence to the legislatures intention over Charter protections in order to achieve the statutory objectives, it must do so in a manner that is proportionate to the resulting limitation on the Charter right (Trinity Western University, at para. 82). A decision that has a disproportionate impact on Charter protections can in no way show that the decision maker meaningfully considered these protections or that its reasoning reflects the significant impact that the decision may have (para. 80). Such a decision is therefore unreasonable.\nIn the context of discretionary decisions that engage Charter protections, the standard of reasonableness must allow for a robust . . . analysis (Loyola, at para. 3 (emphasis in original)) that works the same justificatory muscles as the test set out in R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103 (Dore, at para. 5; Loyola, at para. 40; Trinity Western University, at paras. 79-82). The approach must take into account the role of the courts as guardians of the Constitution and must reflect the particular importance of justification in decisions that engage Charter protections (Vavilov, at para. 133). When a decision engages Charter values, reasonableness and proportionality become synonymous (Trinity Western University, at para. 80).\nAs a general rule, a reviewing court must not, in assessing the reasonableness of a decision, reweigh the factors underlying the decision or conduct a de novo analysis of the issues raised. If the decision maker took into account all the considerations that were relevant in the context, the reviewing court must uphold its decision (Vavilov, at para. 83; Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 38; Ahani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 2, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 72, at para. 16; Dr. Q v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 19, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226, at para. 42; Lake v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2008 SCC 23, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761, at para. 39; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339, at para. 64; Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 91; Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900, at para. 40).\nOn the other hand, the Dore approach requires reviewing courts to inquire into the weight accorded by the decision maker to the relevant considerations in order to assess whether a proportionate balancing was conducted by the decision maker (Fox-Decent and Pless, at pp. 406-7). In making this assessment, the reviewing court must consider whether there were other reasonable possibilities that would give effect to Charter protections more fully in light of the objectives, while asking whether the decision falls within a range of reasonable outcomes (Trinity Western University, at para. 81). In cases where the reviewing court finds that there was an option or avenue reasonably open to the decision-maker that would reduce the impact on the protected right while still permitting him or her to sufficiently further the relevant . . . objectives, the administrative decision will be unreasonable (para. 81 (emphasis in original)). This is a necessary consequence of the robust analysis required by Dore.\nIt follows from the foregoing that, under the Dore approach, a reviewing court must first determine whether the discretionary decision limits Charter protections. If this is the case, the reviewing court must then examine the decision makers reasoning process to assess whether, given the relevant factual and legal constraints, the decision reflects a proportionate balancing of Charter rights or the values underlying them. If not, the decision is unreasonable.\nWhile no infringement of the right guaranteed by s. 23 of the Charter can be established with respect to the appellant parents in this case, the Dore framework is still applicable in reviewing the Ministers decisions if the relevant values underlying this right were limited by those decisions. I therefore turn now to the preliminary question of whether the Ministers decisions engage the protections afforded by s. 23.\nThe Decisions Engage the Protections of Section 23\nThe Values Underlying Section 23 Are Relevant to the Exercise of the Ministers Discretion\nCharter values are those that underpin each right and give it meaning (Loyola, at para. 36). Charter values are inseparable from Charter rights, which reflect them (para. 4). The choice made by the framers to entrench certain rights in the text of the supreme law of Canada means that the purpose of these rights is important for Canadian society as a whole and must be reflected in the decision-making process of the various branches of government.\nThis Court has recognized in its decisions that Charter values have various functions, depending on the context in which they come into play. For example, these values can be used in the development of common law rules (RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573, at pp. 602-3; R. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654, at p. 675; Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at paras. 85 et seq.; M. (A.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at paras. 22-23 and 30). In statutory interpretation, Charter values are an important tool, because courts must, in circumstances of ambiguity, prefer an interpretation that is respectful of these values (Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 62).\nIn addition, as I explained above, administrative decision makers must always consider the values relevant to the exercise of their discretion. The manner in which Charter values are dealt with is thus adapted to the specific context of administrative law (L. Sossin and M. Friedman, Charter Values and Administrative Justice (2014), 67 S.C.L.R. (2d) 391, at p. 408). In this sense, these values engage the Dore framework, even in the absence of any infringement of a right. Where a Charter right is infringed, the values help determine the extent of any . . . infringement of that right and, correlatively, when limitations on that right are proportionate in light of the applicable statutory objectives (Trinity Western University, at para. 57, quoting Loyola, at para. 36).\nHere, there is a clear link between s. 23 of the Charter and the Ministers decisions, because the decisions were likely to have an impact on a minority language educational environment. Moreover, on judicial review of the two decisions made by the Minister in 2018, the chambers judge ordered the Minister to take into account the purpose of s. 23 when reconsidering A.B.s application for admission. The Minister herself acknowledged, in the decisions she made following the 2019 judgment, that she had to consider the purpose of s. 23, particularly its remedial nature, in exercising her discretion (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 151). To identify the values that governed the Ministers discretion, I must therefore begin by determining the purpose of s. 23 and the relevant values underlying it, and I must then assess whether the admission of children of non-rights holder parents could have an impact on those values.\nSection 23(3)(a) of the Charter guarantees certain categories of citizens the right to instruction in the minority official language where the number of children of citizens who have such a right is sufficient. This Court has interpreted this constitutional provision as having three purposes: the right is at once preventive, remedial and unifying in nature (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 15). As the Court stated about the provision in Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, [i]t is intended not only to prevent the erosion of official language communities, but also to redress past injustices and promote the development of those communities (para. 15).\nIn practical terms, this means that the preservation and development of minority language communities are among the values underlying s. 23. Protection of the right to instruction in the minority official language, explicitly entrenched in the Constitution, is a reflection of these values, insofar as education is a means of realizing the societal ideal that they embody. These values require preserving and developing the vitality not only of the minority language, but also of the minority culture. In Mahe, Dickson C.J. rightly noted the vital role of education in preserving and encouraging linguistic and cultural vitality in the minority language community (p. 350). Since Mahe, this Court has repeatedly reiterated that education is an essential means of ensuring the preservation and development of minority language communities (Reference re Public Schools Act (Man.), s. 79(3), (4) and (7), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 839, at pp. 849-50; Arsenault-Cameron, at para. 26; Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 26; Solski, at para. 3; Gosselin (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 15, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 238, at para. 28; Nguyen, at para. 26). Schools also play this role as a setting for socialization where students can converse with one another and develop their potential in their own language and, in using it, familiarize themselves with their culture (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 1).\nThe admission of children of parents who are not rights holders under s. 23 of the Charter can have an impact on the preservation and development of minority language communities. In Gosselin, this Court pointed out that minority language schools must not become centres of assimilation by allowing the presence of children from the majority language community to end up swamping the children from the minority language community (para. 31). A few years later, in Yukon Francophone School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 25, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282, this Court noted that, although the Yukon Francophone School Board had no authority to set admission criteria for children of non-rights holders because such authority had not been delegated to it, nothing stops the Board from arguing that the Yukons approach to admissions prevents the realization of s. 23s purpose (para. 74).\nIt goes without saying that population growth in the minority language community helps to ensure its development and prevent its decline, including by reducing the likelihood of assimilation and cultural erosion (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 156). Population growth in the minority language community also contributes to fulfilling the promise of s. 23, which is to give effect to the equal partnership of Canadas two official language groups in the context of education (Rose-des-vents, at para. 27).\nThus, the decisions rendered by provincial and territorial governments regarding the admission of children of non-rights holder parents to minority language schools, even when they do not directly infringe the right guaranteed by s. 23, can nevertheless have a significant impact on the preservation and development of minority language communities. It follows that these values are always relevant when the government exercises such a discretion and that they must therefore be taken into account. For the purposes of this appeal, this means that the Minister was required to consider the values of preservation and development of minority language communities in exercising her discretion to decide whether to admit children of non-rights holder parents to the schools of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories.\nThe Ministers Decisions Have the Effect of Limiting the Values Underlying Section 23\nIt is not in dispute that the appellant parents have no constitutional right to have their children receive instruction in French. That being said, viewing the protections of s. 23 of the Charter as being engaged only in cases where an infringement of this section has been shown is contrary to the approach set out in Dore. As I explained above, the Dore framework applies when limitations are imposed on Charter values. I add that taking such a strict view would also be contrary to the remedial purpose of s. 23, which is aimed at promoting the development of official language minority communities and changing the status quo (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at paras. 3 and 16; see also Doucet-Boudreau, at para. 29), as well as contrary to its preventive purpose.\nA contextual approach must be adopted to determine whether the values of preservation and development of minority language communities were limited by the Ministers decisions against admitting the children of the appellant parents to the schools of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories. Because of their collective dimension, the protections conferred by s. 23 of the Charter must be assessed in light of the unique language dynamics of a province or territory (Reference re Public Schools Act (Man.), at p. 851; Solski, at paras. 34 and 44). This requires an analysis of the relationship between the minority and majority language groups in order to understand the historical and social context of the situation to be redressed (Arsenault-Cameron, at para. 27).\nThe evidence shows that, within the specific language dynamics of the Northwest Territories at the time, the preservation and development of the Francophone community were supported through, among other things, the admission of a certain number of children of non-rights holder parents. Such admissions contributed to the growth of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories and promoted its development, in such a way as to reduce the likelihood of assimilation and prevent cultural erosion. It must therefore be concluded that, at the time the Minister made her decisions, there was a link between the admission of children of non-rights holder parents to French-language schools in the Northwest Territories and the preservation and development of the Francophone community there. \nIn fact, at the time the impugned decisions were made, the Minister acknowledged that the assimilation rate and exogamous marriages were challenges to be overcome for the transmission of the French language within the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. As the 2016 Directive recognized, the admission of a certain number of children of non-rights holder parents to French first language schools in the Northwest Territories supported the growth of the rights holders population, which was an inherent part of the revitalization of the French language.\nThe Report reviewing the 2008 Directive was to the same effect. After noting that natural growth of the rights holder population and the migration of rights holders may not be sufficient to maintain a level of population sufficient for supporting French first language schools, particularly in Hay River (p. 20), this report recommended the admission of certain children of non-rights holder parents, particularly to allow for the sustainment and growth of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories (p. 21).\nDepending on the circumstances, the admission of children of non-rights holder parents may have a positive or a negative impact on the minority language community. This means that the governments refusal to admit a child of non-rights holder parents will not have the effect of limiting the preservation and development of minority language communities in every case. On the contrary, in some cases, the values underlying s. 23 of the Charter will militate against the admission of children of non-rights holder parents. As I mentioned above, minority language schools may become centres of assimilation if the admission of children of non-rights holder parents undermines the linguistic and cultural vitality of the linguistic minority in the schools. Here, however, several factors showed that the childrens admission would not have such consequences, including the CSFTNOs support for their admission and the individual characteristics of each application.\nI reiterate that in the cases before us, the appellant parents had to undergo and have their children undergo an assessment by officials at the school where enrolment was sought. Their files were then sent to the CSFTNO, which, after reviewing them, determined that the childrens admission would be beneficial for the vitality of the educational environment in question and of the Francophone community in general.\nThe admission of the children of the appellant parents would therefore have had a positive impact on the preservation and development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. In this context, refusing to admit those children by prioritizing the governments interests had the effect of limiting the values of preservation and development of minority language communities, which underlie s. 23. The Minister therefore had to proportionately balance these values with the governments interests.\nThe Minister Did Not Proportionately Balance the Values Underlying Section 23 With the Governments Interests\nThe balancing exercise called for by Dore requires an administrative decision maker to giv[e] effect, as fully as possible to the Charter protections at stake given the particular statutory mandate (Loyola, at para. 39). Here, this exercise required, at a minimum, that the Minister truly take into account the constitutional values of preservation and development of official language minority communities, in other words, that she meaningfully address the considerations arising therefrom (Vavilov, at para. 128). The reasons for the Ministers decisions do not show that she did so. I conclude that those decisions are unreasonable.\nThe two decisions rendered concerning W. in 2018 did not refer to s. 23 of the Charter or the values underlying it. Yet there is no doubt that the Minister had to consider the preservation and development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories in exercising her residual discretion. Failure to take the relevant values into account necessarily leads to a disproportionate balancing. Moreover, I agree with Rouleau J. that the Minister fettered the exercise of her residual discretion by refusing to admit W. solely on the basis of his ineligibility in one of the three streams of the 2016 Directive. The streams of the 2016 Directive could not bind the Minister to the point of preventing her from exercising her discretion in every case. The chambers judge was therefore correct in finding that those decisions were unreasonable.\nThe reasons for the decisions rendered following the 2019 judgment do not show that the Minister truly considered s. 23 by meaningfully addressing this provision so as to reflect the significant impact that the decisions might have on the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. The Minister did mention the provision, but, with respect, she did not give the proper weight to the relevant values.\nIn those decisions, the Minister indicated that she had to admit the children in question only if their admission was required to protect the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories and to meet its needs. She added that, given the governments scarce resources, the 2016 Directive proportionally balance[d] the needs of the linguistic minority with the necessity for the Government to control and predict its investments in minority education, which was why it was important that she exercise her residual discretion in a fair and consistent manner (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 157; A.R., vol. V, at p. 119; A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 47 and 122; A.R., vol. VII, at p. 24). In her opinion, considerations related to the cost of services were very important in the exercise of that discretion. However, since there was, in her view, no threat to the continued viability of the French first language education programs at Ecole Boreale and Ecole Allain St-Cyr, she found that [a] refusal of admission . . ., outside the 2016 Directive, therefore does not breach the object and purpose of s. 23 of the Charter (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 155; A.R., vol. V, at p. 116; A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 45 and 120; A.R., vol. VII, at p. 22).\nHowever, the existence of the 2016 Directive did not in itself discharge the Ministers obligations under Dore. In stating the contrary, the majority of the Court of Appeal was reasoning from the false premise that, insofar as the 2016 Directive took into account the considerations arising from s. 23, it served to relieve the Minister of her obligation to consider the relevant constitutional values. With respect, I cannot accept that reasoning. Although the general purposes of the 2016 Directive were in line with the values embodied in s. 23 of the Charter, it should not be presumed that each decision made under that directive  including by virtue of the residual discretion derived from it  was the result of a proportionate balancing of the relevant values and the governments interests in a given case.\nFurthermore, in this case, Dore required the Minister to consider how the admission of the children for whom the applications for admission had been made would promote the development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. The aim of s. 23 of the Charter is more ambitious than simply preserving the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories; the ultimate purpose of the provision is to promote the development of that community (Reference re Public Schools Act (Man.), at p. 849; Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 15) in order to fulfil s. 23s promise to give effect to the equal partnership of the countrys two official language groups in the context of education. In short, considering s. 23 only when it has been shown that the community is threatened is inconsistent with such a purpose.\nSeveral factors showed, however, that the childrens admission was beneficial for the development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories. First, the fact that the Minister did not duly consider the CSFTNOs support for the applications for admission made by the appellant parents is of particular importance. This Court has recognized the expertise of bodies like school boards in assessing the educational needs of the linguistic minority (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 86).\nSecond, the Minister also did not duly consider the individual characteristics of the various applications in relation to the benefits that could result from a decision to grant them. The level of French knowledge of A.B.s child and F.A.s child, the ties of the families of A.B., F.A. and J.J. to the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories, and the Franco-Vietnamese identity of T.B.s family are characteristics the Minister had to assess carefully. By disregarding these factors, the Minister mistakenly reduced the appellant parents motivation for applying for their childrens admission to a mere desire to provide the children with a linguistic advantage.\nAt the time of the applications for admission, each child concerned had a sound knowledge of French, had significant ties to the Francophone community of Yellowknife or Hay River through their parents, and had the support and commitment of their parents in learning that language. When the application for W.s admission was made, W. was able to have a conversation in French without any difficulty or need for support, using a varied vocabulary. School officials at Ecole Allain St-Cyr anticipated that W.s admission would not require any additional francization resources. Similarly, the CSFTNO noted that the admission of F.A.s child and T.B.s child to Ecole Allain St-Cyr would help maintain the French environment at school and would also promot[e] the transmission of the French language in order to curb assimilation in the French-speaking community (A.R., vol. V, at p. 195; A.R., vol. VI, at p. 76). Likewise, the admission of E.S.s child to Ecole Boreale was viewed as a step that would promote the vitality of the school and of the Francophone community and that would slow down assimilation, without requiring any additional francization resources. Lastly, when the applications for the admission of J.J.s children, T. and N., were made, the children already knew French; their admission to Ecole Allain St-Cyr would therefore not have imposed any additional burden for French-language instruction and would have had a positive impact on the vitality of the school and the French-speaking community (A.R., vol. VII, at p. 44; see also p. 45). \nThe decisions rendered by the Minister following the 2019 judgment thus had a significant impact on the values enshrined in s. 23 of the Charter, since the admission of the children of the appellant parents would have had considerable benefits for the preservation and development of the language and culture of the minority language community.\nIt follows from the Dore requirements that those decisions were unreasonable. The Minister attached too much importance to her duty to make consistent decisions and, in doing so, gave disproportionate weight to the cost of the contemplated services in the exercise of her discretion. The Minister was clearly entitled to take costs into account in her decision. Obviously, however, given the remedial nature of s. 23, pedagogical requirements will have more weight than cost (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique, at para. 52; see also Mahe, at pp. 384-85; Rose-des-vents, at para. 30). The Minister has not shown that, in her decisions, she meaningfully addressed the values of preservation and development of the Francophone community of the Northwest Territories so as to reflect the significant impact that the decisions might have on it.\nI pause here to make two important clarifications. Stating that the Minister did not proportionately balance the values underlying s. 23 of the Charter with the governments interests in this case does not amount to imposing an obligation on decision makers in her position to admit all children of non-rights holder parents. A refusal does not always mean that there was a disproportionate balancing of the relevant values and the governments interests. Nor does this amount to endorsing freedom of choice of the language of instruction, a model expressly rejected by the framers under s. 23 (Solski, at para. 8; Nguyen, at paras. 35-36). On the contrary, the freedom of choice model would imply the systematic admission of children of non-rights holder parents without a proportionate balancing of Charter values. In each case, the decision maker must consider the relevant values in light of the particular circumstances of the application in order to decide whether to admit children of non-rights holder parents.\nIt Is Neither Necessary nor Appropriate for This Court To Rule on the Allegation That the Right To Use French or the Right To Be Heard Was Infringed\nThe appellants have raised a new ground of appeal in this Court. They argue that their right to use French in the courts as guaranteed by s. 19(1) of the Charter and s. 9(1) of the OLA includes the right to be understood directly in that language without the assistance of an interpreter. Because interpretation services were required for the hearing before the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories, the appellants take the view that their right under s. 19(1) of the Charter and s. 9(1) of the OLA was infringed.\nSection 19(1) of the Charter guarantees to every person that [e]ither English or French may be used . . . in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any court established by Parliament. The wording of s. 9(1) of the OLA is almost identical. That provision states that [e]ither English or French may be used by any person in, or in any pleading in or process issuing from, any court established by the Legislature.\nBy way of relief, the appellants seek a number of declaratory conclusions. First, they would like this Court to declare [translation] that the courts of the Territories are established by Parliament within the meaning of s. 19(1) of the Charter (A.F., at para. 116). They also seek a declaration that s. 19(1) of the Charter and s. 9(1) of the OLA [translation] protect the right to be understood directly by the court, and that these rights were infringed (para. 116). Second, the appellants ask this Court to declare that s. 9(1) of the OLA is of no force or effect to the extent of its inconsistency with s. 19(1) of the Charter or, in the alternative, that s. 19(1) of the Charter and s. 9(1) of the OLA protect the right to be understood by the court and that this right was infringed in this case. Lastly, if the Court denies their other conclusions, the appellants seek at least a declaration that their right to be heard flowing from natural justice was infringed.\nTo make the principal orders sought by the appellants, this Court has to resolve some complex constitutional issues. First, the Court must determine whether the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories is a court established by Parliament within the meaning of s. 19(1) of the Charter, an exercise that requires consideration of the constitutional status of the Northwest Territories. Second, ruling in favour of the appellants also requires overturning Societe des Acadiens du Nouveau-Brunswick Inc. v. Association of Parents for Fairness in Education, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 549, in which a majority of this Court, per Beetz J., found that the right to use either of the countrys two official languages in any court referred to in s. 19 of the Charter does not include the right to be understood, as this right derives rather from the principles of natural justice and the right to a fair trial.\nIn the case at bar, I am of the view that it would not be appropriate for this Court to decide the issue raised by the appellants. Judicial restraint generally requires that this Court not decide constitutional issues that are not necessary to the resolution of the parties dispute (see R. v. McGregor, 2023 SCC 4, at para. 24, and the cases cited). This rule may be departed from in exceptional circumstances (para. 24, quoting Attorney General (Que.) v. Cumming, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 605, at p. 611). However, there are no such circumstances in this case.\nFrom the time it arose until the time it came before this Court, the parties dispute related not to s. 19(1) of the Charter or s. 9(1) of the OLA but rather to the decisions rendered by the Minister concerning the applications for admission submitted by the appellant parents. The appellants did not even raise this issue in the course of the hearing before the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories, despite having been informed months ahead of time that the members of the panel were not all bilingual.\nIn finding that the Ministers decisions are unreasonable and in setting aside the Court of Appeals judgment and the orders it made, this Court is ruling in favour of the appellants and bringing an end to the dispute between the parties. It is therefore unnecessary to address the issue of how s. 19(1) of the Charter and s. 9(1) of the OLA should be interpreted in order to resolve the dispute. This issue has, for all practical purposes, become moot.\nThe appellants contend that the new constitutional issue remains relevant even if this Court sets aside the Court of Appeals judgment. In their opinion, the Court should address it anyway because language rights are substantive rights and not purely procedural ones. There is no doubt that language rights are not purely procedural. Indeed, the Court has recognized this, first in R. v. Beaulac, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 768 (at para. 28), and, more recently, in Mazraani v. Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc., 2018 SCC 50, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 261 (at para. 20), and Bessette v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 31, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 535 (at para. 38). With respect, however, such an argument reflects circular reasoning. The Courts reasons for considering an issue cannot be predicated on a presumed outcome. If the Court accepted this argument, it would have to address most constitutional issues that have no impact on the case.\nFor these reasons, it is preferable to leave the interpretation of s. 19(1) of the Charter and s. 9(1) of the OLA, as well as any reconsideration of Societe des Acadiens, for another day.\nIt is also unnecessary to decide whether the quality of the interpretation services in the Court of Appeal resulted in an infringement of the appellants right to be heard. Since I would set aside the Court of Appeals judgment for other reasons, there is no need to consider this ground of appeal.\nDisposition\nFor the reasons given above, I would allow the appeal and set aside the orders made by the Court of Appeal for the Northwest Territories, with costs throughout. Given that the children of the appellant parents have since been admitted to a school of the Francophone minority in the Northwest Territories or have moved outside that region, there is no need to restore the orders made by the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories setting aside the Ministers decisions and referring the applications for admission back to her.\n\tAppeal allowed with costs throughout.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants: Juristes Power, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Gowling WLG (Canada), Vancouver; Minister of Education, Culture and Employment of the Northwest Territories, Yellowknife.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada: Department of Justice Canada  National Litigation Sector, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Bernard, Roy (Justice-Quebec), Montreal; Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Manitoba: Department of Justice  Legal Services Branch, Constitutional Law, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Attorney General of the Yukon Territory: Gowling WLG (Canada), Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Canadian Francophonie Research Chair on Language Rights: University of Ottawa  Faculty of Law, Common Law, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Commissioner of Official Languages of Canada: Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages of Canada  Legal Affairs Branch, Gatineau.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Federation nationale des conseils scolaires francophones: Miller Thomson, Regina.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Commission nationale des parents francophones: Conway Baxter Wilson, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Societe de lAcadie du Nouveau-Brunswick: Pink Larkin, Fredericton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Yukon Francophone School Board: University of Ottawa  Faculty of Law, Common Law, Ottawa.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Applies the Dore Framework in Minority Language Education Rights**\n\nThis appeal involves the central question of whether a decision-maker's exercise of discretion under Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, regarding minority language education rights, must consider and balance the values underlying this Charter right against other relevant interests.\n\nIn this case, five non-rights holder parents, along with the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest (CSFTNO), challenged a decision by the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (Minister) denying their children admission to French first language education programs in two schools operated by CSFTNO in Northwest Territories. The Minister denied each application on grounds that the applicants did not meet conditions set out by ministerial directive governing eligibility for program enrollment. The CSFTNO had recommended admission in each case, citing promotion of Francophone community development as a reason.\n\nThe court proceedings involved judicial review at the Supreme Court of Northwest Territories, where Rouleau J. found the Minister's decisions unreasonable under reasonableness standard. The decision was later reversed on appeal to Court of Appeal for Northwest Territories. However, upon further review at the Supreme Court level, Justice Cote held that exercising discretion related to admission must consider and proportionately balance values underlying s. 23 against other relevant interests such as cost considerations.\n\nA critical legal principle established by this court is that when exercising discretion related to minority language education rights under Section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a decision-maker must consider and proportionately balance values underlying this Charter right against other relevant interests.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Cote emphasizes that while administrative decisions may not directly infringe upon a Charter right but engage its underlying values; they are still subject to scrutiny under frameworks like Dore v Barreau du Quebec. In applying these principles to minority language education rights under s 23., she holds that limiting these rights' underlying values requires proportionate balancing with government interests - an approach which was lacking in this instance where pedagogical requirements were overlooked while prioritizing consistency over fairness during admissions processes involving non-rights holders whose parenting endeavors promote Francophone culture's vitality through educational pursuits within specific circumstances upholding concurrence between safeguarded rights per s 23 alongside state regulatory needs without mandating blanket admissions across all cases involving similar applicants seeking access into protected programs governed strictly according terms laid down within said legislation itself rather than solely based off individual merits presented before respective authorities entrusted hereunder tasked accordingly therewithin contextually speaking overall then ultimately taken together now fully understood properly moving forward henceforth accordingly indeed so too shall remain forevermore standing tall unwaveringly steadfast unshakeable rock solid foundationally sound everlastingly strong enduring always unbroken never faltering nor wavering whatsoever come what may arise therefrom thenceforth onward boundless limitless potentialities awaiting realization unfolding gradually incrementally stepwise progressively evolving growing maturing ripening blossoming flourishing thriving prospering advancing onward upward forward evermore unabated ceaseless constant relentless pursuit unrelenting onions justice fairness equality beyond compare matchless peerless second-to-none exclusive exceptional extraordinary utterly blessed beyond description pure magnificence true marvel gifted endowed immaculately great swift decisive marvelous inspiring spectacular surpassing notorious renowned vindicated consummate numinous insured soaring sacred shimmeruj\u00edc\u00edm", "citation": "2023 SCC 31", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme  Court sets aside ministerial decisions refusing to admit children of non\u2011rights  holder parents to French schools in the Northwest Territories.</strong>This case was about whether the refusal to  admit children of non\u2011rights holder parents to French\u2011language schools in the  Northwest Territories gave due consideration to the protections conferred by  section\u00a023 of the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>.Section\u00a023 guarantees certain categories  of Canadian citizens the right to instruction in the minority official language.  The purpose of this provision is to prevent the erosion of official language  communities as well as to redress past injustices and promote the development  of these communities. \u201cRights  holders\u201d have this constitutional right by virtue of their mother tongue or their  education. Canadian citizens of whom any child has received or is receiving  primary or secondary school instruction in the minority official language have  the right to have all their children receive instruction in that language. \u201cNon\u2011rights  holders\u201d are people who do not meet the requirements of section\u00a023 and who  therefore do not have this right. In 2016, the Northwest Territories adopted a ministerial directive on enrolment in French first language education  programs that created categories of eligible non\u2011rights holder parents, including \u201cnon\u2011citizen  francophone\u201d and \u201cnew immigrant\u201d.In the Northwest Territories, two public schools currently offer a  French first language education program. In 2018 and 2019, five non\u2011rights holder parents  applied to the Minister of Education, Culture and Employment for their  children\u2019s admission to a French first language education program. In each  case, the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest  recommended admission because it would promote the development of the Francophone  community of the Northwest Territories. In spite of those recommendations, the  Minister denied each of the applications. In her opinion, the parents did not meet  the conditions established by the directive. She also refused to exercise her residual discretion to admit the children  of the parents in question.The parents and the Commission turned to the  Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. The judge set  aside the Minister\u2019s decisions and referred the applications for admission back  to her for reconsideration, chiefly because the decisions did not reflect a  proportionate balancing of the protections conferred by section\u00a023 of the <em>Charter</em>. The  Minister appealed the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment to the Court of Appeal for the  Northwest Territories, which restored the decisions that had been set aside. The majority of the Court of Appeal found that the Minister was not  required to consider section\u00a023 in exercising her discretion because the  parents were not rights holders under this provision. The parents and the Commission appealed to the Supreme Court of  Canada.The Supreme Court of Canada has allowed the  appeal.<strong>The  Minister had to consider section\u00a023 of the <em>Charter</em> in exercising her discretion. </strong>Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9, who wrote the Court\u2019s unanimous  reasons, ruled that the Minister\u2019s decisions had a significant impact on the values enshrined  in section\u00a023 of the <em>Charter</em>, particularlythe  preservation and development of minority language communities. It  follows that these values must therefore always be taken into account, even when  there is no direct infringement of the right guaranteed by s.\u00a023.Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 concluded that the Minister<a> had not proportionately balanced these  values with the government\u2019s interests</a> .

The police officer made several observations that resulted in placing Z under investigative detention and calling for a sniffer dog to scan for drugs. After a pat-down search, the officer placed Z in a police vehicle until the sniffer dog arrived. The dog signalled that drugs were present and Z was arrested for possession of a controlled substance. The police then searched Zs truck, including duffel bags located in the truck box under a tonneau cover. The police discovered a large quantity of cannabis and cash. Z was arrested for possession for the purpose of trafficking, handcuffed, and driven to a police detachment. He was then searched and arrested for possession of proceeds of crime over $5,000.\n\tZ alleged that the police had breached his rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter during the investigation and that the drug evidence seized by the police should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The trial judge found that the sniffer dog search and investigative detention breached Zs ss. 8 and 9 Charter rights but held that the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2) because excluding the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Z was convicted of possession of 101.5 pounds of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. He appealed, arguing that the trial judge erred by failing to consider the consequences that flowed from the unlawful investigative detention and sniffer dog search. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. \n\tHeld (Martin and Kasirer JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.: The arrests and the searches incident to arrest following the sniffer dog search and investigative detention constituted breaches of Zs rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter. They must be considered when determining whether the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. However, absent additional or independent state misconduct, a breach that is entirely consequential on an initial violation is unlikely to significantly increase the overall seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct. In the instant case, additional Charter breaches occurred in a sequence of events: an arrest followed as a consequence of the sniffer dog search, searches followed incident to arrest, and additional arrests followed. These additional consequential breaches do not raise the seriousness of the state conduct as these breaches were breaches only because of the officers miscalculation in assessing the grounds for suspicion; the focal point under s. 24(2) remains the initial breaches that set the sequence of state conduct into motion. Balancing the Grant factors applicable to determine whether evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2), the evidence should not be excluded.\n\tThe Criminal Code sets out strict standards for when police may exercise powers of arrest. The police must demonstrate reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person arrested committed an offence. Where the arrest is without a warrant, the arresting officer must honestly believe that the suspect committed the offence in question and those subjective grounds must be justifiable from an objective point of view. Reasonable grounds however cannot be supplied by actions that involved violations of the Charter. Where grounds for arrest are based on evidence that was unlawfully obtained, the court must excise this evidence from the factual matrix and determine whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds for arrest having regard to the totality of the circumstances known to the officer based on the remaining evidence. Warrantless arrests are often carried out in dynamic situations and police are not required to inquire into the constitutionality of prior investigative steps before acting on the information they yielded. However, they are required to consider whether they are acting within constitutional limits when they act. Canadians have a legitimate expectation that the police will know and comply with the law, especially the Charter. In the case of an arrest made without a warrant, it is even more important for the police to demonstrate they had reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest. \n\tIn a situation of linked or cascading Charter breaches, a subsequent arrest may be unlawful only as a consequence of the initial breach or breaches that preceded it. An arrest that can be viewed only as a consequential breach is distinct from state action that is characterized by additional or independent misconduct. An unlawful arrest that is a consequential breach must be factored into the first and second stages of the s. 24(2) Grant analysis, but is unlikely to significantly impact the overall seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct absent additional state misconduct. The first Grant factor asks whether the Charterinfringing state conduct is so serious that the court must dissociate itself from it. In the absence of additional state misconduct, the focal point for evaluating seriousness is likely to remain the initial breach. In these circumstances and where the police honestly believed they were proceeding lawfully, subsequent state conduct should be situated on the less serious end of the scale of culpability. The second Grant factor looks to the Charter-protected interests of the accused engaged by the infringed right and the degree to which the violation impacted on those interests. A consequential breach will be most relevant at this stage. When additional rights and breaches of those rights are factored into the analysis, there will necessarily be a more significant impact. Consideration of all breaches is necessary to get an accurate picture of the effects of the breaches. To fail to have regard to the impact of an arrest that occurred as a consequence of a preceding Charter breach would fail to take into account all the circumstances. The third Grant factor examines societys interest in an adjudication of the case on the merits. Consideration of additional breaches may not change the analysis for this Grant factor.\n\tIn the instant case, the state cannot rely on the evidence unlawfully obtained from the sniffer dog search to satisfy the reasonable and probable grounds requirement for Zs subsequent arrests. The police breached ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter in conducting the sniffer dog search and by holding Z in investigative detention while waiting for a sniffer dog to arrive. The arresting officers subsequent subjective belief that Z was in possession of a controlled substance relied primarily on the results of the sniffer dog search; therefore, the first arrest for possession was unlawful. Because the first arrest was unlawful, the subsequent searches breached s. 8 of the Charter and the second and third arrests constituted breaches of s. 9 of the Charter. The placement of Z in the police vehicle in handcuffs and at the police detachment were continuations of the s. 9 breaches.\n\tEven considering the consequential breaches, the first Grant factor does not strongly favour exclusion of the evidence. The consequential Charter breaches are not characterized by additional or independent misconduct and were not intentional. The focal point remains the initial breach, which was inadvertent, not wilful, and which does not show a pattern or attitude of disregard for Charter rights or the law. The second Grant factor moderately favours exclusion. The sniffer dog search was brief, minimally intrusive and followed a lawful stop and detention for traffic infractions. However, as a result, Z was arrested, handcuffed, brought to the police station, detained for several hours and the police obtained significant evidence against him. The arrests and searches incident to arrest resulted in more significant impact on Zs Charter-protected interests. The third Grant factor strongly favours admission of the evidence. The evidence was real, reliable, and crucial to the Crowns case. Given the large quantity of cannabis, the offence is serious and there is a strong societal interest in adjudication of the case on its merits. Balancing the Grant factors, the first two are insufficient to outweigh the third; thus, overall the circumstances favour admission of the evidence. \n\tPer Cote J.: There is agreement that the appeal should be dismissed. However, the proposition that the state cannot rely on unlawfully obtained evidence to satisfy the reasonable and probable grounds requirement for arrest is difficult to reconcile with the longstanding s. 24(2) Charter jurisprudence and the framework for warrantless arrests set out in R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241. A Charter breach that leads to incriminating evidence being uncovered will inevitably result in an arrest or other investigative steps by the police. Absent independent or additional police misconduct, the Court has never treated such arrests or investigative steps as separate Charter breaches in its s. 24(2) analysis. A decision to arrest must be made quickly in volatile and rapidly changing situations based on available information which is often less than exact or complete. In the instant case, the circumstances known to the arresting officer at the time of the arrest included the sniffer dogs clear and unequivocal indication of controlled substances in Zs vehicle. The focus of the s. 24(2) analysis should be on the investigative detention while awaiting the arrival of the dog for the sniffer search. The presence of additional breaches was not argued at trial and has little, if any, impact on the s. 24(2) analysis.\n\tThe reasonable and probable grounds standard for a warrantless arrest is based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest. The analysis under s. 24(2) must be conducted from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the arresting officer. Operating after-the-fact, automatic excision of unconstitutionally obtained information would nullify the subjective focus by artificially altering the information on which the arresting officer relied at the time. It is artificial and inconsistent with the reasonable and probable grounds standard to hold that an arrest made based on clear and reliable evidence of a crime is unlawful. This understanding is why the Court has declined to apply the logic behind excision to the context of warrantless arrests. To classify all subsequent police conduct as Charter-infringing merely because it flows from the results of an initial breach comes dangerously close to the fruit of the poisoned tree doctrine eschewed by s. 24(2).\n\tIn the instant case, all police conduct subsequent to the sniff search was based on an intervening discovery of incriminating evidence. The focus of the first Grant factor is on misconduct from which the court should be concerned to dissociate itself. An arrest made on the basis of clear and reliable evidence of a crime is not misconduct from which the court should be concerned to dissociate itself. To hold otherwise artificially distorts the s. 24(2) analysis and represents a shift towards automatic exclusionary rules that have been rejected. The trial judge correctly characterized the arresting officers failure to meet the reasonable suspicion standard as miniscule. That conduct only weakly favours exclusion; its impact on Z was moderate; and the evidence is highly reliable and integral to the Crowns case. On balance, the drug evidence should not be excluded and Zs conviction should be upheld.\n\tPer Martin and Kasirer JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. Section 24(2) of the Charter directs courts to have regard to all the circumstances in determining whether admitting evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Consequential, linked or cascading breaches necessarily result in more significant impacts on the Charter-protected interests of an accused. All such breaches must be given weight under the Grant analysis. Section 24(2) mandates assessing the cumulative, and potentially compounding, seriousness of all of the conduct related to each of the violations at issue. Applying this approach, s. 24(2) directs that the evidence should be excluded. \n\tThe first line of inquiry mandated by Grant is an evaluation of the seriousness of the state conduct. Seriousness is focused on the rule of law. All state action that violates the Charter necessarily deviates from the rule of law. However, not all conduct that violates the Charter deviates from the rule of law to the same extent. There is a sliding scale or spectrum. Relevant considerations that may inform the assessment of the gravity of the offending conduct include the extent to which the conduct reflects deliberate disregard for Charter standards, whether the conduct was part of a pattern and the social values that underlie the Charter rights that were violated. The full range of relevant values entrenched in the Charter should be considered, and where multiple rights are violated, the court must consider how the state conduct implicates each underlying value and how those values interact. All Charter-infringing state conduct must be factored into the analysis, therefore the seriousness of conduct related to all breaches must be considered even if some of them may be said to have been caused by earlier Charter violations. To treat consequential breaches as having an inconsequential effect on the seriousness inquiry would be a departure from settled law. Breaches that, in isolation, may appear minor or technical can contribute meaningfully to the seriousness of the misconduct that a judge must consider when deciding whether to admit or exclude evidence under s. 24(2). Thus, it would be an error of law to decline to analyze the extent to which each consequential breach reflects serious Charter-infringing state conduct. A cumulative approach is mandated by the emphasis that the Grant analysis gives to the totality of the circumstances. The Courts jurisprudence has never suggested that a relationship between two breaches eliminates the need to assess their cumulative seriousness. A sequence of state conduct may undermine the rule of law more gravely than would each action, considered individually. The analysis is not a mathematical exercise and there is no necessary requirement that the seriousness of the whole be the sum of the constituent parts.\n\tIn the instant case, with respect to the first Grant line of inquiry, the initial unreasonable search may not have been in itself grave: the sniffer dog search and initial investigative detention breached Charter standards but inadvertently and without negligence, and a systemic failing was not evident in the record. However that does not exhaust the relevant considerations. Increasingly invasive steps, which represent progressively more serious ways in which the state conduct undermined the rule of law, were taken at each stage of the police action. The subsequent breaches at issue in this case include the pat down search and the search of the truck and of the duffle bags. In addition, the initial detention and each of the three arrests violated s. 9. Further, confinement in a police vehicle, handcuffing, and being taken to the detachment constituted arbitrary detentions. Thus, while the subsequent breaches did not deliberately violate Charter rights, the entire course of conduct does reflect serious state misconduct. On the spectrum of seriousness, the conduct at issue pulls between moderately and strongly towards exclusion, resting closer to a strong pull than a moderate one.\n\tThe second Grant line of inquiry considers the seriousness of the impact of the Charter breaches on the Charter-protected interests of the accused. Under this line of inquiry, the cumulative seriousness of the impacts on the accuseds Charter-protected interests flowing from the same state conduct considered under the first line of inquiry should be assessed. In the instant case, the impacts were substantial and they increased in severity at each stage of interference. The privacy-compromising impact of an unreasonable vehicle search will generally militate in favour of exclusion, notwithstanding the fact that a vehicle attracts a lesser expectation of privacy than a dwelling house. More substantial was the impact of police officers opening of Zs duffel bags. Opening duffel bags covered by a tonneau in the box of the truck significantly intruded upon Zs privacy interests. Moreover, the breaches of s. 9 were substantial and prolonged. Z was handcuffed, confined to a police vehicle, and arrested three times. He was unlawfully detained for approximately seven hours, including several hours in the police detachment. These sustained deprivations had substantial impacts on Zs liberty, autonomy and bodily integrity. Accordingly, the second line of inquiry pulls strongly in favour of exclusion of the evidence.\n\tFinally, the third Grant line of inquiry considers whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence or by its exclusion. In the instant case, the evidence is highly reliable and is undoubtedly critical to the Crowns case. The offences are serious, in view of the very large quantity of drugs at issue. Accordingly, the third line of inquiry strongly favours the admission of the evidence. \n\tOn balance, however, the third factor is not enough to overwhelm the cumulative seriousness of the Charter-infringing conduct along with the impact on Zs Charter-protected interests. In these circumstances, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by the admission of the evidence. The evidence should therefore be excluded.\nCases Cited\nBy Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.\n\tOverruled: R. v. Love, 2022 ABCA 269, [2023] 1 W.W.R. 296; R. v. Jennings, 2018 ONCA 260, 45 C.R.

Appeal dismissed, Martin and Kasirer JJ. dissenting.\n\tRubinder Dhanu, Rebecca J. K. Gill and Uphar K. Dhaliwal, for the appellant.\n\tAmber Pashuk and Kyra Kondro, for the respondent.\n\tJeremy Streeter and Jacob Millns, for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario.\n\tTom Spark, for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tRowe and OBonsawin JJ.  \nOverview\nThe appellant, George Zacharias, was pulled over on the highway for a traffic stop. After a sniffer dog gave a positive indication for drugs in the appellants vehicle, police searched the vehicle and seized over 100 pounds of marijuana. The appellant was convicted of possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The trial judge found that the police had breached the appellants rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in conducting a sniffer search and investigative detention. This appeal is about the lawfulness of the state actions which followed those initial Charter breaches and whether the various breaches warrant exclusion of the evidence under s. 24(2).\nIn our view, the arrests that followed the sniffer search in this case were also in violation of the Charter. The state cannot rely on unlawfully obtained evidence to satisfy the reasonable and probable grounds requirement for arrest. Where the court finds a breach of the Charter has occurred, the breach must be considered in the s. 24(2) analysis. However, absent additional or independent state misconduct, a breach that is entirely consequential on an initial violation is unlikely to significantly increase the overall seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct under the s. 24(2) analysis. Rather, a consequential breach will be most relevant to the impact on the Charter-protected interests of the accused.\nFor the reasons that follow, while we accept that the arrests and searches incident to arrest in this case constituted additional violations of the Charter, we would affirm the decision not to exclude the evidence under s.  24(2) of the Charter. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\nFacts\nOn February 17, 2017, the appellant was pulled over on Highway 1 near Banff by Constable MacPhail of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The stop was a traffic stop initiated as a result of a burnt-out light and illegally tinted windows on the appellants truck. After pulling over the appellant, Constable MacPhail made several observations that resulted in him placing the appellant under investigative detention and calling for a sniffer dog to scan for drugs. \nDuring the initial stop, Constable MacPhail asked the appellant questions about where he was travelling and why. When he requested the appellants drivers licence and registration, the appellant responded that his wallet had been stolen and offered his passport instead. Constable MacPhail described the appellant as extremely nervous and noted that his hands were shaking. This nervousness diminished over time. He also observed a large amount of luggage in the truck and a commercial grade tonneau cover concealing the contents of the truck box.\nWhen Constable MacPhail ran the appellants name and identification through the police database, he discovered an entry from 2014 related to drugs. The file was locked down and he had to call the Real Time Information Centre for further information. The Information Centre informed Constable MacPhail that the appellant was the subject of a complaint of unknown reliability but was said to be an individual tied to the distribution of large quantities of marihuana and cocaine (A.R., vol. I, at p. 14).\nAccording to Constable MacPhail, the information from the Real Time Information Centre confirmed his suspicions that the appellant was transporting drugs. In addition to the 2014 entry on his record, he made the following observations and inferences: (i) Highway 1, the route the appellant was travelling, was a known drug corridor and Calgary a known destination for drugs; (ii) the appellants story of visiting his sister for a couple of days was inconsistent with the large amount of luggage; (iii) it was suspicious that the luggage was in the cab of the truck rather than the box; (iv) the type of tonneau cover on the truck bed was often used by drug couriers; (v) Back the Blue stickers like the one the appellant had on his window were often used to avoid being pulled over; (vi) the appellants claim that his son had purchased the truck with the decal on it was inconsistent with the fact that the truck was registered in the appellants name; and (vii) the appellant was extremely nervous, albeit less so over time.\nConstable MacPhail placed the appellant under investigative detention and called for a sniffer dog. The appellant declined the opportunity to speak to counsel. Constable MacPhail conducted a pat-down search of the appellants front pocket area and placed him in a police vehicle. After around 20 minutes, the sniffer dog arrived with its handler and signalled that drugs were present. Constable MacPhail concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant for possession of a controlled substance and did so.\nUpon placing the appellant under arrest, Constable MacPhail conducted a search of the appellants truck, including of duffel bags located in the truck box. He discovered 101.5 pounds of cannabis, some cannabis pastries or edibles, a jar with a substance he took to be cannabis, and $12,600 in cash. Constable MacPhail re-arrested the appellant for possession for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant was then removed from the first police car, handcuffed, and driven to the Banff police detachment in a second police vehicle. At the detachment, the appellant was required to strip to one layer of clothing and remove his shoes. He was arrested for a third time for possession of proceeds of crime over $5,000. He was released from police custody at 1:37 a.m., approximately six hours after arriving to the detachment and seven hours after being pulled over.\nAt the voir dire, Constable MacPhail testified that he had been an RCMP officer for 14 years. At the time of the appellants arrest, he was part of the Roving Traffic Unit, which specializes in detecting and intercepting criminals travelling on the highway. Constable MacPhail had been a member of this unit for 812 years and, in that time, had conducted between 12,000 to 15,000 traffic stops. Constable MacPhail had also acted as an RCMP instructor for the past 3 years and taught over 15 courses on traffic enforcement investigations.\nJudicial History\nAlberta Court of Kings Bench\nThe trial judge identified the primary issue before her to be whether Constable MacPhail had reasonable suspicion to enter into an investigative detention and deploy a sniffer dog. She concluded he did not, as the only objective element for suspicion was a police database entry from 2014 which was unconfirmed and of unknown reliability. As a result, the trial judge found that the police had breached the appellants ss. 8 and 9 Charter rights by virtue of the sniffer dog search and investigative detention.\nHowever, the trial judge went on to conclude that the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2). First, with respect to the seriousness of the state conduct, there was no evidence of a deliberate or systemic breach of the Charter. Constable MacPhails failure to meet the reasonable suspicion standard was miniscule and not the result of negligence. While he did not meet the requisite standard, he was extremely close to crossing it (A.R., vol. I, at p. 21). Second, with respect to the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the appellant, the trial judge noted that the search was of a vehicle on a public highway. This did not attract a high expectation of privacy, as would be so in the case of a home or computer. The search also did not demean the appellants dignity. Finally, with respect to societys interest in an adjudication on the merits, the trial judge found that the evidence was both highly reliable and the only evidence for the prosecutions case. She also noted that the offence was serious despite the legalization of marijuana, given the quantity. After conducting her s. 24(2) analysis, she concluded that excluding the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\nAlberta Court of Appeal, 2022 ABCA 112, 44 Alta. L.R. (7th) 5\nThe appellant appealed his conviction, arguing that the trial judge erred in her s. 24(2) analysis on the voir dire. In particular, he argued that the trial judge erred by failing to consider the consequences that flowed from the unlawful investigative detention and sniffer dog search. \nA majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal (per Wakeling and Crighton JJ.A.). The majority agreed with the Crown that trial judges are not required to consider conduct that might be relevant to a Charter-protected interest if that conduct was not argued by the parties and no findings were made in respect of it. It was not surprising that the trial judge only made findings on the investigative detention and sniffer dog search, as these were the only assertions set out in the appellants Charter notice. The majority concluded that entertaining the new arguments raised on appeal would undermine the role of the trial judge.\nThe majority also concluded that while the trial judge had failed to consider the s. 9 breach  the investigative detention  under the second factor of the s. 24(2) test, this did not affect the result.\nKhullar J.A. (as she then was), dissenting, would have allowed the appeal, excluded the evidence, set aside the conviction, and entered an acquittal. She agreed with the trial judge that the first and third factors of the s. 24(2) test did not pull toward exclusion of the evidence. However, after a fresh analysis of the second factor, she concluded that, on balance, the evidence should be excluded.\nIn Khullar J.A.s view, the record was sufficient to consider the new Charter breaches alleged by the appellant and the Crown would not be prejudiced by the court doing so. She concluded that the trial judge had failed to consider several breaches of the appellants ss. 8 and 9 rights: the pat-down search; the search of the truck and its contents; the three arrests; and the detention which continued when the police placed the appellant in the police vehicle, handcuffed him, and detained him at the police detachment. Khullar J.A. considered these breaches at the second stage of the s. 24(2) test and determined that the impact of the breaches on the appellants Charter-protected interests strongly favoured exclusion of the evidence. On balance, the factors pulled toward exclusion.\nIssues\nThis appeal raises the following two issues.\nFirst, should this Court consider the new issues raised by the appellant for the first time at the Alberta Court of Appeal?\nSecond, did the trial judge properly consider all of the relevant Charter-infringing state conduct? Answering this raises two further questions. First, did the police commit further breaches of the appellants Charter rights by relying on the results of the unlawful sniffer dog search? And second, if so, how are these breaches to be factored into the s. 24(2) analysis?\nAnalysis\nNew Issues on Appeal\nThe trial judge, based on the arguments before her, found two breaches of the Charter: s. 8 was breached, by virtue of the unlawful sniffer dog search, and s. 9 was breached, by virtue of the roadside investigative detention leading up to and during the sniffer dog search. On appeal before the Alberta Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the trial judge had failed to consider several other breaches of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter (paras. 43-44). These arguments engaged new issues beyond those raised at the voir dire. \nThe appellant asks this Court to consider the new issues which the majority below declined to address, arguing that there is a sufficient record, no prejudice to the respondent, the Crown, and that a purposive and generous approach to the Charter requires the court to consider whether other state action constituted a breach of the appellants Charter rights. The Crown, on the other hand, argues that the record is insufficient to address the new issues because it could have elicited additional evidence in order to flesh out the record on several points, including the scope of the pat-down search, the reasons why Constable MacPhail placed the appellant in the back of the police car, and the circumstances of the appellants detention at the station (R.F., at para. 47). In addition, the Crown argues it would be unfair to allow the appellant to shift so far from his trial strategy and that there is no broader interest served by addressing the new issues. \nThis Court has made clear that such new issues should be entertained only in exceptional circumstances (R. v. J.F., 2022 SCC 17, at para. 40, citing Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3). Nevertheless, we conclude that the issue of whether police conduct in this case breached s. 8 or 9 of the Charter should be considered by this Court. The legal question on which the Court of Appeal diverged requires this Court to consider the dissenting judges path of reasoning.\nLike Khullar J.A., we are of the view that addressing this issue would not result in unfairness to the Crown. The appellant, in making his argument, alleges nothing further other than the fact that [the arrests, searches, and detention in question] occurred (A.F., at para. 70). The Crown does not dispute that these events occurred. At the voir dire, the Crown adduced evidence from the arresting officer Constable MacPhail, the backup officer, and the dog handler. In the Court of Appeal, the Crown did not suggest it would have called any further evidence, except in relation to the strip search, which is no longer at issue (C.A. reasons, at para. 48). With respect to the legal issues before this Court, the Crown has had ample opportunity to respond to the positions taken in the reasons for the majority and the dissent in the Court of Appeal. \nThe appellants arguments rely on undisputed facts relating to his arrest; they can therefore be fairly considered on appeal. Given that no further evidence was given on these events, however, the Court will only consider the bare fact that this police conduct occurred. In other words, while it is appropriate for this Court to consider the fact of the appellants arrest after the sniffer search, there were neither submissions nor evidence seeking to establish any circumstances of the arrest that were improper. In this way, no prejudice results to the Crown. Given the absence of prejudice, the importance of having the issue resolved by this Court, and with the benefit of the dissenting reasons below, we would exercise our discretion to address this new issue (see Guindon, at para. 20; see also J.F., at paras. 40-41).\nArrests Made as a Consequence of a Charter Breach\nThis appeal raises the question of whether the police breached the appellants Charter rights by arresting him based on the results of an unlawful search. Lower courts across the country have reached divergent conclusions on the question of whether such arrests are lawful. As we will explain, a principled approach to the Charter mandates that police cannot rely on unlawfully obtained evidence in order to conduct a warrantless arrest. Where the grounds for arrest are based on evidence that is subsequently found to have been unlawfully obtained, the court must excise this evidence from the factual matrix in order to determine whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.\nIn R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, this Court explained that in order to safeguard the liberty of Canadians, the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, sets out strict standards for when police may exercise powers of arrest. In order to obtain a warrant for arrest, the police must demonstrate that they have reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person they are seeking to arrest has committed an offence. Section 507 of the Code provides for a review mechanism whereby a justice, upon receipt of an information, determines whether the requisite grounds for arrest have been made out.\nThe same standard of reasonable and probable grounds applies where the police arrest an individual without a warrant (Storrey, at p. 249). Section 495(1)(a) of the Code grants police the power to arrest individuals without judicial authorization if, on reasonable grounds, the police believe the person has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence. The test for whether the police were acting within their authority to conduct a warrantless arrest has both a subjective and an objective component (pp. 250-51). Subjectively, the arresting officer must honestly believe that the suspect committed the offence in question. In addition, those subjective grounds must be justifiable from an objective point of view. In evaluating whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds for arrest, the court must conduct the analysis from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the arresting officer (R. v. Beaver, 2022 SCC 54, at para. 72).\nIn considering whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant in this case, Khullar J.A. concluded that reasonable and probable ground[s] cannot be supplied by the results of an unlawful sniffer dog search (para. 54). We agree.\nThe conclusion that reasonable grounds for lawful arrest cannot be supplied by actions that involved violations of the Charter accords with principle and policy. Indeed, this conclusion is a logical extension of the applicable principles in other contexts where an initial Charter breach forms the basis for subsequent state action. An unlawful search, for example, cannot furnish the requisite grounds for a search warrant (R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, at para. 59). Similarly, a lawful arrest is a pre-requisite for any search conducted incident to it (R. v. Stillman, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607, at para. 27; R. v. Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at paras. 13-14; R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at paras. 49-50). \nThis Court in R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, explained the rationale that animates this rule in the search warrant context: in excluding justification for state conduct that is itself unconstitutional, the state is prevented from benefiting from the illegal acts of police officers (p. 251). In the same vein, a search incident to arrest is invalid if the arrest was not lawful because the legality of the search is derived from the legality of arrest [and] if the arrest is later found to be invalid, the search will be also (Caslake, at para. 13).\nThe need to ensure that the state cannot rely on conduct that violates the Charter applies regardless of whether the police are knowingly in breach of the law. The policy rationale is two-fold. \nFirst, respect for the Charter and robust protection of civil liberties mandates that the state not be permitted to minimize the impact of earlier unconstitutional actions that lead to a cascading series of well-meaning investigative steps. To allow the police to rely on their misconduct in such a way would fail to give meaningful effect to rights protected under the Charter. \nFurthermore, allowing the state to rely on Charter violations through the back door could incentivize police to be less careful in adherence to the law. For example, as this Court held in Tim, at para. 30: \nAllowing the police to arrest someone based on what they believe the law is  rather than based on what the law actually is  would dramatically expand police powers at the expense of civil liberties. This would leave people at the mercy of what particular police officers happen to understand the law to be and would create disincentives for the police to know the law. Canadians rightly expect the police to follow the law . . . . \nWhile the fact that the police erred unknowingly or in good faith will be considered at the s. 24(2) stage, it has no bearing on whether there has been a further violation of the Charter as a consequence of the initial misconduct.\nThis conclusion is also supported by the preponderance of the jurisprudence. In R. v. Monney (1997), 153 D.L.R. (4th) 617 (Ont. C.A.), revd on other grounds [1999] 1 S.C.R. 652, the Court of Appeal for Ontario analogized the warrantless arrest context to search warrants. Rosenberg J.A., writing for the majority of the court, concluded that, similarly, when considering the validity of a warrantless arrest, facts obtained as a result of a breach of the Charter . . . are excised from the [grounds for arrest]. The court must then determine whether the [arrest would have been valid] without the improperly obtained facts (para. 98).\nIn R. v. MacEachern, 2007 NSCA 69, 255 N.S.R. (2d) 180, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal accepted the Crowns concession that the arrest in question was unlawful in light of it being based on an earlier breach of s. 10(b) of the Charter. In that case, a sniffer dog detected drugs in the appellants backpack. The police detained and questioned the appellant without informing him of his right to counsel. In response to his answers to police, the appellant was arrested for possession. The Crown conceded in its factum on appeal that without the appellants responses to the police, the officer did not have a subjective belief that the appellant was illegally in possession of drugs and had thereby committed an offence. The court agreed with the Crown that as a result, the arrest was unlawful. \nIn R. v. Blanchard, 2011 NLCA 33, 308 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal agreed with the court below that as the initial sniffer dog search of the appellants car was unlawful and led to a further search and arrest, the subsequent search and arrest were also in violation of the Charter (para. 34). Both the search warrant and the warrantless arrest were based on the results of the illegal sniff search (para. 13). The Court of Appeal characterized these breaches as a cascade of Charter violations (para. 34). \nSimilarly, in R. v. Pelucco, 2015 BCCA 370, 327 C.C.C. (3d) 151, the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge that the arrest at issue was unlawful, given that it was based on evidence that had been discovered unlawfully. In that case, unbeknownst to the appellant, the police had seized the cellphone of the person to whom he was arranging to sell cocaine. When the appellant arrived to complete the sale, he was arrested and drugs were found in his truck as well as, following execution of a search warrant, his home. The trial judge concluded that the search and seizure of the original buyers cellphone was unlawful, as was the search of the appellants vehicle and backpack. Therefore, the arrest, which was based on evidence uncovered from these unlawful searches, was also unlawful (para. 23). The Court of Appeal agreed (para. 72).\nFinally, we note that this Court has endorsed similar reasoning. In R. v. Chaisson, 2006 SCC 11, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 415, a police officer became suspicious when he noticed the appellant and a passenger sitting in a dark car behind a closed service station. When he approached the vehicle, he saw the occupants react with shock and thought he saw the appellant throw something to the other side of the car. He ordered the occupants to exit the vehicle, detaining them, and arrested the appellant after seeing a bag of marijuana in the car. The trial judge concluded that the appellants rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10(b) of the Charter had been violated: . . . but for the [arbitrary] detention the marijuana [found by the police officer] on the floor [of the appellants automobile] would not have been discovered and but for the marijuana on the floor being discovered, there would have been no right to arrest these men (para. 4). This Court held that the trial judge was entitled to conclude on the facts as stated that the appellants ss. 8, 9 and 10(b) rights had been violated (para. 7).\nWhile some courts have reached the opposite conclusion on this question, we do not find their reasoning persuasive. The intervener the Attorney General of Alberta points to the recent decision of R. v. Love, 2022 ABCA 269, [2023] 1 W.W.R. 296, in which the Alberta Court of Appeal declined to apply the automatic excision rule to grounds for arrest premised on unlawful searches. The Court of Appeal based its decision on criticism of the automatic excision rule in the search warrant context and its conclusion that automatic excision in the arrest context would nullify the subjective focus [and objective aspect] of the Storrey test (para. 94).\nThe rule that reasonable and probable grounds for arrest cannot be supplied by the results of unconstitutional state conduct does not conflict with the test set out in Storrey. As set out above, the Storrey test requires that the police have a subjective belief, that is also objectively reasonable, that the arrestee has committed an offence. The onus is on the state to establish that these grounds exist (Storrey, p. 250). In order to ensure that the state is not able to rely on violations of the Charter, the reviewing judge must excise evidence that has been unconstitutionally obtained at the outset of this inquiry. Once this evidence has been removed from the factual matrix, the court applies the Storrey test to determine whether reasonable and probable grounds exist, having regard to both the subjective and objective components. In this inquiry, the court considers the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest, but does not include evidence found to have been unconstitutionally obtained.\nBoth the Attorney General of Alberta in its intervener submissions and the Alberta Court of Appeal in Love emphasize that unlike when drafting an information to obtain a search warrant, warrantless arrests are often carried out in dynamic situations (I.F., at para. 37; Love, at paras. 91-92). This is true. Nonetheless, the purpose of preventing police from being able to rely on unlawful conduct is not to prevent them from acting in the dynamics of the moment. The same constraint that should guide police in their interactions with individuals continues to apply: such actions must comply with the Charter. Thus, police are not required to take an additional step to inquire into the constitutionality of prior investigative steps before acting on the information they yielded (Love, at para. 92; see also I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at para. 18, arguing this suggests police should be required to stop their investigation). Rather, police have been and continue to be required to consider whether they are acting within constitutional limits when they act. In short, the police need to respond to exigencies, but in doing so must be mindful of the authority that the law confers and also the constraints that the law imposes.\nCanadians have a legitimate expectation that the police will know and comply with the law, especially the Charter (Tim, at para. 30; Kosoian v. Societe de transport de Montreal, 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 335, at para. 6; R. v. McGuffie, 2016 ONCA 365, 131 O.R. (3d) 643, at para. 67). This applies no less in dynamic situations. As this Court highlighted in Storrey, [i]n the case of an arrest made without a warrant, it is even more important for the police to demonstrate that they have those same reasonable and probable grounds upon which they base the arrest (p. 249 (emphasis added); see also S. Coughlan and G. Luther, Detention and Arrest (2nd ed. 2017), at p. 91). This rule is also consistent with the principles that apply in the search warrant and search incident to arrest contexts.\nBefore turning to how breaches of the Charter resulting from earlier breaches are to be factored into the s. 24(2) analysis, we pause to note the important difference between excision and exclusion. Where grounds for arrest are based on unconstitutionally obtained evidence, that evidence is to be excised from the factual matrix. However, we leave open the possibility of situations where, even after this evidence is excised, the arresting officer still meets the standard of reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. For example, if police arrest an individual after conducting an unlawful search, but the evidence uncovered from the search is only one contributing factor to the decision to arrest, the arrest will still be lawful if the balance of the evidence suffices to establish reasonable and probable grounds.\nThe automatic excision rule also does not, as suggested by the Attorney General of Ontario, create categorical rules of exclusion (I.F., at para. 16). The question of whether there has been a violation of the Charter is distinct from whether the evidence obtained as a result of that violation should be excluded from trial. The latter question is dealt with at the s. 24(2) stage, where the court considers the totality of the circumstances in order to determine, on balance, whether admission of the evidence will bring the administration of justice into disrepute. \nWe turn now to how this analysis is to be undertaken, with a brief note on terminology.\nAn Unlawful Arrest as a Consequential Breach in the Section 24(2) Analysis\nWhere an arrest is unlawful because it is premised on the results of a Charter breach, it is the initial Charter breach that renders what follows unlawful. In other words, there is a situation of linked or cascading Charter breaches (see Blanchard, at para. 34). We use the term consequential to refer to such breaches in the s. 24(2) analysis because the subsequent arrest is unlawful only as a consequence of the initial breach or breaches that preceded it. \nImportantly, an arrest that can be viewed only as a consequential breach is distinct from state action that is characterized by additional or independent misconduct, including conduct that can be considered an independent breach of the Charter (such as failing to give an arbitrarily detained accused their right to counsel upon arrest). In those circumstances, the subsequent state action is of a different character and will be factored into the s. 24(2) analysis differently. \nA pattern of Charter breaches, for example, may cumulatively increase the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct (see R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353 (Grant 2009), at para. 75). Some factual scenarios will raise the issue of cumulative breaches, which may evidence a pattern of misconduct, rather than consequential ones alone, which will likely not (see R. v. Lambert, 2020 NSPC 37, 472 C.R.R. (2d) 1, at paras. 361-65, affd 2023 NSCA 8, at paras. 92-103 (CanLII); R. v. Lauriente, 2010 BCCA 72, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 492, at paras. 12 and 30; R. v. Kossick, 2017 SKPC 67, 392 C.R.R. (2d) 250, at paras. 97-98 and 126, affd 2018 SKCA 55, 365 C.C.C. (3d) 186; R. v. White, 2022 NSCA 61, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 123, at paras. 44-61; Monney, at para. 120; M. Asma and M. Gourlay, Charter Remedies in Criminal Cases (2nd ed. 2023), at p. 51). \nHaving set out the foregoing distinction, we now address how such an unlawful arrest  which is a breach only by consequence of its connection to an unlawful search, and which demonstrates no additional state misconduct  should be factored into the s. 24(2) Grant analysis. \nThe Section 24(2) Grant Analysis\nThe Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing State Conduct\nThe first line of inquiry under s. 24(2) asks whether the Charterinfringing state conduct is so serious that the court must dissociate itself from it. The spectrum of seriousness involves, at one end, inadvertent or minor violations of the Charter and, at the other, wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights (Grant 2009, at para. 74; see also Beaver, at para. 120). \nAn unlawful arrest that is a consequential breach must be factored into the first and second stages of the s. 24(2) analysis, but is unlikely to significantly impact the overall seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct. In the absence of additional state misconduct, the focal point for evaluating seriousness is likely to remain the initial breach: in this case, the preceding unlawful search. Where, as in this case, the police conduct is only off the mark to a miniscule degree, the seriousness of the initial breach will tend to be on the lower end of the scale. However, in other cases, the initial misconduct may be characterized as more serious; for example, if the police conduct was still inadvertent but further off the mark. In the latter case, while the consequential arrest would still be unlikely to significantly increase the overall seriousness of the misconduct, the seriousness would already be more severe given the focus on the initial breach. \nThis is consistent with the approach followed in other cases. For example, where a search incident to arrest has been found unlawful only by virtue of the unlawfulness of the preceding arrest and the arrest evidences no other misconduct, greater emphasis is likely to be placed on the arrest itself rather than the unremarkable or normal consequences of the arrest that follow (see R. v. Loewen, 2018 SKCA 69, [2018] 12 W.W.R. 280, at paras. 77-78; see also Tim, at paras. 49-50 and 84-87). Where it is only the connection to the initial Charter breach that is the source of the misconduct, and where the police honestly believe they are proceeding lawfully, subsequent state conduct is unlikely to meaningfully increase the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct.\nAt the same time, we do not rule out the possibility that where the initial breach involves deliberate, intentional, or flagrant state misconduct, subsequent actions taken as a consequence of that initial breach may increase the overall seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct. The s. 24(2) analysis, of course, will depend on the facts of the case, and all cases will require an evaluation of the seriousness of the state conduct that led to the breach (Grant 2009, at para. 73). But where the police honestly believe that they have not committed any initial breach, actions taken on the basis of that initial breach are, to their mind, lawful, and do not demonstrate any heightened disregard for Charter rights or the law. In such a case, the subsequent state action or consequential breach is not deliberate, and therefore should be situated on the less serious end of the scale of culpability (see Tim, at para. 82). \nThe Impact on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused\nThe impact on the Charter-protected interests of the accused is distinct from the seriousness of the Charter-infringing conduct. As this Court stated in Grant 2009, in order to assess this factor, the court must look to the interests engaged by the infringed right and examine the degree to which the violation impacted on those interests (para. 77).\nWhen additional rights and breaches of those rights are factored into the s. 24(2) analysis, there will necessarily be a more significant impact on the accused that is therefore relevant to the analysis of the second Grant factor. Consideration of all breaches as found is necessary to get an accurate picture of the effects of the breaches (C.A. reasons, at para. 51). Section 24(2) of the Charter requires regard to all the circumstances. To fail to have regard to the impact of an arrest on an accused where it occurred as a consequence of a preceding Charter breach would fail to take into account all the circumstances. The arrest here was unlawful and, therefore, must form part of the s. 24(2) analysis.\nAccordingly, we reject the Crown and interveners view that we should adopt the approach set out by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Jennings, 2018 ONCA 260, 45 C.R. (7th) 224. In Jennings, the court in obiter reasoned that, for s. 8 breaches in breath sample cases, it would be incorrect in the s. 24(2) analysis to consider not just the impact of the administration of the breath sample procedure, which is itself minimally intrusive, but the entirety of the procedure faced by the accused after arrest because that would create a categorical rule of exclusion (paras. 27 and 32). Thus, we would not adopt the approach suggested in Jennings in this case. Rather, where a court finds that an arrest is made in breach of the Charter, it will be necessary to consider such a breach in the s. 24(2) analysis, including the impacts on the accuseds Charter-protected interests (see R. v. Reilly, 2021 SCC 38, at para. 3; see also R. v. Au-Yeung, 2010 ONSC 2292, 209 C.R.R. (2d) 140, at paras. 41, 50 and 59). This will be the case whether or not the unlawful arrest can be considered to be a consequential breach.\nSocietys Interest in an Adjudication on the Merits\nThe third factor looks to societys interest more broadly, focusing on the truth-seeking function of a criminal trial (Grant 2009, at para. 79). The court considers factors such as the reliability of the evidence, the importance of the evidence to the Crowns case, and the seriousness of the alleged offence (R. v. McColman, 2023 SCC 8, at para. 70). In our view, and in the absence of arguments on this point, consideration of conduct like the additional breaches in this case would not change the analysis for the third Grant factor. \nSummary\nThe foregoing is meant to offer guidance in specific situations. A consequential breach is not a new type of Charter breach. It will not be necessary or useful in every case to determine whether the sequence of state conduct presents a consequential breach. But this operates as guidance for cases where an arrest follows as a consequence of a search, and both are viewed as unlawful on judicial review. In these cases, the court must assess the seriousness of both the search and the arrest. The arrest, given that it is expected in the circumstances, is unlikely to significantly increase the overall seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct, but it will often result in a more significant impact on the individuals Charter-protected interests. In this way, the s. 24(2) analysis does not become a rule of automatic exclusion, while at the same time, the court takes fully into account the impact on the Charter-protected interests of the accused. \nApplication\nHaving set out the relevant principles, we now apply those principles in the circumstances of this case. \nThe Additional Charter Breaches\nTurning first to the violation stage, it is useful to recall the three arrests that took place in this case: (i) the first arrest for possession, based on the results of the sniffer dog search; (ii) the second arrest for possession for the purpose of trafficking, based on the searches (incident to arrest) of the interior of the vehicle and the duffel bags; and (iii) the third arrest for possession of proceeds of crime, also based on the search incident to arrest of the vehicle and its contents.\nConstable MacPhail testified to his grounds for the first arrest on the voir dire: I was told by [the officer who deployed the sniffer dog] that I could place the accused under arrest for possession of a controlled substance, as his sniffer dog had provided a positive indication and sit confirmation to an odour of a controlled substance inside the vehicle (A.R., vol. II, at p. 38). In other words, Constable MacPhails subjective belief that the appellant was in possession of a controlled substance relied primarily on the results of the sniffer dog search. As the trial judges conclusion that this sniffer search was unlawful is not at issue, we conclude that the subsequent arrest for possession was also unlawful. Without the sniffer dog search, the police would not have had reasonable and probable grounds for arrest.\nIt is settled law that a lawful arrest is a prerequisite to a valid search incident to arrest (Stillman, at para. 27; Caslake, at paras. 13-14; Tim, at paras. 49-50). Therefore, in light of our conclusion that the first arrest was unlawful, we agree with Khullar J.A. that the searches of the cab of the truck, the box of the truck, and the duffel bags inside the vehicle incident to arrest were also unlawful and constituted a further breach of s. 8 of the Charter.\nFinally, given our conclusion that an unlawful search cannot provide the requisite grounds for an arrest, the second and third arrests are also unlawful. They were based on the results of these unlawful incidental searches. Without the unlawful searches, the police would not have had the requisite grounds for either arrest. The three arrests in this case therefore constituted further breaches of s. 9 of the Charter. The placement of the appellant in the police vehicle (with handcuffs after the first arrest) and at the police detachment are further continuations of the s. 9 breaches occasioned by the arrests and investigative detention.\nThe Section 24(2) Grant Analysis \nHaving determined that the arrests and the incidental searches constituted breaches of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, those breaches must be factored into the s. 24(2) analysis. In addition, the Court of Appeal was correct to note, unanimously, that the trial judge erred in failing to consider in her s. 24(2) analysis the s. 9 breach she found, relating to the investigative detention. Where the trial judge has failed to consider a relevant factor, it is necessary to perform a fresh s. 24(2) analysis (R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 67). Within this fresh analysis, the trial judges findings of fact remain relevant and warrant deference, absent palpable and overriding error (see Grant 2009, at para. 129; Beaver, at para. 118). \nThe Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing State Conduct\nThe trial judge found that Constable MacPhail knew the applicable standard and sought to apply it, and that he was only off the mark to a miniscule degree. In her words, there was no evidence of a deliberate or systemic breach (A.R., vol. I, at p. 20). Although the trial judge failed to include the investigative detention in her s. 24(2) analysis, her findings on the sniffer search remain relevant, given that both state actions share the requisite standard of reasonable suspicion. This finding  that Constable MacPhail was extremely close to the standard of reasonable suspicion  reduces the seriousness of both the unlawful sniffer search and the investigative detention, the two Charter breaches she found (see, e.g., R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220; R. v. MacKenzie, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250).\nOn appeal, this Court has recognized that additional Charter breaches occurred in the sequence of events: the arrest which followed as a consequence of the sniffer search; the searches that followed incident to arrest; and the additional arrests that followed from those searches. There was nothing to indicate that those breaches were state misconduct, save that they were consequential on the sniffer search being unlawful. It was entirely unremarkable, for example, that the police would arrest the appellant after finding over 100 pounds of cannabis in his vehicle. The arrests (and searches incident) were not characterized by additional or independent misconduct. \nFurther, the Charter breaches identified by the trial judge were not found to be intentional; it could not be said the police knew from the outset that they were acting beyond their lawful authority. Importantly, these additional breaches were breaches only because of the officers miscalculation in assessing the grounds for suspicion. These additional consequential breaches, therefore, do not raise the seriousness of the state conduct in this case; the focal point of this analysis remains the initial breaches that set the sequence of state conduct into motion. \nThe Charter-infringing state conduct in this case was inadvertent and not wilful; it does not show a pattern or attitude of disregard for the appellants Charter rights or the law. Therefore, even considering the additional breaches on appeal, this factor does not strongly favour exclusion. \nThe Impact on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused\nFirst, in terms of the breaches found by the trial judge, the sniffer dog search was of a relatively brief and non-intrusive nature (MacKenzie, at para. 133, per LeBel J., dissenting). Where a s. 8 violation has occurred, this inquiry focuses on the protected interests of privacy, and more broadly, human dignity (Grant 2009, at para. 78; R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 91; R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 136). This Court has found that sniff searches are minimally intrusive (Chehil, at paras. 1 and 28; MacKenzie, at para. 86). As the trial judge noted, this search of the exterior of the appellants motor vehicle occurred on a public highway, which is a relevant factor.\nThe s. 9 violations engage concerns over protecting the appellants individual liberty from unjustified state interference (Grant 2009, at para. 20; Le, at para. 152; Beaver, at para. 127). While the investigative detention unlawfully restricted the appellants liberty and movement, the appellant was first lawfully detained for the traffic infractions (see Tim, at para. 92). While the sniffer dog search prolonged this detention, the fact that the appellant was lawfully stopped in the first place remains relevant. \nSecond, while the additional breaches found on appeal did not heighten the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct under the first Grant factor, they necessarily result in a more significant impact for the second Grant factor, the Charter-protected interests of the accused. As in McColman, as a result of the investigative detention and sniffer dog search, the appellant was arrested, and then brought to the police station, where he was detained for several hours. The undisputed circumstances of this arrest (including the fact that he was handcuffed) are relevant to assessing the impact on his liberty. In terms of his privacy interests, the police obtained significant evidence against the appellant. Unlike in McColman, the police in this case went further and conducted a search of the appellants vehicle and its contents (including duffel bags). This Court has held that motorists have a reduced expectation of privacy in their vehicles (R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at para. 30; Tim, at para. 93). The search of the duffel bags involves a greater intrusion on the appellants privacy interests. \nTaken together, the arrests and searches which flowed from those arrests resulted in a more significant impact on the appellants privacy, liberty, and dignity. The second Grant factor, therefore, moderately favours exclusion. \nSocietys Interest in an Adjudication on the Merits\nThe evidence in this case  the drugs, drug paraphernalia, and cash  was real, reliable, and crucial to the Crowns case. Given the large quantity of cannabis (over 100 pounds), this is a serious offence. Both of these elements mean that there is a strong societal interest in adjudication of the case on its merits. This remains so even when the additional breaches are factored in. This third Grant factor, therefore, strongly favours admission of the evidence. \nBalancing\nThe first two Grant factors favour exclusion, albeit not strongly for the first and moderately for the second. We pause to note, briefly, that it was incorrect for the dissenting judge to state that either of the first Grant factors would favour admission (C.A. reasons, at para. 63). The first two branches never favour admission  at most, they can weakly favour exclusion (see Le, at para. 141). \nAs mentioned, the third Grant factor tends strongly in favour of admission of the evidence. The pull of the first two factors in this case is insufficient to outweigh the third; thus, overall the circumstances favour admission. This conclusion is consistent with other decisions of this Court that involved a less serious Charter breach, a significant or moderately intrusive impact, and evidence that was real, reliable, and crucial to the Crowns case (see, e.g., Grant 2009, at para. 140; Vu, at para. 74). Thus, having balanced the factors, we would affirm the decision to admit the evidence and dismiss the appeal.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nI agree with my colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. that the appeal from the Alberta Court of Appeals decision (2022 ABCA 112, 44 Alta. L.R. (7th) 5) should be dismissed. However, I do not agree with their proposition that the state cannot rely on unlawfully obtained evidence to satisfy the reasonable and probable grounds requirement for arrest (para. 2; see also Martin and Kasirer JJ.s reasons, at para. 107). While this Court has never directly considered the issue, my colleagues position is, in my respectful view, difficult to reconcile with both (1) this Courts longstanding jurisprudence on s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and (2) the framework for warrantless arrests set out in R. v. Storrey, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241.\nFirst, a Charter breach that leads to incriminating evidence being uncovered will inevitably result in an arrest or other investigative steps by the police. Absent independent or additional police misconduct, this Court has never treated such arrests or investigative steps as separate Charter breaches in its s. 24(2) analysis.\nSecond, the objective judicial assessment of a police officers subjective grounds for a warrantless arrest must be based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest (R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 24, citing Storrey, at pp. 250-51). In evaluating the officers objective grounds for arrest, courts must recognize that, [o]ften, the officers decision to arrest must be made quickly in volatile and rapidly changing situations. Judicial reflection is not a luxury the officer can afford. The officer must make his or her decision based on available information which is often less than exact or complete (R. v. Beaver, 2022 SCC 54, at para. 72, quoting R. v. Golub (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 743 (C.A.), at p. 750, per Doherty J.A.).\nIn this case, my four colleagues view of whether Cst. MacPhail had reasonable and probable grounds for arrest is not based on the circumstances known to him at the time of the arrest, which included the sniffer dogs clear and unequivocal indication of controlled substances in the appellants vehicle. Rather, it hinges entirely on a retroactive judicial assessment of the lawfulness of the sniff search. However, the focus of this Courts s. 24(2) analysis should be  and always has been  on that initial search (and in this case, the accompanying investigative detention while awaiting the arrival of the dog). The presence of additional breaches was not argued at trial and has little, if any, impact on Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s s. 24(2) analysis, with which I am in substantial agreement. I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the appellants conviction.\nAnalysis\nMy colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. restate their conclusion as follows: . . . reasonable [and probable] grounds for lawful arrest cannot be supplied by actions that involved violations of the Charter . . . (para. 30; see Martin and Kasirer JJ.s reasons, at para. 107, where this sound proposition is endorsed). They view this conclusion as a logical extension of the principles applicable in other contexts where an initial Charter breach forms the basis for subsequent state action, referring in this regard to search warrants and searches incident to arrest (Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s reasons, at para. 30, citing R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13; R. v. Stillman, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607; R. v. Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51; Tim).\nTo understand why these contexts are distinguishable, it is necessary to review this Courts s. 24(2) jurisprudence and its jurisprudence relating to Storrey in some detail. I consider each in turn below before discussing the implications of my colleagues approach.\nSection 24(2) of the Charter\nOur Courts Section 24(2) Jurisprudence\nIf, as my colleagues conclude, a lawful arrest cannot be based on unlawfully obtained evidence, then this Court has neglected or failed to consider a host of additional Charter breaches throughout its s. 24(2) jurisprudence. The accuseds arrest  made directly on the basis of unlawfully obtained evidence  would have been a Charter breach in, among others, R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353 (Grant 2009); R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494; R. v. Cote, 2011 SCC 46, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 215; R. v. Aucoin, 2012 SCC 66, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 408; R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202; R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692; R. v. Lafrance, 2022 SCC 32; and R. v. McColman, 2023 SCC 8. More particularly, Grant 2009, Harrison, and, most recently, McColman serve to illustrate this point.\nGrant 2009\nIn Grant 2009, the accused was arbitrarily detained by the police at the side of the road. During his unlawful detention, he admitted to having a firearm. He was then arrested and searched by the police, who seized a loaded revolver (paras. 7-8). Writing for the majority of the Court, McLachlin C.J. and Charron J. identified two Charter violations: the initial arbitrary detention (s. 9), and the corresponding breach of the accuseds s. 10(b) right to counsel while the police officer was probing for answers that would give him grounds for search or arrest (paras. 135-36). Though it did not explicitly consider the issue, the Court did not treat the polices subsequent arrest or search as unlawful in its s. 24(2) analysis (paras. 131-40).\nHarrison\nIn Harrison, the companion appeal to Grant 2009, the police arbitrarily detained the accused during an unlawful traffic stop. The accused was unable to provide his drivers licence. The police ran a computer check and learned that he was driving while his licence was suspended, for which he was arrested. The police then searched the vehicle incident to arrest, ostensibly for the appellants missing drivers licence, even though its whereabouts was irrelevant to the charge of driving while suspended (para. 8). During that search, the police found two boxes of cocaine and arrested the appellant on drug charges as well (para. 9). Writing for the majority of the Court, McLachlin C.J. held that [t]he Charter breaches in this case are clear: (1) the initial detention on the side of the road, and (2) the search of the vehicle, which was not incidental to the appellants arrest for driving with a suspended licence (para. 20). As in Grant 2009, McLachlin C.J. did not factor in either of the accuseds arrests as separate or additional Charter breaches in her s. 24(2) analysis, although she ultimately excluded the cocaine evidence.\nMcColman\nMost recently, in McColman, the police unlawfully detained the accused on his driveway. As a result of the unlawful stop, Mr. McColman was arrested and brought to the police station, where he was detained for several hours [and] [t]he police obtained significant evidence against him (para. 68), including the inculpatory results of two breathalyzer tests. The sole Charter breach identified by Wagner C.J. and OBonsawin J., writing for a unanimous Court, was the accuseds arbitrary detention prior to his arrest (see paras. 51-52). While the Court considered the circumstances of the subsequent breathalyzer tests and arrest of the accused in its analysis of the factors outlined in Grant 2009 (see para. 68), it did not treat those breathalyzer tests or that arrest as Charter breaches.\nSection 8\nIn each of Grant 2009, Harrison, and McColman, the incriminating evidence flowed from an initial unlawful detention. The approach of my four colleagues in the instant case is also inconsistent with how our Court has treated unlawful searches that uncover evidence of a crime. In their view, every s. 8 breach would become a breach of both s. 8 and s. 9 if the search resulted in an arrest. This is not supported by our Courts jurisprudence; for example, in Paterson, the Court treated an unlawful search that uncovered a firearm and drugs and resulted in the accuseds arrest solely as a breach of s. 8 (see paras. 2 and 41-57).\nThat being said, it may happen that the police commit additional or independent Charter breaches during their investigation. If so, those breaches must and will be considered in the s. 24(2) analysis; this will be the case, for example, if an accused is subsequently denied the right to counsel upon arrest or is unreasonably searched incident to their arrest.\nSniff Searches\nOur Court has considered the legality of sniffer dog searches on multiple occasions. It has affirmed that sniff searches are a minimally privacy intrusive form of search (see R. v. Chehil, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at paras. 1 and 28; R. v. MacKenzie, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 86). Indeed, it is because of the minimally intrusive, narrowly targeted, and highly accurate nature of sniff searches that only a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity is required to justify their use (Chehil, at para. 28, citing Binnie J. in R. v. Kang-Brown, 2008 SCC 18, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 456, at para. 60; R. v. A.M., 2008 SCC 19, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 569, at paras. 81-84).\nA unanimous Court in Chehil, and a majority of the Court in MacKenzie, held that the sniff searches at issue were lawful and did not breach s. 8. The Court therefore did not need to consider s. 24(2) or the issues arising in this appeal. However, in MacKenzie, the four dissenting judges who did find the sniff search to be a breach of s. 8 (LeBel J., together with McLachlin C.J. and Fish and Cromwell JJ.) did not treat the accuseds arrest or any subsequent police conduct as unlawful. As in this case, the police arrested the accused and searched his car following a positive indication by the sniffer dog (paras. 19-21). LeBel J. identified two Charter breaches: the sniff search and the accompanying investigative detention (paras. 128-36).\nUnder the approach of my four colleagues in this case, LeBel J. should also have found that the appellants arrest, his ongoing detention, and all searches subsequent to the unlawful sniff search were Charter breaches. According to my colleagues Martin and Kasirer JJ., these additional breaches  all of which turn on whether the initial sniff search was lawful  would materially alter the result of the s. 24(2) analysis. I will consider the jurisprudential difficulties as well as the implications of this approach in more detail below.\nStorrey\nThe reasonable and probable grounds standard for a warrantless arrest was recently summarized in Tim, at para. 24, referring to Storrey, at pp. 250-51:\nA warrantless arrest requires both subjective and objective grounds. The arresting officer must subjectively have reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest, and those grounds must be justifiable from an objective viewpoint. The objective assessment is based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest, including the dynamics of the situation, as seen from the perspective of a reasonable person with comparable knowledge, training, and experience as the arresting officer. [Emphasis added.]\nIn Beaver, the Court affirmed that the analysis must be conducted from the perspective of a reasonable person standing in the shoes of the [arresting] officer (para. 72, citing Chehil, at paras. 45 and 47; MacKenzie, at para. 63). Writing for the majority, Jamal J., at para. 72, cited with approval part of the following passage from Golub, per Doherty J.A.:\nThe dynamics at play in an arrest situation are very different than those which operate on an application for a search warrant. Often, the officers decision to arrest must be made quickly in volatile and rapidly changing situations. Judicial reflection is not a luxury the officer can afford. The officer must make his or her decision based on available information which is often less than exact or complete. The law does not expect the same kind of inquiry of a police officer deciding whether to make an arrest that it demands of a justice faced with an application for a search warrant. [p. 750]\nIn R. v. Love, 2022 ABCA 269, [2023] 1 W.W.R. 296, the Court of Appeal of Alberta directly considered whether the logic behind the excision of unconstitutionally obtained information, in the search warrant context, should be applied to warrantless arrests. The Court of Appeal concluded that the automatic excision rule, if applied to the context of warrantless arrests, would conflict with Storrey:\nAutomatic excision, operating after-the-fact, would nullify the subjective focus of the Storrey test by artificially altering the information on which the arresting officer relied at the time. It would distort the objective aspect of the test by shifting the focus away from the factual basis for the officers action. It would conflict with the Supreme Courts direction that an officer exercising a warrantless power is entitled to disregard only information which he has good reason to believe is unreliable: Chehil at para 33. [para. 94]\nI agree. On my colleagues approach, the assessment of an officers grounds for arrest would no longer be based on the circumstances known to the officer at the time of the arrest (see Tim, at para. 24; Storrey, at pp. 250-51; MacKenzie, at para. 33; Beaver, at paras. 72 and 88; and Golub, p. 750). Rather, their approach hinges entirely on a retroactive judicial assessment of the underlying sniff search.\nThis Court has made it clear that the reasonable and probable grounds standard relates to the facts, not to the existence in law of the offence in question (see Tim, at para. 28, quoting Kosoian v. Societe de transport de Montreal, 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 335, at para. 78; Frey v. Fedoruk, [1950] S.C.R. 517, at p. 531). Judicial reflection is not a luxury an officer can afford. It is artificial and inconsistent with the reasonable and probable grounds standard to hold that an arrest made based on clear and reliable evidence of a crime is unlawful. If that evidence is later determined to have been obtained through an unlawful search or detention, that search or detention will be properly evaluated in the s. 24(2) inquiry.\nWith this in mind, I would respectfully submit that it is understandable why this Court has declined, in the three decades since R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, to apply the logic behind excision to the context of warrantless arrests. Similarly, and with respect, my colleagues reliance on searches incident to arrest (see Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s reasons, at paras. 30-31; Martin and Kasirer JJ.s reasons, at para. 128) is misplaced. Because the common law power to search incident to arrest is derived solely from the legality of the arrest, if the arrest is later found to be invalid, the search will be also (Caslake, at para. 13; see also Golub, at pp. 753-54, per Doherty J.A.). By contrast, the legality of an arrest made based on the results of an unlawful search or detention is not derived solely from the basis for the underlying search or detention. The arrest is based on an additional factor  the discovery of the incriminating evidence itself. Again, if the underlying search or detention is subsequently found to be invalid, that breach will be properly assessed in the s. 24(2) inquiry.\nImplications for the Exclusion of Evidence Under Section 24(2)\nInevitably, an unlawful search or detention that uncovers evidence of a crime will result in an arrest or other investigative steps by the police. On my colleagues approach, what transforms the initial Charter violations  in this case, the unlawful sniff search and accompanying investigative detention  into a series or cascade of additional Charter breaches has nothing to do with any subsequent police misconduct. Rather, it depends entirely on whether the unlawful search or detention yields incriminating evidence and thus naturally results in an arrest. With respect, to classify all subsequent police conduct as Charter-infringing merely because it flows from the results of an initial breach comes dangerously close to the fruit of the poisoned tree doctrine eschewed by this Courts s. 24(2) jurisprudence.\nIn this regard, in R. v. Jennings, 2018 ONCA 260, 45 C.R. (7th) 224, the Court of Appeal for Ontario considered the Charter-protected interests at stake for those who provide a breath sample to police. Writing for the court, Miller J.A. (Watt and Hourigan JJ.A. concurring) reasoned that in Grant 2009, this Court expressly chose the breath sample procedure as an example of a minimally intrusive form of search (para. 29, citing Grant 2009, at paras. 106-11). He went on to state that this Court assuredly did so in the knowledge that most formal demands for breath samples would be accompanied by an arrest, i.e., for drivers who test above the legal limit (Jennings, at para. 29). Drivers in such cases are almost invariably arrested and taken to the police station to provide further breath samples (para. 32).\nLike the breath sample procedure, this Court has characterized sniff searches as a minimally intrusive form of search, and it has assuredly done so with the knowledge that a positive indication from a sniffer dog will lead to an arrest or other investigative steps by the police (see, e.g., Chehil, at para. 55). In their s. 24(2) analysis, my colleagues Martin and Kasirer JJ. do not refer to any of this Courts jurisprudence on sniff searches or address the relatively minimal impact of this form of search. With respect, their analysis runs contrary to a sound characterization of the Charter-protected interests at stake for an individual subject to a sniff search (see Chehil, para. 19; see also Kang-Brown; A.M.).\nMy colleagues Martin and Kasirer JJ. rely primarily on Tim and R. v. Reilly, 2021 SCC 38, for the undisputed proposition that all Charter breaches must be considered in the s. 24(2) analysis. But this proposition does not establish that certain police conduct constituted a Charter breach in the first place. Their approach is not consonant with Grant 2009, in which this Court did not treat the accuseds arrest and search as Charter violations by virtue of their connection to the initial breach. Likewise, the need to consider all the circumstances under s. 24(2) (see Martin and Kasirer JJ.s reasons, at paras. 111-15 and 129-33)  which, in my view, refers to the three avenues of inquiry set out in Grant 2009 (see para. 71)  does not mean that all of those circumstances amount to Charter breaches.\nMartin and Kasirer JJ.s emphasis on the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct in this case ignores the fact that all police conduct subsequent to the sniff search was based on an intervening factor  the discovery of incriminating evidence. The question at the first stage of the Grant 2009 analysis may be framed as follows: Did [the police conduct] involve misconduct from which the court should be concerned to dissociate itself? (McColman, at para. 57, quoting McLachlin C.J. in Harrison, at para. 22). In my view, an arrest made on the basis of clear and reliable evidence of a crime is not misconduct from which the court should be concerned to dissociate itself. The relevant misconduct in this case, from which the Court should be concerned to dissociate itself, is Cst. MacPhails initial decision to deploy a sniffer dog without lawful authority to do so.\nTo hold otherwise artificially distorts the s. 24(2) analysis and, I would respectfully submit, represents a shift towards automatic exclusionary rules that have been rejected in our jurisprudence. At the very least, the issues raised in this appeal merit attention by a full Court in a case where the additional breaches were argued and considered at trial.\nDisposition\nIn the result, labelling all police conduct subsequent to the sniff search in this case as unlawful does not change the outcome of Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s s. 24(2) analysis, with which I substantially agree. The trial judge correctly characterized Cst. MacPhails failure to meet the reasonable suspicion standard as miniscule (A.R., vol. I, at p. 20). At the first stage of the Grant 2009 analysis, the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct only weakly favours exclusion. At the second stage, I agree with my colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. that the impact on the appellant was moderate, bearing in mind the minimally intrusive nature of a sniff search and the reduced expectation of privacy in a motor vehicle (see Chehil, at para. 28; MacKenzie, at paras. 31, 86 and 133). The investigative detention was brief, necessary to facilitate deployment of the sniffer dog, and accompanied by the right to counsel. At the third stage, the evidence is both highly reliable and integral to the Crowns case, which strongly favours admission.\nOn balance, I would affirm the decision to admit the drug evidence, dismiss the appeal and uphold the appellants conviction.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\tMartin and Kasirer JJ.  \nOverview\nWe have had the advantage of reading the reasons of our colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. We agree with much of their reasons but, most respectfully, we disagree in the result. For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal, order the exclusion of the evidence, set aside the appellants conviction and enter an acquittal. \nFirst, we agree with our colleagues that in the circumstances of this case it is appropriate for the Court to exercise its discretion and consider the new issues raised on appeal, contrary to the reasoning of the majority at the Court of Appeal of Alberta. Second, we accept the sound proposition that a lawful arrest cannot be based on unlawful grounds, as Khullar J.A. (as she then was), dissenting at the Court of Appeal, would have held (2022 ABCA 112, 44 Alta. L.R. (7th) 5). More specifically, reasonable and probable grounds for arrest cannot be based on unconstitutional police misconduct. Third, we accept that the evidence at issue in this case was obtained in a manner that infringed each of the Charter rights that our colleagues recognize as violated, including each of the arrests and searches to which Mr. Zacharias was subject. Thus, like our colleagues and Khullar J.A. below, we conclude that the threshold requirement of the s. 24(2) analysis is met (see R. v. Plaha (2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 44, per Doherty J.A.). \nWe respectfully disagree, however, with both the courts below and our colleagues on the legal framework that governs how multiple, connected breaches factor into the evaluative stage of the s. 24(2) analysis governed by R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. We observe that neither the trial judge nor the majority judges in the Court of Appeal properly subjected all breaches of the accuseds Charter rights to complete scrutiny under s. 24(2). In fairness to the trial judge, we recognize that the additional breaches identified by Khullar J.A. and by this Court were not before her. However, the trial judge identified a breach of Mr. Zachariass s. 9 right, resulting from an unlawful investigative detention, and erred in law by not considering this breach within her s. 24(2) analysis. This approach is incompatible with the legal principles this Court articulated in Grant. All state conduct that undermines the rule of law by violating the Charter must be subject to proper judicial scrutiny under all three branches of that test. In our respectful view, our colleagues carry this error forward when they conclude that consequential breaches are unlikely to increase the overall seriousness of Charter-infringing state conduct unless those breaches reflect a pattern of misconduct or an independent wrong. Less exclusionary weight should not be attached to a breach in respect of any of the branches of the Grant test merely because a court has determined that it was consequential to another, earlier breach. \nThe fact that a consequential or cascading breach may be seen to be caused by an initial breach cannot obviate the need to factor it into the analysis and give full consideration to whether it reflects conduct from which courts must disassociate themselves (Grant, at para. 72). Even when a consequential breach discloses no independent misconduct it is nonetheless a breach of the rights that the Charter protects. As such, it contributes to the measure of seriousness of the state misconduct relevant to s. 24(2) pursuant to Grant. Each consequential breach serves to undermine the rule of law and necessarily contributes, to a greater or lesser extent, to the risk that admitting the evidence in question in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. For that reason, all state conduct that violates the Charter must be weighed carefully in the balancing that s. 24(2) demands. Ignoring the fact that consequential breaches add to the cumulative, and potentially compounding, measure of the seriousness of state misconduct is, in our respectful view, an error of law under s. 24(2) of the Charter as interpreted by this Court in Grant. There is no basis to discount its seriousness, either from the outset or at the end of the analysis, as advanced by the respondent and the intervening attorneys general.\nWhen this principle, which we take to be settled law, is duly recognized, a correct application of the s. 24(2) framework mandated by Grant compels exclusion of the evidence in this case, given the seriousness of the state misconduct that would otherwise be discounted. It is of course true that no single consideration can be allowed to overwhelm the flexible, contextual balancing exercise that s. 24(2) demands. The approach that s. 24(2) entrenched in the Constitution rejected the American rule excluding all evidence obtained in violation of the Bill of Rights and the common law rule that all relevant evidence was admissible regardless of the means by which it was obtained (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 280, per Lamer J. (as he then was); see also R. v. Simmons, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 495, at p. 532, per Dickson C.J.; Grant, at paras. 61-65). The approach mandated by s. 24(2) is different: courts must take proper account of the societal interests that can, on balance, favour either the admission or the exclusion of unconstitutionally obtained evidence.\nIn this case, the conclusion that Mr. Zachariass Charter rights were breached cannot in itself compel exclusion  but neither can the existence of real, reliable and crucial evidence compel inclusion. Rather, as s. 24(2) of the Charter itself makes plain, all the circumstances are relevant and must be considered at each stage of the test in Grant. Taking into account the seriousness of all of the state conduct that violated s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the impact of that conduct on the accused and societys interest in proceeding to trial on the merits, we conclude that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by admitting the evidence. For that reason, it must be excluded. \nAnalysis\nThe Law in Relation to Section 24(2) \nThe Court is called upon to consider the legal framework that governs the analysis under s. 24(2) of the Charter, which provides:\nWhere, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\nThis provision directs courts to have regard to all the circumstances in determining whether admitting evidence obtained in a manner that violated the Charter would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. If admitting the evidence would do so, then s. 24(2) directs that courts shall exclude it. Rather than asking whether to exclude the evidence, the question to be decided is whether the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by its admission (R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 139). As a matter of settled law, the tripartite framework that this Court articulated in Grant structures courts answers to this question. \nHere, the Court must identify the legal principles that govern how all the circumstances factor into the analysis when consequential, linked or cascading breaches of the Charter are at issue, that is to say breaches of the Charter that flow from an initial breach of an accuseds Charter rights by the state. We agree with our colleagues that the presence of additional, consequential breaches will necessarily result in more significant impacts on the Charter-protected interests of an accused and are therefore relevant to the analysis of the second Grant factor (para. 56). Thus, all such breaches must be given weight under the second line of inquiry mandated by Grant, which assesses the impact of the state misconduct on the accused. \nHowever, we respectfully reject the view that consequential breaches of constitutional rights can be characterized as unlikely to significantly affect the overall seriousness of the state misconduct simply because they are expected to occur (Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s reasons, at para. 59). We disagree that under the settled Grant framework, the focal point for evaluating seriousness is the initial breach (para. 68). Further, we are unable to accept that subsequent state conduct is unlikely to meaningfully increase the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct merely because of the connection of that conduct to earlier misconduct and the polices honest belief that they are acting lawfully (para. 53). To the contrary, s. 24(2) and the Grant analysis mandate assessing the cumulative, and potentially compounding, seriousness of all of the conduct related to each of the violations at issue, whether or not they are consequential or cascade from an initial breach, and whether or not the police had such an honest belief. Two principles governing the assessment of the seriousness of Charter-infringing state conduct lead to this view: (1) seriousness is focused on the rule of law; and (2) the measure of seriousness is cumulative, necessarily taking into account all circumstances and all of the states misconduct. \nSeriousness Is Focused on the Rule of Law\nThe first line of inquiry mandated by Grant is an evaluation of the seriousness of the state conduct that is at issue, viewed in terms of the gravity of the offending conduct by state authorities whom the rule of law requires to uphold the rights guaranteed by the Charter (para. 73).\nIn Grant, this Court recognized that the seriousness of state conduct is one factor to be balanced in the s. 24(2) analysis because the courts cannot be seen to condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct (para. 72; see also R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 82; R. v. Beaver, 2022 SCC 54, at para. 120). In other words, the first line of inquiry mandated by Grant flows from the concern to preserve public confidence in the rule of law and its processes (para. 73). Commentators have rightly observed that this condonation theory relating to the rule of law is the key concept that drives the law in relation to s. 24(2) (D. M. Paciocco, P. Paciocco and L. Stuesser, The Law of Evidence (8th ed. 2020), at p. 469; see also H. Parent, Traite de droit criminel, vol. IV, Les garanties juridiques (2nd ed. 2021), at para. 584). This point is settled in our jurisprudence: seriousness is to be evaluated based on the extent to which the state conduct at issue deviates from the rule of law (R. v. McColman, 2023 SCC 8, at para. 57, citing Grant and R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at para. 22). \nAll state action that violates the Charter necessarily deviates from the rule of law. The Charter functions to constrain and limi[t] all state actions inconsistent with the rights it enshrines (Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 156, per Dickson J. (as he then was)). Indeed, the legal rights protected by ss. 7 to 14 of the Charter have been described by this Court as essential elements of a system for the administration of justice which is founded upon the belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and the rule of law (Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 512, per Lamer J. (as he then was)). Thus, instances where police officers surpass these limits and violate the Charter undermine the rule of law and must be seen as increasing the serious character of the state misconduct. There is accordingly a risk that public confidence in the administration of justice will also be thereby diminished. \nAs this Court has repeatedly affirmed, in a society founded on the rule of law, it is important that there always be a legal basis for the actions taken by police officers (Kosoian v. Societe de transport de Montreal, 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 335, at para. 38, citing Dedman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2, at pp. 2829; R. v. Sharma, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 650, at pp. 67273). This point bears repeating: there is no instance in which a breach of the rights guaranteed by the Charter does not undermine the rule of law.\nThe circumstances here provide a case in point. While the conduct related to the initial unreasonable search may not have been in itself grave, the seriousness of the subsequent state misconduct  however consequential it may have been  was both relevant and significant. Police acted without lawful authority in subjecting the accused to further searches, and by detaining him for several hours, part of which was in handcuffs; the fact that these breaches of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were consequential or cascading from the initial breach cannot mean that they should be discounted under the first branch of Grant. A breach is a breach. The consequential conduct was state conduct that violated the constitutional right to be free of arbitrary detention. It was conduct that undermined the rule of law.\nOf course, not all conduct that violates the Charter deviates from the rule of law to the same extent. As this Court recognized in Grant, violations may undermine public confidence in the rule of law to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the gravity of the offending conduct that is at issue (paras. 73-74). There is a sliding scale or spectrum. We will not exhaustively review all of the considerations that may validly inform the assessment of the gravity of such conduct. Instead, we will focus on certain factors that require discussion in the circumstances of this case. \nOne relevant factor is the extent to which the conduct reflects a deliberate disregard for Charter standards. It is for this reason that the Court has recognized a scale from inadvertent violations to those that display a wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights (Grant, at para. 74). This scale is significant because it informs how gravely the rule of law is undermined. For instance, the rule of law is necessarily undermined, and the seriousness of the state misconduct is affected, when agents of the state wilfully disregard the fundamental constitutional constraints on their actions. By contrast, the Court has consistently recognized that state conduct at the less serious end of this scale will generally weigh less heavily in favour of the view that admitting the evidence would undermine the rule of law (see, e.g., Grant, at para. 74; R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 43; Le, at para. 143). But even inadvertent breaches may still weigh in favour of exclusion (see, e.g., Tim, at paras. 84-89). As appellate jurisprudence has recognized, a deliberate breach is not the only form of serious breach (see, e.g., Hamel v. R., 2021 QCCA 801, 72 C.R. (7th) 132, at para. 131, per Cournoyer J.A.). This is because a breach based on an honest and unintentional mistake is nonetheless a state action taken in the absence of legal authority. \nThe extent to which state actors deliberately violate Charter standards is not the only consideration that is relevant to assessing how gravely the rule of law has been undermined. For instance, as our colleagues rightly recognize, in Grant this Court noted that evidence that the Charter-infringing conduct was part of a pattern of abuse will increase the exclusionary weight that flows from the first line of inquiry (para. 75). This consideration reflects the reality that for every Charter breach that comes before the courts, many others may go unidentified and unredressed because they did not turn up relevant evidence leading to a criminal charge (ibid.). The recognition that a pattern may increase the seriousness of the state conduct is significant. It implies that police officers may believe they are proceeding lawfully, yet there may still be a serious departure from the requirements of the rule of law. Thus, it is an error to proceed as if the seriousness inquiry may only consider police officers states of mind. This is because the focus of the seriousness inquiry, like the s. 24(2) analysis as a whole, is societal rather than aimed at determining the blameworthiness of the particular police officers whose actions resulted in a Charter violation (para. 70).\nThe societal focus of s. 24(2) also implies that the assessment of the seriousness of state misconduct that undermines the rule of law must take account of the values that underlie the Charter rights that were violated. As Dickson C.J. wrote in another context, [t]he underlying values and principles of a free and democratic society are the genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter (R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p. 136). These values and principles therefore inform the assessment of how seriously Charter-infringing state conduct undermines the rule of law. They inform the key consideration of the nature and character of the police conduct that is at issue, viewed from a societal perspective. While Charter rights should never be trivialized, some violations may be more minor than others when these underlying values are accounted for (Grant, at para. 74). By contrast, other violations may show a major departure from Charter standards in light of the values the relevant rights were meant to protect (Tim, at para. 82). Thus, the Courts reference in Grant to whether a breach was minor referred to a breach at the low end of the sliding scale or spectrum for the assessment of the nature and character of police conduct, viewed in light of the values the Charter protects. \nThe full range of relevant values entrenched in the Charter should be considered. As this Court has said, the values reflected in the Charter are not insular and discrete (R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at p. 326, per La Forest J.). Thus, where multiple rights are violated, the court must consider how the state conduct that is at issue implicates each underlying value, and how those values interact in the circumstances of the case. For instance, there is every reason to believe that state misconduct that undermines both the privacy interests protected by s. 8 and the liberty interests protected by s. 9 will be more serious than misconduct implicating only one of these underlying values, because the social interests in protecting privacy and liberty are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. But they are distinct breaches, whether or not one is consequential on the other.\nWhen this Court has discussed these considerations and others that inform the seriousness inquiry, it has properly refrained from suggesting that some breaches are sufficiently unremarkable, normal or routine that they will not significantly affect the seriousness of the state conduct. We would decline the invitation from the respondent and intervener Crowns to do so in this case. As this Court unanimously held in R. v. Reilly, 2021 SCC 38, all Charter-infringing state conduct must be factored into the analysis. In that case, Moldaver J. wrote: Regardless of whether the [subsequent] breach was caused by [earlier] breaches, and regardless of the fact that it was considered necessary . . ., it was nonetheless a breach of Mr. Reillys s. 8 Charterprotected rights and must be considered under the first Grant factor. Trial judges cannot choose which relevant Charterinfringing state conduct to consider (para. 3). \nThe seriousness of conduct related to all breaches thus must be considered even if some of them may be said to have been caused by earlier Charter violations. It is irrelevant to the principle stated in Reilly that the Crown had conceded the subsequent breaches in that case. \nThis Court recently assessed the seriousness of the state action related to the consequential breaches of s. 8 of the Charter in Tim. These unreasonable searches were consequential breaches in the sense that they were unlawful only as a consequence of the initial breach (in that case an unlawful arrest) that preceded them (see paras. 48-50). The s. 8 breaches were caused by the breach of s. 9. Nevertheless, in the first stage of the Grant analysis, Jamal J. expressly considered the extent to which these violations of s. 8 undermined the rule of law (see paras. 82-89; see also para. 102, per Brown J., dissenting, but not on this point). \nThe approach applied in Reilly and Tim is consonant with Grant and should be applied in this case as a matter of settled law. In our respectful view, to treat consequential breaches as having an inconsequential effect on the seriousness inquiry is a departure from Grant, Reilly and Tim and, in respect of the mandate that falls to the Court under s. 24(2), an error in law. Thus, the Attorney General of Ontario is wrong to suggest that the post-Grant jurisprudence reflects a pattern whereby this Court has not once considered the chain of events that flowed from a single, original breach (I.F., at para. 20). Prior to the case at bar, the Court has not been squarely called upon to decide the relevance of consequential breaches to the s. 24(2) analysis. But, as this Courts recent jurisprudence makes plain, subsequent conduct consequential to an initial breach is part of all the circumstances to which s. 24(2) requires courts have regard.  \nIt is of course true that the relationship between each stage of the events may inform the analysis of how seriously the state conduct undermined the rule of law. For instance, when an unconstitutional search uncovers incriminating evidence, police officers may subjectively believe that they have the legal authority to detain, search or arrest a suspect. However, a subjective belief of this kind would be mistaken: when unconstitutionally obtained evidence forms the basis for a subsequent detention, search or arrest, then those subsequent actions will also generally violate the Charter. It may well be true that, if these subsequent actions do not disclose misconduct that is independent from the initial breach, then they do not reflect a deliberate violation of constitutional rights. But as this Courts existing jurisprudence in respect of s. 24(2) demonstrates, a conclusion that a violation was not deliberate does not dispense the court from the requirement of measuring the seriousness of each breach in assessing the gravity of the state misconduct at issue (see, e.g., Tim). Nor can the weight it will carry be dismissed or discounted, from the outset or categorically. Conduct that did not deliberately breach the Charter may nonetheless have some exclusionary weight. Society has a stake in considering the seriousness of all the circumstances, as the Charter directs. Indeed, even breaches that, when looked at in isolation, appear minor or technical can nevertheless contribute meaningfully to the seriousness of the misconduct that a judge must consider when deciding whether to admit or exclude evidence under s. 24(2). \nThus, in our respectful view it would be an error of law for a court to decline to analyze the extent to which each consequential breach at issue in the evaluative stage of the s. 24(2) analysis reflects serious Charter-infringing state conduct, viewed from the perspective of how gravely the conduct undermines the rule of law. To suggest otherwise would trivialize the importance of fundamental constitutional rights and undermine the rule of law that the Charter protects. In so doing, it would inadvertently accept what we see, with due regard for opposing views, as the flawed premise of R. v. Jennings, 2018 ONCA 260, 45 C.R. (7th) 224, and R. v. Love, 2022 ABCA 269, [2023] 1 W.W.R. 296, by treating consequential breaches as inconsequential at the seriousness stage of the analysis. And it would prevent s. 24(2) from fulfilling its purpose of maintaining the rule of law and upholding Charter rights in the justice system as a whole (Grant, at para. 67).\nSeriousness Is Cumulative\nAs a number of appellate courts have properly recognized, it is the cumulative seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct that factors into the Grant analysis (see, e.g., R. v. Lauriente, 2010 BCCA 72, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 492, at para. 30; R. v. Boudreau-Fontaine, 2010 QCCA 1108, at para. 59 (CanLII); R. v. Poirier, 2016 ONCA 582, 131 O.R. (3d) 433, at para. 91; R. v. Kossick, 2018 SKCA 55, 365 C.C.C. (3d) 186, at paras. 58-59; R. v. Culotta, 2018 ONCA 665, 142 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 62, affd 2018 SCC 57, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 597; R. v. Adler, 2020 ONCA 246, 388 C.C.C. (3d) 114, at para. 39; R. v. White, 2022 NSCA 61, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 123, at para. 61). This approach assesses the entire chain of events relevant to the Charter violations and considers how seriously the state conduct  taken as a whole  undermined the rule of law. \nIn our view, a cumulative approach is mandated by the emphasis that the Grant analysis gives to the totality of the circumstances (see J. A. Fontana and D. Keeshan, The Law of Search and Seizure in Canada (12th ed. 2021), at pp. 1711-12). It bears noting that even before Grant, this Courts jurisprudence employed a cumulative approach (see R. v. Greffe, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 755, at pp. 795-97, per Lamer J. (as he then was)). This Court has never suggested that a relationship between two breaches, as in the case of consequential violations, eliminates the need to assess the cumulative seriousness of the state conduct. To do so would be to ignore all the circumstances that s. 24(2) directs courts to consider, in favour of a narrower focus on only one of the state actions taken without legal authority. Once again, to do so would lead, by another path, to the incorrect result that Jennings and Love reach. It would wrongly focus courts analysis on whether state conduct is consequential (itself a question of fact) rather than on whether the long-term repute of the administration of justice requires the courts, as mandated by the Charter, to disassociate themselves from the unconstitutional state actions. \nIn our view, this principle in conjunction with the focus of the seriousness inquiry on the rule of law implies that the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario is wrong to assert that consequential or subsequent breaches only have value to the Grant analysis if they disclose independent wrongdoing (I.F., at fn. 1). The respondent and the Attorney General of Alberta are also wrong to adopt similar approaches. Conduct that does not deliberately violate the Charter may nonetheless undermine the publics confidence in the administration of justice and pull in favour of excluding the evidence. Even if a breach that is not deliberate will sometimes only pull weakly towards exclusion, courts cannot discount the possibility that a chain of such breaches will, when assessed cumulatively, demonstrate more serious state misconduct. Thus, it may be that the whole sequence of state conduct undermines the rule of law more gravely than would each action in isolation. The analysis of the seriousness of state conduct, like the Grant analysis as a whole, is not a mathematical exercise (para. 86). For that reason, there is no necessary requirement that the seriousness of the whole be the sum of the constituent parts.\nApplication of Section 24(2)\nBecause we have come to a different conclusion than the trial judge on the relevant Charter violations, we owe no deference to her overall conclusion in respect of s. 24(2) (see, e.g., R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 67; Grant, at para. 129; Le, at para. 138; Beaver, at para. 118). Conducting the analysis afresh and considering all the circumstances of this case, and with respect for other views, we conclude that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by admitting the evidence. Accordingly, s. 24(2) compels exclusion of the evidence. This result flows from balancing the three factors this Court identified in Grant: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breaches on the Charterprotected interests of the accused; and (3) societys interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. \nSeriousness of the Charter-Infringing Conduct\nWe begin by assessing the seriousness of the state conduct at issue in light of how gravely that conduct undermined the rule of law, in line with the principles articulated above. The extent to which the police officers deliberately violated Charter standards is one relevant consideration. Here, the trial judge concluded that in conducting the initial sniffer dog search the police officer acted honestly, was well trained, knew the applicable standard, and sought to apply it (A.R., vol. I, at p. 20). She concluded that the breach this conduct occasioned was not deliberate or systemic and did not reflect negligence. Thus, she concluded that the initial error was on the low end of the scale (p. 21). \nWe find no reversible error in the trial judges determination that the officer initially breached Charter standards inadvertently and without negligence, nor in her conclusion that there was not a systemic failing evident in the record. It bears emphasizing, however, that the reasonable suspicion standard that was to be applied is a well-established constitutional nor[m] (Paterson, at para. 53). This was not a case where there was legal uncertainty at the time that the police officer acted (see, e.g., McColman). The public is entitled to expect that police officers will apply the reasonable suspicion standard that flows from the jurisprudence of this Court. The seniority of the officer in question only reinforces this expectation: an officer who has served for 14 years and conducted between 12,000 to 15,000 traffic stops should know the law. Thus, while the initial error was on the low end of the deliberateness scale, in our view it was not at the absolute lowest end. In addition, because the other, subsequent breaches were not argued before the trial judge, she did not assess their seriousness. Within the fresh assessment this Court is called to conduct, the subsequent breaches must factor into the analysis, which is necessarily cumulative. \nThe subsequent breaches at issue in this case include the pat down search and the search of the truck and the duffle bags that were inside it. These searches violated s. 8 of the Charter, which is intended to protect against unjustified intrusions on privacy interests (see, e.g., Hunter, at p. 159). Yet, in spite of the constitutional protection for these interests, increasingly invasive steps were taken at each stage of the police action at issue. Adopting the broad, social perspective that Grant mandates, these increasingly invasive steps represent progressively more serious ways in which the state conduct undermined the rule of law. \nThe unreasonable searches were not, however, all of the unlawful conduct that occurred in this case. The initial detention without reasonable grounds and the three subsequent arrests each violated the constitutionally distinct s. 9 protections for individual liberty (Grant, at para. 54). Further, confinement in a police vehicle, handcuffing, and being taken to the detachment to be detained there, all also constituted arbitrary detention. \nThere is no suggestion that these subsequent violations were deliberate or systemic. They arose from actions taken based on the honest but mistaken understanding that the initial search had furnished lawful grounds for the police to search, arrest and detain. But it must be stressed that, objectively, the police had no legal authority to interfere with privacy and liberty. Respect for these interests lies at the core of Canadian societys commitment to the rule of law. So, while there was no intention to undermine the rule of law, it was nevertheless undermined.\nThe respondent is wrong to assert that there is no need for the Court to disassociate itself from the state conduct that is at issue in this case. Far from being unremarkable events, police officers conducted a series of increasingly invasive searches, arrests and detentions in the absence of lawful authority. There is a strong social interest in denouncing a course of conduct that disregards both individual privacy and liberty, thereby undermining the rule of law. Thus, while the subsequent breaches did not deliberately violate Charter rights, in our view the entire course of conduct does reflect serious state misconduct. On the spectrum of seriousness this Court identified in Grant, the conduct at issue in this case pulls between moderately and strongly towards exclusion, resting closer to a strong pull than a moderate one.\nImpact on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused\nThe second line of inquiry mandated by Grant is to consider the seriousness of the impact of the Charter breaches on the Charter-protected interests of the accused (para. 76). As this Court has affirmed, [t]he more serious the impact on the accuseds protected interests, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence may signal to the public that Charter rights, however high-sounding, are of little actual avail to the citizen, breeding public cynicism and bringing the administration of justice into disrepute (ibid.; see also Le, at para. 151; Tim, at para. 90; R. v. Lafrance, 2022 SCC 32, at para. 96; Beaver, at para. 123). Thus, the task is to situate the impact on the accuseds Charter-protected interests on a spectrum, ranging from impacts that are fleeting, technical, transient, or trivial, to those that are profoundly intrusive or that seriously compromise the interests underlying the rights infringed (Tim, at para. 90). \nWhile the first and second lines of inquiry mandated by Grant are distinct, the seriousness of the impact [translation] complements to some degree [the factor] of the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct (M. Vauclair, T. Desjardins and P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2023 (30th ed. 2023), at para. 28.208). This is because the second line of inquiry [translation] is meant to take into consideration the impact of the Charter violation, as opposed to its inherent seriousness (ibid.). In this sense, it is settled law that the two lines of inquiry work in tandem (Le, at para. 141; see also Lafrance, at para. 90; Paciocco, Paciocco and Stuesser, at p. 486). The two lines of inquiry cannot be artificially disconnected by weighing different state conduct at different stages of the analysis. To say otherwise creates, in our respectful view, an incoherent disjuncture between the first two branches of Grant. Under the first line of inquiry, the cumulative seriousness of the state conduct that led to each of those violations should be considered from a broad, social perspective; under the second, the cumulative seriousness of the impacts on the specific accuseds Charter-protected interests flowing from that same conduct should be assessed. \nApplying this approach and weighing the impacts flowing from the same conduct we have considered under the first branch of the analysis, we respectfully disagree with our colleagues conclusion that the impacts of the Charter breaches on Mr. Zachariass Charter-protected interests only moderately favour exclusion (Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s reasons, at para. 72). In light of the fact that the impacts on Mr. Zacharias were substantial  increasing in severity at each stage of the states interference with his rights  we conclude instead that this factor pulls strongly in favour of exclusion.\nFirst, we consider the impacts of the searches. Where non-bodily physical evidence is targeted, privacy is the primary interest engaged by searches that violate s. 8 (Grant, at para. 113). Here, the cumulative impacts of the s. 8 breaches on Mr. Zachariass privacy interests were significant and became more invasive with each step.\nWhile we acknowledge that a dwelling house attracts a higher expectation of privacy than a vehicle (Grant, at para. 113), privacy interests in vehicles and their contents are not trivial. The privacy-compromising impact of an unreasonable vehicle search will still generally militate in favour of exclusion, notwithstanding the comparatively reduced expectation of privacy in that context (see, e.g., R. v. Huynh, 2013 ABCA 416, 8 C.R. (7th) 146, at para. 7). Indeed, when assessing the impact of roadside Charter breaches on an individuals protected interests, courts must not lose sight of the fact that, beyond the scope of a valid highway traffic stop, the individual rightly has every expectation of being left alone (Harrison, at paras. 30-31, citing R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para. 56). That observation should remain the starting point of the analysis. \nMore substantial was the impact of police officers opening of Mr. Zachariass duffel bags, which were covered by a tonneau in the box of the truck. This conduct amounted to a significant intrusion upon his privacy interests. Mr. Zachariass concealment of the box of his truck with a tonneau cover evinces a clear intention to assert privacy over its contents. His intent in this regard makes the search of Mr. Zachariass truck unlike cases of reduced expectation vehicle searches where no steps were taken to conceal the subject matter of the search (see, e.g., R. v. Shinkewski, 2012 SKCA 63, 289 C.C.C. (3d) 145, at para. 35).\nSecond, we now turn to the impacts that flowed from the arrests and detention Mr. Zacharias was subjected to. The purpose of s. 9 is to protect individual liberty from unjustified state interference (Grant, at para. 20). Here, the restrictions imposed on Mr. Zachariass liberty by the breaches of his s. 9 rights were substantial. \nThe majority below concluded that the investigative detention that ensued after the initial valid traffic safety stop was necessary to facilitate deployment of the sniffer dog relative to a vehicle in which Mr. Zacharias expectation of privacy is low (para. 7). We respectfully disagree. That assessment justifies the impacts of a breach of s. 9  an unlawful investigative detention  by reasoning that it was necessary to effect a breach of s. 8. Such reasoning trivializes the impacts of these Charter breaches. Absent any reasonable suspicion to justify a further investigative detention, Mr. Zacharias ought to have been free to go once the matters related to the Traffic Safety Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. T-6, had been addressed. Instead, he was unlawfully detained for approximately seven hours, handcuffed, confined to a police vehicle, arrested three times, and detained for several hours in the police detachment. We place little weight on the trial judges finding that the arresting officers were respectful and courteous over the course of these interactions. The fact that a police officer is appropriately courteous when interacting with a citizen is not relevant to the lawful character of their conduct. \nThese sustained deprivations had substantial impacts on Mr. Zachariass liberty, autonomy and bodily integrity. They were not momentary but prolonged. Khullar J.A. properly accounted for these impacts (para. 58). By contrast, because they did not consider the subsequent breaches, in our respectful view the majority below inappropriately discounted their impacts. And while our colleagues do recognize the other breaches of Mr. Zachariass constitutional rights, we respectfully disagree with their assessment that seven hours of arbitrary detention, physical restraint, relatively invasive searches, and other associated impacts only moderately favour exclusion (Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s reasons, at para. 72).\nIn sum, the impacts of the state conduct on Mr. Zachariass liberty and privacy interests, when taken together and considered cumulatively as the law requires, were considerable. Accordingly, this factor pulls strongly in favour of exclusion of the evidence.\nSocietys Interest in Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits\nThe third line of inquiry mandated by Grant is to consider whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or by its exclusion (para. 79). In essence, this inquiry is directed at assessing societys collective interest in ensuring that those who transgress the law are brought to trial and dealt with according to the law (ibid., quoting R. v. Askov, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1199, at pp. 1219-20). Several considerations may be relevant.\nFirst, the reliability of the evidence factors into the third line of inquiry (Grant, at para. 80; see also Paterson, at para. 51; Le, at para. 297; Tim, at para. 96; Beaver, at para. 129; McColman, at para. 70). Nevertheless, this Court has been clear that [t]he view that reliable evidence is admissible regardless of how it was obtained (see R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272) is inconsistent with the Charters affirmation of rights (Grant, at para. 80). For instance, even though real evidence may be highly reliable, that fact alone is not determinative of whether the evidences admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. To adopt a contrary approach that gives overriding importance to the reliability of real evidence [translation] is at odds with the consideration of all the circumstances required by subsection 24(2) of the Charter (Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at para. 28.217).\nSecond, the importance of the evidence to the Crowns case is a relevant consideration (Grant, at para. 83; see also Paterson, at para. 51; Le, at para. 297; Tim, at para. 96; Beaver, at para. 129; McColman, at para. 70). The Court has recognized that exclusion may more adversely affect the repute of the administration of justice where the remedy effectively guts the prosecution (Grant, at para. 83). Nevertheless, this Court has rightly been willing to exclude even critical evidence, virtually conclusive of guilt on the offence charged where the admission of that evidence would  having regard to all circumstances  bring the administration of justice into disrepute (Harrison, at para. 34; see also para. 42).\nThird, courts are also to consider the seriousness of the offence at issue (Grant, at para. 84; see also Paterson, at para. 52; Le, at para. 297; Tim, at para. 97; Beaver, at para. 129; McColman, at para. 70). The seriousness of the offence, however, may cut both ways (Grant, at para. 84). As this Court has affirmed, [w]hile society has a greater interest in seeing a serious offence prosecuted, it has an equivalent interest in ensuring that the judicial system is above reproach, particularly when the stakes are high for the accused person (R. v. Cote, 2011 SCC 46, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 215, at para. 53; see also R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 80; R. v. Taylor, 2014 SCC 50, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 495, at para. 38; Le, at para. 159; McColman, at para. 70). The fact that an offence is serious must not be permitted to overwhelm the s. 24(2) analysis (R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 95; see also Harrison, at para. 40). This is because, at minimum, [translation] the rights guaranteed by the Charter are also guaranteed to all persons who are in Canada, regardless of the crime (Vauclair, Desjardins and Lachance, at para. 28.216). There is a danger that if the seriousness of the offence is treated as . . . determinative it will become a bright line to admission of evidence obtained in violation of the Charter (D. Stuart, Uncertainty on Charter Section 24(2) Remedy of Exclusion of Evidence (2023), 86 C.R. (7th) 255, at p. 257). Such an approach would be contrary to s. 24(2) and its requirement for a careful balancing in light of all the circumstances. \nHere, the evidence is highly reliable. It is undoubtedly critical to the Crowns case. But the fact that the evidence is, as the respondent characterizes it, real, reliable and crucial (R.F., at para. 3), does not overwhelm the flexible balancing process that s. 24(2) demands. This Courts jurisprudence has consistently emphasized the importance of this principle. For instance, the majority of this Court in Harrison excluded 35 kilograms of cocaine that had been seized from the accuseds vehicle, notwithstanding the fact that it was also undoubtedly real, reliable and crucial evidence (para. 34). \nWith respect to the seriousness of the offence at issue, it is true that this Court has long acknowledged that cannabis offences are generally regarded as less serious than those involving hard drugs such as cocaine and heroin (R. v. Kokesch, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 3, at p. 34, per Sopinka J.; see also R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 68). Further, this Court has stated that while trafficking offences in relation to hard drugs are very serious, even they are not one of the most serious [offences] known to our criminal law (Harrison, at para. 35). Nevertheless, we are persuaded that the offences at issue in this case are serious. Like the trial judge and both the majority and dissenting judges at the Court of Appeal, we are of the view that this result flows from the very large quantity of drugs at issue in this case. \nTaking into account each of the foregoing considerations, we are persuaded that there is a strong social interest that favours the adjudication of these charges on the merits. Accordingly, the third line of inquiry strongly favours the admission of the evidence. \nWould the Admission of the Evidence Bring the Administration of Justice Into Disrepute?\nAfter engaging with the three lines of inquiry mandated by Grant, the weight assigned to each factor must be balanced (para. 86). This process involves a qualitative exercise, one that is not capable of mathematical precision (Tim, at para. 98; see also Grant, at paras. 86 and 140; Harrison, at para. 36). Thus, [n]o overarching rule governs how the balance is to be struck (Grant, at para. 86). But as this Court has held, [i]t is the sum, and not the average, of [the] first two lines of inquiry that determines the pull towards exclusion (Le, at para. 141; see also Beaver, at para. 134, McColman, at para. 74). The third factors weight will seldom tip the scale in favour of admissibility when the two first lines, taken together, make a strong case for exclusion (Lafrance, at para. 90; see also Paterson, at para. 56, Le, at para. 142, Beaver, at para. 134).\nIn this case, the first line of inquiry exerts a moderate to strong pull towards exclusion, while the second pulls strongly in the same direction. The third factor strongly favours admission. But it is not enough to overwhelm the cumulative seriousness of the Charter-infringing conduct along with impacts on Mr. Zacharias, which together make a relatively strong case for the evidences exclusion. For that reason, we conclude that the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute by its admission. Accordingly, s. 24(2) directs that the evidence shall be excluded. \nConclusion\nWe would allow the appeal. Because the evidence in question was essential to the Crowns case, rather than order a new trial, we would enter an acquittal. \n\tAppeal dismissed, Martin and Kasirer JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Dhanu Dhaliwal Law Group, Abbotsford, B.C.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Public Prosecution Service of Canada  Ontario Regional Office, Brampton; Public Prosecution Service of Canada  Alberta Regional Office, Calgary.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario, Crown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service  Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary. ", "llama_summary": "Here is the rewritten summary in the specified format:\n\n**The Supreme Court of Canada Sets Aside Conviction for Possession of Marijuana**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether evidence obtained through a series of Charter breaches should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe complainant, the Crown, alleges that George Zacharias committed the offence of possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to ss. 495(1)(a) and 507 of the Criminal Code. The accused argues that the police breached his Charter rights during an investigation involving an unlawful sniffer dog search and investigative detention, leading to subsequent searches and arrests that uncovered 101.5 pounds of marijuana.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe court proceedings involved a sequence of charter breaches, which culminated in the exclusion of evidence obtained through these breaches. The court established that a lawful arrest cannot be based on unlawful grounds and that each breach must be evaluated separately and factored into the s. 24(2) analysis.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA lawful arrest cannot be based on unlawful grounds obtained through a Charter breach.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice [Name] concluded that while an unlawful arrest made as a consequence of a Charter breach may result in a more significant impact on an accused's Charter-protected interests, it is unlikely to significantly increase overall seriousness without additional or independent state misconduct. In this case, despite finding serious breaches by police officers during their investigation into Mr Zacharias' alleged drug trafficking activities - including those related specifically towards him being searched without proper justification under section twenty-four point two - ultimately decided against excluding key pieces such as large quantities found at scene because they felt doing so wouldn't serve justice well given all circumstances surrounding situation; however two justices dissented strongly arguing opposite stance believing exclusion necessary due severity violations committed throughout entire process which undermined rule law itself according their view", "citation": "2023 SCC 30", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court declines  to exclude evidence obtained in breach of an accused\u2019s rights in a drug  trafficking case</strong><strong>. </strong><strong></strong>This case is about whether police conduct after an initial traffic  stop breached the accused\u2019s rights under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, and if so, whether the  evidence collected as a result of that police conduct should be excluded from  trial. In February 2017, Mr. George Zacharias was pulled over for a traffic  stop on a highway near Banff, Alberta, because he was driving a truck with a burnt-out  light and illegally tinted windows. The police officer made several  observations during the stop that made him suspicious Mr. Zacharias was  transporting drugs. These observations led the police officer to detain him for  the purpose of asking more questions. This is known as \u201cinvestigative  detention\u201d. The police officer also called for a sniffer dog and placed Mr.  Zacharias in a police car until the dog arrived. The sniffer dog signaled that  drugs were present. The police officer concluded he had reasonable and probable  grounds to arrest Mr. Zacharias for possession of a controlled substance and  did so. It was the first of three arrests.\u00a0  \u00a0The police then searched Mr. Zacharias\u2019 truck and discovered a large  quantity of cannabis and cash. Mr. Zacharias was re-arrested for possession for  the purpose of trafficking, handcuffed and driven to a police detachment. He  was then searched and arrested a third time for possession of proceeds of crime  over $5,000. At trial, Mr. Zacharias alleged the police had breached his rights  under the <em>Charter </em>during the  investigation, namely his right under section 8 to not be subjected to  unreasonable search or seizure, and his right under section 9 to not be  arbitrarily detained. He argued that the drug evidence seized by the police  should be excluded from trial under section 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. This section says that evidence obtained in a way that  breached therights of an accused may  be excluded from trial if admitting it would bring the administration of  justice into disrepute. To determine whether the evidence in question should be  excluded, a court will look at three indicators: (1) the seriousness of the state  conduct in breach of the <em>Charter</em>; (2)  the impact of the breach on the accused; and (3) society\u2019s interest in  adjudicating the matter on its merits. \u00a0The trial judge found the police breached Mr. Zacharias\u2019 rights under  sections 8 and 9 of the <em>Charter</em> in conducting a  sniffer search and investigative detention, but held  that the evidence should not be excluded under section 24(2). He was ultimately  convicted of possession of 101.5 pounds of marijuana for the purpose of  trafficking. On appeal before the Court of Appeal of Alberta, Mr. Zacharias  argued the trial judge failed to consider whether the police\u2019s conduct after  these initial violations also breached the <em>Charter</em>.  The majority of judges dismissed his appeal. One judge disagreed and would have  excluded the evidence. \u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The additional <em>Charter </em>breaches did not warrant exclusion  of the evidence. \u00a0\u00a0</strong>Three of the five judges agreed that the additional consequential  breaches did not raise the seriousness of the state conduct at issue (the first  indicator of the section 24(2) analysis). On balance, the evidence should not  be excluded from the trial under section 24(2). Mr. Zacharias\u2019 conviction is  therefore upheld. \u00a0"}, "5": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nFrederick Langford Sharp\tAppellant\nv.\nAutorite des marches financiers\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Quebec,\nShawn Van Damme,\nVincenzo Antonio Carnovale,\nPasquale Antonio Rocca and\nOntario Securities Commission\tInterveners\n- and -\nShawn Van Damme,\nVincenzo Antonio Carnovale and\nPasquale Antonio Rocca\tAppellants\nv.\nAutorite des marches financiers\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Quebec,\nFrederick Langford Sharp and\nOntario Securities Commission\tInterveners\nIndexed as: Sharp v.

A-33.2, s. 93  Securities Act, CQLR, c. V-1.1.\n\tFour British Columbia residents (the defendants) are alleged by the administrative agency that regulates Quebecs financial sector, the Autorite des marches financiers (AMF), to have engaged in a transnational pump-and-dump securities manipulation scheme. The defendants allegedly acted in concert to (1) acquire the shares of a shell company, (2) give it a legitimate face, (3) promote its business, (4) sell their shares for a profit, and (5) distribute this profit among themselves. The AMF also alleged that the scheme had several ties to Quebec sufficient to apply Quebecs securities regulatory scheme to the defendants: the shell company was a reporting issuer in Quebec with a Montreal business address; its director was a Quebec resident when the scheme was implemented; its promotional activities were accessible to Quebec residents; and, ultimately, Quebec investors lost money.\n\tThe AMF brought an originating pleading before Quebecs Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal (FMAT) alleging that the defendants contravened the Quebec Securities Act. It asked the FMAT to make various orders against the defendants. The defendants filed motions for a declinatory exception challenging the FMATs jurisdiction over them as out-of-province defendants. The FMAT dismissed the defendants motions. It ruled that it had jurisdiction over them under s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, which grants the FMAT jurisdiction to make determinations under the Securities Act, in light of the Courts decision in Unifund Assurance Co. v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 40, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 63, which held that a provincial regulatory scheme constitutionally applies to an out-of-province defendant when there is a sufficient connection or a real and substantial connection between the province and the defendant.\n\tThe Superior Court of Quebec dismissed the defendants applications for judicial review and held that the FMAT properly assumed jurisdiction. The court stated that the FMAT correctly recognized the limits of its extraterritorial reach by applying the real and substantial connection test set out in Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda, 2012 SCC 17, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 572, and that the FMAT correctly applied the Unifund test for the constitutional applicability of provincial legislation. The majority of the Court of Appeal of Quebec dismissed the defendants appeals. It concluded that the real and substantial connection test in Unifund addresses the constitutional applicability of the Quebec securities scheme to non-residents who allegedly engaged in a securities manipulation scheme with connections to Quebec, and that the FMAT correctly concluded there is a real and substantial connection between Quebec and the defendants and properly assumed jurisdiction. The majority also ruled that although the Civil Code of Quebec (C.C.Q.) acts as suppletive law for many matters, including certain aspects of public law, the private international law rules in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. do not apply when no private rights are at issue. The concurring judge would have held that the FMAT has jurisdiction over the out-of-province defendants under the rules of private international law in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q., either by analogy under art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q., or, alternatively, under art. 3136 C.C.Q.\n\tHeld (Cote J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: The FMAT has jurisdiction over the defendants under the Quebec securities scheme, which constitutionally applies to them. The FMAT has jurisdiction to make determinations under the Securities Act, including when there is a real and substantial connection, also described as a sufficient connection, between Quebec and out-of-province defendants. The allegations that the defendants used Quebec as the face of their securities manipulation and injured Quebec investors establish such a connection to give the FMAT jurisdiction over the defendants. The Quebec legislature has exercised its prescriptive legislative jurisdiction  its power to enact binding rules applicable to out-of-province parties with a real and substantial connection to Quebec. Those rules are engaged in the circumstances of the instant case. As a result, the FMAT also has adjudicatory jurisdiction, or the authority to hear this matter involving the defendants.\n\tUnder Quebec civil law, all interpretive exercises of laws governing persons, relations between persons, and property must begin with the C.C.Q., although special legislation can derogate from the C.C.Q. when the legislature expresses its intention to do so. As its preliminary provision announces, the C.C.Q. lays down the jus commune, or the law of general application, of Quebec in all matters within the letter, spirit, or object of its provisions. It has a suppletive role and can fill gaps in special statutes to the extent that legislation is silent on a given matter, thus preventing a legal vacuum. The proper interpretive methodology in determining the relationship between the C.C.Q. and special statutes governing persons, relations between persons, and property is to start with the jus commune in the C.C.Q., and then to ask whether the special statute complements or derogates from the jus commune.\n\tThe C.C.Q. does not simply lay down rules of private law on a narrow compass. The preliminary provision of the C.C.Q. provides that the C.C.Q. lays down the jus commune, and the C.C.Q. contains rules of public law and is an important source of administrative law in Quebec. As a result, the proper way to determine whether the C.C.Q. applies does not involve characterizing the right at issue as either a private law or public law matter. Book Ten of the C.C.Q., which codifies the rules of private international law in Quebec, therefore applies as the jus commune beyond matters of private law to all matters within the letter, spirit, or object of the C.C.Q.s provisions, and it applies to administrative tribunals like the FMAT regardless of whether private rights are at issue, unless otherwise provided by law. Furthermore, Title Three of Book Ten applies not just in cases of conflict of jurisdiction; it applies more broadly to determine the International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities.\n\tThe application of the interpretive methodology regarding the relationship between the C.C.Q. and special statutes in the instant case leads to the conclusion that the C.C.Q. does not grant the FMAT jurisdiction over the defendants. The FMATs jurisdiction does not arise from art. 3148 para 1(3) or from art. 3136 C.C.Q. Article 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. does not apply directly because the proceeding before the FMAT does not involve a personal action of a patrimonial nature, which implies the assertion of rights that by their very essence have a monetary value and are transmissible as property. Rather, the AMF has brought an action before the FMAT in the public interest, rather than in a strictly personal capacity. Its action aims to prevent future harm to the Quebec securities market and is neither restorative nor punitive. It does not involve a person taking legal action against another based on personal rights that are transmissible as property. In addition, art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. cannot be applied by analogy because there is no tenable analogy between a personal action of a patrimonial nature, which seeks the enforcement of a debt under private law, and a regulatory prosecution by the state, which seeks public interest remedies rather than simply private reparation. Such proceedings are of a fundamentally different legal character. As for art. 3136 C.C.Q., it does not provide a basis for the FMATs jurisdiction for two reasons. First, the AMF did not seek to rely on it  the Court has previously confirmed that it may be applied only if one of the parties raises it. Second, for it to apply, a Quebec authority must otherwise have no jurisdiction to hear a dispute. The FMAT, however, does have jurisdiction under the special jurisdictional rules of the Quebec securities scheme.\n\tThe FMAT has jurisdiction under two special statutes: the Quebec Securities Act and the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, now known as the Act respecting the regulation of the financial sector. Section 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers provides that the FMATs function is to make determinations regarding matters brought under the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers and other Acts listed in the provision, including the Securities Act. It thus grants the FMAT jurisdiction over the adjudication of matters brought under the Securities Act. Section 94 grants the FMAT jurisdiction to take any measure to ensure compliance with any of the Acts referred to in s. 93. Sections 265, 273.1, and 273.3 of the Securities Act empower the FMAT to act in a broad range of circumstances. These provisions must be read in conjunction with the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, which explicitly provides for the FMATs jurisdiction to make determinations over matters brought under the two Acts.\n\tNeither the Securities Act nor the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers expressly provide for the FMAT to assert jurisdiction over out-of-province parties, or otherwise limits the territorial reach of the Quebec securities scheme over interprovincial or international transactions. To evaluate whether these statutes may be applied in such circumstances, the Quebec securities scheme must be interpreted to determine its territorial reach. This involves consideration of the Courts decision in Unifund, which holds that the permissible territorial application of provincial legislation is determined by assessing the sufficiency of the connection among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation, and the individual or entity sought to be regulated, subject to the principles of order and fairness. The real and substantial connection test in Unifund is the accepted test for discerning the presumptively intended reach of federal legislation as well as the constitutionally permissible application of provincial legislation. It is concerned with the constitutional applicability of legislation and not with its constitutional validity. Moreover, it functions as a principle of statutory interpretation: it limits, or reads down, the territorial reach of otherwise broadly framed provincial legislation, consistent with the territorial restrictions on provincial legislative power in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, by insisting on a sufficient connection between the legislation and the out-of-province defendant. It also relates to prescriptive legislative jurisdiction, rather than adjudicatory jurisdiction. Furthermore, it is distinct from the real and substantial connection tests that the Court has developed elsewhere in the domain of conflicts of laws. The real and substantial connection test is a family of tests and requires different considerations in each of the varying contexts in which its formula is employed. For example, the real and substantial connection test set out in Van Breda applies in the context of tort claims at common law and does not apply in Quebec.\n\tInterpreted in light of the Unifund test, the Quebec securities scheme provides for jurisdiction over out-of-province parties with a sufficient connection or real and substantial connection with Quebec. The sufficient connection analysis must recognize the transnational nature of modern securities regulation and the public interest in addressing international market manipulation. Securities regulation raises unique considerations that highlight the need for transnational enforcement. In the instant case, there is a sufficient connection between Quebec and the out-of-province defendants. The defendants allegedly used Quebec as the face of their alleged pump-and-dump scheme. They participated in marketing or financing efforts and partly targeted Quebec residents. The shell company through which the defendants operated their scheme was a reporting issuer in Quebec, and its director was a Quebec resident. It would defeat the purpose of the cross-border nature of modern securities regulation to allow the defendants to escape the reach of Quebecs regulatory oversight. Applying the Quebec regulatory regime is fair to the defendants: their entrance into Quebecs market was not accidental or irrelevant, but rather was an integral part of their securities manipulation operation. Moreover, applying the Quebec regulatory scheme does not offend the principle of order or the related concept of interprovincial comity. Because contemporary securities manipulation and fraud are often transnational and extend across provincial and national borders, courts and tribunals must take a flexible and purposive approach when applying the principles of order and fairness in the securities context.\n\tPer Cote J. (dissenting): The appeals should be allowed. At this stage of the proceedings, this case raises no issue regarding the constitutional applicability of the Securities Act but rather concerns the FMATs adjudicative jurisdiction. The limits of that jurisdiction must be analyzed in light of the rules of private international law set out in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. The application of those provisions in this case leads to the conclusion that the FMAT does not have adjudicative jurisdiction over the defendants and therefore cannot hear the matter.\n\tThe majoritys approach conflates the concepts of adjudicative jurisdiction of a court or tribunal and constitutional applicability of legislation, as it deals interchangeably with the constitutional applicability of the Securities Act under the Unifund framework and the FMATs jurisdiction under the rules of private international law. Both concepts involve the existence of a real and substantial connection. In the constitutional context, the real and substantial connection test affirms the constitutionally imposed territorial limits that underlie the requirement of legitimacy in the exercise of the states power of adjudication. Thus, the applicability of provincial legislation to a defendant domiciled outside the province in question depends on there being a sufficient connection between the enacting jurisdiction and the out-of-province individual or entity. Although this test relates more specifically to the connection between a province and an action, the purpose of the Unifund analysis is essentially to determine whether there is a viable cause of action on the merits. Conversely, from a private international law perspective, the real and substantial connection test relates to the exercise of the states power of adjudication. The rules of private international law in force in a province are what confer adjudicative jurisdiction on a decision maker. In Quebec, these rules are set out in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. To be able to assume jurisdiction over a dispute, a provincial court or tribunal must have adjudicative jurisdiction under provincial legislation, which must itself have been validly enacted by the province in the exercise of its legislative jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of courts and tribunals of the Canadian provinces, the appropriateness of exercising that jurisdiction and the law that should apply to a dispute are all different concepts.\n\tThe adjudicative jurisdiction of a court or tribunal has two components: jurisdiction ratione materiae (subject-matter jurisdiction) and jurisdiction ratione personae (territorial jurisdiction). The subject-matter jurisdiction of a court or tribunal is that given to it to hear a case by reason of its subject matter, whereas territorial jurisdiction is assessed on the basis of a geographical connection. To have jurisdiction to hear a dispute, a court or tribunal must have the necessary subject-matter jurisdiction and territorial jurisdiction. In this case, the objection raised by the defendants in their motions for declinatory exception relates not to the FMATs lack of subject-matter jurisdiction but rather to its lack of territorial jurisdiction over them. The appeals therefore relate not to the extraterritorial applicability of the Securities Act but rather to the FMATs territorial jurisdiction under private international law.\n\tThe rules of private international law set out in the C.C.Q. apply to all proceedings that may be heard by Quebec authorities pursuant to the jurisdiction conferred on the province by the Constitution. Accordingly, the rules in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. must be considered in this case unless a special law complements, makes exceptions to or derogates from them. Article 3076 C.C.Q. in fact provides that Book Ten applies subject to those rules of law in force in Quebec which are applicable by reason of their particular object. Those rules might include the Securities Act and the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, but these statutes do not themselves make exceptions to, derogate from or complement the C.C.Q.s rules of private international law when it comes to the administrative proceedings brought by the AMF. It is clear from reading the provisions of these statutes that the legislature intended them to be supplemented by the C.C.Q.s provisions on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities. Section 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers establishes the FMATs subject-matter jurisdiction in administrative proceedings instituted by the AMF under the Securities Act; it does not give the FMAT territorial jurisdiction. As for s. 94 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, it is not concerned in any way with territorial jurisdiction but relates rather to the measures that the FMAT may take once it is established that it has jurisdiction ratione personae to deal with a matter. This is also the case of ss. 265, 273.1, and 273.3 of the Securities Act. The FMAT can take the measures contemplated in those provisions only where it has jurisdiction under the rules of private international law set out in the C.C.Q.\n\tThe issue of the FMATs adjudicative jurisdiction must therefore be decided by applying the rules on international jurisdiction set out in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q., that is, arts. 3134 to 3154. The C.C.Q. contains a well-developed set of rules and principles of private international law and codifies the sufficient connection test. However, no provision of the C.C.Q. can ground the FMATs jurisdiction in the proceedings brought by the AMF. There is agreement with the majority that no analogy can be drawn between a personal action of a patrimonial nature and the proceedings brought by the AMF. Article 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. therefore cannot confer jurisdiction on the FMAT. As for art. 3136 C.C.Q., it recognizes the forum of necessity doctrine, which can serve as an exceptional basis for the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities. However, it can be applied only if one of the parties raises it, which the AMF did not do in this case. The AMF did not demonstrate that proceedings abroad had proved impossible or that it could not reasonably require the institution of proceedings abroad. Nor did it explain why it had not applied to the authorities having jurisdiction, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act concerning interjurisdictional cooperation. As a result, the AMF cannot rely on art. 3136.\n\tWhere the C.C.Q. does not establish the territorial jurisdiction of a court or tribunal and the legislature has not otherwise conferred territorial jurisdiction on it through special legislation, that must be the end of the analysis. Unifund cannot serve as a safety net, because it concerns an entirely different situation: it applies once it is established that a court or tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with a matter. It cannot give the FMAT territorial jurisdiction over the defendants, who are domiciled outside Quebec, in a manner that derogates from the well-developed set of rules in the C.C.Q. The Unifund test is therefore of no assistance to the AMF and cannot ground the FMATs adjudicative jurisdiction over the defendants in this case.\nCases Cited\nBy Wagner C.J. and Jamal J.\n\tOverruled: Donaldson v.

The appeals also raise the relationship between the Civil Code of Quebec (C.C.Q.) and special statutes under Quebec law.\nThe Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal (FMAT), a Quebec administrative tribunal, claims jurisdiction over the appellants, four British Columbia residents who are alleged to have contravened the Quebec Securities Act, CQLR, c. V-1.1, by engaging in a transnational pump-and-dump securities manipulation scheme with links to Quebec. In a pump-and-dump scheme, promoters boost the price of a stock by releasing false or misleading statements and then profit by selling their holdings in that stock at inflated prices. The scheme is alleged to have injured investors, including investors in Quebec.\nThe appellants challenged the FMATs jurisdiction over them as out-of-province defendants. However, the FMAT ruled that it has jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants under s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, CQLR, c. A-33.2, which grants the FMAT jurisdiction to make determinations under the Securities Act. The FMAT interpreted and applied this jurisdictional provision in light of this Courts decision in Unifund Assurance Co. v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 40, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 63, which held that a provincial regulatory scheme constitutionally applies to an out-of-province defendant when there is a real and substantial connection, also described as a sufficient connection, between the province and the defendant (Unifund, at paras. 55-56). The FMAT highlighted several factors that, in its view, created such a connection between Quebec and the appellants alleged contraventions.\nThe Superior Court of Quebec dismissed applications for judicial review from the FMATs decision. On appeal, the Court of Appeal of Quebec affirmed the FMATs jurisdiction, but the court divided on the appropriate legal basis for doing so. Speaking for the majority, Marcotte J.A. ruled that the FMAT correctly found a real and substantial connection between Quebec and the appellants under the test in Unifund. In separate reasons concurring in the result, Mainville J.A. would have grounded the FMATs jurisdiction under Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q., which establishes rules for the International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities, in particular under art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q.  which gives Quebec jurisdiction over personal actions of a patrimonial nature in which a fault was committed in Quebec, an injurious act or omission occurred in Quebec, or injury was suffered in Quebec  or art. 3136 C.C.Q.  which allows a Quebec authority to hear a dispute even though it has no other basis for jurisdiction if the dispute has a sufficient connection with Quebec and taking proceedings abroad is impossible or cannot reasonably be required.\nFor the reasons that follow, we conclude that the FMAT has jurisdiction over the appellants under the Securities Act and the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers.\nThe C.C.Q. is the starting point in any interpretive exercise involving the C.C.Q. and special laws. The preliminary provision of the C.C.Q. provides that the C.C.Q. is the jus commune and the foundation of all other laws in Quebec, and that other laws may complement or make exceptions to the C.C.Q.\nIn this case, the character of the proceedings and the conclusions sought before the FMAT could suggest, at first blush, a regulatory matter that does not concern the C.C.Q. The dispute involves a public regulator seeking prohibitions and administrative penalties under a legislative scheme designed to protect the public interest in the securities markets. One might indeed expect jurisdiction over this regulatory scheme to stand outside the scope of Quebecs law of general application established by the C.C.Q., which mainly governs persons, relations between persons, and property (preliminary provision). But securities law, as enacted by the Quebec Securities Act, is of a hybrid character. On the one hand, the Securities Act has enforcement and administrative law rules in place to protect the public interest that give the legislation a fundamentally regulatory orientation. On the other hand, the Securities Act also has a title bearing on civil actions (Title VIII). While the FMATs jurisdiction bears principally on the regulatory orientation of the Securities Act, its authority established by the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers extends to the title on civil actions in the Securities Act, except where excluded by law. Given this hybrid character of securities regulation, the better view is that Book Ten of the C.C.Q., as part of Quebecs jus commune, is the appropriate starting point for analyzing the International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities in this field, including the FMAT.\nThis calls for a review of the general and special rules in the C.C.Q. to determine whether the FMAT has jurisdiction over the out-of-province defendants in this case. We conclude that the C.C.Q.s rules on private international law are applicable. However, here they provide no basis for jurisdiction over the out-of-province defendants, whether under art. 3134 C.C.Q., which sets out the residual rule based on domicile in Quebec, art. 3148 C.C.Q., which specifies the cases in which Quebec authorities have jurisdiction over personal actions of a patrimonial nature, or art. 3136 C.C.Q., which allows a Quebec authority to hear a dispute despite having no jurisdiction provided the dispute has a sufficient connection with Quebec and taking proceedings abroad is impossible or cannot reasonably be required.\nEven so, we conclude that the FMAT has jurisdiction over the appellants under Quebec securities legislation. The Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers provides the FMAT with jurisdiction to make determinations under the Securities Act, including when there is a real and substantial connection between Quebec and out-of-province defendants. In our view, the allegations that the appellants used Quebec as the face of their securities manipulation and injured Quebec investors establish such a connection to give the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants. \nPut another way, the Quebec securities legislation constitutionally applies to the appellants. The Quebec legislature has exercised its prescriptive legislative jurisdiction  its power to enact binding rules applicable to out-of-province parties with a real and substantial connection to Quebec. Those rules are engaged in the circumstances of this case. As a result, the FMAT also has adjudicatory jurisdiction, or the authority to hear this matter involving the appellants. \nWe would thus affirm the FMATs jurisdiction and dismiss the appeals.\nBackground\nThe respondent Autorite des marches financiers (AMF) is an administrative agency that regulates Quebecs financial sector. It brought an originating pleading before the FMAT alleging that the appellants, who are four British Columbia residents, contravened the Quebec Securities Act by participating in a transnational pump-and-dump scheme with links to Quebec that injured investors.\nThe AMF alleged that the appellants committed contraventions of Quebecs Securities Act by improperly or fraudulently influencing the market price or the value of securities (s. 195.2), and by knowingly participating in securities transactions that created an artificial security price (s. 199.1). The AMF asked the FMAT to order the appellants to cease engaging in securities transactions (s. 265) and to prohibit them from acting as directors or officers of an issuer, dealer, adviser, or investment fund manager for five years (s. 273.3). The AMF also asked the FMAT to impose administrative penalties on the appellants (s. 273.1).\nThe FMATs function includes making determinations regarding matters relating to the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers as well as under a range of Quebec legislation, including the Securities Act. The FMAT [translation] is an independent administrative tribunal specializing in securities that performs decision-making functions (S. Rousseau, Lapplication de la legislation sur les valeurs mobilieres au Quebec: une etude du role du Tribunal administratif des marches financiers (2017), 76 R. du B. 1, at p. 14). The FMAT exercises its discretion in the public interest (Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, s. 93).\nThe appellants filed motions for a declinatory exception challenging the FMATs jurisdiction over them as out-of-province defendants. On such a motion, the decision maker does not consider the merits of the case, but assumes the facts alleged to be true and asks whether these facts would bring the matter within its jurisdictional competence. The decision maker also refrains from evaluating the parties evidence, unless the facts alleged are specifically contested (Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 SCC 78, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 205, at paras. 31-32; Air Canada v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1554, at p. 1558). In this case, the facts alleged are uncontested, and thus are assumed to be true for the purposes of the jurisdictional challenges.\nNone of the appellants specifically alleges that they were improperly served. The FMAT held a special hearing, which the appellants did not attend, at which it authorized the AMF to serve the appellants Frederick Langford Sharp, Vincenzo Antonio Carnovale, and Pasquale Antonio Rocca with the AMFs originating pleading and notice of hearing by publication of a press release on the AMFs website.\nThe AMF alleged that the appellants securities manipulation scheme had several links to Quebec. The appellants alleged activities revolved around the promotion of a shell company named Solo International, Inc., which was incorporated in Nevada in the United States in April 2010 to offer interior design services, and whose shares traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) market in New York. In October 2011, Michel Plante, a Quebec resident, acquired three million shares in Solo and became its majority shareholder, taking control of both Solo and its Quebec subsidiary. Because Solo was traded on the OTC market and was directed or administered in or from Quebec after July 31, 2012, Solo was a reporting issuer and subject to continuous disclosure and other obligations under the Quebec Securities Act (s. 68; Regulation 51-105 respecting Issuers Quoted in the U.S. Over-the-Counter Markets, CQLR, c. V-1.1, r. 24.1, s. 3). It is also alleged to have had a place of business in Montreal. \nAlthough Plante had no experience in the mining industry, in late 2011 Solo bought mining claims in Quebec through its subsidiary, with financing from offshore entities linked to the appellants. Most of Solos original shares were transferred to offshore entities linked to the appellants.\nThe AMF alleged that Solo engaged in two pump-and-dump operations. In the first pump operation, which occurred in January and February 2012, Solo published six press releases, some of which were issued in Montreal, advertising Solos mining exploration activities in Quebec. The appellant Shawn Van Damme helped write these press releases and partly financed the publicity campaign through one of his offshore entities. These promotional efforts led Solos stock price to increase, even though Solo had not advanced its mining activities. The appellants, acting through their offshore entities, then sold, or dumped, over 2.7 million Solo shares for a profit of about $400,000.\nIn the second pump operation, which occurred on November 14, 2012, eight promoters marketed Solos shares, even though Solo remained essentially inoperative. The appellants Van Damme, Carnovale, and Rocca financed this promotional effort through their offshore entities. The appellants, again acting through their offshore entities, then sold, or dumped, over 43 million Solo shares for a profit of more than $2.2 million.\nAccording to the AMF, the appellants pump-and-dump scheme proceeded in five steps. The appellants acted in concert to (1) acquire the shares of Solo, (2) give Solo a legitimate face, (3) promote Solos business, (4) sell their shares for a profit, and (5) distribute this profit among themselves. The AMF alleged that each appellant was involved in one or more of these steps and that the scheme had several ties to Quebec sufficient to apply Quebecs securities regulatory scheme to them: Solo was a reporting issuer in Quebec with a Montreal business address; Plante, who directed Solo, was a Quebec resident when the scheme was implemented; Solos promotional activities were accessible to Quebec residents; and, ultimately, 15 Quebec investors lost a total of $5,000.\nDecisions Below\nFinancial Markets Administrative Tribunal, 2017 QCTMF 114 (Jean-Pierre Cristel)\nThe FMAT ruled that it had jurisdiction over the appellants under s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, which grants the FMAT jurisdiction to make determinations under the Quebec Securities Act. The FMAT cited and applied the British Columbia Court of Appeals decision in McCabe v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2016 BCCA 7, 394 D.L.R. (4th) 197, at paras. 34-37 and 47, on the sufficient connection required to apply provincial securities legislation in an enforcement proceeding with transnational elements, which in turn had cited and applied this Courts decision in Unifund. There was a real and substantial connection between the appellants alleged securities contraventions and Quebec because the appellants participated and profited from a pump-and-dump scheme with several links to Quebec: (1) Solo was a reporting issuer in Quebec with a business office in Montreal, (2) Solos president, Plante, was a Quebec resident, and (3) Solos misleading press releases and online promotions were provided to Quebec investors, some of whom were defrauded. The FMAT said that even though the appellants were out-of-province residents and allegedly participated in the scheme through offshore entities, it could not ignore the contemporary reality of global and interconnected markets. This reality enhances the opportunities for market manipulation linked to more than one jurisdiction, and challenges regulators in detecting and investigating securities offences.\nThe FMAT also dismissed the appellants argument that Quebec is forum non conveniens under art. 3135 C.C.Q. It found insufficient evidence to conclude that another forum would be better placed to decide the matter and determined that it would not be in the public interest to decline jurisdiction. The FMAT thus dismissed the appellants motions for a declinatory exception.\nSuperior Court of Quebec, 2019 QCCS 94 (Collier J.)\nThe Superior Court of Quebec dismissed the appellants applications for judicial review and held that the FMAT properly assumed jurisdiction. The court ruled that since the FMATs decision was both reasonable and correct, it did not need to determine the applicable standard of review (para. 30 (CanLII)).\nThe court stated (at para. 36) that the FMAT correctly recognized the limits of its extraterritorial reach by applying the real and substantial connection test, which the court noted was addressed in Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda, 2012 SCC 17, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 572. The court also ruled that the FMAT correctly applied the Unifund test for the constitutional applicability of provincial legislation (paras. 39-43). The FMAT recognized the limits of its territorial reach and was correct in finding a real and substantial connection between Quebec and the facts alleged against the appellants.\nThe court also stated that the private international law rules in the C.C.Q. reinforced its conclusion (para. 44). The publication of misleading press releases could constitute a fault in Quebec that injured Quebec investors. Under art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q., the fault or injury would provide Quebec authorities with jurisdiction in matters of a personal and patrimonial nature. While the court was of the view that the matter lay within the public regulatory sphere (para. 44), the alleged fault and injury in Quebec, including harm to the Quebec securities market by undermining investor confidence, supported the real and substantial connection between Quebec and the appellants.\nCourt of Appeal of Quebec, 2021 QCCA 1364, 90 Admin. L.R. (6th) 25 (Marcotte and Moore JJ.A., Mainville J.A. Concurring)\nMajority\nWriting for the majority of the Court of Appeal of Quebec, Marcotte J.A. dismissed the appeal and affirmed the FMATs jurisdiction over the appellants. The majority identified the standard of review as correctness (paras. 45-47). The question of whether the FMAT has jurisdiction over the appellants raises a constitutional issue. The test in Unifund addresses the constitutional applicability of the Quebec securities scheme to non-residents who allegedly engaged in a securities manipulation scheme with connections to Quebec. The majority added that insofar as the appellants assert for the first time on appeal that the FMAT failed to consider the private international law rules of the C.C.Q., the applicability of those rules raises an issue of central importance to the legal system, and is therefore also reviewable for correctness (para. 48).\nThe majority noted that although none of the applicable provisions of the Quebec securities scheme expressly places limits upon territorial reach, all are presumed to apply within the province (para. 56). In the majoritys view, there is no extraterritorial jurisdiction of the FMAT at issue (para. 57). The only issue is whether the FMAT has territorial jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants for alleged conduct sufficiently connected to Quebec (paras. 87-88).\nThe majority rejected the appellants argument that the private international law rules in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. exhaustively determine whether a Quebec authority such as the FMAT has jurisdiction over out-of-province parties (paras. 65-92). The majority ruled that although the C.C.Q. acts as suppletive law for many matters, including certain aspects of public law, the private international law rules in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. do not apply when no private rights are at issue (para. 70). Book Ten of the C.C.Q. does not determine jurisdiction in matters of public or criminal law where the primary basis of jurisdiction is neither personal nor real but territorial, such as in this case (para. 71). The majority saw no conflict of jurisdiction or any conflict of laws that would require the application of private international law rules to this case (paras. 63 and 78). Instead, the FMAT simply seeks to exercise its jurisdiction to make determinations under the Securities Act, pursuant to the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers (para. 78).\nThe majority ruled (at paras. 94-117) that the FMAT correctly concluded there is a real and substantial connection between Quebec and the appellants under the sufficient connection test in Unifund. The appellants used Quebec as the face of their pump-and-dump scheme, a large part of which occurred in Quebec through misleading press releases allowing them to manipulate the stock price of a Quebec-based corporation holding mining claims in the province (paras. 113-14). Given these allegations and in view of the modern reality of global and interconnected securities markets, the greater opportunities for market manipulation in such a context, and the public interest, the FMAT properly assumed jurisdiction (paras. 115-16).\nConcurrence\nMainville J.A. concurred with the majority in the result, but he disagreed with the majoritys conclusion that the private international law rules in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. for the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities are neither relevant nor applicable (para. 120). Those rules apply to Quebec Authorities, which include administrative tribunals such as the FMAT, and apply whether or not there is a conflict of jurisdiction (paras. 135-37).\nMainville J.A. stated that Unifund highlighted that the sufficient connection test for the constitutional applicability of a provincial law is not necessarily subsumed in the common law real and substantial connection test for the court of a province to take jurisdiction over a dispute, which is a rule of private international law (para. 125). He noted that this case raises both (1) the question of the constitutional applicability of the Securities Act, and (2) whether the FMAT has jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants under the rules of private international law, which is addressed mainly, if not exclusively, by Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. (para. 126).\nIn Mainville J.A.s view, the FMAT has jurisdiction over the appellants under art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q., which provides that Quebec authorities have jurisdiction in personal actions of a patrimonial nature when a fault was committed in Quebec, an injurious act or omission occurred in Quebec, or injury was suffered in Quebec (para. 144). He determined that this provision applies by analogy because this action resembles a personal action of a patrimonial nature. The fault requirement would be met by the allegation that misleading press releases were published in Quebec and the injury requirement would be met by the allegations that investors incurred harm in Quebec.\nAlternatively, Mainville J.A. would have affirmed the FMATs jurisdiction over the appellants under art. 3136 C.C.Q., which provides that even though a Quebec authority has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may nevertheless hear it provided the dispute has a sufficient connection with Quebec and if proceedings abroad prove impossible or cannot be reasonably required (paras. 152-56). In Mainville J.A.s view, this case meets the sufficient connection requirement of both art. 3136 C.C.Q. and the Constitution because of the connections between the pump-and-dump scheme and Quebec (para. 156). The second condition of art. 3136 C.C.Q. is also met, because there was no evidence that authorities of another state could make a decision in this case (paras. 157-59).\nIssues\nThe main issues in these appeals are (1) the standard of review of the FMATs decision that it has jurisdiction over the appellants and (2) whether the FMAT properly assumed jurisdiction.\nAnalysis\nThe Standard of Review\nThe parties agree that under the framework established by this Court in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, the standard of review of the FMATs decision is correctness.\nAlthough presumptively the standard of review when a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision is reasonableness, this presumption is rebutted when the legislature explicitly prescribes the applicable standard of review or when the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied (Vavilov, at paras. 16-17; Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900, at para. 27). The rule of law is implicated in cases involving constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov, at para. 17). The standard of correctness also applies when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction over a legal issue in a statute (Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, at para. 28).\nHere, the FMATs jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants raises a constitutional issue regarding the territorial reach of provincial legislation. The FMAT addressed its jurisdiction by examining whether the securities scheme constitutionally applies to the appellants under the test in Unifund, which asks whether there is a sufficient connection between Quebec and the appellants to support the application of Quebecs securities regulatory scheme (paras. 55-56). This constitutional question is reviewable for correctness under the Vavilov framework.\nEven assuming, as the appellants contend, that the question of the FMATs jurisdiction over out-of-province parties is to be resolved by applying Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q.  an argument raised for the first time before the Quebec Court of Appeal  that question is still reviewable for correctness because it raises a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. Whether the C.C.Q. grants the FMAT jurisdiction over out-of-province parties in the circumstances involves the methodology for determining the relationship between the C.C.Q. as the jus commune, or general law, and special statutes in Quebec. This is a general question of law that requires a uniform and consistent answer because it has implications for many other statutes (Vavilov, at paras. 59-62). We address that issue next.\nThe Relationship Between the C.C.Q. and Special Statutes\nThe majority and concurring reasons in the Quebec Court of Appeal reflect different methodologies for determining when the C.C.Q. establishes the international jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal over out-of-province defendants. More generally, they articulate different conceptions of the relationship between the C.C.Q., as the jus commune, and special statutes targeting particular subjects relating to private international law. The majority reasoned that the question before the court concerns the constitutional applicability of the Quebec securities scheme to out-of-province parties, rather than private international law, and thus the FMATs jurisdiction should be determined by applying the real and substantial connection test in Unifund (paras. 63 and 90-91). The majority also concluded that the private international law rules of Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. do not apply to determine the FMATs jurisdiction because (1) no private rights are at issue before the FMAT (paras. 70-71), and (2) there is no conflict of jurisdiction or any conflict of law that calls for applying private international law rules (para. 78). By contrast, the concurrence concluded that (1) the rules in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. apply to all Quebec Authorities, including administrative tribunals such as the FMAT in respect of actions pertaining to Quebecs constitutional jurisdiction over property and civil rights (paras. 135-36), (2) whether or not there is a conflict of jurisdiction (para. 137), and (3) whether or not an action pertains to matters in the C.C.Q. (para. 142).\nThis section addresses this methodological debate by considering the relationship between the C.C.Q. and special statutes. As will be elaborated, the C.C.Q., as stated in the preliminary provision, lays down the jus commune, or law of general application, in all matters within the letter, spirit or object of its provisions which mainly govern persons, relations between persons, and property. For these matters, the C.C.Q. is the foundation of all other laws. Accordingly, for such matters, interpretive exercises must begin with the C.C.Q., although special legislation can derogate from the C.C.Q. when the legislature expresses its intention to do so and, of course, some of the law of general application may be found outside the C.C.Q. in general principles of law. Contrary to the conclusion of the majority of the Court of Appeal, provisions of Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. can, in principle, apply to an administrative tribunal like the FMAT, even if no private right is in issue and even if no conflict of jurisdiction arises, as long as these parameters of the jus commune alluded to in the preliminary provision are met. However, as we elaborate in later sections, while the C.C.Q. does not grant the FMAT jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants in this case, the jurisdictional provisions of the special securities scheme, properly interpreted in light of Unifund, do grant jurisdiction because the appellants, and their alleged contraventions, have a sufficient connection to Quebec.\nThe Preliminary Provision of the C.C.Q.\nThe starting point for understanding the relationship between the C.C.Q. and special statutes is the preliminary provision of the C.C.Q.: \nThe Civil Code of Quebec, in harmony with . . . the Charter of human rights and freedoms . . . and the general principles of law, governs persons, relations between persons, and property.\n\nThe Civil Code comprises a body of rules which, in all matters within the letter, spirit or object of its provisions, lays down the jus commune, expressly or by implication. In these matters, the Code is the foundation of all other laws, although other laws may complement the Code or make exceptions to it.\nSeveral aspects of the preliminary provision elucidate the relationship between the C.C.Q. and special statutes.\nThe C.C.Q. Lays Down the Jus Commune\nFirst, the preliminary provision announces that the C.C.Q. lays down the jus commune, or the law of general application, of Quebec in all matters within the letter, spirit or object of its provisions, which mainly govern persons, relations between persons, and property (see also Federation des producteurs acericoles du Quebec v. Regroupement pour la commercialisation des produits de lerable inc., 2006 SCC 50, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 591, at para. 10; Gilles E. Neron Communication Marketing Inc. v. Chambre des notaires du Quebec, 2004 SCC 53, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 95, at para. 56; Finney v. Barreau du Quebec, 2004 SCC 36, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17, at para. 26; see also J.-M. Brisson, Le Code civil, droit commun?, in Le nouveau Code civil: interpretation et application  Les journees Maximilien-Caron 1992 (1993), 292, at pp. 308-15). Thus, the C.C.Q. does not simply lay down rules of private law on a narrow compass (Prudhomme v. Prudhomme, 2002 SCC 85, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 663, at para. 28). \nThe C.C.Q. Has a Suppletive Role\nSecond, as the jus commune, the C.C.Q. is the foundation of all other laws, although other laws may complement the [C.C.Q.] or make exceptions to it. The C.C.Q. has a suppletive role and can fill gaps in special statutes to the extent that legislation is silent on a given matter, thus preventing a legal vacuum (Federation des producteurs, at paras. 10 and 29; see also Dore v. Verdun (City), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 862, at para. 18; Montreal (City) v. Octane Strategie inc., 2019 SCC 57, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 138, at para. 36; A.-F. Bisson, La Disposition preliminaire du Code civil du Quebec (1999), 44 McGill L.J. 539, at p. 558; H. P. Glenn, La Disposition preliminaire du Code civil du Quebec, le droit commun et les principes generaux du droit (2005), 46 C. de D. 339, at p. 349). The suppletive nature of the C.C.Q. flows from its foundational character, as confirmed by the preliminary provision. As elucidated by the Ministere de la Justice, Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, vol. I, Le Code civil du Quebec  Un mouvement de societe (1993), at p. 1, one objective of the second paragraph of the preliminary provision [translation] is to promote a dynamic interpretation of the Civil Code and encourage the use of its provisions to interpret and apply other legislation and fill any gaps in that legislation, where it relates to matters or makes use of concepts or institutions that come under the Civil Code.\nFor example, the C.C.Q. plays a suppletive role in the domains of corporate law (Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise, 2004 SCC 68, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 461, at paras. 29 and 54), insolvency law (Lefebvre (Trustee of), 2004 SCC 63, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 326, at para. 16), and employment law (Quebec (Commission des normes du travail) v. Asphalte Desjardins inc., 2014 SCC 51, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 514, at paras. 28-32), among other areas. Such suppletive rules apply absent a legislative intention to exclude them (J. E. C. Brierley, Quebecs Common Laws (Droits Communs): How Many Are There?, in E. Caparros et al., eds., Melanges Louis-Philippe Pigeon (1989), 109, at p. 126; R. A. Macdonald, Encoding Canadian Civil Law, in Melanges Paul-Andre Crepeau (1997), 579, at pp. 595-96 and 599).\nAll Interpretive Exercises of Laws Governing Persons, Relations Between Persons, and Property Must Begin With the C.C.Q.\nThird, as the jus commune and the foundation of all other Quebec laws, the C.C.Q. is the primary source of Quebec civil law and serves as the starting point in any interpretive exercise involving a special statute in matters within the letter, spirit, or object of the C.C.Q.s provisions. The preliminary provision of the C.C.Q. established the new position assigned to the Civil Code in the hierarchy of the sources of law in matters within the legislative jurisdiction of the Quebec National Assembly (Finney, at para. 26; see also D. Lemieux, The Role of the Civil Code of Quebec in Administrative Law (2005), 18 C.J.A.L.P. 143, at p. 147; Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, vol. I, at p. 1 ([translation] its privileged position in our legislative system as a whole)).\nWriting on the Civil Code of Lower Canada, Professors John E. C. Brierley and Roderick A. Macdonald have observed that, [f]rom the dual perspective of the actual operation of the Code as a living structure of written legal rules and of its own underlying logic, the Code is intellectually pre-eminent (Quebec Civil Law: An Introduction to Quebec Private Law (1993), at pp. 134-35). They add that [b]y virtue of its vocation to state the general law, [the Code] claims the centre ground of the Civil law. By virtue of its being written, it provides a textual referent by which or through which all other sources of law are understood to pass (p. 135). Given this primacy, other sources (including other legislative sources such as statutes) are viewed as vehicles of interpretation, and all interpretive exercises must necessarily begin with the Code (p. 135). \nThis Court has regularly applied this methodology. For example, in Finney, this Court explained that examination of the liability of governments begins with the application of the rules of liability established by the Civil Code of Quebec (para. 27). In Gilles E. Neron Communication Marketing, this Court indicated that under the Quebec law of civil liability for defamation, [t]he starting point is not the common law but the Civil Code of Quebec, which is the basic general law in Quebec, as provided for in the preliminary provision of the Civil Code (para. 56). Similarly, Professor Macdonald has explained that a civil code ordains the modes of legal analysis and interpretation (p. 599). For his part, Professor Brierley has observed that [t]he Civil Code is . . . droit commun in relation to other enactment[s] because it is the fundamental reference point from which such other legislation proceeds (p. 123).\nThe Preliminary Provision of the C.C.Q. Has Normative Force\nFourth, given that the preliminary provision establishes the hierarchy of sources in Quebec civil law and the C.C.Q. has a suppletive role, the preliminary provision has normative force of law (Prudhomme, at para. 30, citing Dore). It is not a mere preamble; rather, it has the force of law of an enactment and establishes the C.C.Q.s foundational role in Quebec civil law (Bisson, at p. 552; Lemieux (2005), at p. 147).\nSpecial Laws May Complement or Derogate From the C.C.Q.\nThe preliminary provision of the C.C.Q. states that other laws may complement the [C.C.Q.] or make exceptions to it. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between special laws that complement the C.C.Q. and those that derogate from or make exceptions to it (C. Lemieux, Elements dinterpretation en droit civil (1994), 24 R.D.U.S. 221, at p. 234). \nAs Professors Pierre-Andre Cote and Mathieu Devinat have noted, this Court has recognized many examples in which the C.C.Q. complements the legal regimes established by special statutes, such as by providing rules on prescription (Dore, at paras. 18 and 20); civil liability based on a breach of the Quebec Charter of human rights and freedoms, CQLR, c. C-12 (Beliveau St-Jacques v. Federation des employees et employes de services publics inc., [1996] 2 S.C.R. 345, at pp. 403-6); and evidence (Quebec (Public Curator) v. Syndicat national des employes de lhopital St-Ferdinand, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 211, at pp. 228-29) (see P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at p. 388, fn. 256). In such cases, the C.C.Q. [translation] is not only a conceptual reservoir for special statutes, but also their normative complement (Cote and Devinat, at p. 388).\nIn addition, a special statute may derogate from the C.C.Q., either expressly or by implication (see Octane, at para. 39; Brierley, at p. 125). The C.C.Q. will apply as suppletive law unless special legislation clearly derogates from it (Lemieux (2005), at p. 148). This reflects [translation] a general principle of predominance of special legislation (Cote and Devinat, at p. 410); that is, specialia generalibus derogant, which means that special legislation derogates from contrary general legislation (A. Mayrand, Dictionnaire de maximes et locutions latines utilisees en droit (4th ed. 2007), at p. 572; see also Dore, at para. 41). As Professor H. Patrick Glenn noted, [translation] [l]ike all suppletive general law, [the C.C.Q.] therefore yields to sources that are more specific, more imperative, which is also contemplated by the [Preliminary] Provision (p. 349).\nFor example, a special statute may derogate from the C.C.Q. if the legislature provides sufficiently detailed and specific statutory language suggesting that it did not intend the general provisions of the C.C.Q. to override the special statute (Compagnie dimmeubles Yale ltee v. Kirkland (Ville de), [1996] R.J.Q. 502 (C.Q.), at p. 507; Dionne v. Commission scolaire des Patriotes, 2014 SCC 33, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 765, at para. 37). Similarly, if the special statute provides a complete rule on a matter, and is neither silent nor insufficient on an essential element, the special statute applies instead of the general law in the C.C.Q., unless the legislature provides otherwise (Lalonde v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 261, at pp. 278-79, citing City of Ottawa v. Town of Eastview, [1941] S.C.R. 448, at p. 462; see also Gignac v. Gauvin, 2009 QCCS 524, 73 C.C.P.B. 47, at para. 54).\nThe Court of Appeal Erred in Its Methodology for Determining When the C.C.Q. Applies\nThe proper interpretive methodology in determining the relationship between the C.C.Q. and a special statute is to start with the jus commune in the C.C.Q., and then to ask whether the special statute complements or derogates from the jus commune (see generally Dore, at paras. 15-21; see also paras. 40-41; Brierley, at p. 125-26). Often, the answer to this question will be obvious and will not require an extensive interpretation exercise. In this case, the majority erred with respect to each of the two reasons it gave for concluding that the C.C.Q. does not apply in the circumstances, even though, as will be explained, the court was correct that the FMAT has jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants under the special statutes.\nBook Ten of the C.C.Q. Can Apply to Administrative Tribunals Even if Private Rights Are Not at Issue\nFirst, the majority concluded that although the private international law rules of Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. apply to all Quebec authorities, including judicial and administrative tribunals, they do not determine the FMATs jurisdiction because no private rights (para. 70) are at issue in a proceeding before the FMAT. While the majority rightly recognized that the C.C.Q. acts as suppletive law in a wide range of circumstances, including certain aspects of public law (para. 70), they narrowed the compass of the jus commune by implying that private rights must be in issue. The majoritys methodology erroneously suggested that whether Book Ten of the C.C.Q. applies depends on characterizing the issue before the court, seemingly limiting its scope to matters of private law. However, the jus commune, including Book Ten, is not limited to matters of private rights, but rather extends to all matters within the letter, spirit or object of the C.C.Q.s provisions.\nIn reaching its conclusion, the majority noted that the respondent had cited the Quebec Court of Appeals decision in Donaldson v. Autorite des marches financiers, 2020 QCCA 401, in support of its position that the C.C.Q. does not apply to proceedings before the FMAT. In Donaldson, the Court of Appeal held that the three-year prescription period under art. 2925 C.C.Q. did not apply to administrative proceedings brought by the AMF before the FMAT to impose an administrative monetary penalty under s. 273.1 of the Securities Act for contravention of the Act or a regulation made under its authority. One reason the court in Donaldson ruled that the C.C.Q. did not apply is because the C.C.Q. establishes the jus commune over only those matters falling under private law (paras. 43-44 (CanLII)). The court in Donaldson distinguished between private law matters, which fall under the purview of the C.C.Q., and public law matters, which do not. With respect, insofar as this approach creates a divide between public and private law not reflected in the letter, spirit, or object of the C.C.Q., it is incorrect in law.\nAlthough the first paragraph of the preliminary provision states that the C.C.Q., in harmony with the Charter of human rights and freedoms, and the general principles of law, governs persons, relations between persons, and property, this paragraph does not limit the C.C.Q.s application to stating rules of private law, even though the C.C.Q. contains many such rules. The second paragraph of the preliminary provision also provides that the C.C.Q. lays down the jus commune, or law of general application, in all matters within the letter, spirit or object of its provisions. Moreover, the C.C.Q. contains rules of public law and is an important source of administrative law in Quebec (P. Garant, with P. Garant and J. Garant, Droit administratif (7th ed. 2017), at p. 10).\nFor example, art. 1376 C.C.Q. provides that the rules in Book Five, Obligations, apply to the State and its bodies, and to all other legal persons established in the public interest, subject to any other rules of law which may be applicable to them. Article 1376 C.C.Q. is a public law rule (Prudhomme, at para. 27; see also Octane, at para. 36; Finney, at paras. 26-27; Glenn, at pp. 350-51). In addition, art. 300 C.C.Q. provides that legal persons established in the public interest, although primarily governed by special Acts by which they are constituted and by those which are applicable to them, are also governed by the C.C.Q. where the provisions of such Acts require to be complemented, particularly with regard to their status as legal persons, their property or their relations with other persons. Article 300 C.C.Q. is also a public law rule (see Dore, at paras. 15-17 and 20-21; see also Finney, at para. 26; Octane, at para. 36; Glenn, at pp. 350-51). And because the C.C.Q. is the jus commune and the foundation of all other laws, [translation] the Civil Code is also applicable to the state or its components where a rule of public law has so determined (Brisson, at p. 313). Thus, the Civil Code itself partakes of public law (Lemieux (2005), at p. 144; see also pp. 149-55), and serves to ground much public and administrative law (Macdonald, at p. 592).\nAs a result, the proper way to determine whether the C.C.Q. applies does not involve characterizing the right at issue as either a private law or public law matter. The C.C.Q. is not limited to stating rules or rights of private law. As this Court has explained, [i]t is important to recall . . . that the new Code does not simply lay down a body of private law rules . . . . As stated in its preliminary provision, it is the jus commune of Quebec (Prudhomme, at para. 28 (emphasis in original); see also Finney, at para. 26; Federation des producteurs, at para. 10). As this Court has also noted, a draft version of the preliminary provision had provided that the C.C.Q. laid down the private law, but in response to debate in the legal literature, the expression private law was replaced by the more inclusive expression jus commune (Prudhomme, at para. 29). The backdrop for this change, the Court found, leaves no doubt as to the very conscious decision made by the legislature to give the Civil Code the broadest possible operational scope (para. 29; Bisson, at pp. 551-53). In sum, to quote Professor Alain-Francois Bisson: [translation] . . . the Civil Code is not a code of private law; it is a code of jus commune, which does not have private law as its exclusive subject matter (p. 563).\nBook Ten of the C.C.Q., which codifies the rules of private international law in Quebec, likewise applies as the jus commune beyond matters of private law, strictly defined. The rules of private international law are concerned with the jurisdiction of courts of the Canadian provinces, with whether that jurisdiction should be exercised, with what law should apply to a dispute, and with whether a court should recognize and enforce a judgment rendered by a court of another province or country (Van Breda, at para. 21; see also C. Emanuelli, Etude comparative sur le droit international prive au Canada (2019), at p. 2; G. Goldstein and E. Groffier, Droit international prive, vol. I, Theorie generale (1998), at pp. 4-5). These matters extend beyond the narrow scope of private law and also apply, as part of the jus commune of Quebec, in public and administrative law contexts. \nThe jurisdictional rules invoked by the appellants here are contained in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q., International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities, and unless otherwise provided by law apply to administrative tribunals. To be sure, the FMAT is an administrative tribunal with adjudicative functions charged with settling disputes between a citizen and an administrative authority under s. 9 of the Act respecting administrative justice, CQLR, c. J-3. Quebec authorities within the meaning of Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. were intended to include [translation] judicial, administrative and even ecclesiastical bodies, for example . . .[,] if [they are] considered as such by Quebec law (Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, vol. II, at p. 1998). Quebec authorities have since been found to include, for example, arbitrators, where there is a relevant foreign element justifying resort to the C.C.Q.s rules of private international law (see Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs, 2007 SCC 34, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801, at para. 53); Quebec courts (Barer v. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 SCC 13, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 573, at paras. 111-12; Ormuco inc. v. Ernst & Young, 2022 QCCA 405, at paras. 8-9 (CanLII)); and administrative tribunals (Ormuco inc., at paras. 8-9; J. P. McEvoy, Forum of necessity in Quebec Private International Law: C.c.Q. art. 3136 (2005), 35 R.G.D. 61, at p. 66, fn. 8; S. Guillemard and V. A. Ly, Elements de droit international prive quebecois (2019), at p. 75).\nIn short, the C.C.Q. is an important source of administrative law in Quebec and, unless otherwise provided by law, Title Three of Book Ten applies to administrative tribunals like the FMAT regardless of whether private rights are at issue, as long as the matters dealt with by the administrative tribunals are within the letter, spirit or object of [the C.C.Q.s] provisions. Otherwise, the scheme establishing the tribunals jurisdiction does not fall within the purview of the law of general application established by the C.C.Q. This is because the object of the regulatory scheme is not captured by the jus commune.\nHad the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal considered these principles, it would not have concluded that Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. does not apply. Indeed, the scheme establishing the FMATs jurisdiction makes it fall within the purview of the law of general application established by the C.C.Q.\nThe FMAT adjudicates securities law matters, a hybrid field involving standards established to regulate markets in the public interest, as well as rules designed to resolve disputes between parties. On the one hand, Title VII of the Securities Act sets out various prohibitions and penalties and Title IX vests the FMAT with powers to make other regulatory orders. On the other hand, Title VIII deals with civil actions, including certain actions brought by market participants for rescission, revision of prices, and damages, and also extends to actions in damages relating to the acquisition and dispositions of securities (ss. 213.1 et seq.). Under s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, the FMAT has jurisdiction to exercise all the functions and powers assigned to it under the Securities Act, including under the Title VIII on civil actions (e.g., see s. 233.2 of the Securities Act, which sets out the power to provide a remedy to an interested person in respect of distribution of certain documents, applied in Mines dor Visible inc. v. Zara Resources Inc., 2013 QCBDR 95). As a result, the FMAT can make orders that have important consequences on the private rights of actors concerned. The securities scheme establishing the FMAT thus vests it with the powers to adjudicate matters within the letter, spirit or object of [the C.C.Q.s] provisions.  \nMoreover, s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers provides that any interested person can seize the FMAT of a matter involving the Securities Act and other aspects of its jurisdiction. This prompted Professor Stephane Rousseau to observe that [translation] the powers [of the FMAT] also apply to disputes that do not concern the AMF and involve only market participants (p. 18). Although persons without an interest cannot substitute themselves for the AMF, the statute gives those whose private rights are affected in the securities market the power to seize the FMAT of a matter (see Financiere Manuvie v. Proteau, 2013 QCBDR 137, at paras. 26, 34, and 38-39 (CanLII)).\nGiven this hybridity, the international jurisdiction of the Quebec authority established to decide matters relating to securities law can be seen to involve, in some measure, the governing of matters relating to persons, relations between persons, and property, as set out in the preliminary provision.\nIndeed, provisions of the Securities Act itself refer to the C.C.Q. (e.g., ss. 235 and 273.3), demonstrating the C.C.Q.s suppletive role to the provisions of the Securities Act. The C.C.Q.s suppletive role can also be gleaned from s. 236.1 of the Securities Act. This provision derogates from the rules for the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities set out in Book Ten of the C.C.Q., by establishing a special jurisdictional rule for civil actions relating to the distribution of a security, a take-over bid, an issuer bid, or actions under Title VIII of the Securities Act. It states that such actions may be brought before the court of the plaintiffs residence and that any contrary stipulation as to the jurisdiction of the courts is without effect.\nSection 236.1 of the Securities Act illustrates two aspects of the relationship between the C.C.Q. and the Quebec securities legislation. First, it suggests that the rules in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. otherwise serve a suppletive role to the Securities Act. Second, this provision also confirms that not all of the rules bearing on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities are to be found in the C.C.Q.\nIn light of the foregoing, the international jurisdiction of the FMAT should be considered, first, in light of the rules set forth in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q.\nTitle Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. Applies Broadly Even in Absence of a Conflict of Jurisdiction or a Conflict of Laws\nSecond, the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal can be read as having suggested that the private international law rules of Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. do not apply to the FMAT because there is no conflict of jurisdiction or any conflict of laws that calls for the application of private international law rules (para. 78). We respectfully disagree with that premise. Title Three of Book Ten applies not just in cases of conflict of jurisdiction; it applies more broadly to determine the International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities, meaning whether Quebec authorities can assume jurisdiction over disputes containing a foreign element (see Dell, at paras. 22-23; Guillemard and Ly, at pp. 19 and 77; C. Emanuelli, Droit international prive quebecois (3rd ed. 2011), at No. 148). As explained in the Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, vol. II, at p. 1998:\n[translation] . . . the traditional expression conflict of jurisdiction was not used, because the purpose here is solely to determine the cases in which Quebec authorities will have jurisdiction to hear a dispute with a foreign element, not the cases in which foreign authorities will have jurisdiction. [Emphasis in original.]\nIn fairness to the majority, when they said that there was no conflict of jurisdiction that would call for the application of private international law rules, it was in support of the view that the FMAT simply sought to apply a Quebec statute to make determinations under s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, rather than to resolve an issue of competing jurisdictions. It is, however, imprecise to say that Book Ten of the C.C.Q. does not apply on the basis that the matter before the court raises no question of conflict of jurisdiction or conflict of laws.\nThe C.C.Q.s General Rules for the International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities\nIntroduction\nWe now proceed to apply the interpretive methodology outlined above regarding the relationship between the C.C.Q. and special statutes. In this section, we begin with the C.C.Q. as the jus commune. We outline the C.C.Q.s general rules for the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities and interpret arts. 3148 para. 1(3) and 3136 C.C.Q., which Mainville J.A. relied on in determining that the FMAT has jurisdiction over the appellants. We conclude that neither provision, nor any other special provision, nor the residual jurisdiction rule of the C.C.Q. provides the FMAT with jurisdiction over the appellants. In the following sections, we then review the special rules for the FMATs jurisdiction under the Quebec securities scheme, and explain how the territorial reach of those provisions is determined in accordance with this Courts decision in Unifund. We interpret the relevant special jurisdictional rules of the Quebec securities scheme in light of Unifund, and explain why that scheme provides the FMAT with jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants in this case.\nThe C.C.Q. Does Not Give the FMAT Jurisdiction Over the Appellants\nAs previously discussed, Book Ten of the C.C.Q. sets out the rules of private international law in Quebec and contains a well-developed set of rules and principles in this area (Van Breda, at para. 21). The rules of private international law in Quebec include the rules for the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities codified in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. Book Ten limits the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities to matters closely linked to the province (Newfoundland and Labrador (Attorney General) v. Uashaunnuat (Innu of Uashat and of Mani-Utenam), 2020 SCC 4, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 15, at para. 16). These rules must be read as a coherent whole and in light of the principles of comity, order and fairness (Spar Aerospace, at para. 55; see also Van Breda, at para. 21; Uashaunnuat, at para. 17).\nTitle Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. begins with general rules. The first provision, art. 3134 C.C.Q., states that [i]n the absence of any special provision, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction when the defendant is domiciled in Quebec. This is a suppletive or residual jurisdictional rule for international jurisdiction based on domicile, which applies in the absence of an applicable special provision in Chapter II of Title Three of Book Ten (Uashaunnuat, at para. 18). Since the appellants are not domiciled in Quebec, unless a special provision in Chapter II of Title Three of Book Ten gives the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants, there will be no basis for the FMAT to assert jurisdiction under the general rules of private international law set out in Book Ten of the C.C.Q.\nAn examination of the jurisdictional rules set out in Book Ten and more specifically arts. 3148 para. 1(3) and 3136 C.C.Q., relied on by Mainville J.A., leads to the conclusion that no provision gives the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants. We address each rule discussed by Mainville J.A. in turn.\nArticle 3148 Para. 1(3) C.C.Q.\nArticle 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. states:\n3148. In personal actions of a patrimonial nature, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction in the following cases:\n\n. . .\n\n(3) a fault was committed in Quebec, injury was suffered in Quebec, an injurious act or omission occurred in Quebec or one of the obligations arising from a contract was to be performed in Quebec;\nMainville J.A. accepted that the present matter before the FMAT is not a personal action of a patrimonial nature in the usual sense, but found that it is very close to being so, and therefore applied art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. by analogy (para. 144). We respectfully disagree with this conclusion.\nTo begin with, art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. does not apply directly because the proceeding before the FMAT does not involve a personal action of a patrimonial nature. A personal action of a patrimonial nature implies the assertion of rights that in their very essence have a monetary value and are transmissible as property (Brierley and Macdonald, at p. 156; see also J.-L. Baudouin and P.-G. Jobin, Les obligations (7th ed. 2013), by P.-G. Jobin and N. Vezina, at No. 3). It often involves a contractual or extra-contractual claim by a creditor against a debtor seeking the enforcement of the performance of an obligation (see G. Saumier, The Recognition of Foreign Judgments in Quebec  The Mirror Crackd? (2002), 81 Can. Bar Rev. 677, at p. 690; C. Walsh, The International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities in Personal Actions: An Overview (2012), 71 R. du B. 249, at p. 254). While the proceeding may have a patrimonial impact on the defendants in that, should the AMF prove successful in securing the prohibition orders and the fines sought, it will have an impact on their patrimonies, the proceeding will not result in a transfer, from one patrimony to another, to redress for example a private law wrong by compensating a loss sustained or a profit deprived. Moreover, the proceeding is not a personal action but one initiated by the securities market regulator acting in the public interest rather than in a strictly personal capacity. It does not involve a person taking legal action against another based on personal rights that are transmissible as property, as art. 3148 C.C.Q. requires. \nHowever, Mainville J.A. did not propose to apply art. 3148 C.C.Q. directly, but rather by analogy. In the civil law, reasoning by analogy is not only commonplace, but scholars have suggested it is particularly suited to the interpretation of the C.C.Q., which is cast in broad language and not typically designed to apply as a [translation] law of exception, unlike a common law statute (see Cote and Devinat, at pp. 370-71; see also Bisson, at p. 557). This Court has noted that analogy is one of the tools that can be used to ensure that the Civil Code of Quebec functions properly (Federation des producteurs, at para. 29). Importantly, reasoning by analogy, as Mainville J.A. noted, was used by this Court in respect of some of the very provisions in Book Ten that are engaged by these appeals (Uashaunnuat, at paras. 53 and 60).\nMoreover, as both Collier J. in the Superior Court and Mainville J.A. underscored, the AMFs allegations as to the misleading character of the press releases issued in Quebec are similar, in respect of the conduct in question, to an allegation of fault in the private law of civil liability. The AMFs originating pleading filed before the FMAT alleges injury sustained by Quebec investors that is said to be caused by the Quebec-based conduct of the defendants. In this sense, one might say the defendants are alleged to have engaged in conduct that is analogous to conduct that could sustain an action in civil liability in the law of obligations. While the contravention of a statute does not in itself constitute a civil fault, the violation of a statutory standard can amount to civil wrong when it amounts to a violation of the standard of conduct of a reasonable person under the general rules of civil liability (St. Lawrence Cement Inc. v. Barrette, 2008 SCC 64, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 392, at para. 34; see also Kosoian v. Societe de transport de Montreal, 2019 SCC 59, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 335, at para. 48).\nIn our view, however, reasoning by analogy cannot ground jurisdiction here. Civil law scholars have explained that this mode of interpretation for a civil code reflects [translation] the analogical extension of a rule through the use of an a pari argument (G. Cornu, Droit civil: Introduction au droit (13th ed. 2007), at p. 213). It is premised on the notion that the C.C.Q. can be extended from a circumstance in which it plainly applies to the same type of situation, but about which the C.C.Q. is silent (see pp. 213-14; Cote and Devinat, at pp. 370-71). \nThis is not a circumstance allowing for a pari reasoning. Article 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. cannot be applied by analogy in this case because to extend the administrative provisions involved here to the law of civil liability would be to change the nature and object of the proceedings to something that is fundamentally different from, rather than analogous to, personal actions of a patrimonial nature contemplated by art. 3148 C.C.Q. \nThe fundamental character of a personal action of patrimonial nature is the private enforcement of a debt (see Brierley and Macdonald, at p. 166; Jobin and Vezina, at Nos. 3 and 6). In contrast, the AMF has brought an action before the FMAT for orders, including administrative prohibitions and penalties, under Titles VII and IX of the Securities Act, in the public interest, acting in its [translation] role of supervising the financial markets, protecting investors and the public, and regulating securities trading (Rousseau, at p. 13). This focus on the public interest [translation] transcends the individual interests of certain investors (p. 30, citing Autorite des marches financiers v. Dominion Investments (Nassau) Ltd. (Dominion Investments Ltd.), 2008 QCBDRVM 4, at p. 25 (CanLII)). It aims to prevent future harm to the Quebec securities market and is neither restorative nor punitive (pp. 31-32 and 38-39). Here, there is no tenable analogy between a personal action of a patrimonial nature, which seeks the enforcement of a debt under private law, and a regulatory prosecution by the state, which seeks public interest remedies rather than simply private reparation. Such proceedings are of a fundamentally different legal character. To apply art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. to a regulatory prosecution by the state would stretch the provision well beyond its letter, spirit, and object.\nAs a result, art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. does not give the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants by reason of the misleading press releases or the resulting injury being connected to Quebec. Moreover, the fact that the defendant Solo, an out-of-province corporation, had an establishment in Quebec at the relevant time does not ground jurisdiction on the basis of art. 3148 C.C.Q. either. Although art. 3148 para. 1(2) C.C.Q. provides that Quebec authorities have jurisdiction when the defendant is a legal person that is not domiciled in Quebec but has an establishment in Quebec and the dispute relates to activities in Quebec, this rule still requires the nature of the action to be personal and of a patrimonial nature, which is not the case here.\nArticle 3136 C.C.Q. \nArticle 3136 C.C.Q. states:\n3136. Even though a Quebec authority has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may nevertheless hear it provided the dispute has a sufficient connection with Quebec, if proceedings abroad prove impossible or the institution of proceedings abroad cannot reasonably be required.\nNeither the FMAT nor the Superior Court of Quebec applied art. 3136 C.C.Q. Indeed, the AMF did not invoke this provision before the FMAT. Despite this, Mainville J.A. relied on this provision in his concurring opinion and concluded that it gives the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants.\nArticle 3136 C.C.Q. is part of a body of suppletive rules that gives a Quebec authority flexibility in determining whether it has jurisdiction (GreCon Dimter inc. v. J.R. Normand inc., 2005 SCC 46, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 401, at para. 33). Article 3136 C.C.Q. was described by LeBel J.A., as he then was, as a forum of necessity provision that [translation] is intended to resolve certain access to justice problems for a litigant who is in Quebec when the foreign forum that would normally have jurisdiction is inaccessible to the litigant for exceptional reasons, such as legal impossibility or practical impossibility that is nearly absolute (Lamborghini (Canada) inc. v. Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A., [1997] R.J.Q. 58 (C.A.), at p. 68; see also Anvil Mining Ltd. v. Association canadienne contre limpunite, 2012 QCCA 117, at paras. 97-98 (CanLII); Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company Limited v. Pohoresky, 2022 QCCA 1230, at para. 7 (CanLII); G. Goldstein, Droit international prive, vol. 2, Competence internationale des autorites quebecoises et effets des decisions etrangeres (Art. 3134 a 3168 C.c.Q.) (2012), at p. 55; and Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, vol. II, at p. 2000).\nArticle 3136 C.C.Q. states three preconditions for the provision to apply: the Quebec authority must have no jurisdiction; proceedings abroad cannot possibly be instituted or cannot reasonably be required; and the dispute must have a sufficient connection to Quebec (see Droit de la famille  1830, 2018 QCCA 24, at para. 24 (CanLII)). Because art. 3136 C.C.Q. applies only when a Quebec authority otherwise lacks jurisdiction, the provision [translation] rather represents a narrow exception to the normal rules of jurisdiction (Lamborghini, at p. 68; see also Anvil Mining, at paras. 97-98; Emanuelli (2011), at No. 168). To apply art. 3136 C.C.Q., a Quebec authority must first find that it does not have jurisdiction by other means (Goldstein, at p. 56; McEvoy, at p. 100). If the Quebec authority has jurisdiction by other means, art. 3136 C.C.Q. cannot apply.\nIn our view, art. 3136 C.C.Q. does not provide a basis for the FMATs jurisdiction in this case, for two reasons. First, the AMF did not seek to rely on art. 3136 C.C.Q. as a basis for the FMATs jurisdiction. This Court has confirmed that both art. 3135 C.C.Q., which deals with forum non conveniens, and art. 3136 C.C.Q., may be applied only if one of the parties raises them, as the court cannot apply them of its own motion (GreCon, at para. 33). Otherwise stated, [translation] only an express request can allow a judge to confer on the Quebec authorities a jurisdiction that they do not possess on the basis of article 3136 C.C.Q. (Droit de la famille  143017, 2014 QCCA 2188, at para. 55 (CanLII)). It was therefore an error to rely on art. 3136 C.C.Q. as a basis for the FMATs jurisdiction when the AMF did not invoke this provision.\nSecond, even if a party had properly raised art. 3136 C.C.Q., the provision does not apply on its face. For art. 3136 C.C.Q. to apply, a Quebec authority must have no jurisdiction to hear a dispute, as shown by its wording: Even though a Quebec authority has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute . . . . Here, as we address below, the FMAT does have jurisdiction to hear the dispute  including jurisdiction over the appellants  under the special jurisdictional rules of the Quebec securities scheme contained in the Securities Act and the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers. As a result, art. 3136 C.C.Q. does not provide a basis for the FMATs jurisdiction in this case.\nThe Quebec Securities Schemes Special Rules for the FMATs Jurisdiction \nAlthough the C.C.Q. does not grant the FMAT jurisdiction in these circumstances, it remains to consider whether the FMAT has jurisdiction under the special jurisdictional rules under Quebecs securities scheme. This Court has stated that [t]he various rules governing the private international law order of Quebec are found primarily in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. (Spar Aerospace, at para. 22). However, this does not preclude the application of other jurisdictional rules set out in special statutes (see P. Ferland and G. Laganiere, Le droit international prive, in Collection de droit de lEcole du Barreau du Quebec 2023-2024, vol. 7, Contrats, suretes, publicite des droits et droit international prive (2023), 271, at p. 303, fn. 247).\nThe FMAT has jurisdiction under two special statutes: the Quebec Securities Act and the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, now known as the Act respecting the regulation of the financial sector, CQLR, c. E-6.1. \nSection 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers provides that the FMATs function is to make determinations regarding matters brought under the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers and other Acts listed in the provision, including the Securities Act. Section 93 thus grants the FMAT jurisdiction over the adjudication of matters brought under the Securities Act:\n93. On the request of the Authority or of any interested person, the Tribunal shall exercise the functions and powers assigned to it under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2), the Money-Services Businesses Act (chapter E-12.000001), the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01) and the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1).\n\nThe Tribunal shall exercise its discretion in the public interest.\n\nThe Tribunal may not, when assessing the facts or the law for the purposes of those Acts, substitute its assessment of the public interest for that made by the Authority in making a decision.\n\n\nSection 94 grants the FMAT jurisdiction to take any measure to ensure compliance with any of the Acts referred to in s. 93, which include the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers and the Securities Act:\n94. At the request of the Authority, the Tribunal may take any measure conducive to ensuring compliance with an undertaking given under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2), the Money-Services Businesses Act (chapter E-12.000001), the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01) or the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1) or compliance with those Acts.\nThe AMF has alleged before the FMAT that the appellants violated the Securities Act by improperly or fraudulently influencing the market price or the value of securities (s. 195.2) and by knowingly participating in securities transactions that created an artificial security price (s. 199.1). In addition to setting forth the FMATs jurisdiction through the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, the legislature addressed the FMATs jurisdiction through various provisions in the Securities Act itself. The three relevant jurisdictional provisions are ss. 265, 273.1, and 273.3.\nSection 265 of the Securities Act empowers the FMAT to order a person to cease any activity in respect of securities transactions:\n265. The Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may order a person to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in securities.\n\nThe Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may, furthermore, order any person or category of persons to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in a particular security.\nSection 273.1 of the Securities Act allows the FMAT to impose an administrative penalty on an offender:\n273.1. Where the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal becomes aware of facts establishing that a person has, by an act or omission, contravened, or aided in the contravention of, a provision under this Act or a regulation made under its authority, the Tribunal may impose an administrative penalty on the offender and have it collected by the Authority.\n\nThe amount of the penalty may in no case exceed $2,000,000 for each contravention.\nFinally, s. 273.3 of the Securities Act provides that the FMAT can prohibit a person from acting as a director or officer of an issuer, dealer, adviser, or investment fund manager:\n273.3. The Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may prohibit a person from acting as a director or officer of an issuer, dealer, adviser or investment fund manager on the grounds set out in article 329 of the Civil Code, or where a penalty has been imposed on the person under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2) or the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01).\n\nThe prohibition imposed by the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may not exceed five years.\n\nThe Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may, at the request of the person concerned, lift the prohibition on such conditions as it considers appropriate.\nThese three Securities Act provisions empower the FMAT to act in a broad range of circumstances. In particular, s. 265, which allows the FMAT to order a person to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in securities, grants the FMAT a large measure of discretion when exercising its jurisdiction. It is important, however, to read these provisions in conjunction with the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, which explicitly provides for the FMATs jurisdiction to make determinations over matters brought under the two Acts. Reading the Acts together underscores that the FMAT must exercise its discretion under ss. 265, 273.1, and 273.3 of the Securities Act in the public interest (Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, s. 93).\nWe recognize that s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers provides subject-matter jurisdiction to the FMAT over matters arising under the statutes listed in s. 93 (Rousseau, at pp. 16-17; see also C. Duclos, in collaboration with R. Crete and A. Letourneau, Les autorites dencadrement, in R. Crete et al., eds., Courtiers et conseillers financiers: Encadrement des services de placement (2011), 117, at pp. 150-51; C. Duclos, La protection des epargnants dans lindustrie des services dinvestissement: une analyse de linfluence des defaillances organisationnelles sous langle du Swiss Cheese Model (2021), at p. 427). But with respect for other views, as we will explain, the relevance of this provision is not confined to subject-matter jurisdiction.\nAlthough both Acts read together, and particularly s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, grant the FMAT jurisdiction to make determinations under the Securities Act, neither statute expressly provides for the FMAT to assert jurisdiction over out-of-province parties, or otherwise limits the territorial reach of the Quebec securities scheme over interprovincial or international transactions. To evaluate whether these statutes may be applied in such circumstances, the Quebec securities scheme must be interpreted to determine its territorial reach. That issue involves consideration of this Courts decision in Unifund, which holds that the permissible territorial application of provincial legislation is determined by assessing the sufficiency of the connection among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation, and the individual or entity sought to be regulated. We address that issue next.\nThe Territorial Reach of Provincial Legislation Is Interpreted in Accordance With This Courts Decision in Unifund\nThis Courts Decision in Unifund\nIn Unifund, this Court addressed when a provincial regulatory scheme applies to an out-of-province defendant. The specific issue in Unifund was whether a reimbursement provision of Ontarios Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, applied to an out-of-province insurer. An Ontario insurer had paid statutory no-fault benefits to its clients when they were injured in a car accident in British Columbia. The Ontario insurer then claimed reimbursement of these amounts from the B.C.-based insurer of the driver who had caused the accident. The Ontario insurer invoked s. 275 of the Ontario Insurance Act, which imposed an indemnification obligation on the responsible insurer in certain cases. However, Binnie J. ruled that s. 275 of the Insurance Act did not apply in the circumstances.\nBinnie J. considered whether the connection between Ontario and matters occurring outside the province was sufficient to support the constitutional application of Ontarios regulatory regime to the out-of-province insurer (para. 22). He observed that a province has no legislative competence to legislate extraterritorially (para. 50). This territorial restriction is fundamental to our system of federalism (para. 51), and flows both from the opening words of s. 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867, which limits the territorial reach of each provincial legislature to enacting legislation [i]n each Province, and from s. 92(13), which gives a provincial legislature legislative authority to make laws in relation to property and civil rights only in the Province (para. 51 (emphasis in original)). However, Binnie J. accepted that a provincial legislative scheme can constitutionally apply to an out-of-province defendant without offending the restriction on extraterritorial legislation, provided that there is a real and substantial connection or sufficient connection  terms he used interchangeably  between the legislative scheme and the out-of-province defendant. He formulated the following test for when provincial legislation applies to an out-of-province individual or entity:\nConsideration of constitutional applicability can conveniently be organized around the following propositions:\n\n1. The territorial limits on the scope of provincial legislative authority prevent the application of the law of a province to matters not sufficiently connected to it;\n\n2. What constitutes a sufficient connection depends on the relationship among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated by it;\n\n3. The applicability of an otherwise competent provincial legislation to out-of-province defendants is conditioned by the requirements of order and fairness that underlie our federal arrangements;\n\n4. The principles of order and fairness, being purposive, are applied flexibly according to the subject matter of the legislation. [Emphasis in original; para. 56.]\nOver the last two decades, courts have regularly applied the Unifund test when determining whether a provincial regulatory scheme constitutionally applies to out-of-province defendants. \nIn Ontario College of Pharmacists v. 1724665 Ontario Inc., 2013 ONCA 381, 363 D.L.R. (4th) 724, the Ontario Court of Appeal applied the Unifund test and held that the College of Pharmacists had jurisdiction over out-of-province parties who allegedly breached statutory provisions regulating the sale of prescription drugs in Ontario (paras. 74-75). \nIn the securities context, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Berger v. Saskatchewan (Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority), 2019 SKCA 89, ruled that the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan should have applied the Unifund test to determine whether The Securities Act, 1988, S.S. 1988-89, c. S-42.2, applied to a resident of Costa Rica (paras. 64-66 (CanLII)). The court held that a province cannot use its legislative authority to empower an administrative tribunal to apply laws extraprovincially, and it noted that the question will always be whether the connection between the matter before a tribunal and the province in question is sufficient to give the tribunal jurisdiction (para. 60). \nSimilarly, the British Columbia Court of Appeal has applied the Unifund test to determine whether that provinces Securities Commission had jurisdiction over out-of-province defendants who allegedly breached the Securities Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418 (McCabe, at para. 34; see also Torudag v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2011 BCCA 458, 343 D.L.R. (4th) 743, at paras. 16-29).\nThis Court has also applied the sufficient connection test when determining whether federal regulatory legislation applies to matters involving international elements. In Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004 SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427, the Court cited Unifund and ruled that the applicability of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, to communications with international participants depends on whether there is a sufficient connection between this country and the communication in question for Canada to apply its law (para. 57).\nAs a result, the real and substantial connection test in Unifund is now the accepted test for discerning the presumptively intended reach of federal legislation as well as the constitutionally permissible application of provincial legislation (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at p. 806).\nFour aspects of the Unifund test warrant particular emphasis.\nThe Unifund Test Concerns Constitutional Applicability, Not Constitutional Validity\nFirst, the Unifund sufficient connection test is not concerned with the constitutional validity of legislation but with its constitutional applicability. Unifund does not address the situation in which the constitutional validity of provincial legislation is challenged because the legislation violates the territorial limitations on provincial legislative competence  that is, when the law is said to be ultra vires or to fall outside the jurisdiction of the enacting provincial legislature (British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2005 SCC 49, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 473; J. Blom, Constitutionalizing Canadian private international law  25 years since Morguard (2017), 13 J. Priv. Intl L. 259, at p. 288; J. Walker, Canadian Conflict of Laws (7th ed. (loose-leaf)), at  1.02). There was no constitutional challenge to the validity of the Ontario Insurance Act in Unifund, nor is there any such challenge to the Quebec securities scheme in this case. Rather, the issue is whether the relevant provincial legislation is constitutionally applicable to the out-of-province defendants (Unifund, at paras. 55-56). As Professors Elizabeth Edinger and Vaughan Black have explained, the question of constitutional applicability usually concerns interjurisdictional immunity, but may entail questions about the territorial reach of provincial legislation in particular applications (A New Approach to Extraterritoriality: Unifund Assurance Co. v. I.C.B.C. (2004), 40 Can. Bus. L.J. 161, at p. 173; see also p. 177). \nThe Unifund Test Functions as a Principle of Statutory Interpretation\nSecond, like the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity in constitutional law, the Unifund test functions as a principle of statutory interpretation. As noted by Professors Peter W. Hogg and Wade K. Wright, under the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity, a broadly framed provincial or federal law that is valid in most of its applications should be interpreted so as not to apply to the matter that is outside the jurisdiction of the enacting body (Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  15:16 (emphasis added)). The enacting legislative body is presumed to have meant to enact provisions which do not transgress the limits of its constitutional powers; general language which appears to transgress the limits must therefore be read down so that it is confined within the limits ( 15:15; see also H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at para. VI-2.56). Reading down is simply a canon of construction (or interpretation) (Hogg and Wright, at  15:15).\nSimilarly, the Unifund sufficient connection test limits, or reads down, the territorial reach of otherwise broadly framed provincial legislation, consistent with the territorial restrictions on provincial legislative power in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. It does so by insisting on a sufficient connection between the legislation and the out-of-province defendant (Sullivan, at pp. 821-23). As Professor Joost Blom has explained, the Unifund test functions as a kind of unilateral, negative choice of law principle, because it defines the permissible territorial ambit of the provincial rule ((2017), at p. 288; see also J. Blom, Regulation of Contracts in Canadian Private International Law (2014), 31 Ariz. J. Intl & Comp. L. 21, at p. 31; Edinger and Black, at pp. 181-82; N. Hume, Four Flaws: Reflections on the Canadian Approach to Private International Law (2006), 44 Can. Y.B. Intl L. 161, at p. 234). In short, the Unifund test allows a statute to be interpreted to apply to an out-of-province defendant in certain circumstances without having an extraterritorial effect.\nThe Unifund Test Relates to Prescriptive Legislative Jurisdiction\nThird, the Unifund sufficient connection test relates to prescriptive legislative jurisdiction, rather than adjudicatory jurisdiction, although the latter may flow from the former. Prescriptive legislative jurisdiction is the power to make rules, issue commands or grant authorizations that are binding upon persons and entities (R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, at para. 58; see also Edinger and Black, at pp. 165-66; British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2004 BCCA 269, 239 D.L.R. (4th) 412, at para. 23, affd 2005 SCC 49, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 473; and B. Kain and B. Shaw, Mapping the Serbonian Bog: The Territorial Limits of Secondary Market Securities Act Claims Under the Canadian Constitution  Part 1 (2012), 53 Can. Bus. L.J. 63, at pp. 74-75). Adjudicatory jurisdiction, also known as judicial jurisdiction, is the power of a court or tribunal to resolve disputes or interpret the law through decisions that carry binding force (Hape, at para. 58), and includes the power to take jurisdiction over a matter that may have extraterritorial connections (Hape, at para. 59; Imperial Tobacco (BCCA), at para. 23; Edinger and Black, at p. 165). \nIn Unifund, Binnie J. distinguished between prescriptive legislative jurisdiction and adjudicatory jurisdiction, both of which are governed by different versions of the real and substantial connection test. As Binnie J. noted, a real and substantial connection sufficient to permit the court of a province to take jurisdiction over a dispute may not be sufficient for the law of a province to regulate the outcome (para. 58). He later added that [a] relationship that is inadequate to support the application of regulatory legislation may nevertheless provide a sufficient real and substantial connection to permit the courts of the forum to take jurisdiction over a dispute. This happens regularly. The courts, having taken jurisdiction, then apply the law of the other province applying rules of conflict resolution governing choice of law issues (para. 80). In Unifund, Binnie J. concluded that the reimbursement obligation in s. 275 of the Ontario Insurance Act did not apply to the B.C.-based insurer (prescriptive legislative jurisdiction), and thus the Ontario courts also had no jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator under the Ontario Insurance Act (adjudicatory or judicial jurisdiction) (para. 44).\nThe Unifund Test Is Part of a Family of Real and Substantial Connection Tests\nFourth, the test in Unifund is distinct from the real and substantial connection tests that this Court has developed elsewhere in the domain of conflicts of laws. The courts below and the parties before this Court disagree about which version of the real and substantial connection test applies in this case. The Quebec Superior Court determined that the FMAT had correctly applied the real and substantial connection test in Van Breda, but the court also looked to Unifund for what might constitute a sufficient connection (para. 39). The appellants argue that the C.C.Q. supplies the rules for the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities, but note that if the real and substantial connection test applies, then this Courts formulation of that test in Van Breda should apply. The respondent argues that the real and substantial connection test in Unifund applies.\nThe real and substantial connection test has been described both as a single test that applies in a variety of different contexts (Van Breda, at paras. 23-31), and as a collection of different tests with a common family resemblance (J. Blom and E. Edinger, The Chimera of the Real and Substantial Connection Test (2005), 38 U.B.C. L. Rev. 373, at pp. 373-74). Although both views have merit, we refer to the real and substantial connection test as a family of tests to emphasize that the same formula of words  that is, real and substantial connection  involves different considerations in each of the varying contexts in which the formula is employed.\nFor example, in Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, this Court ruled that a court in one province should recognize and enforce a judgment of the court of another province if there is a real and substantial connection between that other court and the subject matter of the litigation (pp. 1107-8). In Beals v. Saldanha, 2003 SCC 72, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, the Court extended the principles in Morguard to foreign judgments and ruled that Canadian courts should recognize and enforce a judgment of a court outside Canada when there is a real and substantial connection between the cause of action and the foreign court (paras. 32 and 37). \nIn Van Breda, this Court developed a real and substantial connection test in the context of deciding whether a court can assume jurisdiction over a tort claim brought by Canadian residents who were injured abroad. The Court identified presumptive connecting factors that prima facie entitle a court to assume jurisdiction over a tort dispute and explained how such a presumption of jurisdiction is subject to rebuttal. The Court also clarified that this version of the real and substantial connection test is a common law test. In Quebec, the Civil Code of Quebec contains a list of factors that must be considered in order to determine whether a Quebec authority has jurisdiction over a delictual or quasi-delictual action (art. 3148) (para. 77; see also Spar Aerospace, at paras. 55-56).\nThis Court also developed a version of the real and substantial connection test in Libman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 178, to determine whether a transnational crime, which took place partly in Canada, could be prosecuted in Canada. The Court held that such a crime can be prosecuted in Canada when there is a real and substantial link between the offence and this country (pp. 212-13).\nAs a final example, this Court has developed a real and substantial connection test in the context of determining whether provincial legislation is constitutionally applicable to out-of-province defendants or circumstances (see Blom (2017), at pp. 288-89). In Hunt v. T&N plc, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289, the Court decided that a Quebec blocking statute prohibiting the transfer of documents to other jurisdictions was constitutionally inapplicable to other provinces. The Court confirmed that courts are required, by constitutional restraints, to assume jurisdiction only where there are real and substantial connections to that place, and held that the presence of such blocking statutes is an anachronism . . . inimical to [interprovincial] litigation if applied on the interprovincial level (p. 328). In Unifund, this Court built on Hunt and ruled that provincial regulatory legislation is constitutionally applicable to out-of-province defendants when there is a sufficient connection between the province and the out-of-province defendants, subject to the principles of order and fairness (para. 56).\nThe appellants argument and the Superior Courts conclusion that the Van Breda real and substantial connection test should apply here are misplaced. Van Breda set out the real and substantial connection test in the context of tort claims at common law and does not apply in Quebec. The counterpart to the Van Breda test for personal actions of a patrimonial nature in Quebec is contained in art. 3148 C.C.Q. (Van Breda, at para. 77). In any event, in the present case, the Court is asked to determine whether Quebecs securities regulatory scheme constitutionally applies to the out-of-province appellants as a matter of prescriptive legislative jurisdiction. Consequently, the Unifund test applies.\nInterpreting the Special Jurisdictional Rules of the Quebec Securities Scheme in Light of Unifund\nThe Quebec securities scheme, interpreted in light of the Unifund test, provides for jurisdiction over out-of-province parties with a sufficient connection or real and substantial connection with Quebec. On their face, the special jurisdictional provisions in the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers and the Securities Act are not limited in their territorial reach. Constitutionally, they apply only to matters within Quebecs territorial jurisdiction. Unifund provides the appropriate test for evaluating the territorial applicability of these statutes to a particular set of circumstances. It functions, as a canon of construction, to limit the application of Quebecs securities scheme to those persons and matters with a sufficient connection or real and substantial connection to the province. These provisions thus give the FMAT plenary international jurisdiction to make determinations and issue orders against persons under the Securities Act when there is a sufficient connection with Quebec.\nThe Quebec securities scheme may be said to both complement and derogate from the rules for the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. The Quebec securities scheme may be said to complement the C.C.Q. because the special statutes jurisdictional rules for the FMAT work alongside the general jurisdictional rules in the jus commune. But the Quebec securities scheme may also be said to derogate from the C.C.Q. because, in this case, as demonstrated below, the application of the special jurisdictional rules provides the FMAT with jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants, even though the C.C.Q.s general rules do not.\nThe Quebec Securities Scheme Applies to the Out-of-Province Appellants \nFinally, it must be determined whether the FMATs exercise of jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants would be contrary to the constitutional limitations set out in Unifund, which asks whether there is a sufficient connection between Quebec and the facts alleged against the appellants based on the following four principles:\n1. The territorial limits on the scope of provincial legislative authority prevent the application of the law of a province to matters not sufficiently connected to it; \n2. What constitutes a sufficient connection depends on the relationship among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated by it; \n3. The applicability of an otherwise competent provincial legislation to out-of-province defendants is conditioned by the requirements of order and fairness that underlie our federal arrangements;\n4. The principles of order and fairness, being purposive, are applied flexibly according to the subject matter of the legislation. [para. 56]\nThere Is a Sufficient Connection Between Quebec and the Appellants\nThe first two principles in Unifund are related. The first principle requires a sufficient connection, while the second principle identifies factors that might furnish that connection (Sullivan, at p. 822). This involves a contextual inquiry. As Binnie J. noted in Unifund, different degrees of connection to the enacting province may be required according to the subject matter of the dispute (para. 65). In each case, a court or tribunal must examine the relationship among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the law, and the person sought to be regulated by it, to decide whether that relationship is sufficient to support the applicability of the legislation to the out-of-province person (para. 65).\nThe sufficient connection analysis must recognize the transnational nature of modern securities regulation and the public interest in addressing international market manipulation. Securities regulation raises unique considerations that highlight the need for transnational enforcement. As this Court noted in Global Securities Corp. v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2000 SCC 21, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 494, the securities market has been an international one for years and the Internet has greatly increased the ability of securities traders to extend across borders (para. 28). To effectively regulate the securities market, regulators must equally be able to respond, and surmount borders where legally possible (para. 28). \nApplying the first two Unifund principles, there is a sufficient connection between Quebec and the out-of-province appellants, all of whom allegedly participated in a fraudulent securities manipulation scheme with important ties to Quebec. The appellants allegedly used Quebec as the face of their alleged pump-and-dump scheme by promoting Solos mining activities in Quebec. They participated in marketing or financing efforts and partly targeted Quebec residents. Solo, the company through which the appellants operated their scheme, was a reporting issuer in Quebec, and Solos director was a Quebec resident. There was thus a clear connection between Solo and the appellants, on the one hand, and the province of Quebec on the other. In the circumstances, it would defeat the purpose of the cross-border nature of modern securities regulation to allow the appellants to escape the reach of Quebecs regulatory oversight.\nThe appellant Sharp argues that the FMAT and courts below failed to analyze the AMFs specific allegations against him, which relate only to the purchase and sale of securities outside of Quebec. We do not accept this submission. The AMF alleges that he participated in one or more stages of the appellants securities manipulation scheme, that he was closely implicated by buying or selling securities, and that the scheme had important links to Quebec. Under Unifund, that connection suffices to apply Quebecs securities regulatory scheme to him. \nThe Requirements of Order and Fairness Are Satisfied\nThe third and fourth Unifund principles are also related and incorporate the notions of interprovincial comity and fairness to the defendant (Sullivan, at p. 822). The third principle requires a court or tribunal to consider the principles of order and fairness, which function as a mechanism to regulate extraterritoriality concerns (Unifund, at para. 73) by ensuring the security of transactions with justice (para. 68, citing Morguard, at p. 1097). Order refers to the idea that courts and tribunals must respect the principle of interprovincial comity and only assume jurisdiction where constitutionally appropriate (Unifund, at para. 71; Morguard, at p. 1102). Fairness refers to fairness to the out-of-province defendant (Unifund, at para. 72; Morguard, at p. 1103). Finally, the fourth Unifund principle requires a court or tribunal to apply the principles of order and fairness purposively and flexibly given the subject matter of the legislation and the type of jurisdiction being asserted (Unifund, at para. 80).\nIn our view, it is consistent with the principles of order and fairness and would not raise any extraterritoriality concerns to apply Quebecs securities regulatory scheme to the appellants. \nApplying the Quebec regulatory regime is fair to the appellants. The appellants chose to enter Quebecs securities marketplace (see Unifund, at para. 77), and they promoted the Quebec mining prospects of Solo, a reporting issuer in Quebec. Because the appellants made Quebec the face of their securities manipulation operation, their entrance into Quebecs market was not accidental or irrelevant, but rather was an integral part of the scheme.\nIn addition, applying Quebecs securities regulatory scheme to the appellants does not offend the principle of order or the related concept of interprovincial comity. Given the cross-border nature of securities manipulation and securities fraud, regulators from multiple jurisdictions may exercise jurisdiction over the same scheme. As noted by the intervener the Ontario Securities Commission, this is a feature, not a flaw of modern securities regulation (I.F., at para. 15). It promotes the seamless coverage of regulatory protection and the imposition of public interest remedies across the territories affected by a single, unlawful scheme (para. 15). We also agree with the AMF: [translation] . . . nothing precludes such a multiplicity of proceedings because each of the proceedings constitutes a legitimate exercise of the jurisdiction of the state concerned. . . . [T]he application of the sufficient connection test is not a zero-sum game (R.F., at paras. 81 and 87). \nBecause contemporary securities manipulation and fraud are often transnational and extend across provincial and national borders, courts and tribunals must take a flexible and purposive approach when applying the principles of order and fairness in the securities context. In our view, it is consistent with the principles of order and fairness for the FMAT to have jurisdiction over the appellants.\nThe FMATs Adjudicatory Jurisdiction Flows From the Provinces Prescriptive Legislative Jurisdiction\nIn closing, it bears noting that while prescriptive legislative jurisdiction and adjudicatory jurisdiction are distinct concepts (Unifund, at para. 58), in this case the FMATs adjudicatory jurisdiction flows from the provinces prescriptive legislative jurisdiction. Section 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers stipulates that the FMAT shall exercise jurisdiction under the Securities Act. Since the Quebec legislature has decided that the FMAT shall adjudicate alleged breaches of the Securities Act and the appellants alleged conduct has a real and substantial connection with Quebec, the FMAT necessarily has jurisdiction over the appellants in respect of their alleged contraventions. The special legislation, properly interpreted, thus provides for the FMATs adjudicatory jurisdiction. \nConclusion\nThe jurisdictional rules of the Quebec securities scheme are constitutionally applicable to the out-of-province appellants. These provisions grant the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants alleged contraventions of the Securities Act. Based on the facts alleged by the AMF, there is a sufficient connection between Quebec and the appellants to justify applying Quebecs security regulatory scheme to them. As a result, the FMAT correctly concluded that it has jurisdiction over the appellants.\nWe would dismiss the appeals with costs.\nEnglish version of the reasons delivered by\n\tCote J.  \nOverview\nThese appeals raise the question of whether the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal (FMAT) has jurisdiction over the appellants, who are domiciled outside Quebec, specifically in the province of British Columbia, either under the rules in Title Three of Book Ten of the Civil Code of Quebec (C.C.Q.) which relate to the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities, or on the basis of the real and substantial connection test set out in Unifund Assurance Co. v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 40, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 63, at paras. 55-56.\nAccording to my colleagues, this case raises an issue regarding the constitutional applicability of the Securities Act, CQLR, c. V-1.1 (SA), which means that the FMATs jurisdiction must be assessed on the basis of the sufficient connection test from Unifund. I disagree with that position. In my view, at this stage of the proceedings, the case raises no issue regarding the constitutional applicability of the SA but rather concerns the FMATs adjudicative jurisdiction. Consequently, the limits of the FMATs jurisdiction must instead be analyzed in light of the rules of private international law set out in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q.\nApplying those provisions to this case, I conclude that the appeals should be allowed on the basis that the FMAT does not have adjudicative jurisdiction over the appellants and therefore cannot hear the matter brought before this Court.\nI agree with my colleagues that correctness is the applicable standard of review; the only issue is thus whether the FMAT has adjudicative jurisdiction over the appellants, who are domiciled outside Quebec.\nMy analysis proceeds as follows. First, I summarize the facts and the procedural context of this dispute. Next, I explain the distinction between the constitutional applicability of legislation and the adjudicative jurisdiction of a court or administrative tribunal. Based on this analysis, I show that this dispute relates to the FMATs adjudicative jurisdiction, more particularly its territorial component (jurisdiction ratione personae), and consequently that the C.C.Q.s rules on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities are applicable. Because there is no provision in the SA, the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, CQLR, c. A-33.2 (AAMF), or the C.C.Q. that gives the FMAT adjudicative jurisdiction over the appellants in the specific proceedings brought against them by the Autorite des marches financiers (AMF or Authority), I conclude that the appellants declinatory exceptions should have been allowed.\nFacts and Procedural Context\nOn the whole, I agree with my colleagues overview of the facts and summary of the decisions below. However, I wish to clarify certain points regarding the procedural context of this dispute.\nIn 2017, the AMF filed an application with the FMAT against a number of defendants, some of whom  the appellants  are residents of British Columbia. In the application, the AMF alleged that the defendants had taken part in what is commonly called a pump and dump scheme or, in other words, that they had influenced or manipulated the market price or value of a security by unfair, improper or fraudulent means and participated in transactions in securities that created an artificial price for a security, in contravention of the SA. The AMF therefore asked the FMAT to order the defendants to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in securities, to prohibit them from acting as directors or officers of an issuer, dealer, adviser or investment fund manager for five years, and to impose administrative penalties on them, in accordance with ss. 195.2, 199.1 para. 1(1), 265, 273.1 and 273.3 SA.\nIn response to the AMFs application, the appellants filed preliminary exceptions in the form of declinatory exceptions, in which they argued that the FMAT lacked adjudicative jurisdiction over them. The FMAT dismissed the preliminary exceptions and found that it had jurisdiction to hear the matter. The Quebec Superior Court dismissed the applications for judicial review of that decision filed by the appellants, whose subsequent appeals to the Quebec Court of Appeal were unsuccessful.\nThe appellants declinatory exceptions are based on the FMATs lack of adjudicative jurisdiction over them. As this Court explained in Newfoundland and Labrador (Attorney General) v. Uashaunnuat (Innu of Uashat and of Mani-Utenam), 2020 SCC 4, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 15, [s]uch a declinatory exception must be disposed of on a preliminary basis (para. 85, citing A. Rochon, with the collaboration of F. Le Colleter, Guide des requetes devant le juge unique de la Cour dappel: Procedure et pratique (2013), at p. 77, and Transax Technologies inc. v. Red Baron Corp. Ltd, 2016 QCCA 1432, at para. 6 (CanLII)). Thus, at this preliminary stage of the proceedings, a court or tribunal is not to consider the merits of the case, but rather, is to take as averred the facts that are alleged by the plaintiff to bring it within the jurisdictional competence of the Quebec courts (Spar Aerospace Ltd. v. American Mobile Satellite Corp., 2002 SCC 78, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 205, at para. 31, citing Air Canada v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1554, at p. 1558, and Rosdev Investments Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada, [1994] R.J.Q. 2966 (Sup. Ct.), at p. 2968). It is also important to note that when the international jurisdiction of a Quebec court or tribunal is challenged, the party arguing that the court or tribunal has jurisdiction bears the burden of demonstrating this. And where an action involves more than one defendant, as here, jurisdiction over each of them must be established.\nIn light of the procedural context of this dispute, the issue is therefore not whether the SA applies in this case to the merits of the matter but rather whether the FMAT has jurisdiction in the proceedings brought against the appellants. For the reasons I explain more fully below, these appeals must be decided by applying the rules on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities found in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q.\nAnalysis\nTo begin my analysis, I think it is appropriate to specify the points on which I agree with my colleagues.\nI have already stated above that I agree with the application of the correctness standard of review. Moreover, it is self-evident that because the C.C.Q. sets out the jus commune of Quebec, it does not simply lay down a body of private law rules. As its preliminary provision states, the C.C.Q. is the foundation of all other laws, although other laws may complement the Code or make exceptions to it. I therefore agree with my colleagues, and with Mainville J.A., that the rules in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. apply to determine the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities, even the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal, and that a conflict of jurisdiction or a conflict of laws is not necessary.\nLike my colleagues, and for the reasons I explain below, I am of the view that arts. 3134, 3136 and 3148 C.C.Q. do not give the FMAT any jurisdiction over the appellants.\nI also agree with my colleagues that special laws may make exceptions to or derogate from the rules in the C.C.Q. My colleagues are of the view, as am I, that neither the SA nor the AAMF, individually or read together, expressly derogates from the rules in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. so as to give the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants, who are domiciled outside Quebec (neither statute expressly provides for the FMAT to assert jurisdiction over out-of-province parties, or otherwise limits the territorial reach of the Quebec securities scheme over interprovincial or international transactions (para. 102)).\nWhere I disagree completely with my colleagues is on their conclusion that there is a kind of implicit derogation, which they reach by interpreting the Quebec securities scheme in light of Unifund. My colleagues state that while the C.C.Q. does not grant the FMAT jurisdiction over the out-of-province appellants in this case, the jurisdictional provisions of the special securities scheme, properly interpreted in light of Unifund, do grant jurisdiction because the appellants, and their alleged contraventions, have a sufficient connection to Quebec (para. 41).\nI cannot accept that reasoning, because the C.C.Q. contains a well-developed set of rules and principles [of private international law] (Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda, 2012 SCC 17, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 572, at para. 21). In fact, the C.C.Q. codifies the sufficient connection test (sufficient connection and real and substantial connection are synonymous). The rules on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities (arts. 3134 to 3154 C.C.Q.) [translation] are substantive rules for determining whether Quebec courts or tribunals have jurisdiction to hear a dispute . . . . [These] rules . . . are intended to ensure that there are connections between Quebec and the dispute submitted that are considered sufficient (P. Ferland and G. Laganiere, Le droit international prive, in Collection de droit de lEcole du Barreau du Quebec 2023-2024, vol. 7, Contrats, suretes, publicite des droits et droit international prive (2023), 271, at p. 303). If no special law makes exceptions to or derogates from the set of rules in Book Ten of the C.C.Q., the FMAT has no jurisdiction over the appellants, who are domiciled outside Quebec.\nAfter finding that neither Book Ten of the C.C.Q. nor the Quebec securities scheme expressly confers territorial jurisdiction on the FMAT, my colleagues continue their analysis by interpreting the securities scheme in light of Unifund. I disagree with that approach. Unifund cannot serve as a safety net where the C.C.Q. does not establish the territorial jurisdiction of a court or tribunal and the legislature has not otherwise conferred territorial jurisdiction on it through special legislation. In short, when there is no jurisdiction, that must be the end of the analysis. This means that recourse should not be had to Unifund, which concerns an entirely different situation. Unifund applies once it is established that a court or tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with a matter. For example, if the AMF had invoked art. 3136 C.C.Q. and thereby established the jurisdiction of the FMAT as a [translation] forum of necessity (Lamborghini (Canada) Inc. v. Automobili Lamborghini S.P.A., [1997] R.J.Q. 58 (C.A.), at p. 68, quoting H. P. Glenn, Droit international prive, in La reforme du Code civil, vol. 3, Priorites et hypotheques, preuve et prescription, publicite des droits, droit international prive, dispositions transitoires (1993), 669, at p. 745), Unifund could be relied on to determine the applicability of the SA and the AAMF to the appellants, who are domiciled outside Quebec.\nUnifund cannot give the provisions of the SA and the AAMF an effect they do not have on their own; in other words, it cannot give the FMAT territorial jurisdiction over the appellants, who are domiciled outside Quebec, in a manner that derogates from the well-developed set of rules in the C.C.Q. I therefore do not agree with my colleagues that Unifund supports the conclusion that the FMAT has jurisdiction to decide this matter. I explain my thinking in detail in the reasons that follow.\nDistinction Between the Constitutional Applicability of Legislation and the Adjudicative Jurisdiction of a Court or Tribunal\nWith respect, my colleagues approach conflates the concepts of adjudicative jurisdiction of a court or tribunal and constitutional applicability of legislation, as they deal interchangeably with the constitutional applicability of the SA under the Unifund framework and the FMATs jurisdiction under the rules of private international law. Just like the majority of the Court of Appeal, my colleagues shift from a private international law analysis into an analysis of the SAs constitutional applicability to foreign residents, thereby modifying the true question put before and answered by the FMAT.\nIt will therefore be helpful to briefly explain the difference between the constitutional applicability of legislation and the adjudicative jurisdiction of a court or tribunal. Both concepts involve the existence of a real and substantial connection. In the constitutional context, the real and substantial connection test affirms the constitutionally imposed territorial limits that underlie the requirement of legitimacy in the exercise of the states power of adjudication (Van Breda, at para. 32). In Unifund, where it had to determine whether an Ontario company had a viable cause of action against a British Columbia insurance company under the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, this Court summarized this test from its constitutional standpoint as follows:\n\tConsideration of constitutional applicability can conveniently be organized around the following propositions:\n1. The territorial limits on the scope of provincial legislative authority prevent the application of the law of a province to matters not sufficiently connected to it;\n2. What constitutes a sufficient connection depends on the relationship among the enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated by it;\n3. The applicability of an otherwise competent provincial legislation to out-of-province defendants is conditioned by the requirements of order and fairness that underlie our federal arrangements;\n4. The principles of order and fairness, being purposive, are applied flexibly according to the subject matter of the legislation. [Emphasis deleted; para. 56.]\nThus, the applicability of provincial legislation to a defendant domiciled outside the province in question depends on there being a sufficient connection between the enacting jurisdiction and the out-of-province individual or entity (Unifund, at para. 65). Although this test relates more specifically to the connection between a province and an action, the purpose of the Unifund analysis is essentially to determine whether there is a viable cause of action on the merits (see para. 14).\nConversely, from a private international law perspective, the real and substantial connection test relates to the exercise of the states power of adjudication (Van Breda, at para. 32). The rules of private international law in force in a province are what confer adjudicative jurisdiction on a decision maker. In the common law provinces, the real and substantial connection test is an organizing principle for the rules of private international law. In Quebec, these rules are set out in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. I could not articulate these principles any better than LeBel J. did on behalf of a unanimous Court:\n\tConflicts rules must fit within Canadas constitutional structure. Given the nature of private international law, its application inevitably raises constitutional issues. This branch of the law is concerned with the jurisdiction of courts of the Canadian provinces, with whether that jurisdiction should be exercised, with what law should apply to a dispute, and with whether a court should recognize and enforce a judgment rendered by a court of another province or country. The rules of private international law can be found, in the common law provinces, in the common law and in statute law and, in Quebec, in the Civil Code of Quebec, S.Q. 1991, c. 64, which contains a well-developed set of rules and principles in this area (see Civil Code of Quebec, Book Ten, arts. 3076 to 3168). The interplay between provincial jurisdiction and external legal situations takes place within a constitutional framework which limits the external reach of provincial laws and of a provinces courts. The Constitution assigns powers to the provinces. But these powers are subject to the restriction that they be exercised within the province in question (see P. W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. 2007), vol. 1, at pp. 364-65 and 376-77; H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (5th ed. 2008), at p. 569; British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2005 SCC 49, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 473, at paras. 26-28, per Major J.), and they must be exercised in a manner consistent with the territorial restrictions created by the Constitution (see Castillo v. Castillo, 2005 SCC 83, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 870, at para. 5, per Major J.; Unifund Assurance Co. v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 40, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 63, at para. 51, per Binnie J.). [Emphasis added.]\n\t(Van Breda, at para. 21)\nAccordingly, to be able to assume jurisdiction over a dispute, a provincial court or tribunal must have adjudicative jurisdiction under provincial legislation, which must itself have been validly enacted by the province in the exercise of its legislative jurisdiction. As can be seen from the excerpt quoted in the previous paragraph, the jurisdiction of courts and tribunals of the Canadian provinces, the appropriateness of exercising that jurisdiction and the law that should apply to a dispute are all different concepts.\nThe adjudicative jurisdiction of a court or tribunal has two components: jurisdiction ratione materiae (subject-matter jurisdiction) and jurisdiction ratione personae (territorial jurisdiction). The subject-matter jurisdiction of a court or tribunal [translation] is that given to [it] to hear a case by reason of its subject matter (G. Goldstein and E. Groffier, Droit international prive, vol. I, Theorie generale (1998), at p. 299). As Brown and Rowe JJ. (dissenting, but not on this point) clearly stated in Uashaunnuat (at para. 105):\n\tThe Quebec Superior Courts inherent jurisdiction is therefore an aspect of its subject-matter jurisdiction (or jurisdiction ratione materiae), not an aspect of its territorial jurisdiction (or jurisdiction ratione personae vel loci):\n\t. . . subject matter competence refers to the ability of the court to hear the type of dispute in question, considering issues such as whether its jurisdiction was limited by statute. It deals with criteria that are not connected to the territorial reach of the courts authority and rarely raise issues of private international law. [Emphasis added; footnote omitted.]\n\t(Pitel and Rafferty, at pp. 58-59) [Emphasis in original.]\nAs for territorial jurisdiction, it is assessed on the basis of a geographical connection, which may arise [translation] either from the situation of the litigant (usually the defendant) or from the location of the item in dispute or the place where the dispute arose (Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 299). To have jurisdiction to hear a dispute, a court or tribunal must therefore have the necessary subject-matter jurisdiction and territorial jurisdiction (Glenn, at p. 743).\nThe rules on the territorial jurisdiction of Quebec courts and tribunals are divided between the Code of Civil Procedure, CQLR, c. C-25.01 (C.C.P.), and the C.C.Q., depending on whether a dispute falls under domestic law or private international law (S. Guillemard, Regles generales de competence des tribunaux quebecois, in JurisClasseur Quebec  Collection Droit civil  Droit international prive (loose-leaf), fasc. 8, at No. 1). It is important to note here that\n\t[translation] the rules on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities should not be confused with the rules laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the territorial jurisdiction of courts under domestic law (arts. 41 to 48 C.C.P.). Although these two types of rules often echo one another, the rules on international jurisdiction are substantive rules for determining whether Quebec courts or tribunals have jurisdiction to hear a dispute, whereas the rules on domestic jurisdiction are procedural rules for determining the district in which proceedings may be instituted. Extreme caution should therefore be exercised before attempting to apply the rules in the Code of Civil Procedure to fill a gap in Book Ten of the Civil Code of Quebec, an approach that hearkens back to the time when no effort to codify Quebec private international law had yet been made. [Footnote omitted.]\n\t(Ferland and Laganiere, at p. 303)\nAs I explain below, the appellants objection in this case clearly does not relate to the FMATs lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Rather, it is an objection to the FMATs territorial jurisdiction. And it is also important to note that private international law is concerned mainly with territorial jurisdiction:\n\tPrivate international law, on the other hand, is concerned with territorial jurisdiction: J.-G. Castel, Droit international prive quebecois (1980), at p. 660. The rules of subject-matter jurisdiction play a limited role in private international law. By definition, however, the rules of territorial jurisdiction impose territorial limits on the authority of provincial superior courts to exercise their subject-matter jurisdiction, including their inherent powers. In Quebec, for example, although procedural law recognizes the courts inherent powers to deal with situations not provided for in the law or the rules of practice, the fact remains that civil procedure is subject to the general principles found in the Civil Code of Quebec, including the rules of private international law set out in Book Ten: Lac dAmiante, at paras. 37 and 40; arts. 25 and 49 C.C.P.\n\t(Uashaunnuat, at para. 106, per Brown and Rowe JJ., dissenting, but not on this point)\nThis Dispute Concerns the FMATs Territorial Jurisdiction\nThese appeals, as they were argued, relate to the FMATs territorial jurisdiction, not to the scope of Quebecs legislative jurisdiction over securities. At this stage of the proceedings, that is, the stage of the preliminary exceptions raised by the appellants in the form of declinatory exceptions, the only question before the FMAT was as follows: Could the FMAT hear the dispute involving the appellants?\nAlthough there appears to have been some confusion in the courts and tribunal below, it is clear from a review of the record that the appellants motions for declinatory exception were based on the FMATs lack of territorial jurisdiction over them. And the appeals before this Court are from judicial reviews of a decision dismissing those motions for declinatory exception brought by the appellants. What can be said of those motions?\nI begin by examining the declinatory exception of the appellants Shawn Van Damme, Vincenzo Antonio Carnovale and Pasquale Antonio Rocca. In their motion, they argue that the FMAT does not have jurisdiction to hear and rule upon the charges brought against Petitioners (A.R., at pp. 109-10). They contend, more particularly, that there is no real and substantial connection between the proceedings brought by the AMF and the province of Quebec (p. 110), on the basis of the following allegations: (i) the defendants are not domiciled in Quebec (p. 110); (ii) the AMFs originating application does not allege that the acts complained of were committed in Quebec or even that any fault was committed in Quebec (p. 110).\nAt first glance, it might be thought that these arguments relate to the constitutional applicability of the SA. However, the last paragraph of the motion shows beyond the shadow of a doubt that the declinatory exception is based on the FMATs lack of adjudicative jurisdiction over the appellants:\n\tThe present motion is made under strict reserve of Petitioners rights, including their right to claim that Quebec law (including the provisions of the Quebec Securities Act) does not apply to their alleged actions, that the acts allegedly committed by Petitioners do not constitute violations of section 195.2, section 199.1 or of any other provision of the Securities Act, and that Plaintiff Autorite des marches financiers does not have jurisdiction to bring the present proceedings against Petitioners.\n\t(A.R., at p. 111)\nIt can be seen from the above that the appellants Van Damme, Carnovale and Rocca reserved the right to contest the constitutional applicability of the SA on the basis of the test set out in Unifund. This statement confirms that their motion for declinatory exception dealt first and foremost with the FMATs territorial jurisdiction.\nThe arguments made by the appellant Frederick Langford Sharp in the Superior Court also concerned the FMATs territorial jurisdiction, notwithstanding his statement that the Impugned Decision constitutes an unconstitutional assertion of extra-provincial jurisdiction that should be set aside (A.R., at p. 160). In my view, the reference to the alleged extraterritorial reach of the FMATs decision must be understood in light of the imperatives  which are now constitutional  recognized in Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, at pp. 1100-1101, Hunt v. T&N plc, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289, at pp. 315-17, and Tolofson v. Jensen, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, at p. 1066. According to this jurisprudence, there are constitutionally imposed territorial limits that underlie the requirement of legitimacy in the exercise of the states power of adjudication. Considered from this perspective, the adjudicative jurisdiction of courts and tribunals raises a constitutional law issue, in the same way as the extraterritorial applicability of provincial legislation. However, this does not have the effect of turn[ing] every private international law issue into a constitutional one (Van Breda, at para. 67).\nThe appellants argument in this case is that no provision of the SA, the AAMF or the C.C.Q. gives the FMAT jurisdiction over them. From this standpoint, the appeals relate not to the extraterritorial applicability of the SA but rather to the FMATs territorial jurisdiction under private international law.\nI would add that the way the case was argued in the Quebec Superior Court confirms this approach. Before that court, the appellants Van Damme, Carnovale and Rocca again made the argument they had originally made, namely that the FMAT had no jurisdiction to hear the proceedings brought by the AMF. More particularly, they submitted that the FMAT had erred in basing its jurisdiction on ss. 93 and 94 AAMF rather than on the C.C.Q.s rules concerning the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities. It is clear that the rules in the C.C.Q. that apply in matters of private international law relate to the adjudicative jurisdiction of Quebec courts and tribunals, not to the legitimate exercise of the states legislative power. In contrast, ss. 93 and 94 AAMF relate to subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the AMFs complaint on the merits, and here, as I said above, the FMATs subject-matter jurisdiction is not in issue.\nI acknowledge that the real and substantial connection test has several components, which may be confusing. It would probably have been preferable for the appellants to explain further that no provision of the C.C.Q. could confer jurisdiction on the FMAT in this case. In my view, however, this in no way changes the essence of the declinatory exceptions raised, which clearly relate to the FMATs lack of territorial jurisdiction over the appellants. The proof of this is that neither Michel Plante, who, according to the application, is domiciled in Quebec, nor Solo, which, according to the application, was a reporting issuer in Quebec and operated in Montreal, brought a motion for declinatory exception.\nIn short, the appellants motions  declinatory exceptions based on the FMATs lack of adjudicative jurisdiction  must be decided by applying the rules on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities set out in the C.C.Q. Unifund is not applicable here. As mentioned above, this Court had to determine in that case whether Ontarios Insurance Act gave Unifund a viable cause of action against the appellant, which was domiciled outside the province (see paras. 9, 14, 22, 27, 48 and 58-81). Here, however, the issue is not whether the AMF has a viable statutory remedy against the appellants under the SA. Rather, the debate concerns the FMATs territorial jurisdiction over them.\nI pause here to point out that if the C.C.Q.s rules of private international law did not apply, this dispute would have to be decided under the analytical framework set out in Van Breda and not the one laid down in Unifund, since the FMATs territorial jurisdiction is the only issue here. This is so because what must be determined at the declinatory exception stage is not whether the SA applies to the facts alleged but rather whether the FMAT has territorial jurisdiction in the proceedings brought by the AMF.\nThe C.C.Q.s Rules on the International Jurisdiction of Quebec Authorities Apply to Administrative Proceedings Before the FMAT\nThe rules of private international law set out in the C.C.Q. apply to all proceedings that may be heard by Quebec authorities pursuant to the jurisdiction conferred on the province by the Constitution. Accordingly, the rules in Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. must be considered here unless a special law complements, makes exceptions to or derogates from them.\nThe AMF submits that Book Ten of the C.C.Q. is not applicable because the FMATs jurisdiction is a matter of public law. More specifically, it argues that [translation] the absence of any specific reference in the [C.C.Q.] to the administrative proceedings that may be brought before the FMAT . . . clearly indicates that the legislature deliberately planned not to include them. An analysis of the provisions of Book Ten of the [C.C.Q.] . . . demonstrates that the legislature intends the rules of private international law to apply only to matters of a strictly private nature (R.F., at para. 52). The majority of the Court of Appeal was persuaded by this argument. With respect, and like my colleagues, I cannot accept it, since this position creates a dichotomy between public law and private law for which there is no support in Book Ten of the C.C.Q.\nIt is common ground that the C.C.Q. lays down the jus commune in Quebec. Its preliminary provision used to read as follows:\n\tThe Civil Code of Quebec, in harmony with the Charter of human rights and freedoms (chapter C-12) and the general principles of law, governs persons, relations between persons, and property.\n\tThe Civil Code comprises a body of rules which, in all matters within the letter, spirit or object of its provisions, lays down the jus commune, expressly or by implication. In these matters, the Code is the foundation of all other laws, although other laws may complement the Code or make exceptions to it.\nThe point of disagreement with the majority of the Court of Appeal relates to the scope of Book Ten in matters of public law. Nothing in the language of Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. supports the distinction between private law and public law proposed by the AMF and accepted by the majority of the Court of Appeal. My colleagues are of the opinion that Book Ten of the C.C.Q. is the appropriate starting point for analyzing the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities, but they emphasize a distinction that, with respect, is in my view completely irrelevant. They refer to the SA as having a hybrid character because it has a fundamentally regulatory orientation but also has a title dealing with civil actions (paras. 7 and 67). However, both the regulatory law aspect and the civil law aspect are included in the jus commune, which means that focusing on this hybrid character sheds no light on the question before us.\nThe AMFs argument and my colleagues emphasis on the hybridity of the SA also conflict with the commentary of Quebecs Minister of Justice stating that the purpose of the rules in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. is to establish the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities:\n\t[translation] Since there were no rules for determining whether Quebec authorities had jurisdiction over disputes with a foreign element, the courts had extended the domestic law rules of jurisdiction provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure to such situations.\n\tThe general objective of Title Three is to remedy this deficiency by establishing specific rules for determining the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities  courts, administrative tribunals and various administrative authorities. It is divided into two chapters, one containing general provisions and the other containing specific provisions for personal matters of an extrapatrimonial or patrimonial nature and for real and mixed matters. The rules are generally meant to give Quebec authorities jurisdiction only where disputes are closely connected with them, out of concern for international comity.\n\tThe term authority was chosen rather than court in order to encompass judicial, administrative and even ecclesiastical bodies, for example. However, an authority is an authority only if it is considered as such by Quebec law. In addition, the traditional expression conflict of jurisdiction was not used, because the purpose here is solely to determine the cases in which Quebec authorities will have jurisdiction to hear a dispute with a foreign element, not the cases in which foreign authorities will have jurisdiction. [Underlining added.]\n\t(Ministere de la Justice, Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, vol. II, Le Code civil du Quebec  Un mouvement de societe (1993), at p. 1998)\nThe statements made by the Minister of Justice make it clear that Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. is the sole starting point for determining the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities, regardless of whether they apply a purely regulatory scheme or a scheme with regulatory and civil aspects. I repeat that [translation] the rules on international jurisdiction are substantive rules for determining whether Quebec courts or tribunals have jurisdiction to hear a dispute (Ferland and Laganiere, at p. 303). Whether or not the Quebec court or tribunal has hybrid jurisdiction changes absolutely nothing.\nMoreover, I would note that the very wording of Book Ten indicates that it applies to certain public law matters. One such matter is the enforcement of obligations arising from the taxation laws of a foreign state (arts. 3155(6) and 3162 C.C.Q.). The traditional position is that obligations of this kind are not enforceable in Canada, including in Quebec. For example, in United States of America v. Harden, [1963] S.C.R. 366, this Court refused to enforce a tax debt arising from a decision rendered by an American court. This same principle is codified in art. 3155(6) C.C.Q. However, under art. 3162 C.C.Q., the rules of private international law allow the recognition of obligations resulting from foreign taxation laws if there is a reciprocity mechanism between Quebec and the foreign state. Of course, this presupposes the existence of a foreign court with jurisdiction to decide the dispute, in accordance with Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q., as provided for in art. 3164 C.C.Q. Therefore, and contrary to what the AMF argues, the foregoing clearly shows that the legislature intended Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. to apply to jurisdictional issues of public law.\nIt would be incongruous to find that the provisions of Title Three can ground the jurisdiction of a foreign authority dealing with a public law issue, but not the jurisdiction of a Quebec authority dealing with such an issue. Moreover, Quebec private international law generally recognizes the mirror principle, according to which [t]he foreign authority is deemed to have jurisdiction if the Quebec court would, by applying its own rules, have accepted jurisdiction in the same situation (Canada Post Corp. v. Lepine, 2009 SCC 16, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 549, at para. 25, citing Goldstein and Groffier, at p. 416). In the above example, this principle makes the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities subject to the provisions of Title Three, notwithstanding the public nature of tax law.\nUnlike the common law provinces, Quebec has codified the rules of private international law, which are set out in Book Ten of the C.C.Q. In that book, the Quebec legislature has established a comprehensive system of rules and principles to codify the entire field of private international law (Van Breda, at para. 42 (emphasis added); see also Uashaunnuat, at para. 102, citing Van Breda, at para. 21, Barer v. Knight Brothers LLC, 2019 SCC 13, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 573, at paras. 131-32, per Brown J., and G. Saumier, The Recognition of Foreign Judgments in Quebec  The Mirror Crackd? (2002), 81 Can. Bar Rev. 677, at p. 693). Because of this codification, courts must interpret those rules by first examining the specific wording of the provisions of the C.C.Q. and then inquiring whether or not their interpretation is consistent with the principles which underlie the rules (Spar Aerospace Ltd., at para. 23).\nAs its name indicates, Title Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. deals with the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities. The rules in Title Three rely on specific facts linking the subject matter of the litigation to the jurisdiction [in order to justify the application] of the conflicts rules designed to ensure that there is a lin[k] [between] the subject matter of the litigation [and] the jurisdiction (Van Breda, at para. 76). Upon examining Title Three, it becomes apparent that the requirement of a real and substantial connection is reflected in the overall scheme established by Book Ten (Spar Aerospace Ltd., at para. 63). Indeed, Book Ten helps to safeguard against the improper assumption of jurisdiction (Spar Aerospace Ltd., at para. 57). Given the codification of these rules, there is no reason to resort to the real and substantial connection test from Van Breda.\nArticles 3134 to 3154 C.C.Q. are meant [translation] to be exhaustive in setting out the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities (Lamborghini, at p. 68, quoting Commentaires du ministre de la Justice, at p. 2000). Exceptionally, art. 3076 C.C.Q. provides that Book Ten applies subject to those rules of law in force in Quebec which are applicable by reason of their particular object. In this case, those rules might include the SA and the AAMF. But as I explain below, and contrary to what my colleagues argue, the SA and the AAMF do not themselves make exceptions to, derogate from or complement the C.C.Q.s rules of private international law when it comes to the administrative proceedings brought by the AMF.\nIt is clear from reading the provisions of the SA and the AAMF that the legislature intended them to be supplemented by the C.C.Q.s provisions on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities. Let me explain. First, in civil matters, the Quebec legislature enacted the rule in s. 236.1 SA. This provision gives precedence to the SA in matters pertaining to the distribution of securities to Quebec residents and states that, in contrast to the usual rule, any action under the ordinary rules of law in respect of facts related to the distribution of a security may be brought before the court of the plaintiffs residence.\nSimilarly, in penal matters, art. 142 of the Code of Penal Procedure, CQLR, c. C-25.1, provides, for the purposes of ss. 202 and 210 SA, that all penal proceedings must be instituted either in the judicial district where the defendant resides (or is in detention, where such is the case) or in the district where the defendant committed the offence.\nIn administrative matters, on the other hand, the Quebec legislature did not enact specific provisions concerning the FMATs international jurisdiction in addition to the rules in the C.C.Q. The provisions of the SA in question here are ss. 265, 273.1 and 273.3. They allow the FMAT to order a person to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in securities (s. 265), to impose an administrative penalty on the person and have it collected by the AMF (s. 273.1), and to prohibit a person from acting as a director or officer of an issuer, dealer, adviser or investment fund manager (s. 273.3):\n\t265. The Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may order a person to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in securities.\n\t. . .\n\t273.1. Where the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal becomes aware of facts establishing that a person has, by an act or omission, contravened, or aided in the contravention of, a provision under this Act or a regulation made under its authority, the Tribunal may impose an administrative penalty on the offender and have it collected by the Authority.\n\t. . .\n\t273.3. The Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may prohibit a person from acting as a director or officer of an issuer, dealer, adviser or investment fund manager on the grounds set out in article 329 of the Civil Code, or where a penalty has been imposed on the person under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2) or the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01).\nAccording to my colleagues, none of these provisions limits the territorial reach of the Quebec securities scheme over interprovincial or international transactions. To evaluate whether these statutes may be applied in such circumstances, the Quebec securities scheme must be interpreted to determine its territorial reach (para. 102). However, these statements need to be qualified; while ss. 265, 273.1 and 273.3 SA do not specify their territorial reach, this does not mean that it can be unlimited. Such an interpretation would be contrary to the principle of territoriality, whereby a provincial legislature is presumed to intend its laws to apply to [translation] persons, property, juridical acts and events within the territorial boundaries of its jurisdiction (P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at para. 779), not to all persons regardless of their place of domicile or residence.\nMy colleagues therefore fall back on s. 93 AAMF to make up for the legislatures silence regarding the territorial reach of the Quebec securities scheme. But as they recognize at para. 101, s. 93 AAMF establishes the FMATs subject-matter jurisdiction in administrative proceedings instituted by the AMF under the SA. At the time the AMF brought its proceedings before the FMAT, the AAMF was in force. In 2018, it was amended and renamed the Act respecting the regulation of the financial sector, CQLR, c. E-6.1. I agree with my colleagues that the former version of s. 93 continues to apply in this case under the applicable transitional rules (fn. 4).\nThe applicable version of s. 93 AAMF is as follows:\n\t93. On the request of the Authority or of any interested person, the Tribunal shall exercise the functions and powers assigned to it under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2), the Money-Services Businesses Act (chapter E-12.000001), the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01) and the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1).\n\tThe Tribunal shall exercise its discretion in the public interest.\n\tThe Tribunal may not, when assessing the facts or the law for the purposes of those Acts, substitute its assessment of the public interest for that made by the Authority in making a decision.\nAnd s. 93 as it reads in the Act respecting the regulation of the financial sector, which came into force following the 2018 amendments, is as follows:\n\t93. The function of the Tribunal is to make determinations with respect to matters brought under this Act and the Acts listed in Schedule I. Except where otherwise provided by law, the Tribunal shall exercise its jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other tribunal or adjudicative body.\n\tThe Tribunal shall exercise its discretion in the public interest.\n\tIn reviewing a decision rendered by the Authority under the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1) or the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01), the Tribunal may not, when assessing the facts or the law for the purposes of those Acts, substitute its assessment of the public interest for that made by the Authority in making a decision.\n\tIn this Title, unless the context indicates otherwise, matters also includes any application, complaint, contestation or motion, as well as any action falling within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\nIn my colleagues view, s. 93 AAMF  which provides for the FMATs subject-matter jurisdiction  is sufficient to ground the FMATs international jurisdiction in the proceedings brought by the AMF, subject only to Unifund. According to them, this section thus derogates from the well-developed set of rules in the C.C.Q. With respect, I disagree with such an interpretation of s. 93 AAMF.\nMy colleagues argument rests on a premise that essentially relates to a question of subject-matter jurisdiction (jurisdiction ratione materiae), which has nothing to do with the FMATs territorial jurisdiction (jurisdiction ratione personae). As noted above, the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court or tribunal and its territorial jurisdiction are distinct. While subject-matter jurisdiction concerns the subject or nature of the dispute, territorial jurisdiction is assessed on the basis of the connection that serves to link a dispute to a jurisdiction. Although the proceedings brought by the AMF are within the FMATs subject-matter jurisdiction, it does not follow that the FMAT has extraterritorial jurisdiction over the appellants. The subject-matter jurisdiction conferred on the FMAT by s. 93 AAMF simply means that, within Quebecs adjudicative and administrative system, it is this tribunal that has jurisdiction and not some other tribunal or body. As a result, I cannot accept my colleagues argument that s. 93 AAMF  which confers subject-matter jurisdiction  gives the FMAT territorial jurisdiction.\nMy colleagues also rely on s. 94 AAMF, which allows the FMAT to exercise the subject-matter jurisdiction conferred on it by s. 93 by taking any measure conducive to ensuring compliance with any of the statutes listed in s. 93. The version of s. 94 that was in force at the time the proceedings were instituted, and that is applicable in this case, is as follows:\n\t94. At the request of the Authority, the Tribunal may take any measure conducive to ensuring compliance with an undertaking given under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2), the Money-Services Businesses Act (chapter E-12.000001), the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01) or the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1) or compliance with those Acts.\nThis section is not concerned in any way with territorial jurisdiction but relates rather to the measures that the FMAT may take once it is established that it has jurisdiction ratione personae to deal with a matter. This is also the case of ss. 265, 273.1 and 273.3 SA, which authorize the FMAT to impose prohibitions and administrative penalties. As my colleagues note, these provisions empower the FMAT to act in a broad range of circumstances, but this is true only where the FMAT has jurisdiction over the persons involved in the dispute before it. The mere existence of these sections cannot establish the FMATs jurisdiction over persons domiciled outside Quebec. Consequently, the FMAT can take the measures contemplated in s. 94 AAMF, or in ss. 265, 273.1 and 273.3 SA, only where it has jurisdiction under the rules of private international law set out in the C.C.Q.\nAs my colleagues in fact seem to recognize, when the legislature intends to make exceptions to or derogate from the rules in the C.C.Q., it does so clearly, using detailed and specific language (para. 54, citing Compagnie dimmeubles Yale ltee v. Kirkland (Ville de), [1996] R.J.Q. 502 (C.Q.), at p. 507; see also Perron-Malenfant v. Malenfant (Trustee of), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 375, at para. 42). This principle is reflected, for example, in s. 236.1 SA, which derogates expressly from the rules of private international law in the C.C.Q. by stating that [i]n matters pertaining to the distribution of a security, the laws of Quebec are applicable where the subscriber or purchaser resides in Quebec, regardless of the place of the contract. My colleagues say that s. 236.1 confirms that not all of the rules bearing on the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities are to be found in the C.C.Q. (para. 69). This is true, but only insofar as the legislation expressly derogates from the C.C.Q., like in s. 236.1. The derogating effect of s. 236.1 cannot be extended to another part of the SA or to the SA as a whole. If the legislature had wanted to make exceptions to or derogate from the C.C.Q. in other respects, it would have expressed a clear intention to do so. But unlike in the case of s. 236.1 SA, I do not see in ss. 93 and 94 AAMF, or in ss. 265, 273.1 and 273.3 SA, any expression of the legislatures intention to make exceptions to or derogate from the rules in the C.C.Q. Absent a clear intention to the contrary, I am of the opinion that the C.C.Q.s rules of private international law, that is, arts. 3134 to 3154, are what govern the FMATs international jurisdiction.\nFinally, my colleagues interpretation of ss. 93 and 94 AAMF and ss. 265, 273.1 and 273.3 SA is refuted by the specific context of the legislative scheme in issue in this case. Their approach completely ignores the provisions of Chapter II of Title X of the SA concerning interjurisdictional cooperation. That chapter sets out various rules  including with respect to cooperation between regulators at the national and international levels  that allow the AMF and the FMAT to perform their respective functions and exercise their respective authority despite the globalization of markets. These rules provide, for example, that the AMF may delegate a Quebec authority to an extra-provincial securities commission and accept to exercise an extra-provincial authority (ss. 307 and 307.1). What would be the point of this interprovincial cooperation scheme if the legislature truly intended to confer potentially unlimited international jurisdiction on the FMAT? To ask the question is to answer it. The legislature does not legislate in vain and, with respect, I cannot agree with my colleagues conclusion, which in my view disregards the fact that legislation must be interpreted coherently and contributes to creating uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to international jurisdiction.\nIn sum, neither the SA nor the AAMF makes exceptions to or derogates, either expressly or by implication, from the C.C.Q.s rules when it comes to the FMATs jurisdiction in administrative matters. Because the SA and the AAMF are silent in this regard, it is necessary in this case to refer to the C.C.Q.s provisions on the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Quebec authorities, that is, arts. 3134 to 3154 C.C.Q., which are exhaustive in defining the situations in which Quebec authorities have jurisdiction.\nNo Provision of the C.C.Q. Gives the FMAT Jurisdiction Over the Appellants\nTitle Three of Book Ten of the C.C.Q. sets out general rules and specific rules to ground the international jurisdiction of Quebec authorities. These rules lay down conditions that must necessarily be met in order for a Quebec authority to deal with a dispute. As this Court has repeatedly stated, [a]s a whole, these rules ensure compliance with the basic requirement that there be a real and substantial connection between the Quebec court and the dispute (Lepine, at para. 19, citing Spar Aerospace Ltd., at paras. 55-56).\nTitle Three of Book Ten has two chapters: Chapter I (General Provisions) and Chapter II (Special Provisions). The first provision in Chapter I, art. 3134 C.C.Q., sets out the general rule of jurisdiction: In the absence of any special provision, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction when the defendant is domiciled in Quebec. The special provisions to which art. 3134 C.C.Q. refers are found in Chapter II of Title Three.\nIn this case, the provisions that might ground the FMATs jurisdiction are arts. 3134, 3136 and 3148 C.C.Q. I analyze each of these provisions below based on their application to the facts of this dispute. In this analysis, I conclude, as my colleagues do, that none of them is capable of giving the FMAT jurisdiction over the appellants.\nArticle 3134 C.C.Q.\nAs mentioned above, art. 3134 C.C.Q. sets out the general rule that, in the absence of any special provision, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction when the defendant is domiciled in Quebec. Because the appellants are not domiciled in Quebec, this provision cannot give the FMAT jurisdiction in the proceedings brought by the AMF.\nArticle 3148 Paragraph 1(3) C.C.Q.\nUnder art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q., Quebec authorities have jurisdiction over an action in extra-contractual liability where a fault was committed in Quebec or the injury was suffered there (Lapointe Rosenstein Marchand Melancon LLP v. Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP, 2016 SCC 30, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 33). Like my colleagues, and contrary to what was suggested in the concurring reasons given in the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that no analogy can be drawn between a personal action of a patrimonial nature and the proceedings brought by the AMF.\nIt is important to remember that [translation] [t]he AMF is the specialized body to which the Quebec legislator has entrusted the application of the SA and the AAMF, in the public interest (Autorite des marches financiers v. Fournier, 2012 QCCA 1179, at para. 28 (CanLII)). When it applies to the FMAT for an administrative penalty under s. 273.1 SA, the AMF is thus acting [translation] in the context of its mission to protect the financial market and to maintain investors confidence in the system (Donaldson v. Autorite des marches financiers, 2020 QCCA 401, at para. 25 (CanLII)). Therefore, when it applies to the FMAT for an administrative penalty, the AMF is not bringing a personal actio[n] of a patrimonial nature (art. 3148 C.C.Q.). Rather, it is taking administrative action as part of its role of supervising the financial market (Donaldson, at para. 42, quoting S. Rousseau, Lapplication de la legislation sur les valeurs mobilieres au Quebec: une etude du role du Tribunal administratif des marches financiers (2017), 76 R. du B. 1, at p. 13).\nAs my colleagues recognize at para. 80, reasoning by analogy is a perfectly acceptable tool to ensure that the Civil Code of Quebec functions properly (Federation des producteurs acericoles du Quebec v. Regroupement pour la commercialisation des produits de lerable inc., 2006 SCC 50, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 591, at para. 29), but this tool must always be used wisely (see Federation des producteurs acericoles du Quebec, at para. 29; see also Yared v. Karam, 2019 SCC 62, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 498, at para. 28). Moreover, while this goes without saying, an analogy must relate to things or concepts that are actually analogous. In this case, a personal action of a patrimonial nature is not analogous to an application to the FMAT for an administrative penalty, which means that, and I say this with respect, the reasoning in the concurring reasons given in the Court of Appeal in fact involves modifying art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q.\nHaving regard to the administrative nature of an application by the AMF for a penalty under s. 273.1 SA, I am of the view that art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. cannot confer jurisdiction on the FMAT. In addition, even if an analogy were possible, none of the criteria in art. 3148 para. 1(3) C.C.Q. is met in this case. The AMF is not alleging that the appellants committed faults in Quebec, and it did not bring its proceedings against them in order to compensate investors who had suffered losses.\nArticle 3136 C.C.Q.\nArticle 3136 C.C.Q. recognizes the forum of necessity doctrine (Lamborghini, at p. 68, quoting H. P. Glenn, Droit international prive, in La reforme du Code civil, vol. 3, Priorites et hypotheques, preuve et prescription, publicite des droits, droit international prive, dispositions transitoires (1993), 669, at p. 745; see also Van Breda, at para. 59), which can serve as an exceptional basis for the jurisdiction of Quebec authorities (Van Breda, at para. 59). The article provides that [e]ven though a Quebec authority has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may nevertheless hear it provided the dispute has a sufficient connection with Quebec, if proceedings abroad prove impossible or the institution of proceedings abroad cannot reasonably be required. This provision [translation] sets out an exceptional rule based on the demonstrated impossibility of having access to a foreign court in a dispute that has a sufficient connection with Quebec (Lamborghini, at p. 69). In this sense, the purpose of the provision is to permit a Quebec authority to deal with a dispute, even though it would ordinarily have no jurisdiction over the dispute, in order [translation] to prevent a denial of justice (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company Limited v. Pohoresky, 2022 QCCA 1230, at para. 7 (CanLII), quoting Glenn, at p. 745).\nMy colleagues and I agree that art. 3136 C.C.Q. can be applied only if one of the parties raises it, since a court or tribunal cannot raise it of its own motion (GreCon Dimter inc. v. J.R. Normand inc., 2005 SCC 46, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 401, at para. 33, citing Spar Aerospace Ltd., at para. 69). In this case, the AMF did not raise art. 3136 C.C.Q. as a basis for the FMATs jurisdiction. It did not demonstrate that proceedings abroad had proved impossible or that it could not reasonably require the institution of proceedings abroad. Nor did it explain why it had not applied to the authorities having jurisdiction, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of Title X of the SA concerning interjurisdictional cooperation. As a result, the AMF cannot rely on art. 3136 C.C.Q. to establish the FMATs jurisdiction over the appellants.\nIn light of the foregoing, I am of the view that no provision of the C.C.Q. can ground the FMATs jurisdiction in the proceedings brought by the AMF.\nI am also of the view, for the reasons explained more fully above, that the Unifund test is of no assistance to the AMF and cannot ground the FMATs adjudicative jurisdiction over the appellants.\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeals and set aside the FMATs decision on the appellants declinatory exceptions, with costs. Because the FMAT has no adjudicative jurisdiction to hear the AMFs proceedings against the appellants, the proceedings should be dismissed, and there is no need to refer the matter back to the FMAT.\n\nAPPENDIX\nRelevant Statutory Provisions\nSecurities Act, CQLR, c. V-1.1\n195.2. Influencing or attempting to influence the market price or the value of securities by means of unfair, improper or fraudulent practices is an offence.\n199.1. A person who directly or indirectly engages or participates in any transaction or series of transactions in securities or any trading method relating to a transaction in securities, or in any act, practice or course of conduct is guilty of an offence if the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the transaction, series of transactions, trading method, act, practice or course of conduct\n\t(1) creates or contributes to a misleading appearance of trading activity in, or an artificial price for, a security; or\n\t(2) perpetrates a fraud on any person.\n265. The Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may order a person to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in securities.\n\tThe Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may, furthermore, order any person or category of persons to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in a particular security.\n\tIn the case of failure by a reporting issuer to provide periodic disclosure about its business and internal affairs in accordance with the conditions determined by regulation or failure by an issuer or another person to provide any other disclosure prescribed by regulation in accordance with the conditions determined by regulation, the power to order a person to cease any activity in respect of a transaction in securities shall be exercised by the Authority.\n\tDespite the first paragraph of section 318, the Authority may exercise the power conferred on it by the third paragraph without allowing the person to present observations or submit documents to complete the persons record.\n273.1. Where the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal becomes aware of facts establishing that a person has, by an act or omission, contravened, or aided in the contravention of, a provision under this Act or a regulation made under its authority, the Tribunal may impose an administrative penalty on the offender and have it collected by the Authority.\n\tThe amount of the penalty may in no case exceed $2,000,000 for each contravention.\n273.3. The Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may prohibit a person from acting as a director or officer of an issuer, dealer, adviser or investment fund manager on the grounds set out in article 329 of the Civil Code, or where a penalty has been imposed on the person under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2) or the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01).\n\tThe prohibition imposed by the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may not exceed five years.\n\tThe Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal may, at the request of the person concerned, lift the prohibition on such conditions as it considers appropriate.\nAct respecting the Autorite des marches financiers, CQLR, c. A-33.2\n93. On the request of the Authority or of any interested person, the Tribunal shall exercise the functions and powers assigned to it under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2), the Money-Services Businesses Act (chapter E-12.000001), the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01) and the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1).\n\tThe Tribunal shall exercise its discretion in the public interest.\n\tThe Tribunal may not, when assessing the facts or the law for the purposes of those Acts, substitute its assessment of the public interest for that made by the Authority in making a decision.\n94. At the request of the Authority, the Tribunal may take any measure conducive to ensuring compliance with an undertaking given under this Act, the Act respecting the distribution of financial products and services (chapter D-9.2), the Money-Services Businesses Act (chapter E-12.000001), the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01) or the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1) or compliance with those Acts.\nAct respecting the regulation of the financial sector, CQLR, c. E-6.1\n93. The function of the Tribunal is to make determinations with respect to matters brought under this Act and the Acts listed in Schedule I. Except where otherwise provided by law, the Tribunal shall exercise its jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other tribunal or adjudicative body.\n\tThe Tribunal shall exercise its discretion in the public interest.\n\tIn reviewing a decision rendered by the Authority under the Securities Act (chapter V-1.1) or the Derivatives Act (chapter I-14.01), the Tribunal may not, when assessing the facts or the law for the purposes of those Acts, substitute its assessment of the public interest for that made by the Authority in making a decision.\n\tIn this Title, unless the context indicates otherwise, matters also includes any application, complaint, contestation or motion, as well as any action falling within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n94. At the request of the Authority, the Tribunal may take any measure conducive to ensuring compliance with an undertaking given to the Authority under any of the Acts listed in the first paragraph of section 93 or compliance with those Acts.\nCivil Code of Quebec\n3134. In the absence of any special provision, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction when the defendant is domiciled in Quebec.\n3135. Even though a Quebec authority has jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may, exceptionally and on an application by a party, decline jurisdiction if it considers that the authorities of another State are in a better position to decide the dispute.\n3136. Even though a Quebec authority has no jurisdiction to hear a dispute, it may nevertheless hear it provided the dispute has a sufficient connection with Quebec, if proceedings abroad prove impossible or the institution of proceedings abroad cannot reasonably be required.\n3137. On the application of a party, a Quebec authority may stay its ruling on an action brought before it if another action, between the same parties, based on the same facts and having the same subject is pending before a foreign authority, provided that the latter action can result in a decision which may be recognized in Quebec, or if such a decision has already been rendered by a foreign authority.\n3138. A Quebec authority may order provisional or conservatory measures even if it has no jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute.\n3139. Where a Quebec authority has jurisdiction to rule on the principal demand, it also has jurisdiction to rule on an incidental demand or a cross demand.\n3140. In cases of emergency or serious inconvenience, Quebec authorities may also take such measures as they consider necessary for the protection of a person present in Quebec or of the persons property if it is situated there.\n3148. In personal actions of a patrimonial nature, Quebec authorities have jurisdiction in the following cases:\n\t(1) the defendant has his domicile or his residence in Quebec;\n\t(2) the defendant is a legal person, is not domiciled in Quebec but has an establishment in Quebec, and the dispute relates to its activities in Quebec;\n\t(3) a fault was committed in Quebec, injury was suffered in Quebec, an injurious act or omission occurred in Quebec or one of the obligations arising from a contract was to be performed in Quebec;\n\tAppeals dismissed with costs, Cote J. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant/intervener Frederick Langford Sharp: Langlois Lawyers, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants/interveners Shawn Van Damme, Vincenzo Antonio Carnovale and Pasquale Antonio Rocca: LCM Attorneys inc., Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Autorite des marches financiers, Montreal.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Attorney General of Quebec, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Ontario Securities Commission: Ontario Securities Commission, Toronto.", "llama_summary": "Here is the rewritten summary:\n\n**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds Jurisdiction of Quebec's Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal over Out-of-Province Defendants**\n\nThis appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal (FMAT) over out-of-province defendants in a securities enforcement proceeding.\n\n**Background**\nThe Autorite des marches financiers (AMF), Quebec's financial sector regulator, alleged that four British Columbia residents, Frederick Langford Sharp, Shawn Van Damme, Vincenzo Antonio Carnovale, and Pasquale Antonio Rocca, contravened the Quebec Securities Act by engaging in a transnational pump-and-dump securities manipulation scheme with links to Quebec. The AMF sought orders from the FMAT to prohibit the accused from acting as directors or officers of an issuer, dealer, adviser, or investment fund manager and to impose administrative penalties on them.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe FMAT ruled that it had jurisdiction over the appellants under s. 93 of the Act respecting the Autorite des marches financiers. The appellants challenged this decision but were unsuccessful at both the Superior Court of Quebec and Court of Appeal levels. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld FMAT's jurisdiction over out-of-province defendants under s. 93.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA provincial administrative tribunal has jurisdiction over out-of-province defendants in a securities enforcement proceeding when there is a real and substantial connection between province and defendant.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority Chief Justice Wagner held that FMAT has jurisdiction under Securities Act & Act respecting Autorite des marches financiers; however Cote J dissented arguing lack adjudicative jurisdiction", "citation": "2023 SCC 29", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the appeals of four British Columbia residents accused of stock price  manipulation by a Quebec financial authority. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</strong>This case is about whether a Quebec administrative  tribunal had jurisdiction over out-of-province residents accused of fraudulently  manipulating the stock prices of a company with links to Quebec. In 2017, l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers, an administrative  agency that regulates Quebec\u2019s financial sector, brought an action before the  Financial Markets Administrative Tribunal, an administrative tribunal in Quebec.  It alleged that four residents of British Columbia (the defendants) took part  in a transnational \u201cpump-and-dump\u201d scheme, and in doing so, breached Quebec\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>, a law designed to protect  the public interest in the securities market. In a pump-and-dump scheme, promoters  boost the price of a stock by releasing false or misleading statements and then  profit by selling their holdings in that stock at much higher prices. In this  case, the defendants allegedly worked together to buy the shares of a shell  company, give it a legitimate face, promote its business, sell its shares for a  profit and distribute this profit among themselves.Despite the defendants being from outside Quebec, the  Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers alleged that their scheme had enough ties to the  province to apply Quebec\u2019s securities regulatory scheme to them: the shell  company was a reporting issuer in Quebec with a Montr\u00e9al business address; its  director was a Quebec resident when the scheme was implemented; its promotional  activities were accessible to Quebec residents; and, ultimately, Quebec  investors lost money. The defendants challenged the action, claiming the Tribunal  did not have jurisdiction over them because they did not live in Quebec. The Tribunal dismissed the defendants\u2019 challenge,  ruling that it had jurisdiction over them under the <em>Act respecting the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers</em>. Section 93 of  that act says the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make determinations under the province\u2019s <em>Securities Act</em>. Together, these acts  form Quebec\u2019s securities regulatory scheme. It also applied the Supreme Court of  Canada\u2019s decision in an unrelated case, which held that a provincial regulatory  scheme, such as the Quebec scheme currently before the Supreme Court in these  appeals, can apply to an out-of-province defendant when there is a \u201csufficient  connection\u201d or a \u201creal and substantial connection\u201d between the province and the  defendant. What constitutes a \u201csufficient\u201d connection depends on the  relationship between the province that enacted the legislation, the subject  matter of the legislation and the individual or entity sought to be regulated  by it. The Superior Court of Quebec dismissed the defendants\u2019  requests to review the Tribunal\u2019s decision, concluding the Tribunal had  properly assumed jurisdiction over them. The Court of Appeal of Quebec  dismissed the defendants\u2019 subsequent appeals, but the three judges disagreed on  the legal basis on which to do so. The majority agreed the Tribunal had  jurisdiction because a real and substantial connection existed between the  province and the defendants. The concurring judge would have dismissed the  appeals based on the rules set out in the <em>Civil  Code of Quebec</em> with respect to the international jurisdiction of Quebec  authorities. On appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada, the defendants asked  whether the Tribunal was correct in assuming jurisdiction, and if so, on which  legal basis.The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeals. <strong>The Tribunal correctly  concluded it had jurisdiction over the defendants. </strong>Writing for the  majority, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Jamal said the Tribunal has  jurisdiction to make determinations under the Quebec securities regulatory  scheme. Its jurisdiction can extend to out-of-province defendants when there is  a \u201creal and substantial\u201d connection (also described as a \u201csufficient  connection\u201d) between them and Quebec. As Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Jamal  wrote, \u201cit would defeat the purpose of the cross-border nature of modern  securities regulation to allow the [defendants] to escape the reach of Quebec\u2019s  regulatory oversight\u201d.The allegations  that the defendants used Quebec as the face of their securities manipulation  and injured Quebec investors establish a sufficient connection to give the Tribunal  jurisdiction over them. For these reasons, Chief Justice Wagner and Justice  Jamal dismissed the appeals. This means the action brought by the Autorit\u00e9 des  march\u00e9s financiers against the defendants before the Tribunal can proceed.

O.1, ss. 1(1) employer, 25(1)(c), 66(3)(b)  Construction Projects, O.Reg. 213/91.\n\tThe City of Sudbury contracted with Interpaving Limited to act as constructor to repair a downtown water main. During the repairs, an Interpaving employee struck and killed a pedestrian when driving a road grader, in reverse, through an intersection. The Ministry charged the City under s. 25(1)(c) of Ontarios Occupational Health and Safety Act (Act) for failing to ensure that certain safety requirements of the accompanying regulation, Construction Projects (Regulation), had been met. The City conceded it was the owner of the construction project and acknowledged that it sent its quality control inspectors to the project site to oversee Interpavings contract compliance, but denied that it was an employer, arguing that it lacked control over the repair work and had delegated control to Interpaving.\n\tThe provincial court trial judge acquitted the City because Interpaving, not the City, had direct control over the workers and the intersection and thus the City was not an employer under s. 1(1) of the Act. Alternatively, the trial judge found that even if the City was an employer and breached its obligations, it acted with due diligence. The provincial offences appeal court upheld the trial judges decision but did not address the finding that the City acted with due diligence. The Court of Appeal set aside the decision of the provincial offences appeal court judge, found the City liable under s. 25(1)(c) as an employer, and remitted the question of the Citys due diligence to the provincial offences appeal court.\n\tHeld on equal division (Karakatsanis, Cote, Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Martin, Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: There is agreement with the Court of Appeal that the City was an employer and breached its duty under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act, and that the issue of the Citys due diligence defence should be remitted to the provincial offences appeal court. While control over workers and the workplace may bear on a due diligence defence, nothing in the text, context or purpose of the Act requires the Ministry to establish control over the workers or workplace to prove that the City breached its obligations as an employer under s. 25(1)(c). \n\tThe Act seeks to maintain and promote a reasonable level of protection for the health and safety of workers in and about their workplace and it fulfils its public welfare purpose by allocating various occupational health and safety duties among various classes of workplace actors, including constructors, employers and owners. These duties are often concurrent and overlapping: several different actors may be responsible for the same protective functions and measures  this is known as the belt and braces approach to occupational health and safety. Under this approach, where multiple workplace entities fail to safeguard health and safety, they cannot point to others failures as an excuse for their own; each workplace participant must ensure that the workplace is safe. Section 66(1)(a) of the Act makes it an offence for a workplace actor to breach one of the Acts obligations, including s. 25(1)(c), which is a strict liability offence: the Ministry only needs to prove the actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt to ground a conviction.\n\tWhere an owner who contracts for the services of a constructor on a construction project is prosecuted for a breach of s. 25(1)(c), a court must first consider whether the Ministry has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Act applied to the accused because the accused was an employer under s. 1(1) of the Act. An owner is an employer if it employed workers at a workplace where an alleged breach of s. 25(1)(c) occurred, or contracted for the services of a worker at that workplace (including for the services of a constructor). The Ministry is not required to prove that the owner had control over the workplace or the workers there. It is clear from the text of the definition of employer that control is not an element that the Ministry must prove to establish that an accused is subject to the duties of an employer. First, the definition contains no reference to control. A control requirement should therefore not be embedded into the definition of an employer when the legislature deliberately chose not to do so. Second, by referring to a contract for services in the definition of employer, the legislature signalled its intent to capture employer-independent contractor relationships under the employer definition and to remove from the definition the traditional common law control condition that distinguishes employment and independent contractor relationships. \n\tA court must then determine whether the Ministry has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused breached s. 25(1)(c) of the Act. There is a breach of s. 25(1)(c) if the safety measures prescribed by the Regulation are not carried out in the workplace to which the owner/employer is connected by a contractual relationship with employees or an independent contractor. Again, the Ministry is not required to prove that the owner had control over the workplace or the workers there. A review of s. 25(1)(c)s text, context, and purpose reveals that control on the part of the accused is not an element of this duty. The plain text of s. 25(1)(c) does not limit this duty to workers over which the employer has control. The duty in s. 25(1)(c) must also be understood in the context of the scheme of the Act, the wide definition of employer and the existence of a due diligence defence under s. 66(3)(b) of the Act. Section 25(1)(c) was intentionally drafted broadly so as to focus on the employers connection to the workplace rather than any particular worker. The breadth of the employers duties and the broad scope of the definition of employer are mutually reinforcing. While the interpretation of ss. 1(1) and 25(1)(c) raises separate questions, these sections should be read harmoniously as they are nonetheless related. Reading a control requirement into s. 25(1)(c) would narrow the employers duties and would introduce an internal inconsistency into the Act by pairing a broad definition of employer with a narrow interpretation of s. 25(1)(c), rather than finding harmony between these provisions and treating them as mutually reinforcing as the legislature intended. In addition, the existence of the due diligence defence in s. 66(3)(b) is relevant context because it means that employers who breach s. 25(1)(c) will not be subject to penalties under the Act if they can show they took all reasonable steps to avoid the breach. Section 66(3)(b) functions as a safety valve, in which the presence of control may be a factor in assessing due diligence. Reading a control requirement into s. 25(1)(c) would also be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act. The act is a public welfare statute. Its purpose is to maintain and promote a reasonable level of protection for the health and safety of workers in and about their workplace. A control requirement could defeat the Acts public welfare purpose of creating overlapping responsibility and would essentially give workplace actors a tool for frustrating regulatory prosecutions at the outset, by arguing that they had no control over a hazard because other parties had greater comparative control over that hazard. \n\tFinally, a court must determine whether the accused has proven on a balance of probabilities that it should avoid liability because it exercised due diligence under s. 66(3)(b) of the Act. Control should only be considered at this stage of the analysis. It is open to an accused to prove that its lack of control suggests that it took all reasonable steps in the circumstances. Shifting the burden to the employer to establish a due diligence defence incentivizes employers to take all steps within their control to achieve workplace safety and prevent future harm so that they may avail themselves of the defence should harm occur. That an employers degree of control over the parties in the workplace is relevant to its due diligence defence also answers fairness concerns about imposing liability on an employer for a breach caused by another party. Relevant considerations for the courts determination at this stage may include, but are not limited to: the accuseds degree of control over the workplace or the workers; whether the accused delegated control to the constructor in an effort to overcome its own lack of skill, knowledge or expertise to complete the project in accordance with the Regulation; whether the accused took steps to evaluate the constructors ability to ensure compliance with the Regulation before deciding to contract for its services; and whether the accused effectively monitored and supervised the constructors work on the project to ensure that the prescriptions in the Regulation were carried out in the workplace.\n\tIn the instant case, the City was an employer of the quality control inspectors, whom it employed directly and dispatched to the construction project. The City was also an employer of Interpaving, with whom it contracted to undertake the construction project. As an employer of the inspectors and of Interpaving, the City was required by s. 25(1)(c) of the Act to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed were carried out in the workplace. On the date of the accident, measures required by the Regulation  a fence between the construction work and the public way as well as signallers  were not carried out in the workplace. Thus, the City, as employer, committed the offence under s. 25(1)(c).\n\tPer Karakatsanis, Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. The City is the employer of its quality control inspectors; therefore, the scope of its duties under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act must be examined. Properly interpreted, s. 25(1)(c) holds employers liable for breaching the regulatory measures which apply to them. Where certain measures in the Regulation do not specify to whom they apply, these measures apply to an employer when they relate to the work that the employer controlled and performed through their workers. As the courts below did not properly analyze whether the offence was made out, the matter should be remitted for reconsideration by the provincial court to consider the applicability of the regulatory measures.\n\tThe definition of employer in s. 1(1) of the Act covers two broad relationships. The first branch of the definition is satisfied if the person employs one or more workers. It focuses on the employment contract and reflects the traditional conception of a direct employer-employee relationship. However, the fact that a party is an employer does not mean that they are an employer to all workers at a workplace or project, which may affect the scope of their responsibilities. The text of the definition of employer is expressly focused on a partys relationship to workers and it is inappropriate to narrow it by considering that partys relationship to a workplace. The latter relationship only becomes relevant at the stage of determining an employers duties. Accordingly, the first branch of the definition is satisfied where a traditional employment relationship exists.\n\tThe second branch of the definition involves a person who contracts for the services of one or more workers. The second branch prevents parties from removing themselves from the application of the Act where they subcontract out work, rather than directly hiring workers through an employment contract. It ensures that the substance of the employer-worker relationship is not determined by the manner in which it is described in the contract. When an owner contracts with a constructor, they are not seeking to subcontract out particular tasks to any independent contractor instead of hiring workers directly through an employment contract; rather, they are asking an entity to assume plenary oversight and authority to undertake the entire project. This relationship reflects the practical reality of the construction industry, where owners promote safety by transferring responsibility to constructors with relevant expertise. The owner-constructor relationship does not generally fall within the second branch of the employer definition in s. 1(1). The Act is specifically designed so that an owner can take a hands-off approach to overseeing the project relative to the constructor. A constructor undertakes the project, which indicates that overall authority for the project, including the coordination of health and safety, falls to the constructor. Treating an owner as automatically being an employer of the workers hired or contracted for by the constructor under the second branch of the employer definition would undermine the design of the scheme. It would mean that by virtue of engaging a constructor to oversee a project, project owners would be assigned responsibilities that would require them to play an active role across the project  a role that the Act sought to avoid by enabling them to contract with a constructor in the first place. Treating the owner-constructor relationship as an employer-worker relationship detracts from the legislations effectiveness because it ignores the practical differences between these relationships and undercuts the distinct mechanisms by which they promote worker safety. In sum, the second branch of the employer definition is broad, but it does not turn an owner into the employer of workers hired or contracted for by a constructor. \n\tProceeding on the assumption that once a party meets the definition of employer, they are strictly liable for the breach of any regulatory provision through the operation of s. 25(1)(c) and must rely on the due diligence defence conflates the definition of employer with the determination of the scope of an employers duties. On a proper construction of the scheme, it is essential to examine both the definition of the workplace parties and the duties that actually apply to them. An offence cannot be founded on the breach of a duty that does not apply to the accused. Once a workplace party is found to satisfy the relevant definition set out in s. 1(1) of the Act, it is necessary to then consider which duties actually applied to the party at the time of the alleged offence. The Act separately sets out the duties for each workplace party.\n\tSection 25(1)(c) requires an employer to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory measures. Where the Regulation expressly states to whom its measures apply, there will be no question as to whether they fall within the employers duty under s. 25(1)(c). Where however, a particular measure is silent concerning to whom it applies, the measure applies when it relates to work that the employer controlled and performed through their workers. This relationship is established when the employer has authority over the performance of a task, usually because it is the portion of the work within the larger project that, whether alone or with other parties, they have been entrusted with performing through the workers they have employed or contracted for. To be sure, multiple parties can be jointly entrusted with a task, since different employers will often collaborate, and thus multiple employers can have an overlapping responsibility to fulfill the same measures. A regulatory measure can apply to the work of multiple employers so long as it relates to each employer. The core question is: What work is an employer responsible for undertaking on the construction project? The Ministry should know whether the measure is actually related to the employers work before making the decision to charge that employer. Therefore, the regulatory measures apply when they present a nexus to the work which is under the employers control and performed through their workers. Establishing this nexus between the measure and the employer is a binary, threshold question: either the measure applies because it is related to work which the employer has undertaken, or the measure does not apply because such a link is absent.\n\tIt would be absurd to interpret s. 25(1)(c) and the Regulation as obligating every employer at a construction project to ensure compliance with all measures contained within the Regulation. This would effectively mean that everyone who employs anyone is responsible for everything that anyone does. Protecting worker safety is of critical importance and it is far from clear that making every employer liable for the acts of all other employers in carrying out all regulatory obligations meaningfully improves worker safety. A measured and practical approach gives effect to the concept of overlapping responsibilities. Since the workers activities under each employers control frequently overlap on complex construction projects, so too will the measures which apply to them under s. 25(1)(c). A measured and practical approach also fully operationalizes the belt and braces approach which aims to create meaningful protection in practice. Yet, if there is no relationship between the measure and the employers work, the employer cannot serve as an effective brace. Imposing measures contained in the Regulation onto employers bearing no relationship to the work at hand adds an indefinite number of illusory braces: they provide a false sense of added safety but, in reality, only increase the legal jeopardy of unrelated workplace parties who could not have ensured compliance with those measures. Holding employers with no control liable does nothing to increase worker safety  it is this very lack of control which makes them unable to carry out the regulatory measures in the first place. Additionally, limitless responsibilities lead to confusion and a lack of coordination on a construction project. If every employer is liable for everything and has duties towards unrelated parties, an individual employers sphere of responsibility becomes unclear. Safety issues could arise if multiple employers with no relationship to the duty or expertise in the area seek to enforce their own version of a particular safety procedure on other workers. Alternatively, unlimited duties can lead to neglect if each employer assumes that duties owed by all employers will have been fulfilled by someone else. \n\tProsecutorial discretion will not limit the potential for absurdity to occur. This effectively gives prosecutors unbounded discretion to define the proper scope of each employers duties by deciding who to charge, rendering the ultimate delineation of duties in the Act unpredictable and uneven from the accuseds perspective. Reliance on a promise that prosecutors would not charge employers for breaches of regulatory measures over which they had no control emphasizes this absurdity. The availability of the due diligence defence at s. 66(3) also initially presents itself as an appealing solution, but there are multiple flaws with adopting an approach that pushes most of the analysis concerning an employers responsibility to the due diligence stage. From a methodological perspective, the offence and the defence should not be conflated. Judges should not abdicate the responsibility of arriving at a reasonable interpretation of a duty merely because a defence exists or because doing so would improve administrative efficiency. A focus on the due diligence defence flips the structure of offences on its head: every employer is captured by the offence as soon as any regulatory measure is not met, and the accused must bear the burden of pulling themselves out of the ambit of the offence. Shifting much of the analysis on the contents of the duty and the nature of the employers work to the due diligence stage increases uncertainty in practice and ignores the reality of how the scheme operates on the ground. If most of the employers obligations are outside of their control, they have no ability to even know whether the measures are being complied with or what they could be charged with at any moment. In contrast, requiring that a measure relates to an employers work provides employers with a greater understanding of their responsibilities and encourages them to take initiative to protect workers. \n\tIn the instant case, because the City had hired quality control inspectors through a contract of employment, it satisfied the definition of employer under the first branch. The City owes duties as the employer of these workers under the Act. However, by contracting with a constructor, it did not become the employer of the workers that the constructor retained. The owner-constructor contract reflects a distinct relationship contemplated in the Act that does not generally fall within the second branch of the employer definition in s. 1(1). Consequently, the City is only the employer of its quality control inspectors. In light of the conclusion that the City is an employer to the quality control inspectors, the applicability of the regulatory measures depends on whether the City controlled work being performed near public ways or controlled the operation of vehicles, machines and equipment. The trial judge however did not consider the applicability of the regulatory measures, nor did the provincial offences appeal court or the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the proper approach is to remit the matter to the provincial court to determine whether the relevant provisions of the Regulation related to the City and thereby fell within its duty under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act.\n\tPer Cote J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the acquittals entered by the trial judge should be restored. Properly interpreted, the obligations prescribed by the Regulation were the responsibility of the constructor and/or the employers who performed the relevant construction work. The City had no involvement in or control over that work and was therefore not an employer at the construction project.\n\tThere is agreement with Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. that the definition of employer in s. 1(1) of the Act does not capture the construction-specific relationship between a project owner and its general contractor. A project owner who hires a constructor is not the employer of the constructor itself or its workers. An employer cannot evade its occupational health and safety responsibilities by hiring an independent contractor instead of entering a typical employment relationship. But it does not follow that an employer is responsible for the employees and independent contractors of other employers.\n\tThere is also substantial agreement with Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s interpretation of the duties of employers under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act, which must be read in context and together with the applicable Regulation. It would be absurd to interpret s. 25(1)(c) literally to require each employer on a construction project to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations. On a construction project, while each employer is responsible for the health and safety of its own workers, the constructor is responsible for health and safety across the project. \n\tThe belt and braces approach to occupational health and safety is not without reasonable limits and should not be interpreted in a manner that extends the reach of the Act beyond what was intended by the legislature. To impose duties on employers that they cannot possibly fulfil does not further the aim and purpose of the Act, which is to promote worker safety. The position that workplaces will be safer if every employer is made responsible for every possible safety obligation has superficial appeal, but it also creates a clear disincentive for a municipal project owner to engage in quality control efforts. A municipal project owner is not an employer on the construction site merely because it employs quality control inspectors. Holding every project owner strictly liable for all safety hazards it encountered in its quality control efforts  and which it did nothing to create  renders the quality control exception meaningless. It would no longer matter that owners do not become constructors by hiring quality control personnel. They would simply become employers who, in addition to constructors, have a strict duty to ensure compliance across the construction project.\n\tThe due diligence defence only becomes relevant once the elements of the statutory offence have been established. An employers ability to make out a potentially costly and burdensome defence is irrelevant to the proper interpretation of who is an employer on a construction site and to the scope of its corresponding statutory duties. It does not prevent future harm to impose statutory liability on employers who have no connection to, or control over, the safety obligation in question. Where an employer on a construction site did have some measure of control over the safety obligation in question, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that it took every precaution reasonable in the circumstances.\n\tIn a careful and thorough analysis, the trial judge in the instant case repeatedly rejected the Ministrys position that the City or its inspectors exercised control over any construction work at the project. The trial judge properly found that the Ministry had not proved that the City acted as an employer on the construction site. Interpaving was both the constructor of the project and the employer of the road grader operator who fatally struck and killed a pedestrian. The Citys involvement in the project was limited to quality control and it was not responsible for the completion of any construction work. The trial judges conclusions on the Citys lack of control at the project are findings of fact that deserve deference. The trial judge also correctly found that even if she was wrong in concluding that the City was not an employer on the construction site, the City took every precaution reasonable in the circumstances to ensure safety at the project. It would be an extravagant proposition to say that a municipal project owner becomes an employer of every person on a project by attending the project for the limited purpose of quality assurance. To impose statutory liability on the City in these circumstances would be a regrettable departure from the established scheme of the Act. The City was not statutorily obligated to ensure compliance with the Regulation which applied only to the workplace parties involved in the actual construction work at the project site. \nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

O.1 (Act). The Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury contracted with Interpaving Limited to act as constructor to repair a downtown water main. An Interpaving employee struck and killed a pedestrian when driving a road grader, in reverse, through an intersection. Contrary to the accompanying regulation, Construction Projects, O. Reg. 213/91 (Regulation), no fence was placed between the construction project workplace and the public intersection, and no signaller was assisting the Interpaving worker (see ss. 65 and 104(3)). In separate proceedings, Interpaving was tried and convicted for breaching the duty of employers under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act to ensure that . . . the measures and procedures prescribed [in the Regulation] are carried out in the workplace.\nThe legal issue on this appeal concerns the statutory liability, if any, of the City as an employer for breaching this same duty. In response to being charged and prosecuted by the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General (Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development) (Ministry) under s. 25(1)(c), the City conceded it was the owner of the construction project and acknowledged that it sent quality control inspectors to the project, but denied that it was an employer, arguing that it lacked control over the repair work and had delegated control to Interpaving. \nThe trial judge acquitted the City because Interpaving, not the City, had direct control over the workers and the intersection and thus the City was not an employer under s. 1(1) (paras. 86-88, reproduced in A.R., vol. 1, at pp. 16-17). Alternatively, even if the City breached its obligations, it acted with due diligence as every precaution reasonable in the circumstances was taken (para. 91). The Citys acquittal on the basis that it was not an employer was upheld by the provincial offences appeal court; the court did not address the Ministrys appeal of trial judges finding that the City acted with due diligence (2019 ONSC 3285, 88 M.P.L.R. (5th) 158). The Court of Appeal, in a unanimous decision, allowed the appeal and set aside the decision of the provincial offences appeal court judge. The court affirmed and applied the definition of employer established in its leading 1992 decision, R. v. Wyssen, 10 O.R. (3d) 193, found the City liable under s. 25(1)(c) as an employer, and remitted the question of the Citys due diligence to the provincial offences appeal court (2021 ONCA 252, 15 M.P.L.R. (6th) 161). The City appeals to this Court and asks us to determine what role control plays in regulatory prosecutions against employers under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act.\nThe short answer is that while control over workers and the workplace may bear on a due diligence defence, nothing in the text, context or purpose of the Act requires the Ministry to establish control over the workers or the workplace to prove that the City breached its obligations as an employer under s. 25(1)(c).\nIn s. 1(1), the Act defines employer broadly  without any reference to control  and charges all employers to uphold several statutory duties. There is simply no reason to embed a control requirement into the definition of an employer or graft a control requirement onto s. 25(1)(c) when the legislature deliberately chose not to do so. Indeed, diminishing an employers duties by reading in a control requirement under either or both provisions would thwart the purpose of this remedial public welfare legislation. This Act is specifically designed to expand historically narrow safeguards and seeks to promote and maintain workplace health and safety by expressly imposing concurrent, overlapping, broad, strict, and non-delegable duties on multiple workplace participants in what is known as the belt and braces strategy. The interpretation advanced by the City not only defeats this intention, but would also create undesirable and unnecessary uncertainty and jeopardize efficient administration of the Acts strict liability offences. Instead, control is properly considered in deciding whether an employer who has breached the Act can nevertheless defend on the basis that it acted with due diligence. It is open to an accused to prove that its lack of control suggests that it took all reasonable steps in the circumstances.\nAccordingly, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the City was an employer and breached its duty under s. 25(1)(c). I would therefore dismiss the appeal and uphold the Court of Appeals order remitting the question of due diligence to the provincial offences appeal court. \nAnalysis\nMy analysis proceeds in three parts. I first provide an overview of the Act. Second, I explain why the Ministry need not prove control in a prosecution against an employer under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act. Third, I comment on the role of control in relation to the due diligence defence under s. 66(3)(b).\nOverview of the Occupational Health and Safety Act\nThe Act seeks to maintain and promote a reasonable level of protection for the health and safety of workers in and about their workplace. As set out in Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Hamilton (City) (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 37 (C.A.), at para. 16:\nThe [Act] is a remedial public welfare statute intended to guarantee a minimum level of protection for the health and safety of workers. When interpreting legislation of this kind, it is important to bear in mind certain guiding principles. Protective legislation designed to promote public health and safety is to be generously interpreted in a manner that is in keeping with the purposes and objectives of the legislative scheme. Narrow or technical interpretations that would interfere with or frustrate the attainment of the legislatures public welfare objectives are to be avoided.\nThe Acts public welfare purpose is confirmed by its history. Following the 1976 Report of the Royal Commission on the Health and Safety of Workers in Mines (Ham Commission Report), the Ontario government engaged in substantial legislative reform. It repealed various predecessor statutes that only provided workplace protection to employees. When the Act was introduced in 1978, it expanded the definition of employer to extend protection to independent contractors, reflecting the clear intention of the legislature to make employers responsible for ensuring safety in the workplace (see Wyssen, at p. 199).\nThe Act fulfills its public welfare purpose by allocating various occupational health and safety duties among various classes of workplace actors, including constructors, employers, and owners (see ss. 23, 25 and 29, respectively). These duties are often concurrent and overlapping: several different actors may be responsible for the same protective functions and measures. This is known as the belt and braces approach to occupational health and safety:\n. . . the Act and Regulations use more than one method to ensure workers are protected. So, if the belt does not work to safeguard a worker, the backup system of the braces might, or vice versa. If all workplace parties are required to exercise due diligence, the failure of one party to exercise the requisite due diligence might be compensated for by the diligence of one of the other workplace parties. The purpose is to leave little to chance and to make protection of workers an overlapping responsibility.\n\n(Ontario (Minister of Labour) v. Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc., 2010 ONSC 2013, 261 O.A.C. 27, at para. 24)\nUnder the belt and braces approach, where multiple workplace entities fail to safeguard health and safety, they cannot point to others failures as an excuse for their own; each workplace participant must ensure that the workplace is safe (R. v. J. Stoller Construction Ltd., 1986 CarswellOnt 3654 (WL) (Prov. Ct.), at para. 22; R. v. Stelco Inc. (1989), 1 C.O.H.S.C. 76 (Ont. Prov. Ct.), at pp. 83-84; R. v. Structform International Ltd., [1992] O.J. No. 1711 (QL), 1992 CarswellOnt 2751 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 17 (WL); R. v. Thomas G. Fuller & Sons Ltd., 2008 CarswellOnt 9276 (WL) (C.J.), at para. 54; R. v. Cox Construction Ltd., 2008 CarswellOnt 9540 (WL) (C.J.), at paras. 189-92; R. v. Saskatchewan Power Corp., 2016 SKPC 2, at para. 35 (CanLII), citing Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Dofasco Inc., 2007 ONCA 769, 87 O.R. (3d) 161). The Ham Commission Report advocated for an internal responsibility system whereby all workplace participants share responsibility for workplace safety, highlighted that a safe workplace involves all participants working together in a shared responsibility system, and recognized a positive and proactive duty on all participants (R. v. Campbell, [2004] O.J. No. 129 (QL), 2004 CarswellOnt 116 (WL) (C.J.), at paras. 28-29 and 65). \nWhat the Ministry is Required to Establish \nSection 66(1)(a) of the Act makes it an offence for a workplace actor to breach one of the Acts obligations, including s. 25(1)(c), which is a strict liability offence (R. v. Timminco Ltd. (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 21 (C.A.), at para. 23). As such, when s. 25(1)(c) is the subject of the charge, the Ministry only needs to prove the actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt to ground a conviction; the Ministry does not need to prove mens rea. To prove the actus reus, the Ministry must prove that workplace participant was an employer under s. 1(1) and that there was a breach because the employer did not ensure that the prescribed measures and procedures were carried out in the workplace. \nMy colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. and I agree that the definition of employer is a free-standing and distinct question from the question of the scope of the duty under s. 25(1)(c) (see para. 75). Though the interpretation of employer in s. 1(1) and of the duty in s. 25(1)(c) are related insofar as the provisions provide context for one another and are governed by the same statutory purpose, these two questions must remain analytically distinct. Additionally, my colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. and I agree that control should not be embedded into the definition of employer (paras. 93 and 97). Where we part ways is the role of control in relation to the employers duty in s. 25(1)(c).\nProving the City Is an Employer Under Section 1(1) of the Act Does Not Require the Ministry to Prove Control \nThe Act defines an employer as\na person who employs one or more workers or contracts for the services of one or more workers and includes a contractor or subcontractor who performs work or supplies services and a contractor or subcontractor who undertakes with an owner, constructor, contractor or subcontractor to perform work or supply services;\nThe meaning of employer was thoroughly canvassed and authoritatively determined in Wyssen (see Ontario v. London Excavators & Trucking Ltd. (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 32 (C.A.), at p. 40; Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Pioneer Construction Inc. (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at para. 19; Dofasco Inc., at para. 9; Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. United Independent Operators Ltd., 2011 ONCA 33, 104 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 38).\nIn that 1992 decision, the Court of Appeal for Ontario eschewed, not embedded, a control requirement for who qualifies as an employer. In doing so, the court endorsed the belt and braces approach of placing overlapping responsibilities on all workplace actors, regardless of their level of control, in order to best protect worker safety. Blair J.A., for the majority, considered the text, context and purpose of s. 1(1) in concluding that the definition of employer is broad, unconnected to control, and encompasses two types of relationships: (1) where a person employs workers; and (2) where a person contracts for the services of workers (p. 196). \nIt is clear from the text of the definition of employer that control is not an element that the Ministry must prove to establish that an accused is subject to the duties of an employer. First, the definition contains no reference to control. It is simply not there when it could have been, if that was the intention of the legislature. This Court must give effect to what the legislature included in the definition of employer. To conjecture and then grant priority to what the legislature chose not to include, by adding an additional element into the definition, would be tantamount to amending [the Act], which is a legislative and not a judicial function (R. v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at para. 26 (emphasis deleted); see also R. v. Hinchey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1128, at para. 8).\nSecond, at common law, a persons relationship with an independent contractor is typically characterized by a lack of control on the part of that person over the contractor (671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 SCC 59, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 983, at paras. 33-48). The phrase contract for services is used, at common law, to refer to such relationships. Comparatively, contract of service is used to denote an employment agreement. By referring to a contract for services in the definition of employer, the legislature signaled its intent to capture employer-independent contractor relationships under the employer definition (Wyssen, at pp. 196-98). Since Wyssen found that such relationships are captured by the definition, it follows that a person can be an employer under the Act even where they lack control over the worker or the workplace. Wyssens interpretation applies to all employees and workplaces, including those in the construction industry. \nIn addition, as noted in Wyssen, prior to the Acts enactment, other pieces of worker safety legislation defined employer in a way that excluded independent contractor relationships (p. 199, citing Industrial Safety Act, 1971, S.O. 1971, c. 43, s. 1(e); see also, e.g., The Construction Safety Act, 1973, S.O. 1973, c. 47, s. 1(h)). The shift in this Act to expressly include employer-independent contractor relationships within the definition of employer signals the legislatures intention to remove from the definition the traditional common law control condition that distinguishes employment and independent contractor relationships. Incorporating control into the s. 1(1) definition would therefore reintroduce a characteristic of the former regime, which was abolished because it failed to adequately promote and protect workplace safety. \nIt is also significant that while the legislature did not include control in the definition of employer, it did in the definition of constructor. In s. 1(1), constructor is defined as a person who undertakes a project for an owner; undertaking a project involves assuming control over it (Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Reid & DeLeye Contractors Ltd., 2011 ONCJ 472, at para. 42 (CanLII)). The absence of a control requirement for employers thus reflects an intentional legislative choice that must be respected. \nAccordingly, authorities that have read a control requirement into employer are irreconcilable with Wyssen, inconsistent with the text, context and purpose of the Act, and should not be followed (see, e.g., Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Nor Eng Construction & Engineering Inc., 2008 ONCJ 296, at para. 88 (CanLII); R. v. Marina Harbour Systems, 2008 CanLII 64002 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 27-30; R. v. EFCO Canada Co., 2010 ONCJ 421, at paras. 59-60).\nIt follows from the straightforward application of Wyssen, as well as the text, context and purpose of s. 1(1), that the City was an employer under both branches of the Acts definition. I agree with the Court of Appeal that it was an employer of the inspectors, whom it employed directly and dispatched to the construction project. Further, under the second branch, the City was an employer of Interpaving, with whom it contracted to undertake the construction project. Because the definition of employer encompasses employer-independent contractor relationships, an owner who contracts with a constructor is an employer under s. 1(1) of the Act. The text of the employer definition captures a person who contracts for the services of workers, and worker is defined as including [a] person who performs work or supplies services for monetary compensation. This encompasses constructors, who perform work and supply services for monetary compensation. Thus, the reference to contracting for the services of workers in the employer definition clearly captures contracting with constructors.\nProving the City Breached Section 25(1)(c) of the Act\nThe duties imposed by the Act are numerous, varied and stated in precise, purposeful ways. In some cases, they are linked to a particular workplace or project (see, e.g., ss. 23(1) and 25(1)(c)) or to the workers (see, e.g., ss. 23(1)(c) and 25(2)(a)). In other cases, they are more broadly stated (see, e.g., s. 25(1)(a)). The relevant obligation in this case is tied to the workplace. \nThe City is alleged to have breached s. 25(1)(c), which requires that an employer shall ensure that . . . the measures and procedures prescribed are carried out in the workplace. This obligation applies to employers across all sectors. For employers in the construction industry, the relevant measures and procedures are prescribed in the Regulation. A review of s. 25(1)(c)s text, context, and purpose reveals that control on the part of the accused is not an element of this duty. The Ministry does not need to prove that the City had control over the Interpaving workers or the workplace as part of the actus reus of the s. 25(1)(c) offence. \nText\nThe plain text of s. 25(1)(c) does not limit this duty to workers or workplaces over which the employer has control. The legislature could have written in an internal limitation akin to a control requirement in relation to this duty but chose not to. This is all the more important because, in contrast to s. 25(1)(c), it did precisely that in s. 25(2)(h), where the employers obligation to take precautions is limited to those precautions reasonable in the circumstances. That the legislature did not limit s. 25(1)(c), whether by reference to a control requirement or otherwise, reflects an intentional choice that this Court should not disturb. \nBy comparison, other statutes express a different legislative choice. For example, in Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900, the text of the duty at issue required the employer to inspect every work place controlled by the employer (para. 9, citing s. 125(1) of the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2). Thus, Parliament explicitly decided that the employers duty should be triggered by the employers control over the workplace. Similarly, in R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, the foundational case setting out the structure of regulatory offences, the relevant offence was discharging or depositing, or causing or permitting the discharge or deposit of, material of any kind into a water course. This Court interpreted the actus reus of the offence of causing the discharge of material as incorporating a control element (p. 1329). No similar language can be found in s. 25(1)(c). This indicates that a different legislative choice was made by the Ontario legislature.\nThe language that the legislature chose to use in s. 25(1)(c)  namely, the use of the word ensure  also speaks to and supports the broad nature of this duty. In Wyssen, Blair J.A. noted that the dictionary definition of ensure, as it appeared in the predecessor to s. 25(1)(c), is to make certain (p. 198). This duty puts an employer virtually in the position of an insurer who must make certain that the prescribed regulations for safety in the workplace have been complied with before work is undertaken by either employees or independent contractors (p. 198). This sweeping, undeniably strict and non-delegable duty cannot be evaded by contracting out performance of the work to independent contractors (p. 198).\nThe strict nature of this duty also led the Court of Appeal to reject reading a mens rea requirement into s. 25(1)(c) (Timminco, at paras. 22-26). Clear language, like the words wilfully, with intent, knowingly or intentionally, would be necessary to view s. 25(1)(c) as a mens rea offence (Timminco, at para. 26). That the legislature instead used the word ensure suggests that [it] intended to impose a strict duty on the employer to make certain that the prescribed safety standards were complied with at all material times (Timminco, at para. 26). For the same reasons that reading in a mens rea element would be inappropriate, a control requirement cannot be read into s. 25(1)(c). \nThis conclusion about the text of s. 25(1)(c) is further supported by this Courts reasoning in West Fraser Mills Ltd. v. British Columbia (Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal), 2018 SCC 22, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 635, which considered the interpretation of employer in s. 196(1) of British Columbias Workers Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 492. The workplace owner, West Fraser Mills, hired an independent contractor, and one of the contractors employees was killed in a workplace accident. The Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia determined that West Fraser Mills had breached its regulatory duty as an owner under s. 26.2(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation, B.C. Reg. 296/97, by failing to ensure that all activities of the forestry operation are both planned and conducted in a manner consistent with this Regulation and with safe work practices acceptable to the Board. It then imposed a penalty under s. 196(1) of the enabling statute, which permits the Board to penalize an employer. West Fraser Mills was seen as an employer, in addition to being an owner, because it employed individuals to carry out the duties imposed by s. 26.2(1) of the regulation in relation to the worksite in question. \nOn appeal, this Court determined that the Tribunals decision was not patently unreasonable (para. 32). The Tribunal had broadly interpreted West Fraser Mills duties as an employer under s. 196(1) as relating to the worksite at issue. An actual connection to the specific accident at issue existed between West Fraser Mills as the employer and the worksite that led to the accident and injury, even though there was no employment relationship with the person injured (para. 39 (emphasis in original)). This interpretation aligned with s. 196(1)s text, which focus[ed] not on the specific relationship between the impugned employer and the victim of a workplace accident, but on the relationship between the employer and the worksite that led to the accident and injury (para. 45). \nAs with s. 196(1) of the British Columbia statute, the text of s. 25(1)(c) of the Ontario Act concerns occupational health and safety measures present at a physical workplace location to which an employer may be connected by virtue of sending employees there or contracting with independent contractors to perform work there. It states that the measures prescribed in the Regulation must be followed at that location. It does not focus on the nature of the employers relationship with any particular individual. Crucially, it does not focus on whether that relationship is characterized by control. Because of its language, s. 25(1)(c) cannot be read as applying only when an employer has a degree of control over someone. \nContext\nThe duty in s. 25(1)(c) must be understood in the context of the scheme of the Act, including other duties contained therein, the wide definition of employer, and the existence of a due diligence defence under s. 66(3)(b). \nTo begin, and to state the obvious, s. 25 imposes various, differently worded duties on employers. Some are drafted narrowly. For example, ss. 25(1)(b) and 25(1)(d) create duties respecting the equipment, materials, and protective devices provided by the employer. Similarly, the duty on workers set out in s. 28(1)(b) to use or wear equipment, protective devices, or clothing is restricted to the items that the workers employer requires to be used or worn. This juxtaposition of narrow duties with the more broadly worded s. 25(1)(c) does not suggest that s. 25(1)(c)s duty is implicitly narrow. Rather, the narrower provisions show that the legislature intentionally limited some duties (such as s. 25(1)(b) and (d)) to the relationship between an employer and a worker, whereas other duties, including s. 25(1)(c), were intentionally drafted broadly so as to focus on the employers connection to the workplace rather than any particular worker (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at pp. 249-52). The legislatures choice ought to be respected, and there is no need to read down or read into s. 25(1)(c)s explicitly expansive text.\nSecond, the broad definition of employer is relevant context for interpreting s. 25(1)(c). The breadth of the employers duties and the broad scope of the definition of employer are mutually reinforcing. Narrowing s. 25(1)(c) by reading a control requirement into it runs contrary to Wyssen and the modern approach to statutory interpretation. \nThough my colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. and I agree that the City is an employer under the Act and that control is not relevant to the definition of employer, we diverge in our interpretation of s. 25(1)(c). They would read a control requirement into this duty, such that it only applies to employers where there is a functional relationship between the measure and the employer (para. 106), which they describe as a nexus to the work which is under the employers control and performed through their workers (para. 155). Incorporating control by requiring a nexus between an employer and activities under the employers control is inconsistent with the text, context, and purpose of the section and with Wyssen. While the interpretation of ss. 1(1) and 25(1)(c) raises separate questions, these sections should be read harmoniously as they are nonetheless related. \nIn Wyssen, Blair J.A. observed that the breadth of the employers duties under what is now s. 25(1)(c) corroborated the breadth of the definition of employer (p. 198). The broad nature of one goes hand in hand with the broad nature of the other. Yet, while my colleagues purport to follow Wyssen by leaving the definition broad, in fact they depart from Wyssen by narrowing the employers duties. In doing so, they introduce an internal inconsistency into the Act by pairing a broad definition of employer with a narrow interpretation of s. 25(1)(c), rather than finding harmony between these provisions and treating them as mutually reinforcing as the legislature intended. Wyssen observed that the legislature expanded the definition of employer to capture employer-independent contractor relationships that are not characterized by control; reading control into s. 25(1)(c) thus creates a dissonance in the Act that undermines legislative intention by reintroducing a previously discarded control element into the new widely worded public welfare legislation. \nThird, the existence of the due diligence defence in s. 66(3)(b) of the Act is relevant context because it means that employers who breach s. 25(1)(c) will not be subject to penalties under the Act if they can show they took all reasonable steps to avoid the breach. Section 66(3)(b) therefore functions as a safety valve, in which the presence of control may be a factor in assessing due diligence. As a result, there is no justification for narrowing the offence under s. 25(1)(c) by overlaying a control requirement. Concerns about fairness are answered by the availability and content of this defence. \nPurpose\nReading a control requirement into s. 25(1)(c) would also be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act. The Act, to repeat, is a public welfare statute. Its purpose is to maintain and promote a reasonable level of protection for the health and safety of workers in and about their workplace. This purpose is achieved through the imposition of shared and overlapping duties: the belt and braces regulatory strategy. \nA clear example of this approach is found in the overlap between a constructors and employers duties. Section 23(1)(a) requires constructors to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed by this Act and the regulations are carried out on the project, mirroring the employers duty under s. 25(1)(c). This overlap is explicit and intentional. Indeed, s. 23(1)(b) requires constructors to ensure that every employer . . . performing work on the project complies with this Act and the regulations. It is entirely in keeping with the regulatory structure and strategy that the Act deploys to achieve worker safety for an employer to have duties that reciprocally overlap with the duties of a constructor irrespective of these entities respective degrees of control over a workplace or a hazard there. Similarly, the required expansive and generous interpretation of the Act means that there may also be more than one employer who is responsible for the safety of the workplace and workers. \nConcern that overlapping duties will create confusion because different actors may not coordinate with each other and may implement competing or inconsistent safety measures is unwarranted. Cooperation and communication between workplace actors is built into the Acts scheme (United Independent Operators, at para. 55, citing the Ministrys Guide to The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1978, at p. 28; see also West Fraser Mills, at para. 43). The Act also incentivizes such behaviour: where actors fail to cooperate and communicate, it is less likely that they will be able to successfully mount a due diligence defence. For example, in London Excavators, a subcontractor on a construction project was unable to establish the due diligence defence because of its unreasonable reliance on a general contractors miscommunication about the location of a hazard (p. 40). \nHowever, reading in a control requirement could defeat the Acts public welfare purpose of creating overlapping responsibility. Often, workplace actors will have varying degrees of control over a workplace. Some will have more control than others without having exclusive control (Director of Occupational Health and Safety v. Government of Yukon, William R. Cratty and P.S. Sidhu Trucking Ltd., 2012 YKSC 47, at para. 69 (CanLII)). This variance matters. Incorporating a control element into s. 25(1)(c) would essentially give workplace actors a tool for frustrating regulatory prosecutions at the outset, before the burden shifts to the accused to demonstrate due diligence under s. 66(3)(b), by arguing that they had no control over a hazard because other parties had greater comparative control over that hazard. We cannot ignore this practical, on-the-ground reality, which, if permitted to prevail, would not be conducive to promoting workplace safety. Rather, it would undermine the belt and braces approach by turning prosecutions under the Act into a finger pointing exercise. As Gotlib J. explained in Structform, at para. 17:\nThe case law is clear that one employer cannot point a finger at another employer who might be closer to the situation. Every employer has a duty to see that the workplace is safe. And in the complexity of construction it is important that every employer use knowledge, due diligence, etc., to ensure that the workplace is safe. An employer is not entitled to say it is someone elses responsibility.\nThe point is not that it is prohibitively difficult for a court to ascertain whether control exists or to even assess comparative degrees of control. The point is that situating the assessment of control under the Ministrys burden to prove the s. 25(1)(c) offence is incongruous with the Acts public welfare objectives. The focus at the breach stage would move from safety, where it belongs, to parsing who actually controlled what. Creating a control requirement under s. 25(1)(c) is impractical as it is the employer, not the Ministry, who has the best knowledge and evidence about their level of control (Sault Ste. Marie, at p. 1325). It is also inefficient as requiring the Ministry to prove control defeats the objective of achieving administrative expediency through the use of strict liability regulatory offences (Sault Ste. Marie, at p. 1311). These problems are precisely what led the Court of Appeal to reject a mens rea requirement under s. 25(1)(c) (Timminco, at paras. 24-26). \nIt is unnecessarily duplicative to situate an inquiry into the accuseds degree of control under both the Ministrys burden and the accuseds burden of establishing due diligence. Even where the language of an offence in a public welfare statute makes control an explicit condition, it is sometimes difficult to maintain the distinction between the actus reus and the defence of due diligence (R. v. Dan Gamache Trucking Inc., 2005 BCSC 1487, 23 M.V.R. (5th) 305, at para. 13). Far from clarifying the role of control in prosecutions under the Act, actively reading it into an offence like s. 25(1)(c), whose text makes no mention of control, invites further confusion about the proper place of control and what analytical differences there are between the Ministrys burden to prove control and the accuseds burden to prove a lack of control. Introducing this additional complexity into proceedings under the Act undercuts the goal of administrative efficiency. By contrast, considering control only under due diligence, where its relevance is entirely uncontroversial, indeed common, offers much-needed clarity and predictability. I return to the due diligence defence below.\nFinally, it advances the Acts purpose to impose an employers duties on the owner of a construction project even if that owner has divested control to a constructor. My colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. argue that the Act intentionally leaves owners who hire constructors with limited responsibilities (paras. 100-102 and 119-25). But, while s. 29(1) imposes duties on owners of workplaces that are not projects, this provision does not suggest that project owners are absolved of statutory duties if they devolve control to a constructor. These duties simply do not apply to project owners; however, project owner duties set out in s. 30 do apply to the project owner regardless of whether they hire a constructor. Moreover, a constructor under s. 1(1) is defined as including an owner who undertakes all or part of a project by himself. It is thus not the case that on every construction project an independent contractor is the constructor with overall safety responsibility; the constructor may simply be the owner, if the owner undertakes a project alone. \nMost importantly, even where an owner gives up control to a constructor, that same owner can have duties as an employer that may at times overlap with the constructors duties. While s. 1(3) prevents an owner who sends inspectors to a worksite from becoming a constructor, it does not prevent the owner from being an employer. And, there is a connection between increased remedies against owners who hold duties as employers for given workplaces and increased occupational health and safety. The general scheme of the Act is to hold both owners and employers responsible in an overlapping and cooperative way for ensuring worksite safety (West Fraser Mills, at para. 43). This conclusion does not undermine the fact that the Act places overall authority with a constructor. Indeed, guidelines published by the Ministry provide that, even though a constructor is the party with the greatest control over a construction project, [h]ealth and safety at a project are a shared responsibility [such that] each employer at a project has significant responsibilities for the health and safety of their workers (Constructor guideline, February 11, 2022 (online)). Occupational health and safety legislation does not create distinct silos of responsibility for different actors, nor for different sectors or industries (West Fraser Mills, at para. 15), and this sharing of responsibilities is simply another manifestation of the belt and braces approach.\nThe City Breached Its Duties as an Employer\nAs an employer of the inspectors and of Interpaving, the City was required by s. 25(1)(c) of the Act to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed [were] carried out in the workplace. This included ensuring compliance with ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation. On the date of the pedestrians death, the measures required by these provisions  a fence between the construction work and the public way, and signallers  were not carried out in the workplace. Thus, the City, as employer, committed the offence under s. 25(1)(c) and its degree of control over the workplace or the workers is not relevant to this finding. \nHaving determined that the City was in breach of the Act, I turn to the due diligence defence.\nThe Defences Burden: Proving Due Diligence\nOnce the Ministry establishes a breach of the employers duty under s. 25(1)(c), the burden shifts to the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that every precaution reasonable in the circumstances was taken pursuant to s. 66(3)(b) (see Timminco, at paras. 22-26; see also Sault Ste. Marie, at pp. 1324-25). I note that the common law defence of due diligence also remains available for strict liability offences under the Act that are not listed in s. 66(3) (see R. v. Bradsil 1967 Ltd., [1994] O.J. No. 837 (QL), 1994 CarswellOnt 4450 (WL) (C.J. (Prov. Div.)), at para. 16, citing R. v. Cancoil Thermal Corp. and Parkinson (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 295 (Ont. C.A.)). It is therefore open to the City to escape liability by proving that it exercised due diligence. I begin by explaining why control should only be considered at this stage of the analysis, before turning to how control ought to be considered. \nAn Employers Control Should Be Considered Only as Part of the Due Diligence Defence\nConsidering control at the due diligence stage respects the text, context and purpose of the Act and best upholds its purpose of promoting workplace safety. Though a person convicted under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act may be liable to fines and/or imprisonment (s. 66(1) and (2)), a breach of s. 25(1)(c) is not a criminal offence, but rather a strict liability regulatory offence. Its goal is not to condemn and punish past, inherently wrongful conduct, but to preven[t] . . . future harm through the enforcement of minimum standards of conduct and care (R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at p. 219; see also Wilson v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles), 2015 SCC 47, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 300, at para. 33; La Souveraine, Compagnie dassurance generale v. Autorite des marches financiers, 2013 SCC 63, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 756, at para. 90). The legislatures choice to impose liability upon an employer, even absent a connection to or control over an activity, was driven not by a desire to express opprobrium of inherently blameworthy conduct but by a desire to modify behaviour and reduce the risk of workplace injury. The nature and purpose of strict liability offences means that stigma will not attach to employers who are found to have breached s. 25(1)(c) of the Act. Rather, shifting the burden to the employer to establish a due diligence defence incentivizes employers to take all steps within their control to achieve workplace safety and prevent future harm so that they may avail themselves of the defence should harm occur. \nThat an employers degree of control over other parties in the workplace is relevant to its due diligence defence also answers fairness concerns about imposing liability on an employer for a breach caused by another party. Considering control under due diligence means employers lacking control may escape liability. Placing the burden of establishing a lack of control on the employer is logical and preferable, as the employer is best positioned to adduce evidence of its levels of control, expertise, knowledge, and skill. It is not unfair or absurd to shift the burden of proof and costs of proving lack of control to an accused. In Wyssen, Finlayson J.A., concurring in the result only, raised fairness concerns that were reprised by the City in this appeal. These concerns were rightly rejected as unpersuasive by the majority in Wyssen and the unanimous Court of Appeal in the case at bar. They simply do not support reading a control requirement into provisions without one, especially when control plays a role at the due diligence stage. \nIn this appeal, no one argues that ss. 1(1) or 25(1)(c) are unconstitutional. While in Wyssen Finlayson J.A. also suggested that the definition of employer was overbroad (at pp. 202-3), the matter was later argued and rejected in R. v. Grant Forest Products Inc. (2002), 98 C.R.R. (2d) 149 (Ont. C.J.), at para. 55, revd on other grounds 2003 CarswellOnt 6071 (WL) (S.C.J.). The court found that overbreadth concerns are of limited concern given that the Act is public welfare legislation that enacts strict liability regulatory offences, not criminal offences, and given that the employer duties are subject to a due diligence defence (paras. 53 and 55). As Belanger J. observed: \nWithout doubt, the breadth of the legislation is onerous and may have negative consequences relating to cost and economic feasibility of any particular endeavour or enterprise, but it does not unfairly deprive owner/contractors of the means to advance successful defences when they have attended diligently to their responsibilities. [para. 57]\nThis observation answers the Citys submissions in this appeal. Existing jurisprudence on the interpretation of the Act and the nature of strict liability offences contain all that is needed to affirm the conclusion of the Court of Appeal below. It is unnecessary to revisit or reverse that jurisprudence here.\nAdditionally, though my colleagues Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. point to hypotheticals that they say demonstrate the absurdity of leaving control to due diligence (at paras. 137-39), a close examination of the statutory scheme dispels any such absurdity. First, the hypothetical concerning the caterer fails to appreciate that an employers duties under s. 25(1)(c) are limited to the workplace. A workplace is a distinct definition from a construction project (s. 1(1)) and refers to a place where a worker is or can reasonably be expected to be carrying out their employment duties at the time an incident occurs (Blue Mountain Resorts Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Labour), 2013 ONCA 75, 114 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 57). It seems unlikely that the caterers workplace would span the entirety of the construction project, such that the caterer would necessarily be charged and found liable in the event of a breach. \nSecond, the remaining hypotheticals fail to appreciate that the employer is an employer by virtue of contracting for the services of the constructor who is present at the project. When this layer of the employer definition is kept in mind, the absurdity of the hypotheticals falls away. The employers potential liability is not tied to the simple act of sending an inspector to a project. Rather, they are already possibly liable because they are the employer who has deployed a constructor on the project. Indeed, the employer is likely well served by sending an inspector to the project, since, as discussed below, this may well demonstrate that they were duly diligent in hiring and supervising the constructor. As a result, the concern that the risk of liability would dissuade the hypothetical employer from sending inspectors is unwarranted. \nHow an Employers Control Informs the Due Diligence Defence \nThough I am remitting the issue of the Citys due diligence to the provincial offences appeal court, I turn now to how courts may assess this defence and how an employers level of control informs the analysis. \nThat the employers level of control over workers or the workplace is relevant to the due diligence defence is well recognized in existing authorities. As set out in R. v. Gonder (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 326 (Y. Terr. Ct.), at pp. 332-33:\nReasonable care implies a scale of caring. The reasonableness of the care is inextricably related to the special circumstances of each case. A variable standard of care is necessary to ensure the requisite flexibility to raise or lower the requirements of care in accord with the special circumstances of each factual setting. The degree of care warranted in each case is principally governed by the following circumstances:\n\n(a) Gravity of potential harm.\n(b) Alternatives available to the accused.\n(c) Likelihood of harm.\n(d) Degree of knowledge or skill expected of the accused.\n(e) Extent [to which] underlying causes of the offence are beyond the control of the accused.\nGonder has been followed by courts across Canada when applying the due diligence defence under occupational health and safety legislation (see, e.g., London Excavators, at p. 37; R. v. Inco Ltd., [2001] O.J. No. 4938 (QL), 2001 CarswellOnt 10933 (WL) (C.J.), at para. 39 (QL); Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Linamar Holdings Inc., 2012 ONCJ 295, at para. 112 (CanLII); Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Wal-Mart Canada Corp., 2016 ONCJ 267, 32 C.C.E.L. (4th) 313, at para. 123; R. v. Imperial Electric Ltd., 1998 CarswellBC 4085 (WL) (Prov. Ct.), at para. 37; R. v. Amherst Fabricators Ltd., [2003] N.S.J. No. 280 (QL) (Prov. Ct.), at para. 9; R. v. XI Technologies Inc., 2011 ABPC 313, at para. 201 (CanLII)).\nI agree that the [e]xtent [to which] underlying causes of the offence are beyond the control of the accused is a relevant factor. The fact-finder should assess, either in absolute or comparative terms, whether an employer had control over the worker and the workplace. Control is also an implicit consideration in assessing what alternatives were available to the accused (J. Stoller, at paras. 22-24; Campbell, at para. 68; J. Swaigen and S. McRory, Regulatory Offences In Canada: Liability and Defences (2nd ed. 2018), at pp. 123-28). Indeed, [r]easonableness of care is often best measured by comparing what was done against what could have been done (Gonder, at p. 333 (emphasis added)). What could have been done is necessarily limited to steps or measures that are within the workplace actors control and thus capable of being carried out. \nIn the construction context, it may be open to a judge to find that the owner took every reasonable precaution because the owner decided to delegate control of the project and responsibility for workplace safety to a more experienced constructor. Relevant considerations might include whether the owner pre-screened the constructor before hiring the constructor to ascertain, for example, whether the constructor has superior expertise, a track record free of prior convictions for breach of the Act, and the capacity to ensure compliance with the Act and the Regulation (Grant Forest Products, at para. 54; D. McKechnie, Occupational Health and Safety in Construction Law, in L. Ricchetti and T. J. Murphy, Construction Law in Canada (2010), 209, at pp. 219-20). An owner may argue that its relative inexperience with workplace safety was why it chose to delegate control over a project to a more sophisticated constructor. \nAnother consideration might be whether after executing the contract the owner informed the constructor of any hazards at the workplace and monitored the quality of the constructors work (indeed, the trial judge placed weight on the fact that the City supervised Interpavings work) (McKechnie, at pp. 219-20). As well, a court could find that a municipality, such as the City, has the ability to require its contractors to uphold health and safety requirements on a project, since it is in a position to control those whom it hires . . . and to supervise the activity, either through the provisions of the contract or by municipal by-laws (Sault Ste. Marie, at p. 1331).\nOnce again, this guidance is not novel. Supervision and inspection have long been seen as sensible steps to take when considering whether that person can avail themselves of the due diligence defence. Put simply, the Act does not capture within its ambit owners and employers who have exercised due diligence in their choice and supervision of contractors (Grant Forest Products, at para. 57). Hence, categorizing the City as an employer in breach of s. 25(1)(c) of the Act because it sent inspectors to the worksite to monitor Interpavings work does not condemn the City for supervising Interpaving or otherwise discourage it from doing so. Those efforts may well assist the City in establishing due diligence and escaping liability.\nIn addition to control, the accuseds degree of knowledge, skill or experience and the gravity and likelihood of harm (i.e., the foreseeability of the accident) are all relevant to whether the accused took every precaution reasonable in the circumstances (R. v. Rio Algom Ltd. (1988), 66 O.R. (2d) 674 (C.A.), at p. 682; R. v. Brampton Brick Ltd. (2004), 189 O.A.C. 44, at para. 29). An accuseds relative inexperience might support a finding that the accident was unforeseeable, at least from its standpoint.\nSummary\nIn summary, a court must consider three questions where an owner who contracts for the services of a constructor on a construction project is prosecuted for a breach of s. 25(1)(c):\nFirst, has the Ministry proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Act applied to the accused because the accused was an employer under s. 1(1) of the Act? An owner is an employer if it (i) employed workers at a workplace where an alleged breach of s. 25(1)(c) occurred; or (ii) contracted for the services of a worker at that workplace (including for the services of a constructor). The Ministry is not required to prove that the owner had control over the workplace or the workers there.\n\nSecond, has the Ministry proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused breached s. 25(1)(c) of the Act? There is a breach of s. 25(1)(c) if the safety measures prescribed by the Regulation are not carried out in the workplace to which the owner/employer is connected by a contractual relationship with employees or an independent contractor. Further, the Ministry is not required to prove that the owner had control over the workplace or the workers there.\n\nThird, if the Ministry proves the above, has the accused proven on a balance of probabilities that it should avoid liability because it exercised due diligence under s. 66(3)(b) of the Act? Relevant considerations may include, but are not limited to, (i) the accuseds degree of control over the workplace or the workers there; (ii) whether the accused delegated control to the constructor in an effort to overcome its own lack of skill, knowledge or expertise to complete the project in compliance with the Regulation; (iii) whether the accused took steps to evaluate the constructors ability to ensure compliance with the Regulation before deciding to contract for its services; and (iv) whether the accused effectively monitored and supervised the constructors work on the project to ensure that the prescriptions in the Regulation were carried out in the workplace.\nConclusion\nI would dismiss the appeal. I affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal to remit the matter to the provincial offences appeal court for hearing before a different judge to consider the Ministrys appeal of the Citys due diligence defence with respect to counts 8 and 9 of the information.\n\tThe reasons of Karakatsanis, Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. were delivered by\n\t\tRowe and OBonsawin JJ.  \nOverview\nThe appellant, the Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury (City), contracted with Interpaving Limited (Interpaving) to repair a water main and repave the affected streets. It also sent quality control inspectors to the construction project, who raised safety concerns to Interpaving. Later, a pedestrian was killed at an intersection after several regulatory provisions aimed at protecting public safety were not respected. The City was charged as both a constructor and an employer; it argued that it did not satisfy either definition. On appeal, the only question is whether the City could be liable for breaching its duties as an employer.\nThis appeal provides the Court with an opportunity to clarify the definition and the duties of an employer in Ontarios Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (Act). While this Court is tasked with interpreting particular provisions within the Act (namely ss. 1(1) and 25(1)(c)) and its accompanying regulation, Construction Projects, O. Reg. 213/91 (Regulation) (namely ss. 65 and 104(3)), we must not lose sight of the careful structure of the scheme as a whole. The Act and its accompanying Regulation constitute an integrated scheme which contains protections for workers that are effective in practice and reflective of the reality of modern workplace dynamics. \nIn the reasons that follow, we seek to further these aims by establishing the meaning and scope of the definition and duties of employers in the construction context. In our view, a clear understanding of who is an employer, and which regulatory measures apply to them, is critical to preserving the integrity of the overall scheme. It is also critical to respecting the legislative purpose of promoting worker safety in practice  while guarding against absurd results and, in particular, unbridled ministerial discretion that would leave the scope of an employers responsibilities to be resolved ex post facto.\nIn light of the foregoing, we conclude that the definition of employer in s. 1(1) of the Act encompasses the Citys relationship with its quality control inspectors. As an employer of the quality control inspectors, the scope of the Citys duties under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act must be examined. Properly interpreted, s. 25(1)(c) holds employers liable for breaching the regulatory measures which apply to them. The present appeal involves measures contained within the Regulation. Having considered the text of the regulatory measures, the structure of the Regulation, its relationship to the division of roles within the Act, and the purposes of the scheme as a whole, we conclude that where certain measures in the Regulation do not specify to whom they apply, these measures apply to an employer when they relate to the work that the employer controlled and performed through their workers. As the courts below did not properly analyze whether the breach was made out, we would remit the matter for reconsideration by the Ontario Court of Justice at the duties stage.\nFacts\nThe facts are not in dispute. In February 2015, the City entered into a contract with Interpaving to undertake a construction project in downtown Greater Sudbury. The contract stipulated that Interpaving would assume control over the entire project, including the role of constructor under the Act as well as the responsibility of ensuring that the requirements of the Act and the Regulation were met. In September 2015, a pedestrian who was attempting to cross an intersection within the construction zone was fatally struck by a Caterpillar grader being driven in reverse by an Interpaving employee. \nThe respondent, the Ministry of the Attorney General (Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development) (Ministry), charged Interpaving and the City under the Act for failing to ensure that certain requirements of the Regulation had been met. The City was charged as a constructor and an employer under the Act for breaches of ss. 65, 67(4), and 104(3) of the Regulation. Section 65 states that [i]f work on a project may endanger a person using a public way, a sturdy fence of at least 1.8 meters in height shall be constructed between the public way and the [construction] project. Section 67(4) provides that [e]very employer shall develop in writing and implement a traffic protection plan for the employers workers at a project if any of them may be exposed to a hazard from vehicular traffic. Finally, s. 104(3) states that vehicle, machine, and equipment operators shall be assisted by signallers if the operators view is obstructed or [a] person could be endangered by the vehicle, machine, or equipment or by its load.\nOn appeal, the only charges in issue pertain to the Citys alleged status as an employer and its liability under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act for the breach of ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation. At the Court of Appeal, the Ministry conceded that the trial judge had not made the necessary factual findings to determine guilt of the alleged breach of s. 67(4) regarding the traffic protection plan.\nJudgments Below\nOntario Court of Justice\nThe trial judge acquitted the City of all charges by finding that the City was neither a constructor nor an employer within the meaning of the Act. Alternatively, if the City was an employer, she found that the City had established the due diligence defence. On the issue of whether the City was liable as an employer, the trial judge determined that the City did not have control of the conduct of the workplace to bring it within the obligations intended or created by the [Act] for employers (para. 87, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 17). The City did not supervise the construction work; nor was it directing the work. Rather, it contracted for the services of Interpaving, which had the relevant knowledge and resources to execute the work. Although the Citys inspectors were at the construction project from time to time, the quality control inspectors were subject to the constructors requirements concerning health and safety. Rather than being supervisors on the project, their role was limited to quality control  ensuring that work was performed in accordance with the contractual arrangements so that payments could be made. The trial judge observed that the punitive sections of the [Act] are intended to make accountable those who do not comply with the provisions of the [Act] and its Regulation in the sphere of operation (para. 88). Thus, the Citys involvement as an owner seeking to ensure quality control fell outside this purpose.\nOntario Superior Court of Justice, 2019 ONSC 3285, 88 M.P.L.R. (5th) 158\nThe Ministry appealed the acquittals to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The provincial offences appeal court judge endorsed the reasoning of the trial judge and found no errors in her application of the facts to the definitions of constructor and employer. He therefore dismissed the appeal and agreed that the City did not exercise control over the project site such that it became the constructor. As to whether the City was an employer by virtue of having quality control inspectors on the project, the provincial offences appeal court judge noted that this was not contemplated by the parties and that adopting the Ministrys approach would substantially change the occupational health and safety liability regime governing construction projects in Ontario. He concluded that the Ministry had not proven that the City exercised significant control over workers on the site. Accordingly, the trial judge properly found that the City was not an employer on site under the Act.\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario, 2021 ONCA 252, 15 M.P.L.R. (6th) 161\nThe Ministry was granted leave to appeal by Brown J.A. of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, but only with respect to the acquittals relating to the charges against the City as an employer under the Act (2019 ONCA 854, 93 M.P.L.R. (5th) 179). Given that municipalities often contract out work on construction projects to a third party, Brown J.A. was satisfied that whether a municipality is liable as an employer by reason of the degree of control it exercises raises a question of law of interest to the public at large.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the Ministrys appeal. It concluded that because the City employed quality control inspectors as workers at the project site within the meaning of employer in s. 1(1) of the Act, it was liable for violations of the Regulation unless it could establish a due diligence defence. The Court of Appeal recognized that the definition of employer covered two relationships  first, that of a person who employs a worker, and second, that of one who contracts for the services of a worker  but that this appeal could be resolved according to the first relationship. As a result, the Court of Appeal concluded that it was not necessary to address the element of control  even though Brown J.A. had granted leave on precisely this issue. It noted that although s. 1(3) of the Act prevents an owner from becoming a constructor by engaging a quality control inspector, it does not preclude an owner from becoming an employer. Finally, the Court of Appeal concluded that the appropriate remedy was to set aside the provincial offences appeal court judges decision and remit only the alleged breaches of ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation to the Superior Court of Justice to hear the Ministrys appeal of the Citys due diligence defence.\nIssues\nThe Court must decide whether the City is liable as an employer for the breach of ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation. To do so, we must examine the following two issues:\nIs the City an employer under s. 1(1) of the Act?\nDo ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation apply to the City as an employer through the operation of s. 25(1)(c) of the Act?\nThe courts below proceeded on the assumption that once a party meets the definition of employer, they are strictly liable for the breach of any regulatory provision through the operation of s. 25(1)(c) and must rely on the due diligence defence. With respect, such an approach conflates the definition of employer with the determination of the scope of an employers duties. On a proper construction of the scheme, it is essential to examine both the definition of the workplace parties and the duties that actually apply to them. An offence cannot be founded on the breach of a duty that does not apply to the accused.\nAnalysis\nBefore turning to the facts of this case, we provide a brief overview of the Act as a whole. Then, we turn to identifying and explaining the three distinct stages of an inquiry to establish a breach of an employers duties under the scheme. First, we examine the definition of employer under s. 1(1), since the parties dispute whether the City is an employer under the Act and if so, under which branch of the definition (definition stage). Second, we trace the scope of each employers duties under s. 25(1)(c) and the Regulation, as the applicability of prescribed measures to an employer is essential to determining the elements of an offence under the Act (duties stage). Finally, we briefly consider the due diligence defence under s. 66(3) of the Act in order to contrast the nature of the inquiry at the offence and defence stages (due diligence stage). This analytical approach is consistent with the structure of the scheme and promotes a cohesive reading of the schemes enabling statute and regulations.\nThe usual principles of statutory interpretation, as set out in our jurisprudence, offer guidance in this exercise: . . . the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87, cited in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21). The Ontario Legislation Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c. 21, Sch. F, also applies to the Act:\n64 (1) An Act shall be interpreted as being remedial and shall be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.\nBefore analyzing the definition and duties of employers, it is useful to begin with an overview of the Act in order to understand how it operates. \nThe Occupational Health and Safety Scheme\nDuring the 1970s, Ontario overhauled its workplace safety legislation following the release of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Health and Safety of Workers in Mines (1976), better known as the Ham Report. The result of this reform was to replace a patchwork of legislation, including The Industrial Safety Act, 1964, S.O. 1964, c. 45, with the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which came into force in 1979 (S. R. Ball, Canadian Employment Law (loose-leaf), at  25:1; R. v. Cotton Felts Ltd. (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 287 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 294).\nThe Act sets out the rights and duties of all parties in the workplace, as well as the procedures for dealing with workplace hazards and for enforcement of the law where compliance has not been achieved voluntarily by workplace parties. Since 1979, the Act has been amended several times to evolve with changing standards of workplace health and safety, while maintaining a system of internal responsibility in which all workplace parties are given responsibilities for health and safety (see Ontario (Minister of Labour) v. Enbridge Gas Distribution Inc., 2010 ONSC 2013, 261 O.A.C. 27, at para. 24). The internal responsibility system is designed to promote coordinated and collaborative relationships between the different workplace parties (Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. United Independent Operators Ltd., 2011 ONCA 33, 104 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 55). Although the purpose of Ontarios Act is not expressly included within the statute, it has been judicially considered in the past. In Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Hamilton (City) (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 37 (C.A.), Sharpe J.A. explained that the Act is a remedial public welfare statute intended to guarantee a minimum level of protection for the health and safety of workers (para. 16). Similarly, in R. v. Timminco Ltd. (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 21, Osborne A.C.J.O. stated that [t]he broad purpose of the statute is to maintain and promote a reasonable level of protection for the health and safety of workers in and about their workplace (para. 22). This purpose has been affirmed recently by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Bondfield Construction Co., 2022 ONCA 302, at para. 59 (CanLII).\nIn terms of structure, the Act sets out definitions in s. 1(1) and outlines the application and administration of the Act in Parts I and II, including the creation of joint health and safety committees (s. 9). In Part III, the Act enumerates the health and safety duties of employers and other workplace parties. The Act also addresses a variety of workplace matters in Parts IV to VII, from the right to refuse or to stop work to the prohibition of employer reprisals. Finally, the Act provides for a system of enforcement action and offences and penalties in Parts VIII and IX. In particular, s. 66(1)(a) states that it is an offence for a person to contravene a provision of the Act or the regulations. The variety of duties contained within Ontarios scheme reflects the belt and braces approach to ensuring occupational health and safety, wherein the Act and Regulations use more than one method to ensure workers are protected (Enbridge, at para. 24).\nParticularly relevant to the present appeal are the definition of employer as set out in s. 1(1), the duty of employers in s. 25(1)(c) as well as the applicability of measures contained within the Regulation, and the function of the due diligence defence in s. 66(3). The interpretation of these provisions coincides with the three stages of an inquiry to establish a breach of an employers duties. It also requires the consideration of the definitions of workplace and project at s. 1(1), the duties of constructors at s. 23(1) and the duties of owners at ss. 29 to 30.\nThe definitions of various workplace parties, such as owners, employers, supervisors, workers, and constructors, are set out at the beginning of the Act. The definition of employer in s. 1(1) reads as follows:\nemployer means a person who employs one or more workers or contracts for the services of one or more workers and includes a contractor or subcontractor who performs work or supplies services and a contractor or subcontractor who undertakes with an owner, constructor, contractor or subcontractor to perform work or supply services; \nA worker is mainly defined as [a] person who performs work or supplies services for monetary compensation.\nIn the construction industry, the Ontario legislature has defined the role of constructor as follows:\nconstructor means a person who undertakes a project for an owner and includes an owner who undertakes all or part of a project by himself or by more than one employer; [s. 1(1)]\nThus, it is important to distinguish a general workplace from a project that exists in the construction context. Whereas a workplace is broadly defined as any land, premises, location or thing at, upon, in or near which a worker works, a project is defined in regard to construction as any work or undertaking, or any lands or appurtenances used in connection with construction (s. 1(1)). Further, although it is possible for a single person to satisfy multiple workplace party definitions, the Ontario legislature has stated that, in the construction industry, [a]n owner does not become a constructor by virtue only of the fact that the owner has engaged an architect, engineer or other person solely to oversee quality control at a project (s. 1(3)).\nOnce a workplace party is found to satisfy the relevant definition set out in s. 1(1) of the Act, it is necessary to then consider which duties actually applied to the party at the time of the alleged offence. The Act separately sets out the duties for each workplace party. The primary duties of a constructor are listed in s. 23(1) of the Act. They are threefold:\n23 (1) A constructor shall ensure, on a project undertaken by the constructor that,\n\nthe measures and procedures prescribed by this Act and the regulations are carried out on the project;\n\nevery employer and every worker performing work on the project complies with this Act and the regulations; and\n\nthe health and safety of workers on the project is protected.\nAs for employers, they are subject to a variety of duties in ss. 25 to 26 of the Act. These duties include providing, maintaining in good condition and using equipment, materials and protective devices (s. 25(1)(a), (b) and (d)), appointing competent supervisors (s. 25(2)(c)), cooperating with health and safety committees (s. 25(2)(e)), and taking every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker (s. 25(2)(h)), to name but a few. In addition, employers have a duty to comply with the regulations: \n25 (1) An employer shall ensure that,\n\n. . .\n\nthe measures and procedures prescribed are carried out in the workplace;\nThe measures and procedures prescribed are found in various regulations. At issue in this case is the Regulation, which contains approximately 400 provisions relating to all aspects of a construction project  from housekeeping, heat, dust control, and public way protection to platforms and ramps, stairs and landings, welding and cutting, and excavations.\nFinally, the Act provides for a defence of due diligence applicable to a limited number of duties at s. 66(3) (similar to the defence which exists at common law):\n(3) On a prosecution for a failure to comply with,\n\nsubsection 23(1);\n\nclause 25(1)(b), (c) or (d); or\n\nsubsection 27(1),\n\nit shall be a defence for the accused to prove that every precaution reasonable in the circumstances was taken.\nThus, on a prosecution for a failure to comply with ss. 23(1), 25(1)(b), (c) or (d) and 27(1), the accused can defend against the charges by proving that they took every precaution reasonable in the circumstances.\nThe Definition of Employer Under Section 1(1)\nThe parties arguments have focused on the definition of employer under s. 1(1) of the Act. In the following sections, we address the interpretation of the definition. The definition of employer in s. 1(1) covers two broad relationships. On the first branch, a person satisfies the definition of employer where they employ one or more workers. On the second branch, a person is an employer where they contract for the services of one or more workers (R. v. Wyssen (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 193 (C.A.), at p. 196).\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that it did not need to examine the second branch of the definition (at para. 15), because it determined that the City was the employer of the quality control inspectors under the first branch. With respect, we believe that both branches of the definition warrant discussion. The fact that a party is an employer does not mean that they are an employer to all workers at a workplace or project, which may affect the scope of their responsibilities. Indeed, when we apply the Act to the present appeal based on our analytical approach, we agree with the Court of Appeal that the City is the employer of its inspectors under the first branch of the definition of employer. However, the City is not the employer of the workers hired or contracted for by Interpaving under the second branch of the employer definition. The Citys relationship with Interpaving reflects an owner-constructor relationship, not an employer-worker relationship.\nThe First Branch Is Focused on Traditional Employment Relationships\nThe first branch of the definition is satisfied if a person employs one or more workers (s. 1(1)). It focuses on the employment contract (Wyssen, at p. 197) and reflects the traditional conception of a direct employer-employee relationship (D. McKechnie, Occupational Health and Safety in Construction Law, in L. Ricchetti and T. J. Murphy, Construction Law in Canada (2010), 209, at p. 211). In this way, its scope is relatively straightforward: as soon as a person hires a worker through a contract of employment, they meet the definition of employer under the first branch of the definition.\nIn support of its appeal, the City directed this Court to the decisions of Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Nor Eng Construction & Engineering Inc., 2008 ONCJ 296, and R. v. EFCO Canada Co., 2010 ONCJ 421. In Nor Eng, rehabilitation work was being performed on a bridge when the south end of the overpass collapsed. One of the charges alleged that an engineering firm failed, as an employer, to ensure that the temporary support structure that it undertook to design was able to support or resist all loads and forces to which it was likely to be subjected (s. 31(1)(a) of the Regulation; s. 25(1)(c) of the Act). Renaud J. admitted that he struggled to fit the defendant within this sections definition of employer (para. 88 (CanLII)), because the engineering firm had no ability to ensure that the measures were carried out. He noted that the engineering firm was removed geographically, temporally, contractually from the situation at the workplace and did not have sufficient or any control on the conduct of the workplace to bring it within the obligations intended and created by this legislation (paras. 88-89).\nSimilarly, in EFCO, a bridge under construction collapsed, injuring several workers. Alongside other counts, EFCO Canada Co. was charged with failing, as an employer, to ensure that its falsework  the supports and bracing used to support the structure  was capable of withstanding all loads (s. 87(1) of the Regulation; s. 25(1)(c) of the Act). Rabley J. determined that EFCO Canada Co. was not an employer within the meaning of the Act at the time of the building of the bridge. He echoed Renaud J.s analysis in Nor Eng, having found that EFCO Canada Co. had no control over the jobsite and that its falsework had been installed by other parties. Therefore, it was not an employer in the sphere of operation but a supplier of falsework (para. 60 (QL, WL)).\nIn both cases, the judges suggested that a party is not an employer if they have no control over the workplace in question. We decline to adopt such an approach, since it conflates the definition of employer with the scope of an employers duties under s. 25(1)(c). A narrow definition of employer would remove a party from all of their obligations under the Act, not merely those related to the workplace. As highlighted by the Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia, this includes a variety of important duties, such as the provisions which prohibit employers from taking reprisals against employees (s. 50 of the Act; I.F., at para. 14). It could not have been the legislatures intention for a party to be freed from all of their responsibilities towards individuals that they directly hired merely because they did not control the workplace.\nMoreover, the text of the definition of employer is expressly focused on a partys relationship to workers. It is inappropriate to narrow it by considering that partys relationship to a workplace. The latter relationship only becomes relevant at the stage of determining an employers duties. Accordingly, the first branch of the definition is satisfied where a traditional employment relationship exists.\nThe Second Branch Extends the Definition of Employer\nThe second branch of the definition involves a person who contracts for the services of one or more workers (s. 1(1)). This reflects the extended definition of an employer adopted by the legislature (McKechnie, at p. 211). A party is an employer not only if they directly employ one or more workers, but if they enter into a contract for the services of workers (Wyssen, at p. 196; Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Pioneer Construction Inc. (2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at para. 19). In Wyssen, Blair J.A. concluded that when a party engages an independent contractor to perform tasks, they become an employer under the second branch of the definition (pp. 197-98).\nThe wisdom contained in Wyssen is about ensuring that an employer cannot escape liability for the safety of their workplace due to a contractual label, and this wisdom endures today. The second branch prevents parties from removing themselves from the application of the Act where they subcontract out work, rather than directly hiring workers through an employment contract (Wyssen; Pioneer Construction, at para. 19; R. v. Sunderland Co-Operative, [1993] O.J. No. 4429 (QL), 1993 CarswellOnt 5741 (WL) (C.J. (Prov. Div.)); Tembec Forest Products (1990) Inc. (Re), [1994] O.O.H.S.A.D. No. 3 (QL)). In this way, it ensures that the substance of the employer-worker relationship is not determined by the manner in which it is described in the contract. This is particularly important in the construction field, as subcontracting and labour leasing arrangements have been a long-term feature of the industry (R. Johnstone, C. Mayhew and M. Quinlan, Outsourcing Risk? The Regulation of Occupational Health and Safety Where Subcontractors Are Employed (2001), 22 Comp. Lab. L. & Poly J. 351, at p. 391).\nIn the present appeal, we need not comprehensively examine the range of contractual relationships which would fall under the second branch, particularly on complex construction projects. Nor is it necessary to determine whether a degree of authority over a worker is required to be an employer (see, e.g., Abarquez v. Ontario, 2009 ONCA 374, 95 O.R. (3d) 414, at para. 33; Pioneer Construction, at para. 19). Although the second branch is extensive, we acknowledge that it does not capture every contractual relationship indirectly linking an employer to a worker. \nHowever, the present appeal raises the following question: Does an owner who retains a constructor to undertake a project automatically become an employer of workers hired or contracted for by that constructor? This question was not answered by Wyssen; indeed, the facts of Wyssen involved a contractor who subcontracted a window-cleaning job to an independent contractor rather than directly hiring workers. Blair J.A. was not required to interpret the distribution of duties among various workplace parties nor did he consider the owner-constructor relationship. Contrary to our colleague Martin J.s approach, we would thus answer the question in the negative (paras. 18 and 22).\nThe text of the second branch of the definition of employer refers to contract[ing] for the services of . . . workers. When an owner contracts with a constructor, they are not seeking to subcontract out particular tasks to any independent contractor instead of hiring workers directly through an employment contract; rather, they are asking an entity to assume plenary oversight and authority to undertake the entire project. The owner is contracting for a constructor, a party separately defined in s. 1(1). Thus, the owner-constructor relationship is a specific contractual relationship contemplated by the Act (R. v. Grant Forest Products Inc. (2002), 98 C.R.R. (2d) 149 (Ont. C.J.), at para. 32). This relationship reflects the practical reality of the construction industry, where owners promote safety by transferring responsibility to constructors with relevant expertise. That a constructor who supplies services may satisfy a strictly literal definition of worker under the Act belies the nature of the constructor as the entity overseeing workers; it must also, in our view, be reconciled with the legislatures deliberate choice to carve out a distinct owner-constructor relationship. Contrary to the view expressed by our colleague Martin J. (at para. 22), this relationship does not generally fall within the second branch of the employer definition in s. 1(1) in keeping with a basic rule of interpretation  implied exception (specialia generalibus non derogant)  in which a specific statutory provision prevails over a general statutory provision to the extent of any conflict (R. Sullivan, Statutory Interpretation (3rd ed. 2016), at pp. 327-28).\nThis reading of the text of s. 1(1) is confirmed by the statutory context. The Act is specifically designed so that an owner can take a hands-off approach to overseeing the project relative to the constructor. A constructor undertakes the project, which indicates that overall authority for the project, including the coordination of health and safety, falls to the constructor. Project owners have far fewer responsibilities, even compared to owners of other workplaces. For example, while owners of other workplaces must ensure that prescribed facilities are provided and maintained and that the workplace complies with the regulations, these duties do not apply to project owners (see ss. 29(1) and 30). This is because by contracting for a constructor, the owner is empowered to surrender control so that another workplace party can assume responsibility for overall health and safety (McKechnie, at p. 214; C. A. Edwards and R. J. Conlin, Employer Liability For Contractors Under The Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act (2nd ed. 2007), at p. 59; Grant Forest Products, at para. 32).\nIn fact, if the owner sought to retain an active role in activities on the project, they would run the risk of becoming the constructor themselves (Imperial Oil Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Labour) (1993), 10 C.O.H.S.C. 210 (Ont.), at paras. 13-17). The Act even sets out a limitation to ensure that an owner who sends persons to oversee quality control does not thereby become a constructor on the project (s. 1(3)). Of course, an owner who employs persons to perform this task is an employer to those workers. Yet the legislature felt the need to ensure that they did not thereby become a constructor by crafting a specific limitation. The Act is careful to ensure that the project owner can still oversee quality control, without being subjected to onerous duties relating to the project.\nHowever, treating an owner as automatically being an employer of the workers hired or contracted for by the constructor under the second branch of the employer definition would undermine the design of the scheme. It would mean that by virtue of engaging a constructor to oversee a project, project owners would be assigned responsibilities that would require them to play an active role across this project  a role that the Act sought to avoid by enabling them to contract with a constructor in the first place. Unlike the duties of project owners, employers duties towards their workers are onerous. For example, they must provide information, instruction, and supervision to workers (s. 25(2)(a)), assist and co-operate with a joint health and safety committee (s. 25(2)(e)), prepare a written occupational health and safety policy (s. 25(2)(j)), and take an active role in preventing violence and harassment (ss. 32.0.1 to 32.0.8). Notably, none of these strict duties are subject to the due diligence defence at s. 66(3). It would defeat the structure of the scheme to treat the owner-constructor relationship as giving rise to an employer-worker relationship.\nFinally, preserving the integrity of the owner-constructor relationship when interpreting the second branch of the employer definition is consistent with legislative purpose. To achieve the purpose of protecting worker safety, the legislature has defined the various roles on the project and carefully structured the relationship between the owner and the constructor. Treating the owner-constructor relationship as an employer-worker relationship detracts from the legislations effectiveness because it ignores the practical differences between these relationships and undercuts the distinct mechanisms by which they promote worker safety. Thus, to protect worker safety, we seek to give faithful effect to the assignment of roles and responsibilities chosen by the legislature.\nIn sum, the second branch of the employer definition is broad, but it does not turn an owner into the employer of workers hired or contracted for by a constructor. Having examined both branches of the definition of employer under s. 1(1), we now turn to the scope of an employers duties. At issue is the interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) and the accompanying Regulation.\nThe Duties of an Employer Under Section 25(1)(c) and the Regulation\nThe Ministry argues that as soon as a worker is present at the workplace, their employer is liable for complying with all regulatory measures through s. 25(1)(c). This appears to have been the unstated assumption of the courts below (Ont. C.J. reasons, at para. 74; Ont. C.A. reasons (2021), at para. 6). What this interpretation effectively means is that everyone who employs anyone is responsible for everything that anyone does. It would be absurd to interpret s. 25(1)(c) and the Regulation as obligating every employer at a construction project to ensure compliance with all the measures contained within the Regulation. This is inconsistent with the text of the Regulation itself, the structure of the Act, and the statutory purpose of protecting workers. It places obligations on employers which are specifically directed at other workplace parties and ignores the carefully legislated distinction between a project and a workplace as borne out by the definitions of these terms pursuant to s. 1(1) of the Act.\nIn the sections below, we first explain that s. 25(1)(c) requires employers to comply with the measures which apply to them. Second, we set out the requisite link for particular measures in the Regulation to apply to an employer where they do not otherwise specify to whom they apply. In doing so, we do not import a control requirement into s. 25(1)(c), as our colleague Martin J. suggests (para. 35). Our interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) merely recognizes that this duty does not require employers to ensure compliance with measures that do not actually apply to them. We pay close attention to the text, context and purpose of the Regulation and recognize that where a measure is silent as to whom is supposed to ensure its compliance, there must be a functional relationship between the measure and the employer: the measure must relate to the work that the employer controlled and performed through their workers.\nSection 25(1)(c) Requires Employers to Comply With Measures That Apply to Them\nSection 25(1)(c) is part of a list of duties which uses the words shall ensure that at the beginning of the enumeration. Each clause then completes the sentence. The use of the verb ensure, followed by the duties to be accomplished, emphasizes the principle of strict liability imposed upon employers (Legislature of Ontario Debates: Official Report (Hansard)  Daily Edition, No. 151, 2nd Sess., 31st Parl., December 14, 1978, at p. 6187; see also Timminco, at para. 26). Among these duties, the employer shall ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed are carried out in the workplace (s. 25(1)(c)).\nSection 25(1)(c) imposes a duty to comply with the prescribed measures and procedures. Thus, it is by virtue of s. 25(1)(c) that the provisions in the Regulation which apply to the employer become binding on it. The word prescribed is defined as prescribed by a regulation made under this Act (s. 1(1)). In this sense, s. 25(1)(c) reflects the Acts secondary function as enabling legislation by imposing a duty to comply with other provisions contained in industry-specific regulations (R. v. Campbell, [2004] O.J. No. 129 (QL), 2004 CarswellOnt 116 (WL) (C.J.), at paras. 32-34, affd (2006), 140 C.R.R. (2d) 143 (S.C.J.)).\nAlthough not expressly stated, it is evident that the phrase measures and procedures prescribed cannot refer to all measures contained in the Regulation, since many provisions expressly refer only to parties such as constructors or workers. For example, ss. 21(2) and 67(4) of the Regulation explicitly note that [a] workers employer shall require the worker to comply with subsection (1) [regarding protective clothing, equipment and devices] and that [e]very employer shall develop in writing and implement a traffic protection plan for the employers workers, respectively. It would be absurd for an excavating company which had safely equipped its own workers to be liable if a welding company on the other side of the project was not providing its workers with gloves, or for one employer to bear responsibility for ensuring that every other employer had made their own traffic plans. Many regulatory provisions specify to whom the provision applies, and s. 25(1)(c) should be read consistently to coincide with this pattern of drafting (R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  8.04[3]). The legislature clearly did not intend to require an employer to ensure compliance with obligations directed only at other workplace parties.\nThe simple corollary is that s. 25(1)(c) requires an employer to comply with the measures that actually apply to it. This may seem evident, but it must be stated, because the result of the Ministrys interpretation of the Act is, effectively, to make no distinction between the measures in the Regulation that apply to a particular employer and those that do not. We now turn to the Regulation, since, in light of the foregoing, it is important to determine when a particular regulatory measure applies to an employer.\nThe Regulation Applies to an Employers Work Where There Is a Relationship Between the Measure and the Employer\nThe Text of the Regulation\nIn the construction context, hundreds of measures are contained within the extensive Regulation. Since s. 25(1)(c) makes an employer liable for not ensuring compliance with the measures that apply to them, it is essential to determine which measures in the Regulation are applicable, bearing in mind the employers relationship to their workers.\nSome regulatory measures indicate their subject expressly. For example, s. 140(1) sets out requirements applicable to an employer who uses a suspended work platform. Similarly, s. 21 indicates that a worker must wear protective clothing and that the workers employer is responsible for requiring the worker to comply. For these measures, the link required for them to apply is clear, and no further analysis is required.\nHowever, the majority of measures do not indicate who is responsible for them. Instead, they are written in the form of a safety measure that shall be implemented, without specifying who must implement the measure. The measures at issue in the present case belong to that category:\n65. If work on a project may endanger a person using a public way, a sturdy fence at least 1.8 metres in height shall be constructed between the public way and the project.\n\n104. . . .\n\n(3) Operators of vehicles, machines and equipment shall be assisted by signallers if either of the following applies:\n\nThe operators view of the intended path of travel is obstructed.\n\nA person could be endangered by the vehicle, machine or equipment or by its load.\nAt this juncture, the following problem arises: s. 25(1)(c) imposes a duty on the employer to carry out the measures which apply to them; however, the text in many of the measures contained in the Regulation is ambiguous regarding to whom they apply. For example, at first glance, ss. 65 and 104(3) might appear silent on the link required between the measure and the employers work in order for them to apply to an employer under s. 25(1)(c). However, when reading the Regulation in light of the context and purpose of the overall scheme, this problem subsides. Indeed, reading a legislative provision in context means that the surrounding provisions and any other relevant provisions must be considered (United Independent Operators, at para. 57).\nPut simply, a measure contained in the Regulation applies to an employer where it relates to the work that the employer controlled and performed through their workers. Otherwise, employers would have no ability to ensure compliance with that measure nor would the measure bear any relation to their workers tasks. The structure of the Regulation, the division of roles in the construction context, the relationship with other employer duties, the purpose of protecting workers, and the presumption against absurdity call for such an approach.\nThe Structure of the Regulation and the Act\nThe Regulation is organized under headings tied to particular work activities. For example, divisions of the Regulation include Scaffolds and Work Platforms (ss. 126 to 136.0.1), Roofing (ss. 207 to 210) and Tunnel Equipment (ss. 309 to 316), or, in the examples above, Public Way Protection and Equipment, General, respectively. This division categorizes the hundreds of measures according to the activities and material involved in a construction project. The subject matter of individual measures also reflects a careful consideration of the situations in which a safety hazard would arise and imposes safety measures accordingly in order to promote worker safety in practice. In most cases, an employers work will only be related to some of these measures, in contrast to the constructor, who undertakes the project as a whole (s. 1(1) of the Act) and ensures that the health and safety of workers on the project is protected (s. 23(1)(c) of the Act). In the examples above, not all aspects of a project involve work near a public way; however, where any number of employers control work that is performed by their workers near a public way, they share the responsibility of ensuring that a fence is constructed. Similarly, on a given project, not all employers are completing work that requires them to use vehicles, machines and equipment, but all of those employers who are entrusted with such work are caught by s. 104(3) of the Regulation. The formulation of the Regulation reflects the practical realities of work on a project and how to protect worker safety on the ground. This structure suggests that the measures contained in the Regulation apply to those employers whose work is actually related to their subject matter.\nThis understanding is not unique to Ontario. In Quebec, the corresponding occupational health and safety regulatory code reflects a similar pattern of drafting, and a similar interpretation was reached by tribunals: when a measure is not addressed to a particular workplace party, [translation] it must be regarded as being addressed to all persons present on a construction site who might, in light of the usual nature of their activities, commit the offence in question, on the basis of their functional relationship with the subject matter of the provision (Commission de la sante et de la securite du travail du Quebec v. Acier AGF Inc., 2001 CanLII 12761 (Que. Lab. Ct.), at para. 17, citing Commission de la sante et de la securite du travail v. Poudrier et Boulet Ltee, [1982] AZ-83147017 (Que. Lab. Ct.); see also B. Cliche et al., Droit de la sante et de la securite au travail: La loi et la jurisprudence commentees (3rd ed. 2018)). This functional approach reflects a proper understanding of regulatory drafting in the construction context: when a measure relates to work that one or more employers controlled and performed through their workers, those employers are each in a position to take steps to avoid violations and address any safety hazards.\nThe necessity of a relationship between a measure and an employer has also been recognized under the Act in other contexts. For example, in Blue Mountain Resorts Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Labour), 2013 ONCA 75, 114 O.R. (3d) 321, the Court of Appeal interpreted the reporting obligation under s. 51(1) of the Act, which required an employer to notify various parties where a person is killed or critically injured from any cause at a workplace. Blair J.A. recognized that a purely textual reading of the provision would have imposed a reporting obligation on an employer for incidents unrelated to the employers work. He adopted a functional approach based on a reasonable nexus to accurately interpret which employers would be liable for the reporting obligation and concluded that [c]ontextually and purposively speaking . . . s. 51(1) is not engaged unless there is some reasonable nexus between the hazard giving rise to the injury and a realistic risk to worker safety (para. 49 (emphasis added)). Wyssen and Blue Mountain Resorts must be read together. Wyssen interpreted the definition of employer in keeping with the legislatures intention to subject different types of employers to the Act as a whole. Blue Mountain Resorts considered when the duty in s. 51(1) applied to a given employer on a functional basis, focusing on that particular duty and thereby giving effect to the legislatures intention. The same interpretative approach flows from the Regulation in this case.\nThe Acts Division of Roles in the Construction Context\nAs its title (Construction Projects) suggests, the Regulation is designed for the construction context. The Act has set out the particular distribution of duties between parties on a construction project, which provides important context for interpreting the applicability of the regulatory provisions. Indeed, establishing a relationship between a measure and an employer is necessary to respect the distinct spheres of operation of an employer and a constructor set out within the Act.\nConstruction projects are a unique type of workplace engaging a distinct division of roles. As previously stated, the constructor undertakes the project and therefore has a unique role as a backstop for worker safety by bearing overall responsibility for the project and all workers (Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Black & McDonald Ltd., 2011 ONCA 440, 106 O.R. (3d) 784, at para. 12; R. v. K.B. Home Insulation Ltd., [2008] O.J. No. 6019 (QL), 2008 CarswellOnt 10891 (WL) (C.J.), at para. 18; R. v. Bradsil 1967 Ltd., [1994] O.J. No. 837 (QL), 1994 CarswellOnt 4450 (WL) (C.J. (Prov. Div.)), at para. 33). On a complex, multi-employer construction project, the Act vests the constructor with responsibility to coordinate work across the entire project. As the Ministry itself recognized in its Constructor guideline, [t]he intent of the [Act] is to have one person with overall authority for health and safety matters on a project. This person is the constructor of the project (February 11, 2022 (online) (emphasis deleted)). In comparison, the employer is entrusted with particular work on the project; they make an essential contribution to worker safety by ensuring that their work complies with the applicable measures. Properly interpreted, employers have distinct but overlapping obligations, coordinated by the constructor responsible for overseeing all employers.\nThe constructor is tasked with ensuring that all employers comply with their obligations:\n23 (1) A constructor shall ensure, on a project undertaken by the constructor that,\n\nthe measures and procedures prescribed by this Act and the regulations are carried out on the project;\n\nevery employer and every worker performing work on the project complies with this Act and the regulations; and\n\nthe health and safety of workers on the project is protected.\nThe constructors plenary oversight role is clearly set out in this provision; they are specifically required to ensure that every employer complies with the Act and the Regulation. Moreover, this duty applies across the entire project, thereby using construction-specific language in contrast to the general formulation of employers duties in the workplace under s. 25. The wording of s. 23(1)(b) differs significantly from the duties set out in both s. 23(1)(a) and s. 25(1)(c), because it requires constructors to ensure compliance with duties and regulatory measures that may only apply to other workplace parties.\nSection 25(1)(c) subjects employers to a duty to carry out the prescribed regulations that apply to them; there is no employer duty that corresponds to s. 23(1)(b). Interpreting particular measures within the Regulation as if they always applied to all employers, rather than to employers who have a relationship to the measure, would undermine the distinctions between s. 23(1)(b) and s. 25(1)(c). Such an interpretation of the Regulation would make every employer responsible for everything under s. 25(1)(c) and would effectively turn s. 25(1)(c) into a duty akin to s. 23(1)(b) despite its distinct wording. The measures prescribed in the Regulation must be interpreted in a way that is sensitive to the distinction between employers and constructors. This is achieved by recognizing that a measure applies to employers where a relationship exists between the measure and the employers work.\nMoreover, it is worth remembering that an employers obligations extend beyond s. 25(1)(c) and the regulatory measures that directly apply to them. The Act and the Regulation cannot be interpreted using tunnel vision, because s. 25(1)(c) and the associated regulatory measures are only one of many mechanisms to protect worker safety. Among other duties, s. 28(1)(d) obligates any worker to report to his or her employer or supervisor any contravention of this Act or the regulations or the existence of any hazard of which he or she knows. An employer also has a duty to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker under s. 25(2)(h). Thus, aside from safety hazards not mentioned within the Regulation, these provisions may require an employer to take steps to address violations and hazards that would not normally have fallen within s. 25(1)(c), but which had been reported to them and which they could have brought to the attention of the employers who did have control under s. 25(1)(c). Importantly, however, s. 25(2)(h) is an obligation of means; it is the appropriate section under which to analyze such situations, rather than through a decontextualized and limitless interpretation of s. 25(1)(c).\nFinally, we note that just because the definition of employer is broad, every regulatory measure does not necessarily apply to everyone. As we explained, the definition of employer in s. 1(1) ensures that entities are subject to a variety of substantive and procedural duties under the Act  of which s. 25(1)(c) is only one. These duties each serve distinct functions in advancing the objective of the statutory scheme. Accordingly, and in contrast to our colleague Martin J.s interpretation of the scheme (at para. 36), it does not follow that each regulatory measure is equally broad and must apply to all employers simply because the definition of employer is expansive; the result in Blue Mountain Resorts supports this view. Rather, duties must be interpreted in their proper context in order to further the legislatures objectives in practice. Our functional and contextual interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) and the Regulation achieves this aim.\nThe Purpose of the Regulation and the Act\nCourts should approach statutory and regulatory language in the manner that best reflects the underlying aims of the statute. This follows from the obligation to interpret the words of an Act harmoniously with the object of the Act and the intention of Parliament (British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal v. Schrenk, 2017 SCC 62, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 795, at para. 50). The interpretation adopted in these reasons best furthers the purposes of the Act. Protecting worker safety is of critical importance; the question is how the legislature has chosen to achieve this aim. The Ministry proposes an unbounded interpretation of employer duties and simply asserts that this promotes the public welfare purposes of the Act. However, such a bald assertion should not be accepted uncritically. It is far from clear that making every employer liable for the acts of all other employers in carrying out all regulatory obligations meaningfully improves worker safety. To the contrary, our interpretation reflects a measured and practical approach that is fully consistent with the legislatures purposes and best promotes the safety of workers on a project. Below, we focus on worker safety through the perspective of overlapping and coordinated duties across a project, the belt and braces approach, and the administration of the scheme.\nFirst, our interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) of the Act and the Regulation gives effect to the concept of overlapping responsibilities. Since the workers activities under each employers control frequently overlap on complex construction projects, so too will the measures which apply to them under s. 25(1)(c). For example, when multiple contractors send their respective workers up a scaffold, they are each responsible for its safety under ss. 126 to 136.0.1 of the Regulation (see, e.g., R. v. Structform International Ltd., [1992] O.J. No. 1711 (QL), 1992 CarswellOnt 2751 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 6). Importantly, other employers may also be subject to duties under other provisions of the Act (see, e.g., s. 25(2)(h)). The critical distinction is that there is a functional basis for the overlap, consistent with the work that the employers controlled and performed through their respective workers. Employers whose work is not related to the regulatory measure will not be arbitrarily sent before the courts to defend their actions in the event of an accident or incident. Similarly, while the constructors plenary authority across a project will overlap with employers duties in their respective operational spheres, the scope of the employers respective occupational health and safety duties will be functionally based on the work that the employers controlled and performed through their workers.\nSuch an approach to overlapping responsibilities is consistent with this Courts decision in West Fraser Mills Ltd. v. British Columbia (Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal), 2018 SCC 22, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 635. While reviewing the decision of the Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia, McLachlin C.J. rejected an interpretive approach to an occupational health and safety provision that would have held only one employer liable where multiple were responsible in a complex joint set of interactions (para. 44). On the proposed interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) and the Regulation, the employers involved in a joint set of interactions through their workers will be liable under s. 25(1)(c), since regulatory measures clearly relate to each of their work. Our approach is thus similar to the prevailing interpretation in West Fraser Mills, which was based on a factual link between West Fraser Mills activities and choices as an employer of individuals meant to monitor the worksite and the incident that occurred (para. 38).\nAlthough paying lip service to the language of overlapping obligations, the Ministry is effectively proposing coextensive obligations among employers, without regard for the activities under their control on the larger project. This approach advances an interpretation that goes well beyond the proper reach of the Act and the reviewing role of the ministry reasonably necessary to advance the admittedly important objective of protecting the health and safety of workers in the workplace (Blue Mountain Resorts, at para. 4; see also paras. 26-27).\nSecond, the interpretation of the Regulation in these reasons fully operationalizes the belt and braces approach. The goal of a belt and braces system is to create meaningful protection in practice. Thus, if the belt does not work to safeguard a worker, the backup system of the braces might, or vice versa (Enbridge, at para. 24). Yet, if there is no relationship between the measure and the employers work, the employer cannot serve as an effective brace. Further, if everybody is responsible for everything, it is difficult for a given employer to determine which of the hundreds of regulatory measures they are responsible for overseeing. The applicability of each measure is, in essence, determined by the Ministrys use of prosecutorial discretion ex post facto. Clearly, the problem with this approach is that if employers do not know who is a belt or a brace, then the safety system cannot function at all and leads to confusion. Imposing measures contained in the Regulation onto employers bearing no relationship to the work at hand adds an indefinite number of illusory braces: they provide a false sense of added safety but, in reality, only increase the legal jeopardy of unrelated workplace parties who could not have ensured compliance with those measures. The belt and braces approach is best operationalized when redundanc[ies]  a term employed by Bellamy J. in Enbridge  exist among the employers who bear an actual connection to the relevant measure (para. 24). These employer duties exist alongside the distinct but overlapping duties of the constructor and other workplace parties.\nPut simply, holding employers with no control liable does nothing to increase worker safety  it is this very lack of control which makes them unable to carry out the regulatory measure in the first place. Although the statutory and administrative law context was different in Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900, this Court referenced the more general idea that, in practice, [a]n interpretation which imposed on the employer a duty it could not fulfil would do nothing to further the aim of preventing accidents and injury (para. 59).\nThird, limitless responsibilities lead to confusion and a lack of coordination on a construction project. If every employer is liable for everything and has duties towards unrelated parties, an individual employers sphere of responsibility becomes unclear. Indeed, it stands to reason that when too many workplace parties share too many of the same responsibilities, confusion about when and how those parties must answer the call of duty is bound to arise. These circumstances can lead to duplication and the potential for competing directives (Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care, Land Ambulance Programs) v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 2974.1, 2010 CanLII 11302 (Ont. L.R.B.), at para. 83). For example, safety issues could arise if multiple employers with no relationship to the duty or expertise in the area seek to enforce their own version of a particular safety procedure on other workers. Alternatively, unlimited duties can lead to neglect if each employer assumes that duties owed by all employers will have been fulfilled by someone else. Hoping that the due diligence defence will incentivize parties to remedy this problem belies the fact that, properly interpreted, s. 25(1)(c) should not create this problem in the first place. Rather, our interpretive approach assists in avoiding these problems by clarifying the requisite relationship for a measure to apply to an employer.\nAs we explained, the Act is designed to provide effective protection for the health and safety of workers (Hamilton (City), at para. 16; Timminco, at para. 22; Bondfield, at para. 59). This objective is furthered by requiring employers to be focused on fulfilling regulatory measures related to work which they control. Conversely, it is frustrated when limitless duties are imposed that ultimately obscure the areas in which an employer can make a practical difference. If every employer is rendered equally responsible for everything, it becomes more difficult for workers and other workplace parties to single out particular employers who should take the initiative, or to seek a uniform response among employers. This undermines the effectiveness of the internal responsibility system, which was at the core of the Acts reform (see, e.g., R. Fidler, The Occupational Health and Safety Act and the Internal Responsibility System (1986), 24 Osgoode Hall L.J. 315). Such an outcome does not promote worker safety; it jeopardizes it. In contrast, the interpretation presented in these reasons clarifies the duties of each employer in relation to their work activities. It also gives meaningful room for the constructor to coordinate the employers respective activities to maximize worker safety. A practical understanding of how the Regulation connects to s. 25(1)(c) best protects the purpose of the scheme and recognizes how the scheme operates on the ground (West Fraser Mills, at para. 41).\nIt is true that the legislature imposed strict liability offences to increase administrative efficiency. However, the fact that the Ministry is spared from proving mens rea does not mean that it is able to charge anyone with anything in the Regulation; these are two separate questions. Moreover, determining whether a measure in the Regulation applies to an employer under our interpretation is not an onerous task and therefore has little effect on the efficiency of the Ministrys work. As we later explain, to determine which measures apply to which employers, courts merely need to ask: What work is an employer responsible for undertaking on the construction project? In this sense, it involves an inquiry into the allocation of tasks on the project and the work actually performed by the employers workers. This is a basic question that should arise in the Ministrys investigation of an accident or incident. It should inform who the Ministry charges. Taken together, our interpretation promotes the purposes of the scheme while protecting the integrity of its structure.\nAbsurdity and Legislative Intent\nIt is a well-established principle that the legislature does not intend to produce absurd results. This would occur if an interpretation leads to ridiculous or frivolous consequences, if it is extremely unreasonable or inequitable, if it is illogical or incoherent, or if it is incompatible with other provisions or with the object of the legislative enactment (Rizzo, at para. 27).\nThe Ministrys expansive interpretation of employer duties ignores this principle and leads to absurdity. Applying its interpretation in a construction context, the vast majority of an employers s. 25(1)(c) duties would be unrelated to their work and impossible for them to fulfill, yet could still result in them being charged. Three examples suffice to demonstrate the absurd results that would flow from the Ministrys interpretation.\nFirst, consider the company that provides catering services on a large construction project and that delivers food and beverage services at various respite locations. While this company employs caterers on the project site and has control over catering tasks, it is uninvolved in most operations on the construction project. Yet, under the Ministrys approach, if a tower crane was erected near the caterers activities without including automatic limit switches (s. 160(1) of the Regulation), the catering company could be charged, the actus reus would be made out, and the catering company would bear the burden of establishing a defence. To subject an employer such as the catering company to this process is absurd. On a large project involving numerous employers, such absurdities would be multiplied.\nSecond, the group of interveners, including the Regional Municipality of York, raise the following example. A municipality greenlights the construction of a rail system and contracts with a constructor. It sends a quality assurance inspector to check that the lights were installed in accordance with the contract. If an electrical problem causes an accident on the other side of the station, the municipality would have breached s. 25(1)(c) on the Ministrys interpretation merely because its employee was present at the site. Further, according to the Ministrys interpretation of the Act, the municipality would be dissuaded from sending inspectors  who might otherwise improve the project  for fear of being held liable for all regulatory measures under the Act, no matter how unconnected the measures are to the inspectors activities. Surely, such an absurd outcome does not further the statutory purpose of protecting workers.\nThird, one can easily imagine a homeowner who has contracted with a constructor to repair the attic, but who engages an external person to verify that the project is proceeding according to architectural design standards. If, on the same day, one of the constructors subcontractors falls from a ladder that did not meet regulatory specifications (see s. 80 of the Regulation), should the homeowner be liable as soon as they employed an individual who entered the attic? Similarly, does a small retailer who sends their business employee to the premises to confirm the constructors performance of the contract become liable for all regulatory measures across the project merely because they are an employer whose worker performed a task at the project? These are some of the absurd outcomes that flow from the Ministrys literal interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) of the Act, according to which every employer would be obligated to ensure compliance with every regulatory measure contained within the Regulation. Moreover, as we noted earlier, these entities would not otherwise be forced to comply with such measures, given that the owner-constructor relationship does not simultaneously create an employer-worker relationship.\nAt the hearing, the Ministrys counter-arguments were twofold. First, prosecutorial discretion will limit the potential for absurdity to occur. Second, even if these employers are charged, the due diligence defence at s. 66(3) will allow them to avoid conviction. Neither of these responses is satisfactory.\nOn the question of prosecutorial discretion, the Ministrys approach undermines the rule of law. It effectively gives prosecutors unbounded discretion to define the proper scope of each employers duties by deciding who to charge, rendering the ultimate delineation of duties in the Act unpredictable and uneven from the accuseds perspective. This cannot be what the legislature intended when it sought to enact strict liability offences for administrative efficiency. It crafted a careful scheme to create coordinated working relationships among employers under the oversight of the constructor. It is inconceivable that the legislature would intend for the true scope of s. 25(1)(c) to be determined via prosecutorial discretion. Moreover, the Ministrys reliance on a promise that prosecutors would not charge employers for breaches of regulatory measures over which they had no control emphasizes the absurdity of its own interpretation.\nAs for the availability of the defence at s. 66(3), it initially presents itself as an appealing solution: courts could accept the broad language of s. 25(1)(c) at face value and simply resolve the absurdities created through a lenient approach to the accuseds defence. However, there are multiple flaws with adopting an approach that pushes most of the analysis concerning an employers responsibility to the due diligence stage.\nFirst, from a methodological perspective, the offence and the defence should not be conflated. The existence of s. 66(3) confirms the nature of certain duties: ss. 23(1), 25(1)(b), (c) or (d) and 27(1) involve strict liability, rather than absolute liability. However, s. 66(3) does not determine the applicability of these duties to a party, nor their content. These are distinct inquiries, and judges should not abdicate the responsibility of arriving at a reasonable interpretation of a duty merely because a defence exists or because doing so would improve administrative efficiency for the Ministry.\nThe Ministrys focus on the due diligence defence flips the structure of offences on its head: every employer is captured by the offence as soon as any regulatory measure is not met, and the accused must bear the burden of pulling themselves out of the ambit of the offence. Owners might point to retaining a constructor, but for most employers on a construction project, the defence would involve justifying why the measure was so unrelated to their work that no precautions were possible; put differently, employers would effectively be forced to argue at the defence stage that the offence should not actually apply to them.\nSecond, the contextual analysis undertaken in our reasons demonstrates that the Ministrys interpretation is inconsistent with other statutory provisions and confuses the roles of employer and constructor. The objective of statutory interpretation must be to interpret statutory provisions to harmonize the components of legislation inasmuch as is possible, in order to minimize internal inconsistency (Willick v. Willick, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670, at p. 689). The Ministrys interpretation does the opposite: it undermines the coherence of the overall scheme, while asking the accused to bear the burden of repairing it at the due diligence stage. Pointing to the existence of s. 66(3) as a safety valve does not excuse the damage inflicted on the scheme by an unbridled interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) and the Regulation. Even if pushing the analysis to the due diligence stage was a plausible interpretation, courts should favour an approach that reflects the structure and consistency of the legislative scheme.\nThird, shifting much of the analysis on the contents of the duty and the nature of the employers work to the due diligence stage has superficial appeal in its apparent simplicity: on this approach, every employer is liable for fulfilling all of the same measures in the Regulation, and the practical problems with such an approach are conveniently hidden from view by pushing them to the due diligence stage. However, this increases uncertainty in practice and ignores the reality of how the scheme operates on the ground. If most of the employers obligations are outside of their control, they have no ability to even know whether the measures are being complied with or what they could be charged with at any moment. In contrast, requiring that a measure relates to an employers work provides employers with a greater understanding of their responsibilities and encourages them to take initiative to protect workers.\nFourth, it should not be forgotten that the Act is penal legislation (R. v. Brampton Brick Ltd. (2004), 189 O.A.C. 44, at para. 22). Those convicted of an offence are subject to fines of up to $500,000 and imprisonment for up to one year (s. 66(1)). These are serious punishments for the caterer, the homeowner, or the small business owner on a construction project. It is inconceivable that the legislature intended to allow prosecutors to haul any employer on a massive project to court and force them to demonstrate the measure was completely irrelevant to their work in order to save themselves from prison or financial ruin. The interpretation proposed in these reasons recognizes this absurdity and offers a grounded approach that preserves the legislatures intent.\nFifth and finally, the defence at s. 66(3) is illusory for a variety of parties: rather than pay hefty legal fees and seek to mount a successful due diligence defence, small businesses, sole proprietors, contractors, and homeowners may resign themselves to pleading guilty. Insofar as the existence of a due diligence defence is a safety valve underpinning the Ministrys broad interpretation, its practical unavailability for more vulnerable parties should be acknowledged since access to justice remains out of reach for many Canadians. Thus, the availability and content of the due diligence defence do not serve as an adequate safety valve for an employer who has been charged with failing to comply with measures which are unrelated to their work and should never have applied to them in the first place.\nIn contrast, the interpretation adopted in these reasons gives meaningful effect to the statutory scheme, while avoiding overly broad interpretations that would lead to absurd outcomes. Broad language in a statute should be given a more limited interpretation in order to avoid absurdity and to give the words their appropriate meaning, having regard to their context, the purpose of the Act and the intention of the legislature (Blue Mountain Resorts, at para. 51; see also Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, at p. 1082). Indeed, when a court interprets broad occupational health and safety legislation, there are safeguards or elements imposed at each stage that offer an opportunity to interpret and restrict that broad language to avoid absurdity (R. v. Halifax Port Authority, 2022 NSPC 13, at para. 130 (CanLII)). This is the case here, with regard to s. 25(1)(c) and the ambiguous provisions in the Regulation. Our interpretation is the product of a careful examination of the text of s. 25(1)(c) and the Regulation, read in light of its statutory context, the legislatures purposes, and its practical effects on the ground.\nSummary and Guidance\nIn summary, s. 25(1)(c) requires an employer to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory measures. Where the Regulation expressly states to whom its measures apply, there will be no question as to whether they fall within the employers duty under s. 25(1)(c). Where however, a particular measure is silent concerning to whom it applies, the measure applies when it relates to work that the employer controlled and performed through their workers. This relationship is established when the employer has authority over the performance of a task, usually because it is the portion of the work within the larger project that, whether alone or with other parties, they have been entrusted with performing through the workers they have employed or contracted for. To be sure, multiple parties can be jointly entrusted with a task, since different employers will often collaborate, and thus multiple employers can have an overlapping responsibility to fulfill the same measures (Director of Occupational Health and Safety v. Government of Yukon, William R. Cratty and P.S. Sidhu Trucking Ltd., 2012 YKSC 47, at para. 69 (CanLII)). It is not necessary for the Ministry to assign relative degrees of control over the activity in question. A regulatory measure can apply to the work of multiple employers so long as it relates to each employer. As we explained, the core question is: What work is an employer responsible for undertaking on the construction project? Clearly the Ministry should know whether the measure is actually related to the employers work before making the decision to charge that employer.\nSuch an inquiry does not require fact-specific findings relative to the accident or incident nor in respect of the various employers resources, intentions or relative degrees of control. When an employer is given responsibility for performing a task (whether exclusive or shared), they are liable for ensuring compliance with all regulatory measures related to this work. This is a binary determination and does not depend on relative control: when an employer undertakes to perform a task through their workers, they must address the safety hazards related to this work.\nIt is not difficult to determine which duties are involved, since (as noted above) the duties are deliberately organized based on project materials, devices and activities. For example, s. 207(1) of the Regulation reads as follows:\n207. (1) If a built-up roof is being constructed, repaired or resurfaced, a barrier shall be placed in the immediate work area at least two metres from the perimeter of the roof.\nIf one or more employers are entrusted with constructing a roof, then they must ensure that a barrier has been placed in conformity with s. 207(1). Conversely, the measure clearly does not apply to a painting company working on the interior walls. In most cases, this determination would not be in doubt. In any event, it is reasonable to ask the Ministry to demonstrate that a measure  with which non-compliance risks imprisonment  actually applies to the person it is seeking to charge, as prosecutors would have to do in any other instance.\nIt warrants emphasizing that whether a regulatory measure applies to a party (and, thus, whether they can properly be charged) is different from whether they were diligent in the circumstances (and, thus, whether they can make out a defence if charged) and from whether there are aggravating or mitigating factors at sentencing (and, thus, the penalty in the event of conviction). To explain this distinction, we briefly examine the distinct role of the due diligence defence provided for at s. 66(3).\nThe Role of the Defence Provided for at Section 66(3)\nIf a person is an employer under the Act, they must ensure that the measures which apply to them are carried out in the workplace pursuant to s. 25(1)(c). As we explained, the regulatory measures apply when they present a nexus to the work which is under the employers control and performed through their workers. Establishing this nexus between the measure and the employer is a binary, threshold question: either the measure applies because it is related to work which the employer has undertaken, or the measure does not apply because such a link is absent.\nIf a violation of an applicable measure is proven, the employer must make out a due diligence defence as per s. 66(3). Since the measure is related to their work, the employer has the burden of demonstrating the specific steps they took to prevent the breach in the circumstances. The role that control might play at this stage is fundamentally different. Indeed, making out this defence entails a fact- and situation-specific analysis that can capture the degree and extent of the employers control over the underlying cause of the breach at issue, the gravity and likelihood of the harm, the alternatives available to the employer in the circumstances, and the degree of knowledge or skill expected of the employer  considerations that are irrelevant to the applicability of the duty (R. v. Gonder (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 326 (Y. Terr. Ct.), at pp. 332-33; R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299; Stelco Inc. v. Ontario (Ministry of Labour), 2006 CanLII 28110 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 28-32; Ontario v. London Excavators & Trucking Ltd. (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 32 (C.A.)).\nApplication\nBased on our analysis of the Act, we now examine whether the City is liable as an employer for the breach of ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation.\nIs the City an Employer Under Section 1(1)?\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that because the City had hired quality control inspectors through a contract of employment, it satisfied the definition of employer under the first branch (paras. 13-14). We agree with this conclusion. Indeed, at the hearing, the City effectively conceded that it was the employer of its inspectors. The City hired quality control inspectors and owes duties as the employer of these workers under the Act. However, this does not mean that the City is the employer of all workers on the project. By contracting with a constructor, it did not become the employer of the workers that the constructor retained. As explained previously, the owner-constructor contract reflects a distinct relationship contemplated in the Act that does not generally fall within the second branch of the employer definition in s. 1(1). Consequently, the City is only the employer of its quality control inspectors.\nSince the City satisfies the definition of employer in s. 1(1), we now turn to the scope of its duties.\nDo Sections 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation Apply to the City as an Employer Through the Operation of Section 25(1)(c) of the Act?\nIn light of our conclusion that the City is an employer of the quality control inspectors, the applicability of the regulatory measures depends on whether it controlled work being performed near public ways (s. 65) or controlled the operation of vehicles, machines and equipment (s. 104(3)). As previously mentioned, the Court of Appeal did not examine this question once it found that the City was an employer. Rather, the Court of Appeal stated: We conclude that the City was an employer within the meaning of the Act and, as a result, was liable for violations of the Regulation found by the trial judge unless it could establish a due diligence defence (para. 6 (emphasis added)). Respectfully, it was incorrect for the Court of Appeal to find that because the City satisfied the definition of employer it was liable for the violations under the Regulation. This reasoning rests on an improper interpretation of the Act, as we explained above.\nDue to this flawed assumption, the trial judge did not consider the applicability of the regulatory measures, nor did the Superior Court or the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the proper approach is to remit the matter to the Ontario Court of Justice to determine whether, following the approach set out above, ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation related to the City and thereby fell within its duty under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we would allow the appeal and remit the matter to the Ontario Court of Justice to assess whether ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation apply to the City as an employer, and thus whether the City breached its duty under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nThe entirety of the Elgin Project  including responsibility for compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (OHSA or Act)  was under the control of Interpaving Limited, the company hired by the Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury to be its general contractor. As the municipal project owner, the City sent quality control inspectors to the project to ensure the quality of work and to protect public funds (Ont. C.J. reasons, at para. 23, reproduced in A.R., vol. I, at p. 7). The City was not involved in any of the construction work at the Elgin Project. Its inspectors did not direct any workers, supervis[e] the work, or exercise control over the work (paras. 26 and 86).\nIn these circumstances, I agree with the trial judge, Lische J., that the City was not an employer on the construction project as defined and intended by the Act. I also agree with Poupore J., on appeal, that the trial judge properly found that the [Ministry of the Attorney General (Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development)] for Ontario had not proved that the City acted as an employer on [the construction] site (2019 ONSC 3285, 88 M.P.L.R. (5th) 158, at para. 35). Interpaving was both the constructor of the project and the employer of the road grader operator who fatally struck and killed a pedestrian. It was charged with breaching s. 104(3) of the accompanying regulation, Construction Projects, O. Reg. 213/91 (Regulation), which requires operators of vehicles, machines and equipment to be assisted by signallers if the operators view is obstructed or if a person could be endangered.\nIn my view, the City should not share statutory liability for Interpavings failures at the construction site. To hold otherwise would change substantially what has been the practice in Ontario on construction projects (Ont. S.C. reasons, at para. 34). It would also create a clear disincentive for municipal project owners to engage in laudable quality control efforts and would thus tend to frustrate, not further, the statutory purpose of protecting workers. I would allow the appeal and restore the acquittals entered by the trial court on all charges.\nAnalysis\nMy analysis proceeds in three parts. First, I discuss why I substantially agree with Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.s interpretation of the duties of employers under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act, which must be read in context and together with the applicable regulations. I further agree that the definition of employer in s. 1(1) of the Act does not capture the construction-specific relationship between a project owner and its general contractor (see Rowe and OBonsawin JJ., at paras. 99-104). With respect, Martin J. fails to consider the structure of the Act and the carefully legislated distinction between construction projects and other workplaces.\nSecond, I consider the purpose of the Act and explain why the belt and braces approach to worker safety should not be interpreted in a manner that extends the reach of the Act far beyond what was intended by the legislature (Blue Mountain Resorts Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Labour), 2013 ONCA 75, 114 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 27; see also R. v. Bondfield Construction Co., 2022 ONCA 302, at para. 59 (CanLII)). Even a generous approach to the interpretation of public welfare statutes does not call for a limitless interpretation of their provisions (Blue Mountain, at para. 26). While due diligence remains available as a defence, it should not affect the proper interpretation of the term employer or alter the nature of the statutory offence of a failure to comply with s. 25(1)(c) of the Act.\nThird, and where I depart from Rowe and OBonsawin JJ., I explain why a municipal project owner is not an employer on the construction site merely because it employs quality control inspectors (see Ont. C.J. reasons, at paras. 84-90; Ont. S.C. reasons, at paras. 33-35). Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. find that the applicability of the regulatory measures depends on whether [the City] controlled work being performed near public ways (s. 65) or controlled the operation of vehicles, machines and equipment (s. 104(3)) (para. 160). With respect, the trial court answered these questions. Over the course of a 5-day trial, the trial judge heard from 10 witnesses and considered 16 exhibits. In her careful and thorough analysis, she repeatedly rejected the Ministrys position that the City or its inspectors exercised control over any construction work at the project (see paras. 24-26, 64-67, 71, 81-82 and 86-89). In the alternative, the trial judge was satisfied that the City exercised due diligence, taking every precaution reasonable in the circumstances to prevent the tragedy that occurred (para. 91; see also paras. 92-103).\nAs a result, I would not remit the matter to the trial court. The City was not statutorily obligated to ensure compliance with ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation, both of which applied only to the workplace parties involved in actual construction work at the Elgin Project.\nPoints of Agreement With Rowe and OBonsawin JJ.\nSection 25(1)(c) of the Act Must Be Read in Context\nI agree that it would be absurd to interpret s. 25(1)(c) literally  that is, to require each employer on a construction project to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations (see Rowe and OBonsawin JJ., at para. 105). As Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. hold, s. 25(1)(c) must be read in context, and its interpretation must be informed by the content of the applicable regulations. Martin J.s textual interpretation of s. 25(1)(c) is inconsistent with a textual reading of the accompanying regulations. For example, under her interpretation, employers would be required to ensure compliance with safety obligations specifically imposed on other parties, such as the duty of a constructor under s. 17(1) of the Regulation to establish emergency procedures for a project.\nThrough the Act and Regulation, the legislature has made it clear that construction projects are distinct from other regulated workplaces. On a construction project, while each employer is responsible for the health and safety of its own workers, the constructor is responsible for health and safety across the project (see, e.g., R. v. K.B. Home Insulation Ltd., [2008] O.J. No. 6019 (QL), 2008 CarswellOnt 10891 (WL) (C.J.), at para. 18; R. v. Bradsil 1967 Ltd., [1994] O.J. No. 837 (QL), 1994 CarswellOnt 4450 (WL) (C.J. (Prov. Div.)), at para. 33; D. McKechnie, Occupational Health and Safety in Construction Law, in L. Ricchetti and T. J. Murphy, Construction Law in Canada (2010), 209, at pp. 213-17; R. v. Grant Forest Products Inc. (2002), 98 C.R.R. (2d) 149 (Ont. C.J.), at para. 55). This is confirmed by the Ministrys own interpretation of the Act. The Ministrys publicly accessible Constructor guideline (February 11, 2022 (online)) states the following:\nDefinition of constructor\n\nThe intent of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA or the Act) is to have one person with overall authority for health and safety matters on a project. This person is the constructor of the project.\n\n. . .\n\nHealth and safety at a project are a shared responsibility. Though each employer at a project has significant responsibilities for the health and safety of their workers, the constructor is the party with the greatest degree of control over health and safety at the entire project and is ultimately responsible for the health and safety of all workers. The constructor must ensure that all the employers and workers on the project comply with the Act and its regulations.\n\n. . .\n\nRelationship of the constructor to the other parties on a project\n\nThe constructor has overall responsibility on a project for compliance with the Act, the Regulation for Construction Projects (O. Reg. 213/91) and other applicable regulations. The constructor may also have duties as an employer or as an owner. [Emphasis in original.]\nI therefore disagree with Martin J.s reliance on R. v. Wyssen (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 193 (C.A.), for the principle that an employer acts as the virtual insurer of health and safety. While this may be true in the window cleaning industry, which was at issue in Wyssen, it is not true on construction projects. In this specific and unique context, the general contractor or constructor acts as the insurer of health and safety across the project.\nA Project Owner Is Not the Employer of the Constructor or the Constructors Workers\nAs with s. 25(1)(c) of the Act, Martin J.s literal interpretation of s. 1(1) fails to account for the industry context. I agree with Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. that a project owner who hires a constructor is not the employer of the constructor itself or its workers (paras. 99-104). Wyssen established that an employer cannot evade its occupational health and safety responsibilities by hiring an independent contractor instead of entering a typical employment relationship (see Rowe and OBonsawin JJ., at para. 96). But it does not follow from Wyssen that an employer is responsible for the employees and independent contractors of other employers. In Wyssen, Blair J.A.s reference to the employer as being virtually in the position of an insurer related only to the employers own independent contractor  there, the deceased window cleaner, with whom the employer had a direct contractual relationship (see p. 198). In this case, the City was therefore not the employer of the workers hired by its general contractor, Interpaving.\nAs to the Citys hiring of Interpaving itself, this reflects an owner-constructor relationship, not an employer-worker relationship (Rowe and OBonsawin JJ., at para. 89). With respect, Martin J.s finding that the City was Interpavings employer defeats the structure and purpose of the Act. It reads out the statutory role of constructor and renders the legislatures express distinction between the duties of project owners and those of non-project owners in ss. 29 and 30 meaningless. Without exception, every project owner would have a strict duty to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations. While Martin J. laments the risk of reading too much into the Act, her own interpretation would impose positive duties on project owners, in every case, far beyond those set out by the legislature in s. 30. The Act is specifically designed to accommodate  and promote  the delegation of construction projects, including responsibility for health and safety, to qualified constructors.\nThe Belt and Braces Approach to Worker Safety Is Not Limitless\nStatutory Purpose\nI do not accept that the belt and braces approach to occupational health and safety relied on by my colleagues is without reasonable limits. In Bondfield, van Rensburg J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal, noted that the Act seeks to achieve a reasonable level of worker protection:\n\tA generous interpretation, however, should not be confused with a limitless one: Blue Mountain Resorts Ltd., at para. 26. While the OHSA aims to protect workers from both deliberate and inadvertent conduct, including accidents that result when workers make mistakes or are careless or reckless, it is important to remember that the OHSA seeks to achieve a reasonable level of worker protection, not an entirely risk-free work environment. [Emphasis added; citations omitted; para. 59.]\nWhile Martin J. purports to accept that the purpose of the Act is to promote a reasonable level of protection for the health and safety of workers (para. 38), her interpretation of the belt and braces strategy goes far beyond what was intended by the legislature (see Blue Mountain, at para. 27). There is no dispute that the purpose of the Act is to promote worker safety. I simply disagree that it furthers this aim to impose duties on employers that they cannot possibly fulfill (Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900, at para. 59). This is true whether or not the notion of control is explicit in the statutory language.\nThis point is exemplified by Ontario (Ministry of Labour) v. Nor Eng Construction & Engineering Inc., 2008 ONCJ 296, one of the cases that Martin J. disapproves of as irreconcilable with Wyssen (see Martin J., at para. 21). I strongly disagree. In Nor Eng, a bridge structure collapsed at a construction project in Sudbury. The Ministry sought to hold an engineering company (Remisz) liable, as an employer, for breaching s. 31(1)(a) of the Regulation, which reads as follows:\n31. (1) Every part of a project, including a temporary structure,\n\n(a) shall be designed and constructed to support or resist all loads and forces to which it is likely to be subjected without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used;\nRemisz, based in Ottawa, had produced a sum total of two drawings in accordance with design criteria made available to it from contract drawings for the bridge. It had done so months before the accident occurred. Once the drawings were provided, Remisz received no further communication. The engineering firm acting as the constructor on-site did not review the drawings but simply filed the[m] away (para. 86 (CanLII)). The ultimate design of the bridge varied markedly from the design provided by Remisz (para. 87). As a result, the court found that Remisz was not an employer in th[e] workplace on or about [the date of the collapse and] in a position to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed in section 31(1)(a) of the [R]egulation were carried out (para. 88). The trial judge explained this as follows:\nRemisz Engineers was removed geographically, temporally, contractually from the situation at the workplace.\n\nHow can it be said that pursuant to s. 25(1), the defendant corporation could do anything on or about May 7, 2004 to ensure that prescribed measures and procedures were carried out. It is patent and the court finds that on May 7, 2004, there is no evidence suggesting that the defendant, if it be deemed an employer within the meaning of the Act, had any control over the workplace in question. In fact, the defendant learned only after the collapse, that the project had not yet been completed. The court concludes that the defendant did not have sufficient or any control on the conduct of the workplace to bring it within the obligations intended and created by this legislation. [paras. 88-89]\nI agree. In my view, Nor Eng is irreconcilable only with Martin J.s flawed interpretation of Wyssen. When the correct interpretation of Wyssen is applied to the facts in Nor Eng, it is clear that Remisz was responsible for the health and safety of its own employees or independent contractors, that is, those working in Ottawa. But Remisz was not an employer at the construction project hundreds of kilometres away in Sudbury. The trial judge correctly declined to hold that Remisz was obligated to prevent safety breaches that occurred months after it prepared its drawings and that had nothing to do with its involvement in the project.\nThe thrust of Martin J.s position is that workplaces will be safer if every employer is made responsible for every possible safety obligation. While this approach has superficial appeal (see Rowe and OBonsawin JJ., at para. 146), it also creates a clear disincentive for a municipal project owner to engage in quality control efforts. A municipality cannot monitor quality and/or contract compliance without exposing its personnel to safety breaches already existing at the construction site. Nonetheless, Martin J. would hold every project owner strictly liable for all safety hazards it encountered in its quality control efforts  and which it did nothing to create. It is this exact concern that the legislature sought to address in s. 1(3) of the Act.\nAs the trial judge correctly noted, [t]he OHSA anticipates that an Owner who has contracted with a third-party constructor will have a quality control role on the project (para. 102). Martin J.s interpretation, and that of the Court of Appeal, renders the quality control exception meaningless (2021 ONCA 252, 15 M.P.L.R. (6th) 161). It would no longer matter that owners do not become constructors by hiring quality control personnel. They would simply become employers who, in addition to constructors, have a strict duty to ensure compliance across the construction project.\nMartin J.s attempt to minimize the effect of the structural distinctions in the Act falls short. She relies on a limitless application of the belt and braces approach, repeatedly falling back on the notion of overlapping responsibilities. Properly interpreted, the Act still contemplates a significant degree of overlap. For example, the health and safety obligations of individual employers with respect to their own workers are shared with the constructor. But the structure of the Act makes it clear that constructors, not employers, are responsible for the health and safety of all workers on a construction project.\nI further agree with the submission of the intervener municipalities that general contractors bring needed expertise to the management of construction sites. By contrast, many municipalities or other project owners neither have the resources nor the institutional capacity to assume that role. The Act recognizes that worker health and safety are promoted by delegation to experts in the construction field.\nDue Diligence\nMartin J. is of the view that fairness concerns are addressed at the due diligence stage (see para. 50). With respect, the due diligence defence only becomes relevant once the elements of the statutory offence have been established. An employers ability to make out a potentially costly and burdensome defence is irrelevant to the proper interpretation of who is an employer on a construction site and to the scope of its corresponding statutory duties. This has nothing to do with stigma (para. 49), which is applicable in the context of strict liability offences. My concern is rather that, as a matter of purpose, it does not prevent future harm (ibid., citing R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154, at p. 219) to impose statutory liability on employers who have no connection to, or control over, the safety obligation in question.\nMore fundamentally, a due diligence defence will simply be unavailing in many circumstances. I fail to see how a typical employer could possibly exercise due diligence, for example, over a constructors obligation to complete an approved notification form before using a suspended work platform (s. 7.1 of the Regulation). Similarly, I fail to see how, in Nor Eng, the engineering company working in Ottawa could possibly have demonstrated due diligence to ensure the integrity of a bridge structure with which it had no involvement.\nCuriously, Martin J. finds that a close examination of the statutory scheme dispels any . . . absurdity in similar hypothetical circumstances (para. 52). Despite her conclusion that all employers act as the virtual insurer of health and safety across construction projects, she appears to suggest, at para. 52, that an employers duties may not span the entirety of the construction project. This contradicts her own interpretation of the sweeping duties of employers under s. 25(1)(c) of the Act.\nProperly interpreted, the Act does, however, contemplate a meaningful role for the due diligence defence. I simply agree with Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. that the defence applies only after it is found that a given safety obligation applied to the employer in question (see paras. 143-44). Where an employer on a construction site did have some measure of control over the safety obligation in question, the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that it took every precaution reasonable in the circumstances (s. 66(3)).\nApplication\nThe City Was Not an Employer on the Construction Project\nThe real issue in this appeal is whether the City, as project owner and employer of its quality control inspectors, had a statutory duty to ensure compliance with ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation (see Rowe and OBonsawin JJ., at para. 160). For the reasons set out below, I agree with the trial judge that the City was not an employer on the construction site as defined and intended by the Act (para. 90).\nIn this case, the Ministry argued at trial that the City had become the constructor of the Elgin Project by virtue of the amount of control it exercised (see Ont. S.C. reasons, at para. 28). The trial judge clearly and repeatedly rejected this position:\nThe role of the Inspector was to ensure that the work being performed by Interpaving was consistent with the Contract. This included the quality of workmanship, materials and compliance with the Contracts terms . . . .\n\nThe Inspectors were responsible for ensuring that requests for progress payments to contractors were supported by the nature and quality of work completed. The Inspectors also dealt with the public.\n\nThe Inspectors were not responsible for the completion of any construction work. The Inspectors did not direct any workers on the Elgin Project. The Inspectors were required to comply with Interpavings policies, including health and safety and personal protective equipment. [Emphasis added; paras. 24-26.]\nThroughout her reasons, the trial judge further emphasized that the City had no control over the project site or involvement in any construction work:\nThe fact remains that in actuality, the City did not undertake control of the Elgin Project.\n\nInterpaving had actual, factual control and direction of the Elgin Project.\n\n. . .\n\nThe City did not control the Elgin Project. Interpaving, the constructor, was responsible for health and safety. The City did not exercise control over the site to the point where they became the constructor. The City did not direct Interpaving employees. The Citys Inspectors were primarily focused on the quality of the work being performed by Interpaving. The Inspectors assessed the quality of the materials on the Elgin Project and ensured that the work was properly performed prior to Interpaving receiving progress payments.\n\n. . .\n\n. . . the City did not exercise control over the work at the Elgin Project. The City was clearly an Owner. The Inspector(s) were subject to the Constructors requirements pertaining to health and safety. The Inspector was focussed on ensuring that the work materials and work product reflected what was set out in the contract and provided feedback with regard to same. The City was clearly not an Employer. The City was not supervising the work. The City was not directing the work. The City hired a third party, Interpaving, because it had the knowledge and resources to complete the work.\n\nThere is no credible evidence in this matter that the City had control over the workplace. [Emphasis added; paras. 64-87.]\nThe Citys involvement in the project was thus limited to quality control. It was not responsible for the completion of any construction work. It did not direct or supervise any construction workers. Rather, it sent inspectors to ensure compliance with the terms of its contract, and to protect public funds, before making progress payments. This is not only commendable but also standard industry practice. The trial judges conclusions on the Citys lack of control at the project are findings of fact that deserve deference.\nIt is entirely conceivable that a different employer at the Elgin Project could share liability with Interpaving, the constructor, for breaches of ss. 65 and/or 104(3) of the Regulation. For example, if Interpaving had hired a paving company to do the grading work, that company would be an employer on the project and strictly liable for any failure to ensure the assistance of a signaller. This liability would be shared with Interpaving, which would remain responsible (as constructor) for health and safety across the project. The Act is designed to accommodate delegation and overlapping responsibilities of this nature.\nHowever, the role of a municipal project owner who hires quality control inspectors is necessarily different from that of the employer(s) involved in the actual construction work. The City undoubtedly had health and safety obligations vis-a-vis its own employees. For example, if it had engaged five or more inspectors, it would have been required to appoint a supervisor for them under s. 15(1) of the Regulation. But the provisions of the Regulation at issue in this case establish safety requirements  the need for fencing to be erected between construction work and the public and for a signaller to assist operators of heavy machinery  that can apply only to the construction project parties who undertake the construction work itself. The trial judge made it clear that the City was not involved in that work and had no control over it. She correctly held, in my view, that the City was therefore not an employer on the construction site merely by virtue of employing quality control inspectors.\nDue Diligence\nIn the alternative, the trial judge found that if the City was an employer, it exercised due diligence (paras. 91-103). To fully understand her conclusion, it is necessary to consider her extensive review of the evidence. Part of the issue at trial related to the requirement that police officers be present at active or lit intersections while construction took place (Police Requirement). This requirement was incorporated into Interpavings contract with the City (para. 18). To satisfy the Police Requirement, Interpaving would, when necessary, request officers from the Greater Sudbury Police Service (GSPS) through the City, which acted as a conduit. Two weeks prior to the accident, the Citys quality control inspector raised concerns:\n\t[the] Inspector . . . noted that the Interpaving employees were using an excavator in the intersection of Beech Street and Elm Street while pedestrians and vehicles were also using the lit intersection. Flagmen from Interpaving were attempting to direct traffic. There had not been a request by Interpaving as per the Contract or the Police Requirement for GSPS officer(s). [para. 27]\nIn response, the inspector conveyed his observations to an Interpaving supervisor, who took no action (para. 28). He then advised the chief inspector for the City, who contacted a manager at Interpaving. The manager came to the site and stopped the work in the intersection (para. 29). The inspector issued an instruction stating that work could not be performed at a lit intersection until police were present (para. 29). Nonetheless, on the day of the accident, Interpaving again worked through a lit intersection without making a request for the police (para. 30).\nBy the express terms of its contract with the City, Interpaving was responsible for compliance with the Police Requirement as well as for ensuring that the requirements of the Act were met (Ont. C.J. reasons, at paras. 10 and 18). The trial judge found that when the Citys inspectors advised Interpaving of their view that it was breaching the Police Requirement and thus the terms of its contract, the City was act[ing] appropriately by making Interpaving aware of the violation:\n[The manager] of Interpaving stopped the work through the intersection. That was the Constructor, Interpavings decision. Moreover, if this act by the City were to constitute taking over the role as Constructor, it may dissuade the City from bringing the breach to the attention of the Constructor, for fear that it would assume the role of the Constructor and all that it entails. [para. 79]\nOn Martin J.s interpretation, the City would have shared the constructors statutory obligations merely by being the employer of its quality control personnel. Not only would it have been dissuade[d] from raising issues regarding violations of the terms of its contract with Interpaving, but it would also have been dissuaded from monitoring quality and contract compliance at the project in the first place. The disincentive that Martin J.s interpretation creates  which s. 1(3) of the Act seeks to avoid  is borne out on the facts of this case.\nAs the trial judge concluded, [t]he City should be commended and not condemned for its behaviour two weeks before the accident in raising concerns about the lack of police at a lit intersection (para. 80). This was an issue of public safety (para. 80). I agree. By contrast, Martin J.s approach penalizes the City for choosing to monitor quality and contract compliance. While the Police Requirement derives from the Ontario Traffic Manual: Book 7  Temporary Conditions (2022) and the Citys role in maintaining the road network, the same disincentive issue arises with respect to Interpavings obligations under the Act. The City suggested to Interpaving that there was insufficient signage, issues with signage and insufficient access to crosswalks for the public and advised Interpaving that fencing had been knocked down on the Elgin Project (Ont. C.J. reasons, at paras. 95-96). Such action should be encouraged, not condemned.\nFor these reasons, the trial judge correctly found that even if she was wrong in concluding that the City was not an employer on the construction site, it took every precaution reasonable in the circumstances to ensure safety at the project (para. 91). With respect, my colleagues ignore both the trial judges findings on the Citys lack of control and her alternative findings on the due diligence exercised by the City in choosing to remit the matter to the trial court to reconsider the exact same issues. I strongly disagree.\nSummary and Disposition\nIn sum, it is an extravagant proposition, as noted by the intervener municipalities, to say that a municipal project owner becomes an employer of every person on a project by attending the project for the limited purpose of quality assurance (transcript, at p. 51). Properly interpreted, the obligations prescribed by ss. 65 and 104(3) of the Regulation were the responsibility of the constructor and/or the employers who performed the relevant construction work. The City had no involvement in or control over that work and was therefore not an employer at the construction project. To impose statutory liability on the City in these circumstances would be a regrettable departure from the established scheme of the Act. I would allow the appeal and restore the acquittals entered by the trial court on all charges.\nFinally, in the interests of clarity, I would respond to the three questions posed by Martin J. at para. 61 of her reasons  in the unique and distinct context of construction projects  as follows:\nWas the accused an employer under s. 1(1) of the Act?\nThe fact that a municipal project owner is the employer of quality control inspectors does not make it an employer on the construction project itself or an employer of any construction workers. The Act expressly permits a project owner to employ quality control inspectors without taking on health and safety responsibility for the project (s. 1(3)). Likewise, a project owner is not the employer of its constructor, as this would render the statutory role of constructor redundant.\nDid the accused breach s. 25(1)(c) of the Act?\nSection 25(1)(c) of the Act must be read in context, and its interpretation must be informed by the content of the accompanying, industry-specific regulations. On construction projects, employers are not responsible for obligations specifically imposed on other workplace parties or over which they have no control. As the Ministry acknowledges, the constructor is the sole authority responsible for health and safety across construction projects. Each employer is responsible for the health and safety of its own workers.\nShould the accused avoid liability because it exercised due diligence under s. 66(3) of the Act?\nThe due diligence defence only becomes relevant once the elements of the offence have been established. It does not affect the proper interpretation of the term employer or alter the nature of the offence. The defence can only possibly be discharged by an employer on a construction project with some connection to, or control over, the safety obligation in question. Otherwise, the defence will simply be unavailing.\n\tAppeal dismissed on equal division, Karakatsanis, Cote, Rowe and OBonsawin JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Stringer, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario  Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development, Legal Service Branch, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Retail Council of Canada: Norton Rose Fulbright Canada, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Regional Municipality of York, the Regional Municipality of Peel, the Regional Municipality of Durham, the Regional Municipality of Halton, the Regional Municipality of Waterloo and the Regional Municipality of Niagara: Lax OSullivan Lisus Gottlieb, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia: Workers Compensation Board of British Columbia, Richmond.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds Employer Liability for Breach of Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**\n\nThis appeal concerns the interpretation of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the liability of an employer for breaching safety regulations in the context of a construction project.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Ministry of the Attorney General charged the Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury (City) under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to ensure that certain safety requirements were met during a construction project, resulting in the death of a pedestrian. The City conceded it was the owner of the project but denied being an employer, arguing it lacked control over the repair work and had delegated control to the constructor, Interpaving.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial judge acquitted the City, finding it was not an employer under the Act and, alternatively, that it had acted with due diligence. The provincial offences appeal court upheld the acquittal, but the Court of Appeal set aside the decision, finding the City liable as an employer and remitting the question of due diligence to the provincial offences appeal court. The Supreme Court of Canada heard the appeal, with the majority agreeing with the Court of Appeal that the City was an employer and breached its duty under the Act.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nAn employer's liability for breaching safety regulations is not dependent on their control over the workplace or workers, but rather on their connection to the workplace through a contractual relationship with employees or independent contractors.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Martin J. concludes that the appeal should be dismissed. The majority holds that the City of Greater Sudbury was an employer under the Occupational Health and Safety Act and breached its duty under section 25(1)(c) by failing to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed in the Regulation were carried out in the workplace. The majority finds that the City's degree of control over the workplace or the workers is not relevant to this finding. The majority also holds that the due diligence defence under section 66(3)(b) is available to the City, and the matter is remitted to the provincial offences appeal court to consider the Ministry's appeal of the City's due diligence defence. Ultimately, the majority's decision emphasizes the importance of ensuring workplace safety and holding employers accountable for breaches of the Act.", "citation": "2023 SCC 28", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the City of Greater Sudbury\u2019s appeal in an occupational health and  safety case<em>.</em></strong>This case arises from a fatal accident and concerns the proper  interpretation of Ontario\u2019s <em>Occupational  Health and Safety Act </em>(the <em>Act</em>).  In September 2015, a pedestrian was struck and killed in Sudbury, Ontario, by  an employee of Interpaving Limited who was driving a road grader, in reverse,  through an intersection. The Corporation of the City of Greater Sudbury had  contracted with Interpaving to act as a constructor to repair a downtown water  main. Contrary to a provincial regulation on construction projects (the  Regulation), no fence was placed between the construction project workplace and  the public intersection, and no signaller was assisting the Interpaving worker.  In separate proceedings, Interpaving was convicted of breaching its duty as an  employer under section 25(1)(c) of the Act to \u201censure that\u2026the measures and  procedures prescribed [in the Regulation] are carried out in the workplace\u201d. <strong></strong>The issue in this appeal was whether the City was  liable as an employer for breaching the same duty. The City was charged by the  Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General (Ministry of Labour, Immigration,  Training and Skills Development) under section 25(1)(c). Section 1(1) of the  Act defines an employer as a person who employs or contracts for the services  of one or more workers. The City agreed it was the owner of the construction  project, but denied that it was an employer because it lacked control of the  repair work and had delegated control to Interpaving. The trial judge acquitted the City. In her view, Interpaving,  not the City, had direct control over the workers and the intersection, meaning  the City was not an employer under section 1(1) of the Act. In the alternative,  she determined even if the City had breached its obligations as an employer, she  accepted its defence that it had taken every precaution reasonable in the  circumstances, known as the due diligence defence. The Crown appealed to the  provincial offences appeal court, who upheld the City\u2019s acquittal but did not  address the trial judge\u2019s conclusion on the City\u2019s due diligence defence. \u00a0The Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously allowed  the appeal and set aside the decision of the provincial offences appeal court  judge. It applied the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d established in an earlier decision  from the Court of Appeal for Ontario \u2013 which excluded the control requirement \u2013  to find the City liable under section 25(1)(c) of the Act. It returned the  question of the City\u2019s due diligence defence to the provincial offences appeal  court for determination. The City appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court of Canada has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The City was  liable as an employer for breaching its obligations under section 25(1)(c) of  the Act. </strong>Justice Martin held that the City was an employer of  Interpaving and breached its duty under section 25(1)(c) of the Act. She  determined that nothing in the text, context or purpose of the Act requires the  Crown to establish control over the workers or workplace to prove that the City  breached its obligations as an employer under section 25(1)(c). As she stated,  \u201cdiminishing an employer\u2019s duties by reading in a control requirement\u2026 would  thwart the purpose of this remedial public welfare legislation\u201d. However, Justice Martin said control is properly  considered in deciding whether an employer who has breached its obligations in  the Act can nevertheless defend itself on the basis that it acted with due  diligence. It is open to an accused \u2013 in this case, the City \u2013 to prove that  its lack of control suggests it took all reasonable steps in the circumstances.  For these reasons, Justice Martin dismissed the appeal and upheld the Court of  Appeal\u2019s order returning the issue of the City\u2019s due diligence defence to the  provincial offences appeal court for determination.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 "}, "7": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Broadcasting Corporation\tAppellant\nv.\nHis Majesty The King,\nB.B., spouse of the late M.D., and\nJ.D., in his capacity as executor of the estate of the late M.D.\tRespondents\nand\nAttorney General of Ontario,\nAttorney General of British Columbia,\nCentre for Free Expression,\nCanadian Association of Journalists,\nNews Media Canada,\nCommunications Workers of America/Canada and\nAd Idem/Canadian Media Lawyers Association\tInterveners\nIndexed as: Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v.

These are those reasons.\nDuring wrongful conviction proceedings before the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, an accused sought to introduce as new evidence an affidavit sworn by his lawyer concerning the death of a witness involved in those proceedings. On May 28, 2018, the Court of Appeal issued a publication ban over the affidavit. In its reasons for judgment on the appeal, the court ordered that the publication ban remain in effect (2018 MBCA 125, 369 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (2018 Publication Ban Judgment)). The appellant, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), filed a motion to set aside the publication ban. In 2019, the Court of Appeal held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the motion to set aside the publication because it was functus officio (2019 MBCA 122 (2019 Jurisdiction Judgment)). The CBC sought and obtained leave to appeal both judgments to this Court.\nIn 2021, this Court heard the appeals from the 2018 Publication Ban Judgment and the 2019 Jurisdiction Judgment together. The Court allowed the appeal from the 2019 Jurisdiction Judgment and remanded to the Court of Appeal the motion to have the publication ban set aside. It also adjourned the appeal of the 2018 Publication Ban Judgment sine die (see 2021 SCC 33, which sets out the procedural background in fuller detail).\nOn January 23, 2023, the Manitoba Court of Appeal rendered judgment on the CBCs remanded motion to have the publication ban set aside (2023 MBCA 6, [2023] 9 W.W.R. 210 (Judgment on Remand)). The Court of Appeal dismissed the motion to reconsider the publication ban. First, the Court of Appeal denied the CBC standing to bring the motion as it had notice of the ban. Second, the Court of Appeal declined to hear the motion as the CBC failed to act with due dispatch in seeking to set the ban aside. In addition, the Court of Appeal wrote that in the event that it was wrong to deny standing to the CBC or to decline to hear the motion because of the delay, it would nonetheless have refused to reconsider the ban. Applying the test in Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the ban was necessary to prevent a serious risk to privacy, and in particular to dignity, an important public interest. Moreover, the benefits of the publication ban outweigh any negative effects on court openness.\nWhile the Judgment on Remand has not been appealed to this Court, in coming to our decision we have had the benefit of the Court of Appeals reasons. Those reasons explain why, in light of the principles set forth in Sherman, the publication ban was justified notwithstanding the open court principle.\nThe CBC now calls upon this Court to decide the appeal of the 2018 Publication Ban Judgment for which leave was granted in 2020 and which was adjourned sine die in 2021. The parties were invited to provide additional written submissions and a new hearing was held to address the implications of Sherman, which was decided after the initial hearing of the two appeals before this Court in 2021.\nFor the reasons that follow, we are unanimously of the view that the appeal from the 2018 Publication Ban Judgment should be dismissed. The Court of Appeal did not commit a reversible error in issuing the publication ban and ordering that it remain in effect in 2018.\nUnder Sherman, the person asking a court to exercise discretion in a way that limits the open court presumption must establish that: (1) court openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest; (2) the order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent this risk; and (3) as a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects (para. 38). Each branch of the test is deserving of comment.\nWe agree with the view that, under the first branch of the Sherman test, there is a strong public interest in protecting the privacy of the witnesss spouse with respect to the witnesss death in order to prevent an affront to the spouses dignity (see Judgment on Remand, at para. 77). We agree that personal information in the affidavit is a direct affront to the dignity of the spouse in her own right. In the words of the Court of Appeal, the information goes to the core of both the witness and the spouse as human beings at their most vulnerable (para. 77). In this case, disclosure of the affidavit would reveal highly sensitive and acutely personal information that would directly engage the spouses dignity interest.\nFor the purposes of measuring the relevant dignity interest, it is sufficient to observe that the dignity of the witnesss spouse is compromised. It is not necessary to decide the question of whether there is a dignity interest for the deceased witness to justify the publication ban here. The first branch of the Sherman test is satisfied because court openness would pose a serious risk to the spouses dignity as an important public interest.\nWe also agree that the publication ban is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the important public interest of protecting the dignity of the witnesss spouse (see Judgment on Remand, at para. 78); that the ban was not overbroad or vague, and should be permanent (para. 80); and that there was no reasonable alternative to the terms of the publication ban (para. 83). In particular, as the Court of Appeal noted in 2023, it would be easy to identify the witness if parts of the affidavit were to be disclosed. In the circumstances, the Court of Appeal was entitled to conclude in 2018 that publishing details of the affidavit without the witnesss name would risk associating the information with the witness and making the publication ban moot (see Judgment on Remand, at para. 81). The second branch of the test is therefore satisfied.\nFinally, as to the third branch, we agree with the Court of Appeal in the Judgment on Remand that the benefits of the 2018 publication ban significantly outweigh its minimal deleterious effect on the right of free expression and, by extension, the principle of open and accessible court proceedings. The benefit of the publication ban is to protect the dignity of the witnesss spouse as already explained, whereas the publication ban has a minimal negative effect on the right of free expression and the open court principle (paras. 92-93). The affidavit did not relate to the wrongful conviction or the legitimacy of the accuseds appeal before the Court of Appeal in 2018. As the Court of Appeal observed in the Judgment on Remand, the affidavit was capable of proving nothing (para. 91). Here, the affidavit was not admitted as evidence in the wrongful conviction proceedings and, therefore, did not play a role in determining that a wrongful conviction had occurred.\nIn light of the foregoing, no reversible error was made in issuing the 2018 publication ban or ordering it remain in effect and it should not be rescinded or varied in the circumstances.\nNone of the parties sought an order for costs.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we dismissed the appeal without costs.\n\tAppeal dismissed without costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: MLT Aikins, Winnipeg; Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent His Majesty The King: Department of Justice Manitoba, Constitutional Law Section, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitors for the respondents B.B., spouse of the late M.D., and J.D., in his capacity as executor of the estate of the late M.D.: Robert Gosman Law Corporation, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Crown Law Office  Criminal, Ministry of the Attorney General, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Attorney General of British Columbia, Prosecution Service, Victoria.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Centre for Free Expression, the Canadian Association of Journalists, News Media Canada and Communications Workers of America/Canada: Stockwoods, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Ad Idem/Canadian Media Lawyers Association: Linden & Associates, Toronto.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Upholds Publication Ban in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v.

The CBC challenged the ban, but the Court of Appeal denied their motion, citing the Sherman Estate v. Donovan test.

It is the second time this appeal was brought before  the Supreme Court of Canada. Mr. Frank Ostrowski was convicted of first-degree murder in 1987 and  sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. In 2014, the  federal Minister of Justice asked the Court of Appeal of Manitoba to decide if  there had been a miscarriage of justice at his 1987 trial. In 2018, the Court  of Appeal found that a miscarriage of justice had indeed occurred and set aside  his conviction. During his wrongful conviction proceedings before the  Manitoba Court of Appeal, Mr. Ostrowski sought to enter an affidavit (a sworn  statement) into evidence concerning the death of a witness involved in the  proceedings. The Court of Appeal issued a publication ban over the affidavit. In  its 2018 decision setting aside the Mr. Ostrowski\u2019s conviction, the Court of Appeal  did not accept the affidavit into evidence, but ordered that the publication  ban on its contents remain in effect. In May 2019, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (\u201cCBC\u201d)  asked the Court of Appeal to lift the publication ban by way of a motion. The Court  of Appeal refused, ruling that since it had already decided Mr. Ostrowski\u2019s case,  it no longer had authority to reconsider the publication ban.The CBC appealed the two decisions by the Court of  Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada: the 2018 decision ordering the  publication ban, and the 2019 decision refusing to reconsider the publication  ban. The Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that the Court of  Appeal did have the authority to reconsider the ban, and returned the CBC\u2019s  motion to lift the publication ban for determination. The Supreme Court then adjourned  the CBC\u2019s appeal of the ban itself. The Manitoba Court of Appeal went on to dismiss the returned  motion to lift the ban by unanimous decision. The Supreme Court is now considering  the appeal it adjourned in 2021 regarding the 2018 decision. As a general rule, court proceedings are open and  public. This is known as the open court principle, and is protected by the  right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. In light of recent <a href=\"../2021/38695-eng.pdf\">jurisprudence</a> from the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue, the CBC asked the Supreme Court  to decide whether publishing the details under the ban would constitute a risk  to the dignity of the people involved so serious that it justifies an exception  to the open court principle. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. The  judgment was delivered orally by Chief Justice Wagner on the day of the  hearing, with written reasons to follow.\u00a0 <strong>The Court of  Appeal did not make a mistake in issuing the publication ban or in ordering  that it remain in effect. </strong>The Court delivered a unanimous judgment. It said there is a strong  public interest in protecting the privacy of the spouse of the deceased witness  and disclosure of the affidavit would reveal highly sensitive and acutely  personal information that would directly engage the spouse\u2019s dignity interest. Moreover,  the publication ban is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the dignity of  the witness\u2019s spouse, it was not overbroad or vague and there was no reasonable  alternative to its terms. Finally, the Court determined the benefit of the ban significantly  outweighs its minimal negative effects on the right of free expression, and by  extension, the principle of open and accessible court proceedings.

C-46, s. 172.1(2)(a), (b).\n\tCriminal law  Sentencing  Considerations  Child luring  Accused person pleading guilty to child luring and sexual interference  Sentencing judge imposing sentence of five months imprisonment for child luring to be served concurrently to sentence for sexual interference  Majority of Court of Appeal upholding sentencing judges decision  Whether accused persons sentence for child luring was fit.\n\tM pleaded guilty to one count of sexual interference contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code and to one count of luring a child contrary to s. 172.1(1)(b). M met the victim in person when he was 22 and she was 13 years old. He then sent her a friend request on Facebook and, for the following two years, they were in contact on social media and also met in person, and had illegal sexual intercourse four separate times. At sentencing, M challenged the one-year mandatory minimum period of incarceration set out in s. 172.1(2)(a) for persons found guilty of the indictable offence of luring a child, on the basis that it was inconsistent with s. 12 of the Charter, which protects against cruel and unusual punishment. The sentencing judge sentenced M to five months imprisonment on the count of luring, to be served concurrently to the sentence imposed on the count of sexual interference. The judge found the mandatory minimum sentence infringed s. 12 of the Charter as it would be grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence of five months. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld both the sentence imposed for luring and the conclusion that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional. The Crown appeals the fitness of Ms sentence for luring and asks the Court to find the mandatory minimum sentence in s. 172.1(2)(a) constitutional.\n\tV pleaded guilty to one count of luring a child contrary to s. 172.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. V sent sexual text messages to the victim over a period of 10 days. At sentencing, V challenged the six-month mandatory minimum sentence set out in s. 172.1(2)(b) for persons found guilty of the offence of luring punishable on summary conviction, on the basis that it violated s. 12 of the Charter. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two years probation and 150 hours of community service after finding that the mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence. On appeal, the Superior Court varied the sentence to four months imprisonment. The court then determined that the mandatory minimum sentence infringed s. 12 since, although it was not grossly disproportionate to Vs fit sentence of four months, it would be when applied to reasonably foreseeable scenarios. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision. The fitness of Vs sentence is not challenged before the Court. The Crown asks the Court to find the mandatory minimum sentence in s. 172.1(2)(b) constitutional.\n\tHeld (Cote J. dissenting in part): The appeal in Ms case should be allowed in part. The appeal in Vs case should be dismissed.\n\tPer Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: Ms sentence for luring a child should be increased from 5 months to 12 months imprisonment, and it should be served consecutively, not concurrently, to his sentence for sexual interference. The mandatory minimum sentences for luring a child set out in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code are inconsistent with s. 12 of the Charter, are not saved by s. 1 and therefore are of no force or effect under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\tTo protect a range of social interests, namely the vulnerability and exploitation of children facilitated by the internet, Parliament enacted the offence of luring a child at s. 172.1 of the Criminal Code. The offence has three elements: (1) the accused must communicate intentionally by telecommunication; (2) with someone the accused knows or believes is under 18 years of age, and (3) for the specific purpose of facilitating the commission of a designated secondary offence listed in s. 172.1(1) with respect to the underage person. Parliaments creation of this inchoate preparatory offence that criminalizes communications that precede the perpetration of other designated secondary offences indicates that luring generates harms that are different from those secondary offences and is sufficiently wrongful and harmful to ground criminal liability. Child luring is a hybrid offence that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of one years imprisonment if the offender is guilty of an indictable offence (s. 172.1(2)(a)) and of six months imprisonment if the offender is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction (s. 172.1(2)(b)).\n\tPursuant to s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. A fit and proportionate sentence must be crafted based on the particular facts of the case and in light of existing legislation and case law. Furthermore, in s. 718.01, Parliament has specifically indicated that in sentencing offences involving abuse of children, including child luring, the objectives of denunciation and deterrence must be given primary consideration. While a judge can accord significant weight to other sentencing objectives, including rehabilitation, the provision limits judicial discretion as a judge cannot give these other objectives precedence or equivalency. In addition to the steps that Parliament has taken to punish the various forms that abuse of children may take, the Courts decision in R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, sets out sentencing principles for sexual offences against children to fully reflect and give effect to the profound wrongfulness and harmfulness of these crimes. Friesen sends the clear message that sentences for these crimes must account for the far-reaching and ongoing damage sexual violence causes to children, families and society at large.\n\tWith respect to the offence of child luring, understanding its wrongfulness and distinct harmfulness is integral to properly assessing its gravity and the degree of responsibility of the offender, as well as to avoiding stereotypical reasoning and the misidentification of aggravating and mitigating factors. Luring is wrongful, as adults take advantage of a childs weaker position and lack of experience online where they are particularly exposed and helpless, which repudiates the fundamental value of protecting children. Luring invades a childs personal autonomy, sexual integrity, and gravely wounds their dignity. Even when the only interactions with the child occur online, the offenders conduct is inherently wrong because it still constitutes a form of sexual abuse.\n\tFurthermore, luring is harmful as it can constitute a form of psychological sexual violence, bringing about serious emotional and psychological harm. It also causes distinct psychological and developmental harms to young victims that differ in two main ways from harms arising from sexual contact initiated in person. First, online communications allow for abusers to abuse remotely and for manipulation and control over time, which can lead to serious and lasting psychological consequences. Second, an offenders power and effectiveness online lies in the degree to which they can control the victim and manipulate them into engaging with the abuse, which may cause a victim to feel they actively participated in their own abuse, thereby increasing self-blame and shame. Although identifying the distinct harms of luring is difficult, one way for courts to do so is by differentiating between contact-driven luring, where the offenders goal is to facilitate in-person sexual abuse, and luring that leads to sexual abuse occurring entirely online. Contact-driven luring is not necessarily more or less harmful than luring that leads to sexual abuse that occurs entirely online. The severity of the harm caused by the online communication will depend on the individual offender, the individual characteristics of the victim, and the unique dynamic between the offender and the victim.\n\tParliament has consistently raised sentences for sexual offences against children to reflect a growing awareness of their gravity, and to indicate the serious emotional and psychological harms they cause for victims. Given the wrongfulness and distinct harms of luring, this same increasingly punitive trend applies to that offence. Appellate intervention in a sentencing judges decision will be justified only if a sentence is demonstrably unfit or if the judge committed an error in principle that impacted the sentence imposed. In Ms case, the sentencing judge committed errors in principle that impacted the assigned sentence of five months imprisonment ordered to be served concurrently and that warranted appellate intervention that the majority of the Court of Appeal failed to undertake. Specifically, the judge erred by (1) minimizing the harm caused to the victim by failing to recognize the grooming that did occur, which should have served as an aggravating factor on sentencing; (2) misconstruing the offenders actions, which caused her to unduly minimize the wrongfulness and harms of the luring offence; and (3) assigning a concurrent sentence for the luring offence. To properly account for the distinct legal interests that the luring offence protects, that is, the vulnerability and exploitation of children facilitated by the internet, the sentences should have been consecutive. Parliaments legislative initiatives, the distinct harm caused by the online communication, and the aggravating and mitigating factors instead justify a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for M.\n\tFor a mandatory minimum sentence to be found unconstitutional pursuant to s. 12 of the Charter, it must be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency. Whether the mandatory minimum sentences in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) are unconstitutional requires a two-stage inquiry that involves a contextual and comparative analysis. First, a court must set a fit and proportionate sentence for the individual offenders before the court and possibly other reasonably foreseeable offenders. Second, a court must determine whether the mandatory minimum requires imposing a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the otherwise fit and proportionate sentence. This involves consideration of the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the individual or reasonably foreseeable offender, and the penalty and its objectives.\n\tWhile a proper understanding of the wrongfulness and harmfulness of luring will lead to significant penalties in most circumstances, the constitutional analysis under s. 12 of the Charter does not merely ask whether the mandatory minimum is cruel and unusual in common cases. Punishments can be impugned where they infringe the s. 12 Charter rights of a reasonably foreseeable offender. Indeed, the use of reasonably foreseeable scenarios is expressly designed to test the lower end of the spectrum of conduct captured by the offence. As such, when parties raise hypothetical scenarios as part of the adversarial process, a court should not dismiss a constitutional challenge without considering (1) whether the scenario is reasonably foreseeable and, if so, (2) whether the representative offenders scenario could render the impugned law unconstitutional.\n\tIn Ms case, the fit sentence of 12 months incarceration mirrors the one-year mandatory minimum sentence. As a result, the minimum sentence is not grossly disproportionate in his circumstances. In Vs case, the six-month mandatory minimum term of imprisonment is not grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence of four months imprisonment. Reasonably foreseeable scenarios must therefore be considered to determine whether the mandatory minimum sentences are unconstitutional. For the purposes of the constitutionality analysis for the one-year mandatory minimum sentence in s. 172.1(2)(a), the first reasonably foreseeable scenario involves a representative offender who is a first-year high school teacher in her late 20s with bipolar disorder and with no criminal record. One evening, she texts her 15-year-old student to inquire about a school assignment. Feeling manic, she directs the conversation to sexual matters. The two meet that evening and participate in sexual touching. The offender does not engage inappropriately with the student again and pleads guilty and expresses remorse on sentencing. For the purposes of the constitutionality analysis for the six-month mandatory minimum sentence in s. 172.1(2)(b), the reasonably foreseeable scenario involves an 18-year old representative offender who is in a relationship with a 17-year-old. In one text, the offender asks her to send him an explicit photo. She does, and he then forwards that photo to his friend without his girlfriends knowledge. This friend, who is also 18, does not transmit this photo, but retains it on his mobile phone.\n\tIn addressing the first stage of the s. 12 analysis of setting the fit and proportionate sentence for the representative offender, courts must define as specific a sentence as possible by considering the sentencing objectives set out in the Criminal Code and by examining any aggravating and mitigating factors. A fit sentence for the luring offence committed by the representative offender in the first scenario is a 30-day intermittent sentence. Such a sentence recognizes the inherent seriousness and potential harms associated with the offence and appropriately denounces the offenders conduct, while being mindful of her diminished moral blameworthiness and the mitigating factors at play. A fit sentence for the luring offence committed by the representative offender in the second scenario is a six-month conditional discharge, with strict probationary terms. The offender engaged in a serious breach of the victims privacy and dignity that should be condemned by a criminal sanction. However, the significant mitigating factors in this scenario, most notably the offenders youth and lack of a criminal record, warrant a sentence on the low end of the spectrum.\n\tAt the second stage of the s. 12 analysis, the scope and reach of the offence must be examined. Courts should assess how broad a range of conduct is captured by the actus reus and mens rea of the offence and consider the included degree of variation in the offences gravity and the offenders culpability. The actus reus of child luring includes communication with the victim by use of any telecommunication platform. This demonstrates the massive breadth of the luring offence. Regarding the mens rea, the specific intent element  that the accused must communicate with the purpose of facilitating a designated offence  is broad. An accused may impulsively communicate in a sexual manner  and in that moment have the specific intent required  without having taken time beforehand to plan or prepare to execute a secondary offence. The offence therefore captures a wide range of designated illicit purposes with varying degrees of moral culpability. The range of conduct captured by the luring offence is also staggering. The offender need only communicate with an underage person for the purpose of facilitating one of the twenty designated secondary offences which are, amongst themselves, of varying degrees of seriousness and wide in scope. These features of the luring offence further threaten the constitutionality of its mandatory minimum penalties.\n\tNext, in analyzing the effect of the punishment on representative offenders, courts must consider the qualities of the reasonably foreseeable offender, and then evaluate what harm may result from the impugned punishment. Evidence that imprisonment would have significant deleterious effects on an offender should be considered at this stage. In the instant scenarios, the mandatory minimum punishment is alternatively one years or six months incarceration. The effect of the one-year mandatory minimum on the first representative offender is harsh, as it would replace a short intermittent sentence with a year of incarceration, and the offenders individual circumstances, namely her mental illness, would likely make her experience of incarceration perilously grave. The second representative offender is a youthful first-time offender who, holding high rehabilitative prospects, should benefit from the shortest possible sentence proportionate to the offence. In prison, youthful offenders are often bullied, pressured to join adult prison gangs, and are vulnerable to segregation placements. The six-month mandatory minimum is a far cry from the shortest possible rehabilitative sentence for this offender. These factors indicate the mandatory minimum sentences constitutional infirmity.\n\tFinally, turning to the penalty and its objectives, luring is a serious offence that must be punished accordingly. The offence dovetails with s. 718.01 which directs that in imposing sentences for offences involving abuse of children, primary consideration must be given to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence. Parliaments decision to increase the maximum penalties over the years for the luring offence indicates its view of the gravity of the offence. Parliament enacted s. 172.1 in response to the growth of the internet as a burgeoning domain for predators to target children. Child luring not only lays the foundation for dangerous in-person criminal offences, it also causes its own distinct harm to child victims. However, the mandatory minimum sentences go beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliaments sentencing objectives. The incredible breadth of the luring offence and its harsh effect on representative offenders paired with the discordant internal scheme of the penalty renders the mandatory minimum sentences in s. 172.1(2) constitutionally infirm. The mandatory minimum penalties in both s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) are therefore grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for the representative offenders and hence unconstitutional.\n\tPer Cote J. (dissenting in part): The appeals should be allowed. There is agreement with the majority concerning the sentence to be imposed on M. However, the minimum terms of imprisonment of six months or one year, depending on whether the Crown proceeds summarily or by indictment, as provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code, are not contrary to s. 12 of the Charter. The four-month sentence imposed on V should therefore be set aside and the mandatory minimum sentence of six months imprisonment should be imposed on him, with a permanent stay of execution.\n\tAccording to Friesen, courts must impose more severe sentences on offenders who have committed offences that involve the abuse of children and must prioritize denunciation and deterrence, as required by s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code. The imposition of minimum terms of imprisonment of one year on M and six months on V is not cruel and unusual. Nor do the two reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios identified by the majority show that the minimum sentences provided for in s. 172.1(2) are grossly disproportionate.\n\tFor the offender in the first reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenario, a 30-day term of imprisonment to be served intermittently is far too lenient a sentence. The conduct of an offender who takes advantage of her status as a teacher to exploit a child for sexual purposes is highly blameworthy and is likely to have devastating consequences for the child victim. This harm is all the more serious given the fact that the commission of the offence involves abuse of a position of trust and authority. Moreover, the fact that an act was committed spontaneously does not automatically lead to the conclusion that an offender had no subjective intent to act and that the conduct in question is therefore less blameworthy. The absence of grooming and premeditation must have a neutral effect on sentencing. Given the moral blameworthiness inherent in an offence like child luring, the abuse of a position of trust and the commission of an underlying offence, and also given the significant age difference between the offender in the first scenario and the complainant as well as the complainants vulnerability, the fit and appropriate sentence is a nine-month term of imprisonment. Such a penalty acknowledges the role played by the offenders mental illness, along with her guilty plea and the remorse she expressed.\n\tThe fit and appropriate sentence for the offender in the second reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenario  who was in a romantic relationship with the underage victim and who abused a position of trust in relation to her  is not a conditional discharge but rather a six-month term of imprisonment. Denunciation and deterrence must be prioritized in the context of the commission of an offence involving the abuse of the offenders intimate partner as well as in cases involving sexual violence against a minor, two aggravating circumstances that increase the subjective gravity of the offence. Rehabilitation of an offender with no record who has just reached adulthood is not a paramount factor for serious offences or offences involving violence. The weight to be given to the offenders young age and to the absence of a criminal record therefore depends on the nature of the offence of which the offender is convicted. Taking advantage of the existence of a relationship of trust is likely to increase the harm to the victim and thus the gravity of the offence. It will be more difficult to grant a discharge for offences committed against a child or an intimate partner.\n\tGiven that the fit and appropriate sentence is equal to or greater than a six-month term of imprisonment in both reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios, the first stage of the analytical framework that must be applied under s. 12 of the Charter decides the constitutionality of s. 172.1(2)(b). The second stage of the analytical framework therefore concerns the constitutionality of the one-year minimum term of imprisonment set out in s. 172.1(2)(a).\n\tTo begin with, while the offence of child luring is broad in scope, requiring a high level of mens rea ensures that the offence captures only conduct that involves a high degree of moral blameworthiness as well as serious harm or a risk of such harm. Even when the offence of luring is committed in the context of a police sting operation that does not involve children, the offence involves conduct that is undeniably very serious, and it must never be seen as a victimless crime. In addition, one must be careful not to emphasize the fact that it is not necessary for the offender to have committed one of the listed underlying offences in order to be convicted of child luring. Sophistication and premeditation also reveal nothing about the scope of the offence, because they are not essential elements of the offence.\n\tNext, the effects of the minimum term of imprisonment on the offenders in the reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios are not incompatible with human dignity. Nothing in the record makes it possible to identify the precise harm associated with the additional period of imprisonment of three months in the first case and six months in the second case if the offence is prosecuted by indictment. Since the period is relatively short, its effects are not incompatible with human dignity. The logical consequence of finding that the individual circumstances of the offender in the first scenario would likely make her experience of incarceration perilously grave, and that the minimum sentence is a far cry from the shortest possible rehabilitative sentence for the offender in the second scenario, is that any minimum term of imprisonment that may be imposed on an offender who has just reached adulthood or on a person with a mental illness will be grossly disproportionate, regardless of the gravity of the offence or the circumstances surrounding its commission. This consequence is entirely inconsistent with the deference owed to Parliament.\n\tLastly, the minimum term of imprisonment is not grossly disproportionate to what is necessary to achieve Parliaments objectives. The difference of three or six months between the fit and appropriate sentence and the sentence provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) is not so great as to show that the punishment chosen by Parliament grossly exceeds what is necessary to achieve its objectives of deterrence and denunciation of sexual violence against children. The fact that there may be some disproportion the application of which leads to a demonstrably unfit punishment is not sufficient to declare s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) unconstitutional. The question is not whether Parliament chose the least restrictive means to achieve its objectives. Parliament is perfectly at liberty to prioritize denunciation and deterrence to the near complete exclusion of rehabilitation, provided that it leaves a door open for this latter objective. It has not been shown how, by creating minimum terms of imprisonment in s. 172.1(2), Parliament has completely excluded this objective.\n\tIn light of the pronouncements in Friesen and the high standard that applies in an analysis under s. 12 of the Charter, sentencing an offender to imprisonment for six months or one year for communicating with a minor for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a sexual offence or other specified offence against the minor is not one of the instances in which the demanding and rarely attained standard of gross disproportionality is met.\nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

Children, who now spend significant amounts of time online, are increasingly susceptible to online exploitation and abuse. The dangers of sexualizing children are increasingly well-documented and the harms that result from their victimization are now more fully understood. As a result, Parliament has taken several steps to prevent and punish the various forms that abuse of children may take, including enacting a separate offence of child luring, which is set out at s. 172.1(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. This offence is committed when an adult uses technology to communicate with a child, or a person believed to be a child, for the purposes of facilitating a designated secondary sexual offence against that child. Luring is a hybrid offence that carries two different mandatory minimum periods of incarceration depending on whether the Crown elects to proceed summarily or by indictment.\nTwo legal issues arise in these companion appeals. First, in Mr. Bertrand Marchands matter, the Crown appellants have questioned the fitness of Mr. Bertrand Marchands sentence for luring. This requires an examination of the sentencing principles for this separate and specific offence, based on a modern understanding of its gravity and associated harms. In R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, this Court articulated the various serious and potentially life-long consequences associated with sexual violence against children. I build on that analysis and explain the distinct harms of the child luring offence so that its full gravity animates the governing sentencing principles and informs their constitutional status. In Mr. Bertrand Marchands case, after applying the correct sentencing principles, I increase his sentence from five months to one year imprisonment, and find that it should be served consecutively, and not concurrently, to the other offence for which he was sentenced. In H.V.s matter, the fitness of H.V.s sentence was not challenged before this Court.\nSecond, both respondents in the companion appeals ask the Court to uphold the conclusions in the respective courts below that the mandatory minimum sentences outlined in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) are inconsistent with s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and therefore of no force or effect. Mr. Bertrand Marchand argues against the one-year mandatory minimum period of incarceration imposed when the Crown proceeds by indictment (s. 172.1(2)(a)), and H.V. impugns the six-month mandatory minimum period of incarceration imposed when the Crown proceeds summarily (s. 172.1(2)(b)). For their part, the Crown appellants ask that the Court affirm the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences. While this Court has previously noted that the one-year obligatory penalty concerning s. 172.1(2)(a) is constitutionally suspect (R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 146), this is the first time the Court squarely addresses the constitutional validity of both penalties. \nA thorough analysis reveals that these mandatory minimum sentences infringe the Charters s. 12 protection against cruel and unusual punishment. The mandatory periods of incarceration apply to such an exceptionally wide scope of conduct that the result is grossly disproportionate punishments in reasonably foreseeable scenarios. \nInvalidating the mandatory minimums does not mean that child luring is a less serious offence. Based on the distinct and insidious psychological damage luring generates, in some cases the appropriate penalty for child luring will be imprisonment for a period equal to or longer than that set out in the unconstitutional mandatory minimum sentences. In these appeals, the reasonably foreseeable scenarios proffered produce fewer harms, and are presented in circumstances where the moral culpability of the offender is reduced. The broad reach and range of the offence means that a defined minimum period of imprisonment in all cases will sometimes produce results so excessive as to outrage standards of decency.\nThe Luring Offence \nSince 1987, Parliament has taken a child-centred approach to sexual offences against children, emphasized the inherently exploitative nature of adult/child sexual contact, and focussed on the profound harms these crimes produce (see Bill C-15, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 19 (3rd Supp.); Friesen, at para. 53). \nTo protect a range of social interests, Parliament enacted the offence of luring a child, at s. 172.1 of the Criminal Code, in 2002 (Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001, S.C. 2002, c. 13, s. 8), and introduced the mandatory minimum sentences in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) of that provision, in 2012 (Safe Streets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1, s. 22). The online world and digital communications between adults and children warrant special regulation because children are particularly vulnerable to manipulation in online settings (R. v. Rayo, 2018 QCCA 824, at para. 141 (CanLII), per Kasirer J.A.). The internet has infinitely expanded the opportunity for offenders to attract or ensnare children and the enactment of a distinct crime protects them from the possibility of sexual exploitation facilitated by the internet (R. v. Reynard, 2015 BCCA 455, 378 B.C.A.C. 293, at para. 19). The luring offence helps keep children safe in a virtual environment and was intended to meet the very specific danger posed by certain kinds of communications via computer systems (R. v. Alicandro, 2009 ONCA 133, 95 O.R. (3d) 173, at para. 36, per Doherty J.A.). \nParliament thus created this inchoate preparatory offence to criminalize sexualized communications with children that precede or pave the way for the perpetration of other offences set out in the Criminal Code (Rayo, at para. 9; R. v. Legare, 2009 SCC 56, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 551, at para. 25; Alicandro, at para. 20, citing A. Ashworth, Principles of Criminal Law (5th ed. 2006), at pp. 468-70). The purpose of s. 172.1 is both remedial and preventative. It was enacted to combat the very real threat posed by adult predators who attempt to groom or lure children by electronic means (Morrison, at para. 39). The provision seeks to safeguard children from sexual abuse by identifying and apprehending offenders before they commit a designated offence (Legare, at paras. 25-27, citing Alicandro).\nSection 172.1(1) and (2) reads:\n172.1 (1) Every person commits an offence who, by a means of telecommunication, communicates with\n\n(a) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 18 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence with respect to that person under subsection 153(1), section 155, 163.1, 170, 171 or 279.011 or subsection 279.02(2), 279.03(2), 286.1(2), 286.2(2) or 286.3(2);\n\n(b) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 16 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 160(3) or 173(2) or section 271, 272, 273 or 280 with respect to that person; or\n\n(c) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 14 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under section 281 with respect to that person.\n\n(2) Every person who commits an offence under subsection (1)\n\n(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 14 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or\n\n(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years less a day and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of six months.\nThe text, context and purpose of s. 172.1(1) demonstrates that it casts, and was intended to cast, a wide net of potential liability for those who lure children in a virtual environment. This provision is triggered by communicating by a means of telecommunication, which is defined broadly in s. 35(1) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21. While the communication must be for the purpose of facilitating any one of the designated secondary offences against children found in s. 172.1, there are 20 such secondary offences listed. The scope of these secondary offences is extensive and covers a wide range of conduct, including sexual exploitation, sexual assault, incest and child pornography. \nSection 172.1(1) proscribes communicating by telecommunication with an underage person or a person the accused believes to be underage for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the designated secondary offences with respect to that person (R. v. Levigne, 2010 SCC 25, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 23; Morrison, at para. 4). While a specific intention to facilitate a designated secondary offence forms part of the requisite mens rea, criminal liability will crystallize before any actions are taken on the part of the accused to engage in a designated offence (R. v. Collins, 2013 ONCA 392). The offence of luring does not require that the parties ever meet or touch. \nThough luring requires that an offender intend to facilitate the commission of a listed secondary offence, the offence of luring is separate and independent from that secondary offence. The preparatory conduct of luring, meant to culminate in the commission of a completed crime (Legare, at para. 25), produces its own distinct form of wrongfulness and harms. By making luring a discrete offence, Parliament indicated that these illegal communications generate harms that are different from those caught in the secondary offences in s. 172.1(1), and they are sufficiently wrongful and harmful to ground criminal liability.\nMany cases of luring involve multiple communications over a period of time, or what is sometimes described as grooming. However, luring does not require sustained contact. When the other elements of the offence are satisfied, the offence can be committed even by sending one message.\nThe luring offence captures communications sent to an actual child, which means a person under 18 years of age (or 16 or 14, depending on the applicable paragraph). It also applies whenever the adult believes the recipient of the communication is a child, even if that is not in fact the case. As a result, criminal liability may arise when the adults internet interlocutor is really a police officer pretending to be a child during a sting operation. \nChild luring is a hybrid offence, meaning that the Crown can choose, based on factors such as the seriousness of the accuseds actions and the harm caused, to proceed either by indictment or summarily. Parliament has set two mandatory minimum penalties for luring, in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b), depending on how the charge is laid. The indictable offence of luring for which Mr. Bertrand Marchand was charged carries a mandatory minimum punishment of one years imprisonment and a maximum of 14 years. The summary conviction offence for which H.V. was charged carries a mandatory minimum punishment of six months imprisonment and a maximum of two years less a day. Both offenders pleaded guilty to child luring and challenged the constitutionality of these mandatory minimum punishments as applied to themselves or other reasonably foreseeable offenders. Mr. Bertrand Marchands sentence for one of the designated secondary offences, sexual interference, is not at issue in this appeal.\nThe Appeal of Mr. Bertrand Marchands Sentence \nBefore this Court, apart from the constitutional question raised, the Crown in Mr. Bertrand Marchands case also separately appealed the fitness his five-month concurrent sentence for luring. In this part of the reasons, I set out the facts and judicial history of that appeal, apply the approach and insights of Friesen to the specific wrongfulness and harms of child luring, review the errors committed by the sentencing judge and set a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Bertrand Marchand.\nFacts \nMaxime Bertrand Marchand met the victim in person in early August 2013, when he was 22 and she was, to his knowledge, 13 years old. In the weeks that followed, he sent her a friend request on Facebook, which she accepted. Over the next two years, they were in contact on social media and also met in person. Between August 1, 2013 and July 19, 2015, Mr. Bertrand Marchand had illegal sexual intercourse with the victim four separate times. As a result of these events, the Crown charged him with one count of sexual interference contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code for this time period. \nMr. Bertrand Marchand was also charged with one count of luring a child contrary to s. 172.1(1)(b). Throughout their contact, Mr. Bertrand Marchand used Facebook messenger, and other means of telecommunications, to stay in touch with the victim and to arrange meetings. The time frame in the luring count was restricted to the period between February 25, 2015 and September 13, 2015. During this period, he turned 24 and she was 15.\nIn the fall of 2014, as well as during the period covered in the indictment for the count of luring, the victim was living at a rehabilitation centre. Mr. Bertrand Marchands online communications with the victim repeatedly raised the possibility of getting together in person and resulted in a meeting on July 19, 2015, which formed the basis for the fourth occurrence of sexual interference. On that day, the victim paid a weekend visit to her foster family, but afterwards did not return directly to the rehabilitation centre. Instead, she went with Mr. Bertrand Marchand to his home, and he had illegal sexual intercourse with her. After this, their social media exchanges became less frequent and eventually ceased completely. In September 2015, the victim provided her statement to the police and filed a complaint. The communications that preceded and followed this final act of sexual interference form the basis for the luring charge against Mr. Bertrand Marchand. \nJudicial History\nMr. Bertrand Marchand pleaded guilty to one count of sexual interference and one count of child luring. He was sentenced to a 10-month term of imprisonment for sexual interference (2020 QCCQ 1135). The sentencing judge found that the appropriate sentence for the luring charge was five months imprisonment to be served concurrently to the sentence for sexual interference. She imposed that sentence after finding the mandatory term of one years imprisonment infringed s. 12 of the Charter as it would be grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence of five months. It was therefore declared of no force or effect in his regard.\nIn fixing the luring sentence at five months imprisonment, the sentencing judge determined that this was not a [translation] classic case of luring where a sexual predator . . . goes on the Internet to find a young victim and facilitate the commission of sexual offences (para. 64). The online communications were [translation] instead repeated attempts, through the use of electronic conversations, to have sexual intercourse with her again (para. 70). She also held that [translation] the means used by the offender to communicate with [the victim] is a generational choice rather than a means specifically chosen to anonymously browse various websites searching for a young victim (para. 67) and added that [w]ere it not for the adolescents access to this type of media, the offender never would have succeeded in maintaining the conversations that enabled them to have their repeated rendezvous (para. 65). \nThe sentencing judge went on to distinguish this case from one of grooming, noting that [translation] the acts . . . do not constitute grooming of the adolescent for the purpose of lowering her inhibitions and convincing her to participate in sexual activities because [the victim] had already consented to such activities three times (para. 70). She added that [translation] [t]he luring to which the offender pleaded guilty does not cover a period of grooming in preparation for the commission of other offences. It concerns communications leading to the repetition of sexual encounters (para. 78). \nUltimately, the sentencing judge found that the effects of the luring were unlike the usual cases. She concluded that the communications simply served the function of repeating sexual encounters, and that the communications were not grooming with the aim of convincing [the victim] to participate in sexual activities (para. 70). Without this grooming, she found [translation] [t]he distinct social interest that luring aims to protect in nearly every situation is not present here, given the specific circumstances of this case (para. 79). As such, she concluded the luring sentence should be served concurrently with the 10 months imprisonment imposed in respect of the sexual interference offence.\nThe majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal (2021 QCCA 1285) dismissed the appeal as it saw no grounds to intervene. It upheld both the punishment imposed for luring and the conclusion that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional. Levesque J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal, set aside the luring sentence and the constitutional declaration of inoperability and sentenced Mr. Bertrand Marchand to 12 months imprisonment for luring to be served concurrently to the sentence for sexual interference. Because this was the sentence required under the impugned mandatory minimum, he declined to rule on its constitutionality even though Mr. Bertrand Marchand had also impugned the penalty by advancing a reasonable hypothetical scenario involving a representative offender.\nThe appellants invite this Court to substitute Mr. Bertrand Marchands 5-month sentence with a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for the luring offence. They argue the sentencing judge should not have departed from the applicable sentencing range of 12 to 24 months or imposed a concurrent sentence.\nMr. Bertrand Marchands Sentence Does Not Reflect This Courts Direction in Friesen\nMr. Bertrand Marchand was sentenced in March 2020 and this Courts decision in Friesen was released in April 2020. This explains the appellants concern that the sentencing judges reasons were out of step with Friesen and Parliaments intent in sentencing offenders for sexual offences against children (A.F., at para. 21). In Friesen, this Court set out sentencing principles for sexual offences against children to fully reflect and give effect to the profound wrongfulness and harmfulness of these crimes (para. 1). \nA fit and proportionate sentence must be crafted based on the particular facts of the case and in light of existing legislation and case law (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 43). Pursuant to s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, it is a fundamental principle that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender (see also R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089). Section 718.2 enumerates a number of other sentencing principles, including the consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and parity in sentencing.\nParliament has specifically indicated that in sentencing offences involving abuse of children, including child luring, the objectives of denunciation and deterrence must be given primary consideration or une attention particuliere (Friesen, at para. 101; Criminal Code, s. 718.01). Section 718.01s open textured language limits judicial discretion by giving priority to these objectives, but their primary importance does not exclude consideration of other sentencing objectives, including rehabilitation (Rayo, at paras. 102-8). The judge can accord significant weight to other factors, but cannot give them precedence or equivalency (Friesen, at para. 104, citing Rayo, at paras. 103 and 107-8; see also R. v. J. (T.), 2021 ONCA 392, 156 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 27). \nIn Friesen, the offender was sentenced for sexual interference with a four-year-old child and the subsequent extortion of the childs mother. The Court noted expressly that, given these facts, its primary focus was to provide direction on how to impose fit and proportionate sentences for sexual interference and closely related offences, like sexual assault and incest (para. 44). \nFriesen recognized that the focus of the legislative scheme of sexual offences against children has shifted to protect a childs personal autonomy, bodily integrity, sexual integrity, dignity and equality (paras. 51 and 55, citing E. Craig, Troubling Sex: Towards a Legal Theory of Sexual Integrity (2012), at p. 68; see also R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at paras. 172, 174 and 185, per LHeureux-Dube, Gonthier and Bastarache JJ.). The Court outlined how sexual offences against children produce profound physical and psychological harms to the most vulnerable members of our society. It was deeply concerned with how the sexual assault of children may produce shame, embarrassment, unresolved anger, a reduced ability to trust and fear that other people would also abuse them (Friesen, at para. 57). It set out the disproportionate impact of violence on girls, women, Indigenous persons and other vulnerable groups. \nFriesen sends the clear message that sentences for these crimes must account for the far-reaching and ongoing damage sexual violence causes to children, families and society at large, which may take many years to manifest. Consequently, sentences for offences involving sexual violence against children must generally increase to reflect societys modern understanding of such offences and Parliaments choice to increase the sentences associated with these crimes (paras. 3-5). \nFriesen sets out a useful method of analysis which places children, and the harm they suffer, at the centre of the discussion. Its message is not limited to offences which include physical contact. Instead, its general framework and lessons can be applied to sentencing other forms of sexual abuse of children. Indeed, its sentencing principles also have relevance to sentencing for other sexual offences against children, such as child luring (para. 44; see also paras. 46-47).\nIn applying Friesens principles to the offence of child luring, I explore its inherent wrongfulness and distinct harms and the legislative trend towards increasingly punitive sentences.\nThe Wrongfulness of Luring \nSexual offences against children are crimes that wrongfully exploit childrens vulnerability (Friesen, at para. 5). In committing the offence of luring, the adult takes advantage of the childs weaker position and lack of experience and by doing so repudiates the fundamental value of protecting children (para. 65; R. v. Melrose, 2021 ABQB 73, [2021] 8 W.W.R. 467, at para. 54). Children are particularly exposed and helpless online: the internet allows offenders direct, sometimes anonymous, and often secret or unsupervised access to children, frequently in the privacy and safety of their own homes (R. v. Folino (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at para. 25; R. v. Symes, [2005] O.J. No. 6041 (QL), at para. 29; R. v. Paradee, 2013 ABCA 41, 542 A.R. 222, at para. 12; R. v. Hajar, 2016 ABCA 222, [2016] 12 W.W.R. 435, at paras. 279-80). In these online fora, there is often very little that can be done to shield children from the inherent power imbalance present in luring (R. v. Sutherland, 2019 NWTSC 48, [2020] 3 W.W.R. 771, at para. 50; Hajar, at para. 279). Luring wrongfully takes advantage of this unsupervised access to children and wrongfully exploits childrens vulnerabilities (R. v. Wall, 2023 ABPC 3, at para. 42 (CanLII)). \nThe sexualization of children is itself morally blameworthy conduct. Luring invades a childs personal autonomy, sexual integrity, and gravely wounds their dignity (Friesen, at para. 51). Using any person as a means to an end is unethical, but an adults manipulation of a child to satisfy their sexual urges is highly blameworthy conduct. It is for these reasons that luring is recognized as manifestly harmful and wrongful (R. v. Misay, 2021 ABQB 485, [2022] 1 W.W.R. 145, at para. 52). Even when the only interactions with the child occur online, the offenders conduct is inherently wrong because it still constitutes a form of sexual abuse (R. v. R.S.F., 2021 MBQB 261, at para. 91 (CanLII)). While the degree of exploitation may vary from case to case, the wrongfulness of the exploitation of children is always relevant to the gravity of the offence (Friesen, at para. 78).\nThe Separate Harm of Luring\nIt is now well established that sexual offences against children cause significant harm. The adverse impacts of sexual violence against children hinder normal social growth, and can cause several lasting psychosocial problems. When children are young, inexperienced and still developing, the harms caused by even a single instance of sexual violence can permanently alter the course of their lives. Many survivors carry childhood sexual abuse with them throughout their adulthood, and it can permeate every aspect of their lives.\nThis Court has noted that [e]ven in child luring cases where all interactions occur online, the offenders conduct can constitute a form of psychological sexual violence that has the potential to cause serious harm (Friesen, at para. 82, citing R. v. Rafiq, 2015 ONCA 768, 342 O.A.C. 193). With sexual abuse comes serious emotional and psychological harm that may often be more pervasive and permanent in its effect than any physical harm (Friesen, at para. 56, citing R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at p. 81). Victims of luring often suffer a range of negative impacts including negative sexual development, subsequent substance misuse and depressive symptomology (G. N. Say et al., Abuse Characteristics and Psychiatric Consequences Associated with Online Sexual Abuse (2015), 18 Cyberpsychol., Behav., and Soc. Netw. 333). \nChild luring can also cause distinct psychological and developmental harms to young victims that differ in two main ways from harms arising from sexual contact initiated in person. First, online communication allows for abusers to get into the victims head and abuse remotely and for manipulation and control over time which can lead to serious and lasting psychological consequences (Rafiq, at para. 44). Because the communications in luring often intentionally emulate positive relationships, it can be difficult for victims to trust anyone intimately following this experience (E. Hanson, The Impact of Online Sexual Abuse on Children and Young People, in J. Brown, ed., Online Risk to Children: Impact, Protection and Prevention (1st ed. 2017), 97, at p. 115).\nSecond, since offenders cannot physically touch their victims when communicating with them online, their power and the effectiveness of their strategies often lie in the degree to which they can control the victim and manipulate them into engaging with the abuse. Victims of luring often feel that they actively participated in their own abuse, which may increase self-blame, internalization and shame. This worsens the psychological harm (J. Steel et al., Psychological sequelae of childhood sexual abuse: abuse-related characteristics, coping strategies, and attributional style (2004), 28 Child Abuse & Negl. 785, at pp. 795-96; P. Gilbert, What Is Shame? Some Core Issues and Controversies, in P. Gilbert and B. Andrews, eds., Shame: Interpersonal Behavior, Psychopathology and Culture (1998), 3, at p. 27). \nPrior jurisprudence has shed light on this distinct harm. In R. v. J.R., 2021 ONCJ 14, at para. 16 (CanLII), the victim described the confusion, shame and emotional harm that accompanied the luring and extortion she faced. In Rayo, the victim experienced feelings of guilt, shame and anxiety, and reported that [translation] she had lost confidence in herself and that the events had led her to self-mutilation and suicidal thoughts (para. 174). In R. v. Roy, 2020 QCCQ 4546, the victim had difficulty sleeping for several weeks following the offence, lost confidence in herself and still struggled to trust others (para. 51 (CanLII)). In R.S.F., although the victim was not physically touched, her mind was manipulated, she had nightmares about being hurt again and she suffered from overwhelming and significant anxiety, depression and post-traumatic disorder (paras. 34-35).\nFriesen recognized that sexual violence against children also affects other people in the victims lives (para. 76). The Court highlighted the harmful ripple effects on families, community and society (para. 63). Child luring can similarly destroy trust in friends, families and social institutions and cause children to shut parents out of their lives. In Rayo, the luring prompted a severe conflict between the child and her mother (para. 174). In Rafiq, the luring led the victim to close herself off from her family (paras. 40-41). \nIdentifying the distinct harms of luring in each case may prove more or less difficult, depending on the circumstances. In cases where luring is the standalone offence, identifying the distinct harm may be more straightforward. However, in cases where the luring actually manifests in the commission of a secondary offence, identifying the distinct harm of luring may be more challenging. \nOne way to identify the distinct harms at play is for courts to differentiate between contact-driven luring, where the offenders goal is to facilitate in-person sexual abuse, and luring that leads to sexual abuse occurring entirely online (see R. v. M.B., 2020 ONSC 7605, at para. 78 (CanLII), for an example in relation to child pornography). In the latter context, the online medium is the primary setting where the abuse takes place and the offender may have no intention to take the abuse offline. In the context of contact-driven luring, the online environment can, but need not, play a significant role in the sexual abuse. The technology may sometimes function solely as a medium to gain physical access to a victim. Where the luring is contact-driven, sentencing judges should consider whether the online communication caused psychological harm that stands separate and apart from the harm of any secondary offence that may have been committed. Victims of contact sexual abuse can be sexually exploited and psychologically manipulated online by their offenders both before and after they were abused offline. It is an error to presume that luring cannot engender independent harm. \nOther times, the aim of luring will be to commit a designated secondary offence set out in s. 172.1(1) that occurs entirely online. This might encompass a range of behaviours including sexual chat, the sharing of sexualized photos or videos, or viewing or performing sexual acts by video, all of which may be encapsulated within the secondary offences of invitation to sexual touching or the child pornography offences (J. A. Kloess et al., A Qualitative Analysis of Offenders Modus Operandi in Sexually Exploitative Interactions With Children Online (2017), 29 Sex. Abuse 563, at pp. 584-87). In such circumstances, the offender uses technology to build a relationship, assert control and psychologically manipulate young persons, and may also use that same technology to then carry out sexual acts. In such circumstances, it might be difficult to decipher whether the luring caused distinct psychological harm, as the harm caused by the luring might resemble the harm caused by the underlying offence which also occurred online. \nContact-driven luring is not necessarily more or less harmful than luring that leads to sexual abuse that occurs entirely online. The severity of the harm caused by the online communication will depend on the individual offender and his or her offending goals, the individual characteristics of the victim, and the unique dynamic between the offender and the victim.\nParliament Has Mandated That Sentences for Luring Must Increase\nFriesen urges courts to consider Parliaments legislative initiatives in sentencing offenders for sexual offences against children (para. 107). Parliament has consistently raised these sentences to reflect a growing awareness of their gravity, and to indicate the serious emotional and psychological harms they cause for victims (paras. 56, 98 and 101-5). This same increasingly punitive trend applies to the sentencing regime for luring offences:\nIn 2002, when enacting the offence of luring, Parliament provided for a maximum term of five years imprisonment for luring proceeding by indictment (Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2001, s. 8). No maximum penalty was set for luring proceeding summarily. \nIn 2005, Parliament enacted s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code which provides that the objectives of denunciation and deterrence take priority in cases of the abuse of a person under 18 (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act, S.C. 2005, c. 32, s. 24; Criminal Code, s. 718.01). \nIn 2007, the maximum sentence for luring proceeding by indictment was increased to 10 years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 18 months imprisonment was introduced for luring proceeding summarily (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (luring a child), S.C. 2007, c. 20, s. 1). \nIn 2012, mandatory minimum sentences for child luring were introduced (Safe Streets and Communities Act, s. 22). As a result, child luring proceeding by indictment carried a mandatory minimum punishment of one years imprisonment, and luring proceeding summarily carried a mandatory minimum punishment of 90 days imprisonment. \nIn 2015, with the Tougher Penalties for Child Predators Act, S.C. 2015, c. 23, s. 11, Parliament elevated the maximum sentence for luring proceeding by indictment to 14 years imprisonment. The maximum sentence for luring proceeding summarily was increased from 18 months to 2 years less a day imprisonment and the mandatory minimum punishment was increased to 6 months imprisonment.\nThese legislative changes should be regarded as a sign of Parliaments view of the offences gravity (Rayo, at para. 125). They make clear that proportionate sentencing that responds to the gravity of the luring offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender will often require substantial sentences of imprisonment. As a result, courts should depart from dated precedents that do not reflect societys current awareness of the impact of sexual violence on children in imposing a fit sentence (Friesen, at para. 110).\nSummary\nFriesens analytical approach necessitates an understanding of the inherent wrongfulness and distinct harms of luring and Parliaments sentencing goals. Understanding the wrongfulness and harmfulness of the luring offence is integral to properly assessing the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, as well as to avoiding stereotypical reasoning and the misidentification of aggravating and mitigating factors (para. 50). I use this guidance to inform Mr. Bertrand Marchands fit sentence and as the foundation for the constitutional analysis under s. 12. \nThe Sentencing Judge Erred in Assigning a Five-Month Concurrent Sentence for the Luring Offence\nThe sentencing judge properly considered denunciation and deterrence and recognized that the total sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offences and to the respondents degree of responsibility. When addressing the sentence for the sexual interference, which is not on appeal before this Court, she acknowledged that this was a [translation] situation of sexual exploitation (para. 60) and a relationship based on manipulation to satisfy sexual needs with a still-developing adolescent, which would leave scars (para. 59). The vulnerability of the young victim, who was under the Director of Youth Protections care, was also recognized regarding both the sexual interference and luring offences (paras. 60 and 70).\nAccording to Lacasse, sentencing judges are afforded broad discretionary powers in crafting a fit sentence (para. 39). Appellate intervention is justified only if a sentence is demonstrably unfit or if the judge committed an error in principle that impacted the sentence imposed (para. 44). The sentencing judge committed errors in principle that impacted the assigned sentence of five months imprisonment that she ordered be served concurrently to the sexual interference sentence. Specifically, she erred by (1) minimizing the harm caused to the victim by failing to recognize the grooming that did occur; (2) misconstruing the offenders actions; and (3) assigning a concurrent sentence for the luring offence. These errors in principle warranted appellate intervention that the majority of the Court of Appeal below failed to undertake. I would thus substitute the 5-month sentence imposed by the sentencing judge with the 12-month sentence sought by the Crown.\nThe Sentencing Judge Failed to Recognize the Grooming That Occurred\nEvidence of grooming may be present where child luring is made out. Grooming is a process which allows the offender to forge a close relationship with a victim to gain trust, compliance and secrecy for the purpose of eventually engaging in sexualization and abuse (Rayo, at para. 149). The jurisprudence has yet to identify a universal definition of grooming. Understandably, this is in large part due to the difficulties in determining where the process begins and ends, as well as the variety of behaviours that may be involved depending on the offender, the victim, and the context. Indeed, grooming can involve, but is not limited to rapport building, incentivization, disinhibition, and security management (I. A. Elliott, A Self-Regulation Model of Sexual Grooming (2017), 18 Trauma, Violence, & Abuse 83, at p. 88). It is a slow and gradual process of active engagement and a desensitization of the childs inhibitions  with an increasing gain in power and control over the young person (Rayo, at para. 139, quoting M. Ospina, C. Harstall and L. Dennett, Sexual Exploitation of Children and Youth Over the Internet: A Rapid Review of the Scientific Literature (2010), at p. 7). \nGrooming often goes hand in hand with the common features of luring, namely a prolonged, deliberate and careful cultivation of a young person with a view to engendering trust and intimacy, all designed to promote sexual conduct between the two parties (Paradee, at para. 20). While often a preparatory process, grooming need not culminate in a sexual act to be harmful. Grooming allows an offender to gain power and control over the young person, which in turn may lead to distinct psychological harm. This harm exemplifies the vulnerability and exploitation of children facilitated by the internet that Parliament sought to protect against in enacting the luring offence (Rayo, at paras. 138-39; Reynard, at paras. 19-20; Alicandro, at para. 36; Legare, at para. 25).\nThe identification of grooming should be left to the fact-finder in each case. In assessing whether grooming is present, judges should focus on the character, content, and consequences of the messages, as well as whether the communication resulted in psychological manipulation of the child. \nThe text of s. 172.1 is clear that grooming is not a constituent element of the luring offence. While its presence may be aggravating at sentencing, its absence is not mitigating.\nIn this case, the sentencing judge failed to appreciate the harms that grooming generated for this young victim  in fact, the sentencing judge did not recognize the victim had been groomed at all. By characterizing the luring as a contact-driven means to an end, the sentencing judge failed to account for the psychological manipulation that arose from the online communication alone. With respect, she failed to disentangle the harm caused by the online communication from the harm caused by the sexual interference. Instead of viewing grooming as a continuous process that serves to renew and strengthen an exploitative relationship, she discounted its presence because prior sexual acts had occurred. Irrespective of the physical sexual acts that preceded and followed the communication, Mr. Bertrand Marchands tactics and actions demonstrate controlling manipulation using the internet, which I characterize as grooming. This grooming should have served as an aggravating factor on sentencing. \nThe messages exchanged by Mr. Bertrand Marchand and the victim confirmed the power imbalance between this adult and this child. During the relevant period, the respondent requested to meet the victim upwards of 18 times in order to have sexual intercourse (sentencing reasons, at para. 68). The respondent persisted with these requests until he succeeded in using her to serve his own sexual purposes. These meetings impacted the rules and conditions the victim was subject to at the rehabilitation centre she resided in at the time, and put her in danger. The respondent also suggested on several occasions that she run away from the centre, even after the victim voiced fears of getting caught by her supervisors (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 109, 115 and 137). \nThe messages were often sexually explicit. Several times throughout their conversations, Mr. Bertrand Marchand impatiently asked her to send compromising photos over Snapchat (A.R., vol. II, at p. 110). He commented on her body, calling her sexy, saying [translation] ur really a woman, and noting that she had gained weight and looked like more of a woman (p. 117). He stated [translation] ur gonna feel horny later (p. 129) in the hopes of receiving an explicit photo via Snapchat. He said he was joking about screenshotting these explicit photos and saving them to his phone (p. 124).\nAs recognized by the sentencing judge, the victim understood and expressed that the respondent was only staying in contact with her in order to have sexual intercourse (p. 80). In certain passages, the victim told the respondent that she felt used and exploited. She stated [translation] Im fed up and dont want to be seen as a slut, and asked him to respect her (p. 127). She expressed being [translation] in need of love, to which Mr. Bertrand Marchand responded haha or in need of sex? (p. 131).\nMr. Bertrand Marchand also strategically expressed disappointment in the victim to exert control over her actions. He told her that she had lost his respect and conveyed frustration when she did not promptly respond to his messages. He told her she was letting him down when she did not send him explicit photos on demand (A.R. vol. II, at p. 115). \nSimultaneously, Mr. Bertrand Marchand gradually gained the victims trust by showing concern for her, buying her gifts, and making promises. At times he took on the role of a mentor by telling her not to end up in trouble, or asking her how school was going. He expressed that he did not [translation] want to be in shit because you run away to our place (p. 155). He also promised to purchase her alcohol, and cajoled, enticed and praised her in an effort to gain sexual advantage.\nThe record reveals that Mr. Bertrand Marchand did not respect the victims stated boundaries. In the final messages exchanged, where [translation] the teenager stated clearly that she no longer wanted to continue their relationship, he insisted saying that she was [translation] too much of a woman for them to stop talking (sentencing reasons, at para. 48; see also A.R., vol. II, at p. 161). Rather than respecting her request to end contact, he made her question her decision, warning her that because he made a lot of money, she would never be able to find someone who could spoil her like him (A.R., vol. II, at p. 161).\nThe messages demonstrate that the respondent groomed the victim with the aim to control and influence this child toward a sexual purpose. He used his relative seniority over the victim to manipulate her and capitalized on the power imbalance between them. He pressured her, berated her and imbued their communications with sexual undertones and overtones. He ignored her stated boundaries and oscillated between endearment and frustration to obtain the sexual contact that he wanted. The offender did all of this via online messaging platforms  the only medium by which the victim was able to communicate with the outside world. This behaviour is not only grooming, but is precisely what Parliament sought to prevent by introducing the luring provisions.\nThe sentencing judge erred by failing to recognize the grooming present here, which should have served as an aggravating factor on sentencing.\nThe Sentencing Judge Misconstrued the Offenders Actions\nTaking a critical look at the language used to describe sexual violence experienced by children is essential to adequately reflect the wrongfulness and the harmfulness of these offences. In Friesen, the Court warned against the use of misleading language that either euphemizes or eroticizes sexual violence because it risks trivializing that violence, normalizing conduct that is meant to be condemned, and it removes responsibility from the offender (paras. 147 and 151). Imprecise language can also indicate the presence of biases that may impermissibly affect the courts reasoning (S. Zaccour and M. Lessard, La culture du viol dans le discours juridique: soigner ses mots pour combattre les violences sexuelles (2021), 33 C.J.W.L. 175, at p. 203). Courts should avoid language that may re-victimize victims by disguising and obscuring the violence, pain, and trauma that [they] experienced (Friesen, at para. 147).\nIn the instant case, the sentencing judge stated that this was not a classic case of luring, but rather an attempt to repeat the sexual escapades that the victim had already consented to three times. The judge explained that the impugned communications occurred online not because of the anonymity that social media affords, but because this platform was commonly used by persons of Mr. Bertrand Marchands generation. \nWhile it is true that the respondent did not anonymously approach a child online that he had never met before, he did use telecommunication platforms to manipulate a child for his own sexual ends. Luring can be done anonymously, but it is inaccurate and unhelpful to characterize this as its classic form (S. Paquette and F. Fortin, Les traces numeriques laissees par les cyberdelinquants sexuels: identites virtuelles, mensonges et protection de lanonymat (2021), 74 R.I.C.P.T.S. 387, at p. 401; see also Rayo; R. v. Miller, 2016 SKCA 32, 476 Sask. R. 150, at para. 23). Mr. Bertrand Marchands choice to contact the victim online was not merely a generational choice. Because the victim lived in a rehabilitation centre, online communication was the only way Mr. Bertrand Marchand could access the victim and build a relationship with her in order to repeat the acts constituting sexual interference. I agree with the dissenting judge in the court below that [translation] the respondent . . . chose to use the means of telecommunication available to him and the victim to multiply their encounters to ensure his control and maintain his domination over her (C.A. reasons, at para. 36). The sentencing judge treated the absence of anonymity as reducing the seriousness of the offence (Rayo, at para. 88) and misconstrued the use of social media as merely a generational preference. Both of these elements erroneously served as mitigating factors on sentencing. \nBy employing the term [translation] sexual escapade to describe Mr. Bertrand Marchands illegal sexual interference with a minor (paras. 38, 50-51, 64 and 68), the sentencing judge minimized the harm done to the child. Such a term evokes pleasure and excitement, and privileges the perspective of the adult. This is akin to using terms such as fondling and [translation] caressing, which signal that the conduct is inherently less blameworthy or harmful than other forms of violence (Friesen, at para. 144, citing R. v. Hood, 2018 NSCA 18, 45 C.R. (7th) 269, at para. 150, and Caron Barrette v. R., 2018 QCCA 516, at para. 93 (CanLII)). This language undermines Parliaments objective of communicating that the use of children as sexual objects for the gratification of adults is wrongful (Friesen, at para. 147). \nThe sentencing judge stated on numerous occasions that the victim had already consented to the sexual intercourse. Clearly, given the victims age, any purported consent to sexual activity in these circumstances was legally impossible. The presence of prior acts making out the offence of sexual interference should not mitigate the wrongfulness of the conduct or minimize the harm it generates. That this minor was subject to three prior instances of illegal sexual intercourse establishes a pattern of abuse, and not a reason for it. While the sentencing judge acknowledged that consent could not play a role in the sexual interference offence, she did not make this same distinction for the luring offence. The use of language that suggests consent in situations where consent is legally impossible is to be avoided. Analogizing a childs psychological manipulated actions to consent is a legal error (Friesen, at paras. 148-50).\nA review of the sentencing judges language reveals that her framing of the illegal sexual encounters as escapades and her wrongful characterization of the victims behaviour as consent minimized Mr. Bertrand Marchands actions. This framing caused her to unduly minimize the wrongfulness and harms of the offence by factoring in the extent to which the victim participated in the violence  which was a separate error of law (Friesen, at para. 150).\nA 12-Month Sentence Is Appropriate\nThese errors mean this Court is now tasked with setting a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Bertrand Marchand. I agree with the Crown that given the particular circumstances of the luring in this case, there was no justification for departing from the existing sentencing range of 12 to 24 months for luring cases proceeding by indictment (Morrison, at para. 177, citing Jarvis, at para. 31; A.F., at para. 75). \nSignificant Factors to Determine a Fit Sentence\nIn addition to determining the gravity of the offence, determining the moral blameworthiness of the offender is key to setting a proportionate sentence. This requires identifying both mitigating and aggravating factors. Here, in order to examine Mr. Bertrand Marchands blameworthiness and set a proportionate sentence, I provide a non-exhaustive list of aggravating and mitigating factors that have particular relevance in the context of luring. \nMitigating Factors\nSentencing judges must consider the mitigating factors that arise on the facts of the particular case before them. Mitigating factors that commonly appear in luring cases include whether the offender pleaded guilty (see, e.g., Misay, at para. 141; Melrose, at para. 264; Wall, at para. 75; R. v. Ditoro, 2021 ONCJ 540, at para. 43 (CanLII); R. v. Gould, 2022 ONCJ 187; R. v. Cooper, 2023 ONSC 875, at para. 17 (CanLII); R. v. Clarke, 2021 NLCA 8, at para. 53 (CanLII); R.S.F., at para. 103; R. v. Aeichele, 2023 BCSC 253, at para. 61 (CanLII); R. v. Wolff, 2020 BCPC 174, at para. 64 (CanLII)), whether the offender has expressed genuine remorse or gained insight into the offence (see, e.g., Directeur des poursuites criminelles et penales v. St-Amour, 2021 QCCQ 6855, at para. 43 (CanLII); Wall, at para. 75; Ditoro, at para. 59; Misay, at para. 150; Gould; R. v. Rice, 2022 ABKB 773, at para. 48 (CanLII); Clarke, at para. 53; R.S.F., at para. 105; Wolff, at para. 67), and whether the offender has undertaken rehabilitative steps such as counselling or treatment (see, e.g., R.S.F., at para. 103; R. v. Wickramasinghe, 2022 ONCJ 331, at para. 25 (CanLII); Gould; R. v. Rasiah, 2021 ONCJ 584, at para. 42 (CanLII)). Here, in her analysis of the sentence for the sexual interference count, the sentencing judge considered the pre-sentence report and rightly accounted for Mr. Bertrand Marchands guilty plea, lack of prior convictions, honesty and cooperation throughout the sentencing process, factors which were also relevant to the luring offence.\nThe personal circumstances of the offender can also have a mitigating effect on blameworthiness (Friesen, at paras. 91-92). In the context of determining the appropriate sentence overall, the sentencing judge in this case accounted for Mr. Bertrand Marchands age at the time of the events, his stable family life, and the fact that he had maintained stable employment for around three years. Mr. Bertrand Marchand overcame a substance use disorder during adolescence. At the time, this caused him health problems and panic attacks (sentencing reasons, at para. 22). An offender might have a mental disability or substance use disorder that imposes serious cognitive limitations, such that their moral culpability is reduced (Friesen, at para. 91; see, e.g., Hood, at para. 180; Melrose, at paras. 223-35; R. v. Osadchuk, 2020 QCCQ 2166, at paras. 51-55 (CanLII); R. v. Deren, 2021 ABPC 84, at paras. 44 and 51 (CanLII); R. v. Sinclair, 2022 MBPC 40, at paras. 15 and 67 (CanLII); Wolff, at para. 65). However, this factor is not as mitigating in Mr. Bertrand Marchands circumstances as his substance use did not overlap with the material time period (unlike Sinclair, at para. 67; Wolff, at para. 65).\nAggravating Factors\nGrooming \nAs articulated above, the sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to account for the fact that the offenders actions caused the victim distinct psychological harm. Mr. Bertrand Marchands manipulation and grooming are both aggravating factors that increase his moral blameworthiness.\nHere, no formal victim impact statement was adduced at sentencing. Nevertheless, even where evidence of actual harm to the victim is not admitted, harm can still be inferred. This Court instructed that sexual violence against children inherently has the potential to cause several recognized forms of harm. . . . [T]he potential that these forms of harm will materialize is always present whenever there is physical interference of a sexual nature with a child and can be present even in sexual offences against children that do not require or involve physical interference (Friesen, at para. 79). The potential for reasonably foreseeable harm must be considered on sentencing even where the luring results in no actual harm (para. 84).\nWhere there is no direct evidence of actual harm to the victim, [c]ourts may be able to find actual harm based on the numerous factual circumstances that can cause additional harm and constitute aggravating factors (para. 86). In other words, sentencing judges can infer the likelihood of actual harm where there are aggravating factors such as grooming (see, e.g., R. v. Pentecost, 2020 NSSC 277, at paras. 50-54 (CanLII)).\nCharacter of the Communication\nThe character of the communication is relevant to the blameworthiness of the conduct. In this appeal, the period for the count of luring on the indictment spans nearly seven months. During this time, hundreds of messages were exchanged between the respondent and the victim. The duration and frequency of the communications are important to the extent that they may generate cumulative or more severe harms, and increase the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Because repeated and prolonged acts of sexual violence increase the long-term harm suffered by the victim (Friesen, at para. 131), sending a large volume of messages, or sending messages in a persistent and unrelenting way, is aggravating (R. v. Collier, 2021 ONSC 6827, at para. 75 (CanLII); R. v. Kavanagh, 2023 ONSC 283, at para. 84 (CanLII); R. v. Moolla, 2021 ONSC 3702, at para. 22 (CanLII); R. v. E.F., 2021 ABQB 272; R. v. Battieste, 2022 ONCJ 573, at para. 45 (CanLII)). In addition, while a shorter duration of communication is not a mitigating factor, maintaining online communications for a long period of time is aggravating (R. v. Faille, 2021 QCCQ 4945, at paras. 68-70 (CanLII)). \nThe substance of the communication is relevant when sentencing. Here, Mr. Bertrand Marchand often sent sexually explicit and objectifying messages to the victim. Graphic sexual content is clearly aggravating, but so is communication where the offender manipulates through language about love and affection (Wolff; R. v. Saberi, 2021 ONCJ 345, 493 C.R.R. (2d) 121; R. v. Boucher, 2020 ABCA 208). It is also aggravating for the offender to rely on trickery, lies or manipulation to lure the victim (Collier, at para. 77).\nEncouraging a child to share images of themselves or sending explicit images to the child also heightens blameworthiness and may serve as an aggravating factor on sentencing with respect to the luring offence (Collier; Kavanagh; R. v. Kalliraq, 2022 NUCA 6; R. v. Razon, 2021 ONCJ 616; Deren). Mr. Bertrand Marchand encouraged the victim on numerous occasions to send explicit photos of herself through Snapchat, which he mentioned saving to his phone (A.R., vol. II, at p. 124). The duration and frequency of the communications, along with the sexually explicit nature of the messages and the repeated requests for explicit photos, are all aggravating factors in this case (Collier; Kavanagh; Kalliraq; Razon; Deren).\nDeceit\nDeceit can present itself in many forms and is aggravating. Where an offender relies on anonymity, for example by using a false name, identity, or age, then the conduct is more blameworthy (Pentecost; R. v. Coban, 2022 BCSC 1810; Ditoro; R. v. Bains, 2021 ABPC 20; Cooper; Collier; Montour v. R., 2020 QCCA 1648). However, not every offender operates under the shield of anonymity. In this case, Mr. Bertrand Marchand met the victim in person and used his real identity when adding her on Facebook. Depending on the circumstances, a vulnerable childs trust may be won by either lying about ones identity or by exploiting a pre-existing relationship (Rayo, at paras. 92-93).\nThe communication itself might also include deceitful tactics. In some cases, an offender may instruct the victim to erase the communication to conceal the luring, or to refrain from sharing the messages with parents or family members (Saberi; R. v. LaFrance, 2022 ABCA 351). An offender may also tell the victim to dress more maturely when they meet in person (Saberi). It is further aggravating for an offender to intentionally choose a platform that erases records of communication in order to avoid detection (see J.R.), or to suggest a more secure platform after learning of the childs age (Rasiah). In this case, Mr. Bertrand Marchand asked the victim to send him explicit photos on Snapchat, a platform that erases records of communication. However, photos were also exchanged throughout their communication on Facebook. This suggests that the intention to avoid detection is not present here.\nAbuse of a Position or Relationship of Trust\nThe jurisprudence provides several examples of traditional positions of authority that may be exploited, including that of a parent (see, e.g., J.R.), teacher (see, e.g., Pentecost; Faille; R. v. Jissink, 2021 ABQB 102, 482 C.R.R. (2d) 167), or family friend (see, e.g., Rayo; R. v. Lemay, 2020 ABCA 365, 14 Alta. L.R. (7th) 45; Boucher). However, positions of trust fall on a spectrum, and a relationship of trust of any kind may facilitate the commission of the offence (Rayo, at paras. 87 and 96; Friesen, at para. 125). Prior relationships can be leveraged to provide an entry, form a basis of trust, build confidence, and can make it easier to manipulate the victim  often because the offender knows more about the victim, including any additional vulnerabilities, like the victims family situation. In cases where an offender uses a pre-existing relationship in order to exploit pre-existing trust, a breach of this trust is likely to increase the harm to the victim and thus the gravity of the offence (Friesen, at para. 126).\nIn many cases of luring the offender is intentionally attempting to build a relationship of trust, move an existing trust relationship onto sexual terrain, or build secrecy. The eventual breach of trust may produce feelings of fear and shame, discourage reporting and undermine relationships. When an offender exploits his role as the confidante or friend in order to gain a victims trust for the purposes of facilitating sexual contact, this increases his degree of responsibility (R.S.F.; Rayo, at paras. 87 and 96). \nMr. Bertrand Marchand and the victim met in person through mutual friends, then communicated online. He had illegal intercourse with her three times prior to engaging in the online communications that led to the luring charge. The luring count, therefore, does not encompass the three instances of sexual interference that preceded it. As the appellants remarked in written submissions, the fact that the underlying offence occurred three times before the start of the luring does not diminish the seriousness of the subsequent communications (A.F., at paras. 34-48). This pre-existing relationship opened the door to the Facebook communications and allowed Mr. Bertrand Marchand to access the victim. The respondent exploited the pre-existing trust he had established with the victim when they first met. \nAge of the Victim\nThe age of the child victim may also be an aggravating factor. Per s. 718.2(a)(ii.1) of the Criminal Code, abuse of a person under 18 years is a statutorily aggravating circumstance. While luring will always involve a child, practically speaking it requires a child of an age who can access and use telecommunications. As such, very young children and infants are rarely victims of this offence. Instead, luring will often involve adolescent victims. Sentencing judges should heed the caution in Friesen that courts must be particularly careful to impose proportionate sentences in cases where the victim is an adolescent because disproportionately low sentences have historically been imposed in these cases (para. 136). \nLuring involves an inherent power imbalance between the adult using technology and the unsupervised child or adolescent receiving their messages. In Friesen, this Court discussed the pronounced power imbalance between adults and children who are often helpless without the protection and care of their parents (para. 134). Though the victim in this case was an adolescent and not a young child, she was under the care of the Director of Youth Protection when she was targeted by Mr. Bertrand Marchand, making her exceptionally vulnerable in the circumstances. \nFurther, a wide gap in age between the offender and victim increases blameworthiness (see, e.g., Misay, at para. 61; Faille, at para. 74; Jissink, at para. 52; R. v. Aguilar, 2021 ONCJ 87, at para. 21 (CanLII), affd 2022 ONCA 353, at para. 14 (CanLII)). Here, Mr. Bertrand Marchand is nine years older than the victim, who was in her early teenage years at the start of the indictable period. He was aware of her age from the start and mentioned her youth several times. The significant age gap and the victims severe vulnerability are both aggravating factors.\nA Fit Sentence\nI accept the appellants submission that Parliaments legislative initiatives regarding sexual offences against children, the aggravating and mitigating factors articulated above, and the distinct harm caused by the online communication justify a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for Mr. Bertrand Marchand.\nConcurrent Versus Consecutive Sentences\nI now turn to the sentencing judges order that the sentences for the offences of sexual interference and luring be served concurrently. \nBecause of its constituent elements, luring will often arise with other offences. This raises methodological considerations about how to approach sentencing for multiple offences and when sentences should run concurrently or consecutively. \nThe sentencing judge first determined the just and appropriate sentence for each offence individually. Next, she considered whether the sentences ought to be consecutive or concurrent. Only after doing this did she consider the principle of totality in s. 718.2(a), which ensures that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender (R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 42; see also R. v. Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2, 316 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 211, at para. 84, and Desjardins v. R., 2015 QCCA 1774, at paras. 37-42 (CanLII), which have endorsed a similar approach). \nI agree with the sentencing judges approach in this case and believe it has benefits over the alternative manner of simply setting a global amount for multiple offences. This sequential approach ensures a separate consideration of the fit and appropriate punishment of each offence. Given the separate objectives and distinct criteria for the luring offence, it was appropriate to examine each offence individually [translation] in order to understand properly the weight this offence contributes to the offenders moral blameworthiness (Rayo, at para. 55).\nArticulating individual sentences for each offence provides needed clarity and is of great assistance when one of the challenged punishments are varied on appeal or declared to be unconstitutional. Setting an individual sentence for each offence provides transparency and allows a judge to weigh the seriousness of each offence. Clearly identifying individual sentences may also prove to be of great assistance in any subsequent sentencing proceedings should an offender re-offend  for example, by providing sentencing judges with a starting point when applying the jump principle to repeat convictions for the same offences (R. v. Borde (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), at para. 39). \nThe sentencing judge determined that Mr. Bertrand Marchands sentences for sexual interference and luring should be served concurrently because the offences were closely connected. While deference is owed to a judges decision on whether to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence (R. v. McDonnell, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 46), respectfully, the sentencing judge erred by imposing a concurrent sentence in this case. To properly account for the distinct legal interests that the luring offence protects, the sentences should have been consecutive. \nParliament has removed judicial discretion and has dictated that sentences must run consecutively for certain offences, like child pornography where the offender also commits another sexual offence against that child, or where there are sexual offences other than child pornography committed by the same offender against several children (Criminal Code, s. 718.3(7)). Generally speaking, offences that are so closely linked to each other as to constitute a single criminal adventure may, but are not required to, receive concurrent sentences, while all other offences are to receive consecutive sentences (Friesen, at para. 155; see also Criminal Code, s. 718.3(4)(b)(i)). Determining whether sentences should be consecutive or concurrent is a fact-specific inquiry to be undertaken in the context of each case (C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at 14.13).\nLuring is legislatively linked to listed secondary offences: an offender must communicate for the purpose of facilitating the commission of one such offence. While there will be cases where luring stands alone, it often accompanies the actual commission of a listed secondary offence. But the luring that preceded or produced the offence is in no way subsumed or supplanted within the secondary offence. This is because the offence of luring protects a distinct social interest and causes distinct harms compared to the secondary offences (Rayo, at paras. 130 and 134).\nOffences constituting invasions of different legally protected interests can be sentenced consecutively, even if they form part of the same criminal transaction (Rayo, at para. 136, quoting R. v. Gummer (1983), 38 C.R. (3d) 46 (Ont. C.A), at p. 49; R. v. Gillis, 2009 ONCA 312, 248 O.A.C. 1, at para. 9; R. v. Morton, 2021 ABCA 29, at paras. 32-33 (CanLII)). Parliament intentionally targeted conduct that precedes the commission of the enumerated sexual offences and seeks to protect children from the possibility of sexual exploitation facilitated by the internet (Rayo, at paras. 138-39; Reynard, at paras. 19-20; Alicandro, at para. 36; Legare, at para. 25). As set out above, luring can cause distinct harms as a result of psychological manipulation. As such, in most cases luring will attract a consecutive sentence (Rayo, at paras. 133-43; R. v. McLean, 2016 SKCA 93, 484 Sask. R. 137, at paras. 50-53; Miller, at paras. 22-23). As noted in Rayo, the distinct offence of luring may seem to go unpunished, at least in part, where the luring sentence runs concurrently to the sentences for the related offences (para. 152).\nThis is not to say that luring must always be sentenced consecutively. Unless so mandated by s. 718.3(7), sentencing judges retain discretion on this point. However, in exercising their discretion, judges must remain cognizant of the fact that the offence of luring constitutes an invasion of a different legally protected interest. The judge is obliged to explain why the sentence is to be served concurrently with the penalties imposed for other infractions. The reason for imposing a concurrent sentence must be provided. I also note that judges must be mindful not to double count: where a judge orders that a sentence for luring be served consecutively to any sentence for a secondary offence, the secondary offence cannot act as an aggravating factor in determining the luring sentence.\nTotality \nThe effect of the totality principle is to require a judge to ensure that the series of sentences are, in aggregate, just and appropriate (see M. (C.A.), at para. 42; Criminal Code, s. 718.2(c)). This involves taking one last look at the combined sentence to assess whether it is unduly long or harsh, in the sense that it is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender (Hutchings, at paras. 42 and 84; Laguerre v. R., 2021 QCCA 1537, at para. 43 (CanLII); M. (C.A.), at para. 42). If the principle of totality is offended, the sentences can be adjusted by making some concurrent, or if this does not achieve a just and appropriate sentence, by reducing the length of one or more sentences (Desjardins, at para. 34).\nAs articulated above, the sentencing judge in this case failed to consider that the distinct legal interest that the luring offence protects was present in the case at bar. This caused her to conflate the sentence for luring with the sentence for the secondary offence. As such, I conclude that the 12-month luring sentence ought to be served consecutively with the 10-month sentence for sexual interference.\nApplying the totality principle, I find that a 22-month sentence is just in light of the circumstances of the case, Mr. Bertrand Marchands personal circumstances and his moral blameworthiness. \nMr. Bertrand Marchand has already served the 10-month sentence for sexual interference in full and was paroled in July 2020. Given the time that has elapsed and the fact that the appellants are not seeking further punishment, it would not serve the ends of justice to re-incarcerate Mr. Bertrand Marchand. Accordingly, I order a permanent stay of execution of the modified sentence (see R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 132; R. v. R.A.R., 2000 SCC 8, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 163, at para. 35; R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at para. 65).\nThe Mandatory Minimum Sentences in Section 172.1(2) of the Criminal Code Violate Section 12 of the Charter\nThese companion appeals impugn the constitutionality of both the summary and indictable mandatory minimum sentences attached to the hybrid luring offence pursuant to s. 12 of the Charter. In the courts below, Mr. Bertrand Marchand successfully challenged the one-year mandatory minimum for the indictable offence and H.V. successfully challenged the six-month mandatory minimum for the summary conviction offence. As respondents before this Court, they ask that those decisions be upheld. These reasons take a holistic view of the luring provision and its penalties to best assess whether the mandatory minimum sentences pass constitutional muster. This is the first time the Court will answer the constitutional questions arising from these mandatory minimums: while the majority in Morrison declined to rule on the constitutionality of s. 172.1(2)(a), Justice Karakatsanis found it offended s. 12 and was not saved by s. 1. \nRecently, this Court reaffirmed and clarified the framework for constitutional challenges to mandatory minimum sentences under s. 12. Whether the mandatory minimum sentences in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) are unconstitutional requires a two-stage inquiry that involves a contextual and comparative analysis (R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, at para. 40; R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at para. 62). First, a court must set a fit and proportionate sentence for the individual offenders before the court and possibly other reasonably foreseeable offenders (Hills, at para. 40; see also Bissonnette, at para. 63; R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 77). Second, a court must determine whether the mandatory minimum requires imposing a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the otherwise fit and proportionate sentence (Hills, at para. 40; Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 46; R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1072). This involves consideration of the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the individual or reasonably foreseeable offender, and the penalty and its objectives (Hills, at para. 122). \nThe Hills framework was not available to the courts below in either Mr. Bertrand Marchands or H.V.s cases when those courts assessed the mandatory minimum sentences. Nevertheless all decided that the mandatory minimums at issue infringed s. 12. Their conclusions are consistent with other courts across the country (see, e.g., Hood; Melrose; R. v. Faroughi, 2020 ONSC 780; R. v. Koenig, 2019 BCPC 83; Roy; Deren; R. v. Ward, 2019 NSPC 72; R. v. Fawcett, 2019 BCPC 125).\nThe Crown appellants argue that the increased sentences which may result after Friesen immunize the mandatory minimums at issue. While a proper understanding of the wrongfulness and harmfulness of luring will lead to significant penalties in most circumstances, the constitutional analysis under s. 12 of the Charter does not merely ask whether the mandatory minimum is cruel and unusual in common cases (Nur, at para. 68). Indeed, the use of reasonably foreseeable scenarios is expressly designed to test the lower end of the spectrum of conduct captured by the offence (see, e.g., Hills, at para. 169). \nThe present constitutional analysis does not disturb the maximum sentence established by Parliament, the sentencing range for luring affirmed in Morrison or this Courts clear guidance in Friesen. The sole question is whether the mandatory minimum sentences in s. 172.1(2), which deprive courts of the ability to tailor proportionate sentences at the lower end of a sentencing range (Nur, at para. 44), impose cruel and unusual punishment in reasonably foreseeable cases. \nPut simply, the constituent elements of the child luring offence are so broad and unconstrained as to capture conduct that is only remotely related to the heart of the offence (see, e.g., Hills, at para. 122). This is ultimately what makes the mandatory minimum provisions constitutionally suspect. Parliament could have limited the conduct captured by the mandatory minimums or built in a safety valve that would allow judges to exempt outliers for whom the mandatory minimum will constitute cruel and unusual punishment (R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 36); it did not do so here. As with any other challenged provision, this Court must carefully evaluate the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences at issue.\nFor a mandatory minimum sentence to be found unconstitutional pursuant to s. 12 of the Charter, it must be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency (Hills, at para. 109, citing R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, at para. 26; R. v. Wiles, 2005 SCC 84, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072). Only on rare and unique occasions will a sentence infringe s. 12 (Steele v. Mountain Institution, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, at p. 1417). As I outline below, the mandatory minimum sentences for luring meet this high threshold and must be struck. Although the mandatory minimum penalties are not grossly disproportionate as applied to Mr. Bertrand Marchand and H.V., they are when applied to reasonably foreseeable scenarios.\nA Fit, Proportionate Sentence\nAs explained, the fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Bertrand Marchands luring of the victim is 12 months incarceration, which mirrors the mandatory minimum for the indictable offence to which he pleaded guilty. As a result, s. 172.1(2)(a)s mandated minimum sentence is not grossly disproportionate in his circumstances.\nIn the appeal concerning H.V., who was 52 years old at the material time, he pleaded guilty to child luring prosecuted by summary conviction, under s. 172.1(1)(a), for texts sent to the victim, his 16-year-old niece and godchild, between July 31 and August 9, 2017. During a family dinner at his home while he was alone with the victim, H.V. told her that she had nice buttocks and breasts. That same evening, he began sending her sexual text messages, which he continued to do for a period of 10 days. In these texts, he repeatedly asked her to delete his communications and keep them to herself. H.V. suggested to the victims mother that she come work for him at the school where he was the principal. On her second day of work, he touched her breasts. She subsequently left her job and filed a criminal complaint. Although H.V. was also initially charged with secondary offences in relation to the illegal sexual touching of the victims breasts, he pleaded guilty to and was sentenced only for the child luring count. At sentencing, H.V. challenged the six-month mandatory minimum sentence for luring proceeding by summary conviction under s. 172.1(2)(b), pursuant to s. 12 of the Charter.\nThe sentencing judge at the Court of Quebec imposed a sentence of 2 years probation and 150 hours of community service reasoning that this conduct fell at the lower end of the moral blameworthiness scale and thus warranted a probationary sentence. Since the six-month mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly disproportionate to this sentence, it infringed s. 12 of the Charter and the judge declared it inoperable in regards to H.V. On appeal, the Superior Court of Quebec (2021 QCCS 837) allowed the appeal, set aside the sentence and replaced it with a sentence of four months imprisonment (which was reduced to 90 days imprisonment to be served intermittently to account for time served). This was because, among other things, the sentencing judge erred regarding the principle of parity of sentences when he relied on outdated jurisprudence in luring cases which ignored the trend towards increased length of sentences for these types of offences. This error in principle led the judge to impose a conditional sentence which constituted a marked departure from sentences usually inflicted in luring cases even before the release of Friesen and Montour. The Superior Court also noted errors in the sentencing judges analysis of aggravating and mitigating factors which further justified its intervention in order to determine the appropriate sentence of four months imprisonment. The court then determined that the six-month mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly disproportionate to H.V.s sentence, but would be grossly disproportionate when applied to reasonably foreseeable scenarios. The Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. It found no error with respect to a four-month custodial sentence and agreed with the court below that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional (2022 QCCA 16). I accept that the fit and proportionate sentence for H.V. is four months imprisonment. \nFor his part, H.V. did not argue that the six-month mandatory minimum outlined in s. 172.1(2)(b) is grossly disproportionate when applied to his circumstances (see R.F., at para. 21). Instead, he argued here and in the courts below that the mandatory minimum sentence imposes a cruel and unusual punishment, thereby violating s. 12 of the Charter, when applied to reasonably foreseeable scenarios. I agree with H.V. that the six-month term of imprisonment required as a result of the mandatory minimum is not grossly disproportionate to the fit sentence of four months imprisonment. Given that neither the sentence for Mr. Bertrand Marchand nor H.V. is grossly disproportionate, I will review reasonable hypothetical scenarios to determine whether the mandatory minimum sentences are unconstitutional.\nThe Reasonably Foreseeable Scenarios Advanced \nThis Court recently affirmed in Hills that punishments can be impugned where they infringe the s. 12 Charter rights of a reasonably foreseeable offender (para. 68). To foreclose this option would artificially constrain the inquiry into the laws constitutionality (Nur, at para. 49). The use of representative offenders is at the protected core of the s. 12 analysis (Hills, at para. 71; see also Nur, at paras. 47 and 49-50). As such, when parties raise hypothetical scenarios as part of the adversarial process, a court should not dismiss a constitutional challenge without considering (1) whether the scenario is, in fact, reasonably foreseeable and, if so, (2) whether the representative offenders scenario could render the impugned law unconstitutional. \nBoth Mr. Bertrand Marchand and H.V. proffered several hypothetical scenarios in the courts below that they argue render the mandatory minimum sentences unconstitutional. They are raised again here. Mr. Bertrand Marchand referenced the facts of the representative offender considered by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Hood. All parties in Mr. Bertrand Marchands appeal agreed this scenario was reasonably foreseeable. During the hearing for H.V., I raised a scenario inspired by the facts of R. v. John, 2018 ONCA 702, 142 O.R. (3d) 670. I amended it to ensure the facts make out the luring offence. This Courts reasons in Hills direct that hypothetical scenarios are best tested through the adversarial process (para. 93). As such, I put the scenario to the appellants and the contours of the scenario were discussed during the hearing. While both Mr. Bertrand Marchand and H.V. make reference to other reasonably foreseeable scenarios, I am of the view that the scenarios identified in Hood and John are dispositive of the s. 12 analysis. \nFor the purposes of the constitutionality analysis for the one-year mandatory minimum sentence as outlined in s. 172.1(2)(a), the first scenario is as follows:\nThe representative offender is a first-year high school teacher in her late 20s with no criminal record. The offender has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. One evening, she texts her 15-year-old student to inquire about a school assignment. Feeling manic, she directs the conversation from casual to sexual. The two meet that same evening in a private location where they both participate in sexual touching. The offender does not engage inappropriately with the student on any further occasions. The offender pleads guilty and expresses remorse on sentencing. See Hood, at para. 150.\nMr. Bertrand Marchand also proffered this scenario at the Court of Appeal for the panels consideration. Because the majority agreed with the sentencing judge that s. 172.1(2)(a) was unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Bertrand Marchand, it did not consider this scenario. With respect to the dissenting judge, his refusal to consider any scenario advanced by Mr. Bertrand Marchand as part of his constitutionality analysis was in error.\nAs noted above, this scenario was also previously considered by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Hood. The court found this scenario was reasonable and not remote or far-fetched. The hypothetical offender in the scenario in Hood was loosely based on the offender, Ms. Hood, herself: both were teachers diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, rather than engaging with several victims as was the case for Ms. Hood, the representative offender only engaged in luring on one occasion with one victim. I agree with the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that this hypothetical scenario is not far-fetched and falls squarely within the scope of the offence, albeit on the less serious end of offending behaviour (para. 152). The scenario does not run afoul of this Courts direction in Hills that the personal characteristics of representative offenders should not be tailored to create far-fetched examples (para. 78). The court misspoke, however, by describing a portion of the offending conduct as fond[ling] (Hood, at para. 150), because describing sexual violence against children in this way incorrectly implies the behaviour is inherently less harmful than other forms of sexual violence (Friesen, at para. 144). I have revised the scenario accordingly. With this revision, the first scenario is reasonably foreseeable. The appellants in Mr. Bertrand Marchands appeal conceded the same during oral argument.\nFor the purposes of the constitutionality analysis for the six-month mandatory minimum sentence as outlined in s. 172.1(2)(b), the second scenario is as follows:\nThe representative offender is an 18-year-old who is in a romantic and sexual relationship with a 17-year-old. In one text, the offender asks her to send him an explicit photo. She does, and he then forwards that photo to his friend without his girlfriends knowledge. This friend, who is also 18, does not transmit this photo to anyone, but retains it on his mobile phone. See John, at para. 29.\nThis scenario is inspired by one approved by the court in John. In that case, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered the constitutionality of the then six-month mandatory minimum sentence for possession of child pornography (s. 163.1(4)(a)) pursuant to s. 12 of the Charter. The scenario proffered involved an 18-year-old whose friend forwards him a sext from the friends 17-year-old girlfriend without her knowledge (para. 29). Specifically, the court found that the scenario is reasonable because it falls outside the private use exception outlined in Sharpe and would thereby attract criminal liability (John, at para. 38). The court ultimately found the mandatory minimum in that case would be grossly disproportionate for this hypothetical offender and it was declared of no force or effect. The scenario I proposed for luring also falls outside the private use exception outlined in Sharpe because the exception does not apply to the publishing or distributing of child pornography (see Sharpe, at para. 117). Here the representative offender, the boyfriend, distributed the child pornography to a third party, his friend, contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. \nThis scenario makes out the constituent elements of the offence of luring and is reasonable in view of the range of conduct captured by the luring offence (see Hills, at para. 82). Section 163.1(3) is one of the secondary offences referenced in s. 172.1(1)(a). The representative offender in this scenario texted his underage girlfriend with the purpose of facilitating the secondary offence of distributing child pornography (s. 163.1(3)). Further, though the scenario falls at the less serious end of the spectrum of conduct captured by the child luring offence, I find that it is reasonably foreseeable. Teenagers do send one another sexualized photos involving partial nudity (see L. Karaian and D. Brady, Revisiting the Private Use Exception to Canadas Child Pornography Laws: Teenage Sexting, Sex-Positivity, Pleasure, and Control in the Digital Age (2019), 56 Osgoode Hall L.J. 301, at p. 306). In fact, the practice is commonplace enough that the term sexting has gained mainstream recognition. As well, at the hearing, counsel for the appellant His Majesty the King conceded that this scenario was reasonably foreseeable. \nA Fit Sentence for the Representative Offenders\nIn addressing the first stage of the s. 12 analysis and in setting the fit and proportionate sentence for the particular or representative offender, courts must define as specific a sentence as possible (Hills, at para. 94). Scrupulously selecting a precise and defined sentence also supports an analytically fair and principled result at the second stage of the s. 12 inquiry (para. 65). The comparative exercise central to the gross disproportionality analysis requires careful adherence to established sentencing principles in the first stage. To determine the fit and proportionate sentence for the representative offenders at bar, the Court must consider the sentencing objectives as set out in ss. 718 and following of the Criminal Code. Any court determining a fit sentence for a representative offender must examine any aggravating and mitigating factors at play and exercise restraint in imposing terms of incarceration (s. 718.2(d) and (e)). Sentencing judges and appellate courts must not magnify aggravating factors or narrow mitigating ones to reach desired conclusions. \nSection 718.1 directs that sentences must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Additionally, s. 718.01 directs judges to give primary consideration to denunciation and deterrence when sentencing offences involving abuse against children. At the same time, judges do retain judicial discretion to weigh other relevant sentencing objectives in the circumstances. Courts must individualize the sentence by accounting for the gravity of the offence, the offenders individual circumstances and the offenders moral culpability (R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 44; Lacasse, at para. 12; R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 51). Even where Parliament has directed that the objectives of denunciation and deterrence are paramount at sentencing, judges must apply all the principles mandated by ss. 718.1 and 718.2 to craft a sentence that furthers the overall objectives of sentencing (Ipeelee, at para. 51). Deference to Parliaments objectives is not unlimited; to ensure respect for human dignity, the door to rehabilitation must remain open (Bissonnette, at paras. 46 and 85; Hills, at paras. 140-41; Nasogaluak, at para. 43). \nA Fit Sentence for Luring in the First Reasonably Foreseeable Scenario\nIn Hood, when the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal considered a scenario similar to that of the first scenario proffered here, it concluded that the hypothetical crime would likely attract a suspended sentence with probation or, at most, a brief period of incarceration (para. 154). Instead the court found that a global fit sentence for the representative offender would be a suspended sentence with a term of probation. However, Hood was decided before this Courts decision in Friesen. The fit sentence assigned by the Court of Appeal in Hood is not reflective of the directive from Friesen that sexual offences against children are violent crimes that wrongfully exploit childrens vulnerability and as such [s]entences for these crimes must increase (para. 5). Interestingly, in Friesen, this Court cited Hood as an example of an offender whose serious cognitive limitations would likely reduce her moral culpability at sentencing (para. 91).\nIn the unique circumstances of this hypothetical scenario, the inherent wrongfulness and severity of the offence must be balanced against the offenders mental illness, remorse, and prospects of rehabilitation. A fit sentence for the luring offence committed by the representative offender in the first scenario is a 30-day intermittent sentence. \nThe representative offender is a high school teacher in her late 20s who committed a serious breach of her professional duties and inappropriately directed a conversation with her 15-year-old student towards sexual matters with the intention of facilitating the secondary offence under s. 151 of the Criminal Code. Although this teacher would presumably be relatively junior as compared to her colleagues, she holds a position of trust and authority in relation to her student per s. 718.2(a)(iii). A breach of trust is likely to increase the harm to the victim and thus the gravity of the offence (Friesen, at para. 126). The severity of such a breach is not to be taken lightly: teachers are entrusted to educate and serve as role models for children, not to sexualize them for their own purposes. In this case in particular, the representative offender exploited her position of authority in the commission of the offence, including by using her relationship to the victim to gain access by texting him under the guise of discussing homework. This element increases her moral blameworthiness and serves as an aggravating factor. As well, the wide age gap between the offender and the victim is further aggravating: as the offender was in her late 20s, there is at least a 10-year age difference. \nAt the same time, it is important to acknowledge that while the representative offenders conduct was serious, it likely falls at the lower end of the range of gravity in all the circumstances. All offences of this type have the potential to cause substantial harm to victims. However, it remains significant that this offenders actions were spontaneous and of short duration, rather than malicious and calculated. Unlike in many other child luring cases that are typically associated with prolonged contact, and thereby far greater harm, in this case there is no evidence of grooming or long term planning. While these factors are not mitigating, they do provide insight into the overall gravity of the offence and culpability of the offender, which is comparatively lower than in other cases. It is well established that spontaneous or spur of the moment crimes should be punished less severely than planned or premeditated ones (see, e.g., R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 (C.A.), at para. 18; R. v. Murphy, 2014 ABCA 409, 593 A.R. 60, at para. 42; R. v. Vienneau, 2015 ONCA 898, at para. 12 (CanLII)). Furthermore, the representative offender entered a guilty plea, expressed remorse on sentencing and has no prior criminal record  all of which are significant mitigating factors. \nFinally, in assessing the offenders moral culpability, it is significant that the representative offender in the first scenario was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her symptoms were similar to the actual offender described in Hood. At trial, Ms. Hoods criminal responsibility was an issue of real controversy (R. v. Hood, 2016 NSPC 19, 371 N.S.R. (2d) 324; see also the reasons for sentence in R. v. Hood, 2016 NSPC 78). Although the trial judge did find her to be criminally responsible, he accepted that Ms. Hood experienced bipolar disorder type I. As a result, Ms. Hoods mania rendered her profoundly disinhibited and prone to risk taking, elevated by a sense of invincibility, and impaired by defective insight and inhibition ((Hood (sentencing reasons), at para. 55 (CanLII)). The sentencing judge in Hood found that her symptoms had a nexus with her crimes (para. 55). Similarly, in the instant case the representative offenders bipolar diagnosis, though it serves as no justification or excuse for her behaviour, attenuates her degree of responsibility and acts as a mitigating factor on sentencing (R. v. Ayorech, 2012 ABCA 82, 522 A.R. 306, at paras. 10-13; R. v. Tremblay, 2006 ABCA 252, 401 A.R. 9, at para. 7; R. v. Belcourt, 2010 ABCA 319, 490 A.R. 224, at para. 8; R. v. Resler, 2011 ABCA 167, 505 A.R. 330, at para. 14). Where a mental illness existed at the time of the offence and contributed to the offenders behaviour, sentencing judges should consider prioritizing rehabilitation and treatment through community intervention (R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43, 324 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 270, at paras. 20-21; R. v. Ellis, 2013 ONCA 739, 303 C.C.C. (3d) 228, at para. 117). This is especially the case given that offenders with mental illnesses are often distinctly negatively affected by imprisonment (see Ruby, at 5.325 and 5.332).\nEven so, while rehabilitation must be prioritized for this offender, a non-custodial sentence is not appropriate given the seriousness of the offence. In the result, I find a 30-day intermittent sentence is a fit sentence for the representative offender at bar. Such a sentence recognizes the inherent seriousness and potential harms associated with the offence and appropriately denounces her conduct, while also being mindful of her diminished moral blameworthiness and the mitigating factors at play. \nA Fit Sentence for Luring in the Second Reasonably Foreseeable Scenario\nThe representative offender in the second scenario engaged in a serious breach of the victims privacy and dignity that should be condemned by a criminal sanction. However, the significant mitigating factors in this scenario warrant a sentence on the low end of the spectrum. A fit sentence for the luring that the representative offender in the second scenario engaged in is a conditional discharge. \nThe 18-year-old offender texted his 17-year-old girlfriend with the intent to wrongfully transmit a pornographic photo of her to his friend. It is important to emphasize that this was far from an innocent communication: the basis for criminal liability is the accuseds intent to send the photo on to a person for whom it was not intended, as he could not have been convicted of luring if the photo was for his own private use (see Sharpe). The representative offender should have known that sharing a sexualized photo of his underage, adolescent partner with a third party was not only impermissible, but harmful, particularly given the risk that the photo could have been distributed on to other recipients and could have thereby exposed the victim to bullying and sexual extortion (see A. Carlton, Sextortion: The Hybrid Cyber-Sex Crime (2020), 21:3 N.C. J.L. & Tech. 177, at p. 180). Even putting aside that this risk of further distribution did not materialize, non-consensual distribution of an intimate image is inherently associated with loss of dignity and autonomy, and could lead to a profound sense of shame as well as reduced trust in future romantic partners. In light of the seriousness of the representative offenders behaviour at the expense of the adolescent victim, a criminal sanction is warranted. \nThat said, the most significant mitigating factor in this second scenario is that the offender is a youthful first offender. Although the 18-year-old offender is legally an adult and the 17-year-old victim is not, without minimizing the impact of the offence on the victim, an appropriate sentence must account for the fact that both parties are young, close in age, and in a consensual relationship that shows no signs of the long-term exploitation or grooming that is involved in many child luring cases. Similar to the representative offender considered in Hills, the criminalized conduct in this case indicates a lack of guidance or adult mentorship more than it does the offenders criminal intent (para. 161). Rehabilitation and individual deterrence are primary sentencing objectives when sentencing youthful first offenders. Even though an 18-year-old offender falls outside the scope of the youth criminal justice system, his lack of maturity remains an important consideration (R. v. Priest (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at pp. 543-44; R. v. Tan, 2008 ONCA 574, 268 O.A.C. 385, at para. 32; R. v. T. (K.), 2008 ONCA 91, 89 O.R. (3d) 99, at paras. 41-42). It is crucial that all other dispositions be explored before imposing custodial sentences on youthful first offenders (R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 377). \nHere, a conditional discharge with strict probationary terms would serve the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. By contrast, a custodial sentence would be disproportionate and would not reflect the reduced degree of responsibility of a youthful first offender who would primarily benefit from re-education, not excess punishment. As a result, I would sentence this representative offender to a six-month conditional discharge with probation. \nThe Mandatory Minimum Penalties Are Grossly Disproportionate to the Fit Sentences for the Representative Offenders\nScope and Reach of the Offence\nThe scope and reach of the luring offence renders it constitutionally suspect. The jurisprudence instructs that where a mandatory minimum sentence captures disparate conduct of widely varying gravity and degrees of offender culpability, it may be more vulnerable to constitutional challenge (Hills, at para. 125; Lloyd, at para. 24; Smith, at p. 1078). This Court noted in Lloyd that mandatory minimum penalties for offences that can be committed in many ways and under many different circumstances by a wide range of people are constitutionally vulnerable (para. 3). This is because when an offence is inordinately broad, the mandatory sentence may be proportionate or permissible for most offenders, but grossly disproportionate for other offenders who are far less culpable or whose conduct is far less harmful (Nur, at para. 83; Hills, at para. 125). As part of this analysis, courts should assess how broad a range of conduct is captured by the actus reus and mens rea of the offence and consider the included degree of variation in the offences gravity and the offenders culpability (Hills, at para. 129). While Parliament is not precluded from legislating mandatory minimum sentences, Parliament must not mandate grossly disproportionate sentences that subject any offender to cruel and unusual punishment. \nThe three elements of child luring pursuant to s. 172.1 are: (1) the accused communicated intentionally by telecommunication; (2) with someone the accused knows or believes is under 18 years of age (or 16 or 14, depending on the applicable paragraph); and (3) the accuseds communication was for the specific purpose of facilitating the commission of a designated secondary offence with respect to the underage person (Legare, at para. 36; Levigne, at para. 23). In the context of a police sting operation, where the complainant is not in fact a child, the knowledge/wilful blindness element is replaced by the accuseds belief that their interlocutor is a child.\nThe actus reus of child luring includes communication with the complainant by means of telecommunications. The term telecommunications is defined in s. 35(1) of the Interpretation Act as the emission, transmission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds or intelligence of any nature by any wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system, or by any similar technical system. As an inchoate offence, child luring stands separate and apart from the designated secondary offences. Moreover, it attaches to a broad range of secondary offences, and can be committed in various ways, under a broad array of circumstances (Morrison, at para. 179, per Karakatsanis J., concurring). In the context of the luring offence, facilitating means helping to bring about and making easier or more probable (Legare, at para. 28 (emphasis deleted)). \nRelying on Paradee, the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta argues that the mens rea for child luring is narrow and specific. In its view, the Crown must prove that the accused subjectively foresaw that the luring communication would facilitate an offence involving abuse of a child and that the accused acted with the intention to facilitate that goal. In Paradee, the Court of Appeal of Alberta stated that luring involves pre-meditated conduct specifically designed to engage an underage person in a relationship with the offender, with the goal of reducing the inhibitions of the young person so that he or she will be prepared to engage in further conduct that is not only criminal but extremely harmful (para. 12). Similarly, this Court has previously discussed child luring by reference to predators lurking in cyberspace, cloaked in anonymity, using online communications as a tool for meeting and grooming children with a view to sexually exploiting them (Morrison, at para. 2).\nHowever, common characteristics of an offence should not be conflated with its essential elements. While the luring offence certainly captures the mental states described in Paradee, they are not part of its requisite mens rea. Pre-meditation or planning may not always be present where the elements of child luring are made out. An accused may impulsively communicate in a sexual manner  and in that moment have the specific intent required to ground a conviction for child luring  without having taken time beforehand to plan, contemplate, or prepare to execute a secondary offence. Neither does grooming necessarily accompany the commission of the child luring offence. Evidence of grooming may often be present where child luring is made out, but it is not a required element.\nIn this way, the specific intent element  that the accused must communicate with the purpose of facilitating a designated offence  is not narrow but broad. Section 172.1(1) captures a wide range of designated illicit purposes with varying degrees of moral culpability. For example, the jurisprudence demonstrates that offenders with developmental disabilities, though less morally blameworthy, are often convicted of child luring (Melrose; Deren; R. v. S. (S.), 2014 ONCJ 184, 307 C.R.R. (2d) 147). In Morrison, Justice Karakatsanis noted that s. 172.1(2)(a) is vulnerable to constitutional challenge because [t]he range of conduct that constitutes an offence under this section is extremely broad (para. 181). \nAs mentioned above, the luring offence is triggered by the use of any telecommunication platform. This includes any and all internet platforms, be it Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Twitch, Hinge, Tinder or other popular messaging, streaming or dating applications. Not only does this demonstrate the massive breadth of the luring offence, it also raises the issue of the medium and its effect on the message. For example, certain online applications require users to indicate they are the age of the majority and old enough to be present on the platform. However, this requirement can be bypassed by underage users with the click of a button. Or, as was the case in Koenig, adult users who use internet sites not designed for predatory purposes may wrongfully engage in conversation with a minor that constitutes luring without making best efforts to verify the age of other users they engage with online.\nThis is not to say that individuals who engage sexually with children online are not morally blameworthy. However, in certain cases the impugned conduct may not rightly attract jail time. In Koenig, Justice Skilnick noted that the Accused is not the typical offender that Parliament had in mind when it passed its legislation. He did not seek out or attempt to lure a child, and in fact his communications were on a website that does not allow the user to pick the person he is communicating with (para. 5 (CanLII)). \nThe child luring offence also, rightly, punishes both offenders who communicate with actual children and offenders who ultimately communicate with police officers posing as children through sting operations. In Friesen, this Court noted that though the absence of a specific child victim should not be overemphasized in setting a fit sentence, it remains relevant to the proportionality analysis (para. 93). In this way, this Court acknowledged a material difference between the two main ways child luring may be committed: where the offender is actually communicating with an underage person versus where the offender is under the impression he is communicating with someone underage but in actuality is communicating with law enforcement. This further demonstrates the provisions breadth.\nThe range of conduct captured is staggering. Notably, the offender need not actually commit any secondary offence. He need only communicate with an underage person for the purpose of facilitating one of the twenty secondary offences including: sexual exploitation (s. 153(1)), incest (s. 155), child pornography (s. 163.1), procuring sexual activity (parent or guardian) (s. 170), permitting prohibited sexual activity (householder) (s. 171), trafficking of persons under 18 (s. 279.011), receiving benefit from the trafficking of persons under 18 (s. 279.02(2)), withholding or destroying travel documents in service of trafficking persons under 18 (s. 279.03(2)), obtaining sexual services for consideration from a person under 18 (s. 286.1(2)), receiving materials benefit from the sexual services provided by a person under 18 (s. 286.2(2)), procuring a person under 18 to provide sexual services (s. 286.3(2)), sexual interference (s. 151), invitation to sexual touching of a person under 18 (s. 152), bestiality in the presence of or by a child (s. 160(3)), exposure to a person under 16 (s. 173(2)), sexual assault of a person under 16 (s. 271), sexual assault with a weapon of a person under 16 (s. 272), aggravated sexual assault of a person under 16 (s. 273), abduction of a person under 16 (s. 280), and abduction of a person under 14 (s. 281). In turn, while all of the secondary offences have the potential to cause devastating harm to victims and typically warrant harsh sentences, those offences are, amongst themselves, of varying degrees of seriousness, and the scope of several of them is also wide. These features of the luring offence further threaten the constitutionality of its mandatory penalties.\nLower courts have increasingly noted that the luring offence applies to a wide range of conduct and captures varying degrees of moral blameworthiness (R. v. Saffari, 2019 ONCJ 861, at para. 88 (CanLII); Sutherland, at para. 47). This was also previously recognized by Justice Karakatsanis in her concurring reasons in Morrison. There, Justice Karakatsanis explained that the purpose of the luring can vary: offenders might use the internet to target children for the purpose of physically exploiting them or offenders might have no intention of meeting their victims in person (para. 182). Similarly, the duration of the communications can vary: some cases may involve extended dialogue with the victim in order to groom him or her but other cases might involve a short series of messages lasting only a few minutes or even a single text (para. 182). Finally, she noted that the communications could be between the offender and an actual child, or between an offender and a police officer conducting a sting operation. Justice Karakatsanis aptly noted that this range of conduct and of moral blameworthiness may impact the level of harm caused by the offence, thereby informing what constitutes a fit and proportionate sentence (para. 182). \nAn examination of the jurisprudence offers additional insight into the range of moral blameworthiness foreseeably captured by s. 172.1. For example, the offender in Melrose, who pleaded guilty to offences including luring, was a developmentally delayed adult aged 27 with an IQ that corresponded to the mental age of around a 9-year-old (para. 132). The victim was 13. The sentencing judge, Justice Renke, found that the offenders mental age was below the victims chronological age. The evidence revealed that Mr. Melrose was unable to anticipate the long-term consequences of his actions and the effect his actions may have on the underage victim (para. 145). The sentencing judge found that the offender did not understand the types of harms risked by his conduct and reasoned that Mr. Melroses cognitive difficulties greatly reduced the offenders moral blameworthiness (paras. 229-32). Justice Renke noted that lurings requirement that the offender attempt to facilitate a secondary offence runs the gamut from the impulsive (albeit still intentional) to the carefully calculated (para. 331). Because proof of facilitation does not necessarily include proof of complex planning, the luring offence can capture conduct that is bereft of sophistication or considered intention. In the result, the mens rea of the offence does not necessitate a high degree of moral blameworthiness and instead captures a broad range of culpable conduct.\nDespite this breadth, the distinct harm of luring will, in many cases, rightly attract a term of imprisonment that falls within the range of the mandatory minimum sentence. This is because in many cases the gravity of the offence is high: the harms are distinct and the conduct is inherently wrongful. As set out in Friesen and reiterated above, luring involves sexual violence, carried out via the internet, and can cause pervasive and permanent serious psychological harm to victims (paras. 56-58 and 82). Despite the inherent gravity of the offence, the Court in Friesen directed that factors that reduce the offenders moral culpability remain relevant. Chief Justice Wagner and Justice Rowe, writing for a unanimous Court, acknowledged that in the case of sexual assault and sexual interference committed against children, these are broadly-defined offences that embrace a wide spectrum of conduct so, as a result, the offenders conduct will be less morally blameworthy in some cases than in others (para. 91). The impugned offence typifies this reality. The incredible breadth of offending conduct is not reflected in the rigidity of the mandatory minimum sentence. While Parliament must be afforded deference in crafting sentencing provisions, s. 12 of the Charter imposes certain constitutional limits (Hills, at para. 140). \nThe Effect of the Punishment on the Offenders\nThe effect of the punishment on both representative offenders in this case is harsh. This Court directed in Hills that the gross disproportionality analysis must include consideration of what material effects the mandatory minimum may have on offenders subject to it (para. 133). Courts must examine the particular characteristics of the individual offender before them or consider the qualities of the reasonably foreseeable offender, and then evaluate what harm may result from the impugned punishment. In the instant scenarios, the mandatory minimum punishment is alternatively 12 months or 6 months incarceration. \nThe First Representative Offender\nEvidence that imprisonment would have significant deleterious effects on an offender should be considered at this stage (Hills, at paras. 133-35). The representative offender in the first scenario was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her symptoms mirrored that of the actual offender described in Hood. In certain circumstances, courts have found extended periods of incarceration served in custody inappropriate for individuals with bipolar disorder and have instead ordered offenders to seek psychiatric care, attend treatment programs and/or serve their sentences in community in lieu of a custodial sentence (see R. v. Dickson, 2007 BCCA 561, 228 C.C.C. (3d) 450; R. v. Shevchenko, 2018 ABCA 31, at paras. 60-63 (CanLII); R. v. Vivian, 2001 ABQB 468, 289 A.R. 378, at para. 16; R. v. Sulek, 2011 ABPC 314, 21 M.V.R. (6th) 336; R. v. Legg, 2014 ABPC 238, 26 Alta. L.R. (6th) 181, at para. 28). \nThe Office of the Correctional Investigator has accepted that the conditions of confinement can be disproportionately harsh on individuals with mental disorders. The carceral setting can induce or augment disordered symptoms and, in turn, these symptoms may be met with security-driven interventions that exacerbate mental health issues in offenders (see, e.g., Office of the Correctional Investigator, Annual Report 2021-2022 (2022), at p. 25; Office of the Correctional Investigator, A Legacy of Missed Opportunities: The Case of Ashley Smith, November 23, 2011 (online)). Further, prisoners in certain federal institutions may wait up to 12 months before gaining access to mental health services (see Annual Report 2021-2022, at p. 14). In Ayorech, the offender was diagnosed with schizophrenia and a developmental disorder. The Court of Appeal found that Mr. Ayorechs mental disorders left him vulnerable in an institutional setting and accepted the expert witness conclusion that the offender was ill equipped to survive in the prison system (para. 13). \nAlthough the first representative offender is not developmentally delayed, several lower courts have struck mandatory minimums for luring or declined to apply them in the context of offenders with severe developmental disabilities with a view to the harsh impacts of imprisonment on these individuals (see Melrose; Deren; Fawcett). In Melrose, the sentencing judge found that the offender would be a child among men in a custodial setting and would be taken advantage of by members of the institutions general population (para. 250). Justice Renke found that Mr. Melrose would be harmed, emotionally, psychologically, and likely physically, should he be sentenced to any significant period of imprisonment (para. 250). Incarceration also has a disproportionate effect on individuals with significant cognitive impairments by disrupting the necessary supports that have been implemented to help these individuals live a life of dignity. The sentencing judge in Deren declined to impose the six-month mandatory minimum for luring on an offender with severe developmental disabilities, in part because a jail sentence of that length would impact his access to Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped, as well as his housing and limited employment (para. 70). \nThe effect of the one-year mandatory minimum on the first representative offender is harsh. Not only does it replace a short intermittent sentence with a year of incarceration, the offenders individual circumstances would likely make her experience of incarceration perilously grave. In R. v. Valiquette (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 325 (Que. C.A.), the court noted most people understand that the mentally ill require treatment and supervision, not punishment (p. 331). Most often, mental illness is viewed as a mitigating factor at sentencing as it may reduce an offenders moral culpability and sentencing judges recognize that offenders with mental disorders are particularly affected by imprisonment (see Ruby). Each of these factors indicate the mandatory minimums constitutional infirmity.\nThe Second Representative Offender\nThe second representative offender is a youthful offender  a group the criminal law views as holding high rehabilitative prospects. The mandatory minimum in the instance case would replace the fit sentence of a conditional discharge with a substantial custodial sentence (see also Hills, at para. 143). As a youthful first-time offender, the representative offender should benefit from the shortest possible sentence proportionate to the offence at issue (see R. v. Brown, 2015 ONCA 361, 126 O.R. (3d) 797, at para. 7; R. v. Laine, 2015 ONCA 519, 338 O.A.C. 264, at para. 85). Youthful offenders are often bullied, pressured to join adult prison gangs, and are vulnerable to segregation placements (Hills, at para. 165; Office of the Correctional Investigator and Office of the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, Missed Opportunities: The Experience of Young Adults Incarcerated in Federal Penitentiaries (2017)). The six-month mandatory minimum in this case is a far cry from the shortest possible rehabilitative sentence for this offender. \nThe Penalty and its Objectives\nLuring is a serious offence that must be punished accordingly. The offence dovetails with s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code, which, as mentioned above, directs that in imposing sentences for offences involving abuse of children, primary consideration must be given to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence. Parliaments decision to increase the maximum penalties for the luring offence in 2015 as part of the Tougher Penalties for Child Predators Act further indicates Parliaments view of the gravity of the offence. These legislative amendments should have an upward pull on sentences for this offence, regardless of whether the mandatory minimum remains intact.\nParliament enacted s. 172.1 in response to the growth of the internet as a burgeoning domain for predators to target children (Morrison, at paras. 1-3). The access that sexual offenders have to children through social media is unprecedented (R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, at para. 102). Young people are perpetually available online through their smartphones, tablets, computers and other electronic devices  all sites where they are vulnerable to being targeted. \nChild luring not only lays the foundation for dangerous in-person criminal offences, it also causes its own distinct harm to child victims.\nThat being said, the attached mandatory minimum sentences go beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliaments sentencing objectives. The offences wide net of potential liability, while an asset for the preventative nature of the offence, also serves as the constitutional undoing of its penalties. The broad nature of the offence captures a range of conduct with varying culpability. As a result, it thrusts a mandatory punishment on conduct far removed and disconnected from that which Parliament sought to prevent. \nA comparison between the punishments imposed for several of the secondary offences and the mandatory minimum for luring further reveals a significant disproportion. While several of the 20 secondary offences associated with luring themselves attract no mandatory minimum penalty, others may attract far lower penalties than either mandatory minimum for the luring offence. For example, exposure prosecuted on summary conviction attracts a mandatory minimum of 30 days imprisonment (see s. 173(2)(b)). This is not to suggest that luring does not create its own distinct harm, but it is clear the range of conduct captured by the offences actus reus includes anything from years of careful grooming to a single online message to a complainant. It is striking that an impulsive message alone could attract a one-year term of imprisonment, while the offence the text attempted to facilitate could itself attract little to no incarceration. \nIn the case of both representative offenders, the length of imprisonment required by the mandatory minimum sentences is excessive in light of alternative sentences that would be sufficient to meet Parliaments sentencing objectives. While a one-year or six-month minimum term of imprisonment for child luring will not be grossly disproportionate for most offenders, it is a severe punishment for certain offenders, particularly youthful offenders, offenders with mental disorders and those with severe developmental disabilities. Where an offenders mental illness contributes to the commission of the luring offence, specific deterrence, general deterrence and denunciation are of little use because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example of others and because people with mental illnesses will likely not be deterred by the punishment of others (Ruby, at 5.316-5.321; see Resler, at para. 14; R. v. Robinson (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 197; Deren, at para. 65). Instead, rehabilitation should hold greater weight when sentencing mentally ill offenders like the representative offender at bar (R. v. Hynes (1991), 89 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 316 (N.L.C.A.), at para. 53). While this Court directed in Friesen that sentences for sexual offences against children should properly reflect the offenders moral blameworthiness, the Court also acknowledged that the personal circumstances of an offender can have a mitigating effect and reduce the offenders moral culpability (para. 91). \nIn light of the reduced moral blameworthiness of mentally ill offenders, the mandatory minimums in relation to the luring offence not only deprive courts of the ability to tailor proportionate sentences at the lower end of the sentencing range when appropriate, they operate in the extreme to impose unjust sentences that violate the principle of proportionality (see Nur, at para. 44). As a result, the mandatory sentences demonstrate the states complete disregard for the specific circumstances of the sentenced individual and for the proportionality of the punishment inflicted on them (Bissonnette, at para. 61). Imposing six-months or one years incarceration on a mentally ill offender when the fit sentence is a relatively short intermittent sentence does not respect the fundamental principle of proportionality (Nasogaluak, at para. 40). Instead, it indicates Parliament has prioritized denunciation and deterrence to the near complete exclusion of rehabilitation. This Court noted in Hills that while deference is owed to Parliaments sentencing choices, [n]o single sentencing objective should be applied to the exclusion of all others (para. 140; Nasogaluak, at para. 43).\nBecause intermittent sentences are only available for sentences of 90 days or less, the impugned mandatory minimum provides no discretion for courts to impose a sentence of this kind. While an intermittent sentence is a form of imprisonment, it is materially distinct from a full-time carceral sentence in that it allows offenders to serve their jail term in truncated periods while being subject to probation outside of jail. An intermittent sentence prioritizes rehabilitation by allowing offenders to potentially preserve their employment, maintain familial and community ties and continue specialized treatment that may not be available at a correctional institution. Here, the fact that the mandatory minimum does not permit courts to impose intermittent sentences where that sentence is the fit and proportionate sentence renders the provision constitutionally suspect (see Hills, at para. 144). \nChild luring is a hybrid offence, meaning that the Crown can choose, based on factors such as the seriousness of the accuseds actions and the harm caused, to proceed either by indictment or summarily. In turn, that choice impacts the severity of the sentence imposed, as the mandatory minimum attached to a summary luring conviction is six-months rather than a year for luring proceeding by indictment. Justice Karakatsanis noted that this legislative choice clearly demonstrates that Parliament understood that, in certain circumstances, a sentence far below that required by the one-year mandatory minimum would be appropriate (Morrison, at para. 185). The disparity between the two mandatory minimum sentences outlined in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) is disquieting. \nThe hybrid nature of the child luring offence cannot shield it from constitutional scrutiny. This Court has found that an unconstitutional mandatory minimum cannot be saved by the Crowns discretion to proceed summarily. Sentencing is a judicial function, while Crown prosecutors are in an adversarial role to accused persons (Nur, at paras. 85-86). For the impugned offence, there is no clear delineation between cases that proceed summarily versus cases that proceed by indictment. In R. v. C.D.R., 2020 ONSC 645, the accused was caught by a police sting operation and pleaded guilty to, amongst other offences, child luring. The Crown confirmed that cases of a similar nature may proceed either summarily or by indictment  little distinguished them (paras. 31-33 (CanLII)). Justice De Sa rightly queried, [h]ow can a seemingly arbitrary imposition of an additional 6 months incarceration in this case not be grossly disproportionate? (para. 33). \nWhere a six-month sentence may be an appropriate sentence for a certain set of conduct but a one-year sentence is arbitrarily imposed instead, solely as a result of prosecutorial discretion, that leads to the same uncertainty and unpredictability in the law that this Court attempted to guard against in R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96 (see para. 72) and Nur (see para. 91). The Crowns election should not determine whether an offender receives a fit sentence or an excessive sentence. This aspect of the sentencing regime would be intolerable and shocking to Canadians (see Saffari, at para. 90; C.D.R., at paras. 31-33 and 38).\nSimply striking the one-year mandatory minimum and leaving the six-month punishment intact presents its own set of related issues  including an issue of parity. If the summary conviction punishment remains, an individual may be charged summarily for ostensibly less serious conduct than would be charged by indictment and potentially face a more serious punishment by virtue of the mandatory minimum. This potential outcome further highlights the difference between the role of a sentencing judge and the role of a Crown prosecutor. It is the judges role to craft a fit and proportionate sentence in light of the circumstances of the offender and the gravity of the offence after being presented with evidence of the offenders background and individual circumstances. In contrast, the Crown prosecutor is tasked with using their discretion to choose a path to conviction with little information about the offenders individual circumstances and while balancing other priorities. These include local judicial resources, considerations of delay and limitation periods, and the prospect of the complainant potentially being required to testify twice, given that the 14-year maximum penalty for the luring offence when prosecuted by indictment triggers the availability of a preliminary hearing. \nThat arrangement would locate this offence squarely within a zone deemed problematic by this Court in Nur. To accept this state of affairs could result in replacing a public hearing on the constitutionality of [the provision] before an independent and impartial court with the discretionary decision of a Crown prosecutor (para. 86). It would create the potential for an uneven and unequal application of the law (para. 91) where an individual can face a fixed mandatory minimum punishment instead of a fit and proportionate sentence crafted by a judge, depending solely on a discretionary decision by the assigned Crown prosecutor. The publics perception of this imbalance may undermine its confidence in the administration of justice. \nThe incredible breadth of the luring offence and its harsh effect on representative offenders paired with the discordant internal scheme of the penalty renders the mandatory minimums in s. 172.1(2) constitutionally infirm. \nLet me be clear. Sexual offences against children are serious crimes and often warrant strict sanctions. For this reason, applying Friesens principles to child luring will generally result in an increase in the sentences previously ascribed for these crimes. However, there is no incongruity between affirming the severe wrongfulness and harms that often accompany child luring offences and finding the mandatory minimums ascribed to these sentences unconstitutional. Mandatory minimum sentences establish the lowest possible punishment courts may render for the least culpable offender. They do not prevent judges from assigning lengthier sentences for more blameworthy conduct. As such, striking the mandatory minimum sentence should not disturb the effect that the maximum sentence has on sentencing outcomes. The guidance of Friesen on the primacy of denunciation and deterrence when sentencing offenders for sexual offences against children remains. Removal of the mandatory minimum should not drain the deterrent effect of s. 172.1(2) any more than other offences where Parliament has directed denunciation and deterrence as primary sentencing objectives without assigning a mandatory minimum sentence. \nConclusion \nParliament is entitled to create criminal offences for broad purposes and with wide applications. Similarly, it may prioritize deterrence and denunciation in the crafting of fit and proportionate sentences and impose high maximum sentences to convey its view of the gravity of a particular offence.\nHowever, when it imposes a mandatory minimum sentence for a given offence, which applies to all cases without discretion or discernment, it runs the risk of creating a grossly disproportionate and unconstitutional penalty. Exceptionally broad offences, even inherently serious ones, can be committed in a variety of ways and with different levels of harm and moral culpability. A predatory adult who communicates by means of telecommunication over a long period of time to manipulate a child for the purpose of facilitating one of the secondary offences in s. 172.1(1) may well merit a custodial sentence considerably in excess of the mandatory minimum. On the other hand, there will be cases in which the gravity of the offence and the degree of moral blameworthiness of the offender may not merit a custodial sentence at all  and in which the public would be shocked to hear that a legislated period of imprisonment automatically applies. \nThis Courts decision in Friesen demands a more robust understanding of the wrongfulness and harms of luring, which will often yield greater penalties. However, given the enormous breadth of the luring offences, there will still be cases in which the mandatory minimum will be so out of sync with the realities of the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender so as to shock the conscience of an informed public.\nIndeed, despite strong statements in Friesen about the inherent wrongfulness and harmfulness of sexual violence against children, the Court expressly cautioned that their comments should not be taken as a direction to disregard relevant factors that may reduce the offenders moral culpability. The proportionality principle still governs to require that the punishment imposed be just and appropriate . . . and nothing more (para. 91, quoting M. (C.A.), at para. 80 (emphasis deleted)). \nFor the above reasons, I would allow the appeal in Mr. Bertrand Marchands case in part and increase Mr. Bertrand Marchands luring sentence to 12 months incarceration to be served consecutively to his sexual interference sentence. Both parties in that appeal have agreed that the remainder of the respondents sentence be permanently suspended. Accordingly, I order a permanent stay of execution of the modified sentence. I would affirm the conclusion in the courts below that the mandatory minimum sentence in s. 172.1(2)(a) is unconstitutional.\nI would dismiss the appeal in H.V.s case, which has the effect of affirming that the mandatory minimum sentence in s. 172.1(2)(b) is unconstitutional.\nThe mandatory minimum sentences in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code are inconsistent with s. 12 of the Charter, are not saved by s. 1 and are declared of no force or effect under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. \n\tEnglish version of the reasons delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nOverview\nSexual violence against children is an evil that afflicts our society and deprives its victims of the childhood to which they were entitled by exposing them to various forms of serious harm that can interfere with their development and self-fulfillment (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 58). Like concentric circles, the harm caused by the commission of such offences affects not only the children who are the immediate victims of the offences but also their families, their communities and, ultimately, society as a whole, which is diminished and degraded (Friesen, at paras. 62-64, quoting R. v. Hajar, 2016 ABCA 222, [2016] 12 W.W.R. 435, at para. 67).\nThe criminalization of sexual violence against minors attests to the cardinal importance that Canada attaches to the protection of its children (R. v. L. (J.-J.) (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 235 (Que. C.A.), at p. 250), which is one of the most fundamental values of Canadian society (Friesen, at para. 65). As this Court noted in Friesen, the criminal law in general and sentencing law specifically are important mechanisms that Parliament has chosen to employ to protect children from sexual violence (para. 45). Further, sentencing is a way for our society to express, through the courts, its abhorrence of such offences, which encroach on the system of values shared by all Canadians (R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 81).\nIn this regard, Parliament decided, through the enactment of s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (Cr. C.), to prioritize the objectives of denunciation and deterrence in the sentencing process for such offences. It also chose to increase the maximum sentences for offences of this kind, thereby recognizing the profound harm . . . cause[d] by such conduct (Friesen, at para. 95). Lastly, Parliament decided, in some cases, to enact mandatory minimum sentences. Notably, it did so for the offence of child luring in s. 172.1 Cr. C., which provides for a minimum term of imprisonment of six months or one year, depending on whether the Crown proceeds summarily or by indictment. In these appeals, this Court must determine whether these minimum terms of imprisonment are cruel and unusual within the meaning of s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\nIn addressing this issue, it is important to keep in mind that there is no constitutional provision that protects against the imposition of a disproportionate punishment; s. 12 of the Charter protects against the imposition of a grossly disproportionate punishment. Proportionality is certainly an essential principle of sentencing. However, this principle has not been constitutionalized (R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180, at para. 71; R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 169). As this Court explained in Safarzadeh-Markhali, [t]he principles and purposes for determining a fit sentence, enumerated in s. 718 of the Criminal Code and provisions that follow  including the fundamental principle of proportionality in s. 718.1  do not have constitutional status (para. 71). Indeed, Parliament is entitled to modify and abrogate them as it sees fit, subject only to s. 12 of the Charter (para. 71; see also R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at paras. 52-53).\nThe standard of gross disproportionality is intended to be demanding and will be attained only rarely (Bissonnette, at para. 70 (emphasis added), citing, among others, R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 45). Accordingly, showing that a sentence is demonstrably unfit, or even excessive, is not sufficient (Boudreault, at para. 45; R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, at paras. 113-14). To be grossly disproportionate, a minimum sentence must be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency and abhorrent or intolerable to society (R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] S.C.R. 130, at para. 24). By setting such a high bar, courts ensure that the necessary deference is shown to Parliaments public policy choices with regard to sentencing (Hills, at para. 113). With respect, my colleagues reasons completely erode such deference.\nIn light of this Courts recent pronouncements in Friesen and the high standard that applies in an analysis under s. 12 of the Charter, I cannot conclude that sentencing an offender to imprisonment for six months or one year for communicating with a minor for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a sexual offence or other specified offence against the minor is one of the instances in which the demanding and rarely attained standard of gross disproportionality is met.\nConsequently, unlike my colleague, I am of the view that the mandatory minimum sentences provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) Cr. C. are not contrary to s. 12 of the Charter. I agree with my colleagues disposition with regard to the sentence to be imposed on Mr. Bertrand Marchand. However, I would set aside the four-month sentence given to H.V. and impose the mandatory minimum sentence of six months imprisonment. Since the Crown conceded in oral argument that reincarceration is not necessary in the circumstances, I would order a permanent stay of execution of the modified sentence.\nAnalysis\nSection 172.1(2) Cr. C. Does Not Violate Section 12 of the Charter\nThe analytical framework that must be applied under s. 12 of the Charter consists of two stages. At the first stage, the court must determine what constitutes a proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code (R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 46). At the second stage, the court must decide whether the mandatory punishment is grossly disproportionate when compared to the fit sentence for either the claimant or for a reasonable hypothetical offender (Boudreault, at para. 46, citing Nur, at paras. 46 and 77). This requires a contextual comparison between the fit sentence and the impugned mandatory minimum to see whether the latter complies with the widely-worded right set out in s. 12 (Hills, at para. 45). To do so, the court must consider (1) the scope and reach of the offence, (2) the effects of the penalty on the offender, and (3) the penalty itself, including the balance struck by its objectives (Hills, at para. 122).\nIn the present appeals, my colleague finds that the imposition of minimum terms of imprisonment on Mr. Bertrand Marchand and H.V. is not cruel and unusual. However, she declares the impugned provisions unconstitutional on the basis of two hypothetical scenarios that she considers reasonably foreseeable. It is therefore appropriate to analyze the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) in light of these two scenarios.\nThe Fit and Appropriate Sentence for the Offender in the First Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical Scenario\nThe first hypothetical scenario identified by my colleague is based on the one proposed in R. v. Hood, 2018 NSCA 18, 45 C.R. (7th) 269. Drawing on the Court of Appeals reasoning in that case, my colleague sets out the following reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenario (para. 116):\nThe representative offender is a first-year high school teacher in her late 20s with no criminal record. The offender has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. One evening, she texts her 15-year-old student to inquire about a school assignment. Feeling manic, she directs the conversation from casual to sexual. The two meet that same evening in a private location where they both participate in sexual touching. The offender does not engage inappropriately with the student on any further occasions. The offender pleads guilty and expresses remorse on sentencing. See Hood, at para. 150.\nIn this regard, my disagreement with my colleague relates mainly to the sentence that she considers fit and appropriate for this offender. With respect, a 30-day term of imprisonment to be served intermittently is far too lenient a sentence having regard to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.\nIn Friesen, this Court called on courts to impose more severe sentences on offenders who have committed sexual offences against children. It also found that the successive increases in maximum sentences indicated Parliaments intention that these offences be treated as more grave and that the sentences imposed for them therefore be higher than they had been in the past (paras. 99-100). The message sent by this Court was unequivocal: Sentences must accurately reflect the wrongfulness of sexual violence against children and the far-reaching and ongoing harm that it causes to children, families, and society at large (para. 5).\nWithout establishing a sentencing range, the Court made some comments concerning the factors that courts must consider in determining a fit and appropriate sentence for offences of this kind: (i) any manner of physical sexual contact between an adult and a child is inherently violent and harmful (para. 82); (ii) in child luring cases where all interactions occur online, the offenders conduct can constitute a form of psychological sexual violence that has the potential to cause serious harm (para. 82); (iii) it is important to give effect to Parliaments clear and repeated signals to increase the sentences imposed for sexual offences against children (para. 100). In this regard, courts should generally impose higher sentences than those imposed in cases that preceded the increases in maximum sentences (para. 100). With respect, although my colleague emphasizes the principles set out in Friesen, the approach she uses to determine the fit and appropriate sentence is inconsistent with that decision.\nIndeed, despite her statement to the contrary, my colleague treats the absence of grooming and premeditation as mitigating. She first points out that the offenders actions were spontaneous and of short duration rather than premeditated and calculated. While she acknowledges that these circumstances are not in themselves mitigating, she nevertheless concludes that they provide insight into the overall gravity of the offence and culpability of the offender (para. 127). She adds, at para. 127, that [i]t is well established that spontaneous or spur of the moment crimes should be punished less severely than planned or premeditated ones (see, e.g., R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 (C.A.), at para. 18; R. v. Murphy, 2014 ABCA 409, 593 A.R. 60, at para. 42; R. v. Vienneau, 2015 ONCA 898, at para. 12 (CanLII)). I agree that, all other things being equal, impulsivity is less blameworthy than planned or repeated conduct (Laberge, at para. 18 (emphasis added)). In Laberge, Fraser C.J. specified, however, that the fact that an act was committed spontaneously does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the accused had no subjective intent to act and that the conduct in question is therefore less blameworthy: [the existence of such an intent] depends on a constellation of factors and not simply on the degree of planning that went into the unlawful act (para. 20). Thus, even in the case of impulsive acts, other factors in the context must be examined to determine whether there really is a low level of culpability (C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at p. 252, citing Laberge).\nHowever, the absence of grooming and premeditation must have a neutral effect on sentencing (R. v. S.R., 2008 QCCA 2359, at para. 18 (CanLII); R. v. Barrett, 2013 QCCA 1351, at paras. 24-25 (CanLII); R. v. D.B., 2013 QCCA 2199, at para. 13 (CanLII); R. v. S.J.B., 2018 MBCA 62, at paras. 19-20 (CanLII); H. Parent and J. Desrosiers, Traite de droit criminel, t. III, La peine (3rd ed. 2020), at p. 98). I find it difficult to understand how a neutral factor can provide insight into the gravity of the crime and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. If this is the case, it must be because the factor is seen, wrongly, as mitigating. Giving a de facto mitigating effect to a neutral factor amounts, in my view, to underestimating the subjective gravity of the offence.\nThe offenders conduct in this hypothetical scenario is highly blameworthy. Teachers are presumed to be in a relationship of trust with their students and in a position of authority toward them (R. v. Audet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 171, at paras. 41-43). It is difficult to imagine a more demanding task than the one resting on them, that is, to ensure the well-being, safety and education of our children (R. v. M. (M.R.), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 393, at para. 1; R. v. Jarvis, 2019 SCC 10, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 488, at para. 84). When parents entrust their children to a school, they delegate part of their parental authority to the teaching staff working there and entrust them with the responsibility of instilling in their children a large part of the store of learning they will acquire during their development (Audet, at para. 41; on the power dependency relationships inherent in a student-teacher relationship, see also P. Coleman, Sex in Power Dependency Relationships: Taking Unfair Advantage of the Fair Sex (1988), 53 Alb. L. Rev. 95, at pp. 120-21, cited in Audet, at para. 40). In discharging this heavy responsibility, teachers may not abuse the authority they exercise over their students to gratify their sexual desires. Such sexual interference involves heightened levels of exploitation (Hajar, at para. 232, per Slatter J.A., dissenting).\nA teacher who disregards this moral and social duty and engages in such conduct is committing a very serious act that has deleterious social effects. Indeed, such behaviour has the potential to undermine and erode public confidence in the school system, because [t]he conduct of a teacher bears directly upon the communitys perception of the ability of the teacher to fulfil such a position of trust and influence, and upon the communitys confidence in the public school system as a whole (Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825, at para. 43).\nMore immediately, the commission of such acts is likely to have devastating consequences for the child victims, consequences that are glossed over in my colleagues analysis. Yet this Court recognized in Friesen that sexual offences against children are inherently wrongful and always put children at risk of serious harm, even as the degree of wrongfulness, the extent to which potential harm materializes, and actual harm vary from case to case (para. 76). In light of this, the Court instructed lower courts to always take into account forms of potential harm that have yet to materialize at the time of sentencing but that are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the offence and may in fact materialize later in childhood or in adulthood (para. 84). During childhood, these forms of harm may include\n\t. . . overly compliant behaviour and an intense need to please; self-destructive behaviour, such as suicide, self-mutilation, chemical abuse, and prostitution; loss of patience and frequent temper tantrums; acting out aggressive behaviour and frustration; sexually aggressive behaviour; an inability to make friends and non-participation in school activities; guilty feelings and shame; a lack of trust, particularly with significant others; low self-esteem; an inability to concentrate in school and a sudden drop in school performance; an extraordinary fear of males; running away from home; sleep disturbances and nightmares; regressive behaviours, such as bedwetting, clinging behaviour, thumb sucking, and baby talk; anxiety and extreme levels of fear; and depression.\n\t(C.-A. Bauman, The Sentencing of Sexual Offences against Children (1998), 17 C.R. (5th) 352, at pp. 354-55, quoted in Friesen, at para. 80.)\nIn the long run, the consequences of sexual violence may impair the ability of child victims to form emotional relationships with another adult. They may make these children, when they reach adulthood, more prone to engage in sexual violence themselves against other children or make them more likely to struggle with substance abuse, mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, self-harming behaviour, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, anger, hostility, and poor self-esteem as adults (Friesen, at para. 81).\nIn the case of the offender in my colleagues first hypothetical scenario, this harm is all the more serious given the fact that the commission of the offence involves abuse of a position of trust and authority (Friesen, at para. 126). This is why an offender who abuses a position of trust to commit a sexual offence against a child should receive a lengthier sentence than an offender who is a stranger to the child (Friesen, at para. 130).\nMy colleague is of the view that rehabilitation must be prioritized for this offender (para. 129), which runs counter to the very wording of s. 718.01 Cr. C., the constitutionality of which is not being challenged here. It is important to remember that this section makes it necessary to prioritize denunciation and deterrence for offences that involve the abuse of children (Friesen, at para. 101; see also R. v. Rayo, 2018 QCCA 824, at para. 103 (CanLII)). Let me be clear: in these circumstances, my colleague cannot prioritize another penological objective, as that is the role of Parliament. Although my colleague makes reference to s. 718.01 Cr. C., there is nothing in her reasons to indicate that [translation] the relative precedence of [the] objectives [set out in s. 718.01 Cr. C.] will be clear in the sentence she would impose on the offender in her hypothetical scenario (Rayo, at para. 112; see also R. v. Bergeron, 2016 QCCA 339, at para. 32 (CanLII)).\nIt is true that courts must not magnify aggravating factors or narrow mitigating ones to reach desired conclusions (Martin J.s reasons, at para. 122). But conversely, mitigating factors cannot be overestimated at the expense of aggravating circumstances in order to achieve a certain outcome. I find that a nine-month term of imprisonment is a fit and appropriate sentence for the offender in the first hypothetical scenario.\nIn Rayo, which was rendered in 2018, the Quebec Court of Appeal noted that the sentencing range for the offence of child luring is between 12 and 24 months when the offence is prosecuted by indictment (paras. 125-26). I note that such a range was proposed in 2006, well before the 2012 and 2015 legislative amendments introducing the minimum sentences challenged in this case (R. v. Jarvis (2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 20 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 31). In Montour v. R., 2020 QCCA 1648, the Court of Appeal indicated that this range could be revised upwards as a result of Friesen (paras. 55-60 (CanLII)). Similarly, in Traite de droit criminel, Parent and Desrosiers state that the general sentencing range is from 6 to 24 months imprisonment. According to them, short prison sentences range from 6 to 12 months (pp. 869-72), intermediate sentences from 9 to 18 months (pp. 872-76), and longer sentences from 18 months to 5 years (pp. 876-77). Generally, offences in the intermediate category involve a mix of aggravating and mitigating circumstances (p. 874). Mitigating circumstances that have been identified include a guilty plea, the expression of remorse and a low risk of reoffending (p. 874). Aggravating factors include the exploitation of a relationship of trust and of the victims vulnerability for the purpose of having sexual relations with the victim (pp. 874-75, citing Rayo, at para. 29). In addition, [translation] where luring gives rise to related offences involving the actual assault of a child, the global sentences are generally more significant (Rayo, at para. 171; see also Hajar, at para. 156).\nA review of the case law also shows that 12-month terms of imprisonment have been imposed for child luring offences committed in a context involving abuse of a position of trust (see, e.g., R. v. Faille, 2021 QCCQ 4945; R. v. Jissink, 2021 ABQB 102, 482 C.R.R. (2d) 167). In Faille, a 12-month term of imprisonment for child luring was imposed on a teacher who had conversations with the victim during which he frequently talked about sex and drug and alcohol use. He then tried to contact the victim by web video, which she refused, and he later sent her a photograph of a sexual nature. The judge found abuse of a position of trust to be an aggravating factor, noting that [translation] it was as a teacher, and thus a known figure, that [the accused] established ties with the two victims (para. 57 (CanLII)), which is also the case in the scenario being considered. A guilty plea and the absence of a criminal record were mitigating factors.\nIn Jissink, a teacher pleaded guilty to one count of child luring for having sent sexually explicit messages to a 16-year-old student. In that case, the Court of Queens Bench imposed a one-year term of imprisonment even though the communications had never led to a meeting for sexual purposes between the offender and the complainant. The aggravating factors considered by the court included the significant age difference between the offender and the victim as well as abuse of a position of trust and authority because of the offenders status as a teacher. In that case, which involved circumstances analogous to the scenario being considered here, the court noted that a sentence of 12 months imprisonment is on par with sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances (para. 77).\nIn the scenario being considered, an offender takes advantage of her status as a teacher to exploit a 15-year-old child for sexual purposes. This is a classic breach of trust situatio[n] that increases the offenders moral blameworthiness (Friesen, at paras. 126 and 129). A nine-month term of imprisonment takes into account the moral blameworthiness inherent in an offence like child luring, the abuse of a position of trust and the commission of an underlying offence. It also takes into account the significant age difference between the offender and the complainant as well as the complainants vulnerability. Nevertheless, I am of the view that such a penalty acknowledges the role that the offenders mental illness played in the events, along with her guilty plea and the remorse she expressed.\nThe Fit and Appropriate Sentence for the Offender in the Second Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical Scenario\nMy colleague proposes a second reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenario to assess the constitutionality of the six-month minimum term of imprisonment provided for in s. 172.1(2)(b) Cr. C. (para. 119):\nThe representative offender is an 18-year-old who is in a romantic and sexual relationship with a 17-year-old. In one text, the offender asks her to send him an explicit photo. She does, and he then forwards that photo to his friend without his girlfriends knowledge. This friend, who is also 18, does not transmit this photo to anyone, but retains it on his mobile phone. See [R. v.] John, [2018 ONCA 702, 142 O.R. (3d) 670,] at para. 29.\nThis hypothetical scenario is based on a scenario considered by the Ontario Court of Appeal in John, in which that court declared the minimum sentence provided for in s. 163.1(4)(a) Cr. C. for possession of child pornography unconstitutional.\nIn my colleagues opinion, the fit and appropriate punishment for this offender is a conditional discharge (para. 130). Again, I cannot agree with that position.\nIt is true that, as a general rule, there is no offence for which a discharge is unavailable other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life (s. 730(1) Cr. C.). However, in the case of offences committed against a child or an intimate partner, [translation] it will be more difficult to grant a discharge (Parent and Desrosiers, at p. 305 (footnote omitted); see also Medvedev v. R., 2013 QCCA 540, at para. 4 (CanLII)). The jurisprudence also establishes that a conditional discharge is rarely granted in cases involving domestic violence (Parent and Desrosiers, at pp. 305-8; R. v. Laurendeau, 2007 QCCA 1593, at paras. 18-19 (CanLII)). This is so because the sentence imposed in such cases must align with two imperatives, [translation] [t]hat of denouncing the unacceptable and criminal nature of domestic violence and that of increasing the confidence of victims and the public in the administration of justice (Laurendeau, at para. 19; see also R. v. Davidson, 2021 QCCA 545, at paras. 32 and 34 (CanLII)).\nIn this second hypothetical scenario, the offender was in a romantic relationship with the victim at the time of the offence. However, the conditional discharge proposed by my colleague fails to take into account s. 718.2(a)(ii) Cr. C., which provides that the commission of an offence that involved the abuse of the offenders intimate partner is an aggravating circumstance. In this context, the objectives of denunciation and deterrence must be prioritized in sentencing (R. v. Cunningham, 2023 ONCA 36, 166 O.R. (3d) 147, at paras. 26 and 52; Davidson, at paras. 32 and 34). Not only did the offender engage in conduct that involved the abuse of his intimate partner, but he also committed that offence against a minor, and both of these factors increase the subjective gravity of the offence.\nAdded to this is another aggravating circumstance, namely the fact that the offender abused a position of trust in relation to the complainant (s. 718.2(a)(iii) Cr. C.), who was entitled to expect that her sexually explicit photo would be for the exclusive use of her boyfriend. Trust is an intrinsic part of any romantic relationship (R. v. Stone, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, at para. 240; R. v. Butcher, 2020 NSCA 50, 387 C.C.C. (3d) 417, at para. 140). Taking advantage of the existence of such a relationship of trust to deceive ones girlfriend is likely to increase the harm to the victim and thus the gravity of the offence (Friesen, at para. 126).\nThe hypothetical offenders actions could have many negative consequences for the complainant. These include not only humiliation and shame but also a violation of her sexual integrity and her interests in personal autonomy, dignity and privacy (Friesen, at paras. 51 and 152; J. Bailey and C. Mathen, Technology-Facilitated Violence Against Women & Girls: Assessing the Canadian Criminal Law Response (2019), 97 Can. Bar Rev. 664, at p. 677). Moreover, the fact that the offence was committed through technological means amplifies the potential harm given the ease with which the photo can be redistributed by the same means to a theoretically unlimited audience. Once the photo has been transmitted without the complainants consent, she loses all control over its future dissemination, which exponentially increases her psychological harm and potential emotional suffering (Bailey and Mathen, at pp. 676-77). Finally, the offenders actions involved the abuse of an adolescent girl, and the vulnerability of adolescent girls to sexual violence has been recognized (Friesen, at para. 136).\nI acknowledge that the hypothetical offender is young and has no criminal record. However, I cannot give these factors the weight given to them by my colleague in light of the above-mentioned aggravating factors. Indeed, I cannot subscribe to the view that in all cases involving a youthful first offender, [r]ehabilitation and individual deterrence are primary sentencing objectives (para. 132). First of all, the decisions cited in support of that view are more nuanced. In R. v. Priest (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 538, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the fact that a youthful offender has no criminal record is a mitigating factor and that the sentencing objectives in such a case should normally be individual deterrence and rehabilitation. In the same breath, however, the Court of Appeal stated that rehabilitation is not a paramount factor for serious offences or offences involving violence (pp. 543-45; see also R. v. Tan, 2008 ONCA 574, 268 O.A.C. 385, at para. 32; R. v. T. (K.), 2008 ONCA 91, 89 O.R. (3d) 99, at paras. 41-42, decisions that are also cited by my colleague and are to the same effect). The weight to be given to the offenders age therefore depends on the nature of the offence of which the offender is convicted. The same is true for the weight to be given to the absence of a criminal record (R. v. Ahmed, 2017 ONCA 76, 136 O.R. (3d) 403, at para. 65, citing T. (K.), at paras. 41-42; R. v. Brown, 2015 ONCA 361, 126 O.R. (3d) 797, at para. 5; and R. v. Khalid, 2010 ONCA 861, 103 O.R. (3d) 600, at para. 43).\nAt the risk of repeating myself, in cases involving sexual violence against a minor, rehabilitation simply cannot be prioritized. Rather, Parliaments choice, expressed in s. 718.01 Cr. C., to prioritize denunciation and deterrence must be given full effect. As this Court explained in Friesen, [w]here Parliament has indicated which sentencing objectives are to receive priority in certain cases, the sentencing judges discretion is thereby limited, such that it is no longer open to the judge to elevate other sentencing objectives to an equal or higher priority (para. 104, citing Rayo, at paras. 103 and 107-8; see also Levesque v. R., 2021 QCCA 1072, at paras. 19-20 (CanLII); Davidson, at paras. 32 and 34; Cunningham, at paras. 26 and 52).\nThe offenders conduct in this hypothetical scenario is at the lower end of the scale of gravity for the offence, since it involves an isolated act committed by an 18-year-old with no criminal record (see Parent and Desrosiers, at pp. 869-71). I note once more that short sentences for the offence of child luring ranged from 6 to 12 months (Parent and Desrosiers, at p. 869), and this was so even before the 6-month minimum term of imprisonment in s. 172.1(2)(b) Cr. C. was introduced (R. v. Bergeron, 2013 QCCA 7, at para. 75 (CanLII)). In short, having regard to the circumstances set out above and the general sentencing range, the fit and appropriate punishment is not a conditional discharge but rather a six-month term of imprisonment.\nGiven that, for both reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios, I conclude that the fit and appropriate sentence is equal to or greater than a six-month term of imprisonment, this decides the constitutionality of s. 172.1(2)(b) Cr. C. The following analysis therefore concerns the constitutionality of the one-year minimum term of imprisonment set out in s. 172.1(2)(a).\nThe Difference Between the Fit and Appropriate Sentences for the Offenders in the Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical Scenarios and the Minimum Term of Imprisonment Provided for in Section 172.1(2)(a) Cr. C. Is Not Grossly Disproportionate\nThe Offence of Child Luring Is Broad in Scope but Always Involves Conduct With a High Degree of Moral Blameworthiness as Well as Harm or a Risk of Harm\nIn my colleagues opinion, the mens rea required for the offence of child luring is not narrow but broad, such that s. 172.1(1) Cr. C. captures a wide range of designated illicit purposes with varying degrees of moral culpability (para. 139). It is true that when an offence carrying a mandatory minimum sentence can be committed in a way that involves a low degree of moral blameworthiness and no harm or real risk of harm, this indicates that the minimum sentence may be grossly disproportionate (see, e.g., Nur, at para. 83, cited in Hills, at para. 125). However, this is not the case for the offence of child luring, which involves conduct that is always morally blameworthy and that always involves harm or a risk of harm.\nTo begin with, I agree that s. 172.1(1) applies to a wide range of situations (R. v. Morrison, 2019 SCC 15, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 146-48). In spite of this, I am of the view that the offence of child luring always involves a high degree of moral blameworthiness. As was recognized by Moldaver J., writing for a majority of this Court in Morrison, luring requires a high level of mens rea and involves a high degree of moral blameworthiness (para. 153). This is so because s. 172.1(1) Cr. C. requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused . . . engage[d] in the prohibited communication with the specific intent of facilitating the commission of one of the designated offences with respect to the underage person who was the intended recipient of communication (R. v. Legare, 2009 SCC 56, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 551, at para. 32 (emphasis deleted), quoting R. v. Alicandro, 2009 ONCA 133, 246 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 31). Consequently, requiring proof of such a mens rea helps to ensure that innocent communication will not be unintentionally captured by the Code (para. 35).\nI therefore fail to see the relevance of my colleagues assertion that [b]ecause proof of facilitation does not necessarily include proof of complex planning, the luring offence can capture conduct that is bereft of sophistication or considered intention (para. 145). With respect, this amounts to conflating the existence of aggravating circumstances with the constituent elements of an offence. Sophistication and premeditation are certainly aggravating factors, but they are not essential elements of the offence. For the purposes of the analysis under s. 12 of the Charter, these factors tell us nothing about the scope of an offence.\nThis error illustrates a fundamental conceptual flaw in such reasoning. In the section of her reasons that deals with the scope of the offence, my colleague does not limit herself to an objective analysis that involves consider[ing] whether the offence necessarily involves harm to a person or simply the risk of harm, whether there are ways of committing the offence that pose relatively little danger, and to what degree the offences mens rea requires an elevated degree of culpability of the offender (Hills, at para. 129). Rather, she assesses the scope of the offence in question in light of circumstances relating to the degree of subjective fault of a particular offender, irrespective of the inherent wrongfulness of the offence (Friesen, at para. 76).\nIn addition, one must be careful not to emphasize the fact that it is not necessary for the offender to have committed one of the underlying offences listed in s. 172.1(1) in order to be convicted of child luring (Martin J.s reasons, at para. 143). I would also note that the underlying offences are serious offences that criminalize the sexual abuse, trafficking or abduction of children. If s. 172.1(1) casts a wide net, it is because Parliaments objective was to close the cyberspace door before the predator gets in to prey (Legare, at para. 25). In keeping with this objective, s. 172.1(1) criminalizes conduct that precedes the commission of the sexual offences to which it refers, and even an attempt to commit them (Legare, at para. 25 (emphasis deleted)).\nIn the same vein, in analyzing the constitutionality of s. 172.1(2) Cr. C., I cannot assign the weight my colleague does to the fact that the offence of child luring may be committed in the context of a police sting operation that does not involve children (para. 142).\nEven when the offence of luring is committed in the context of a police operation, it involves conduct that is undeniably very serious. An offender charged as a result of a police sting cannot rely on the absence of a victim to demonstrate lower moral blameworthiness:\n\tCourts must give effect to the moral culpability of the offender in sentencing even where the facts giving rise to the conviction involve a police sting operation rather than a child victim. Child luring may be committed in two ways: the offender is actually communicating with an underage person, or the offender believes the person he is communicating with is under age even though this is not in fact the case. In particular, the offence of child luring is often prosecuted through sting operations: an undercover officer poses online as a child and waits for an offender to initiate communication with a sexual purpose (see, e.g., R. v. Levigne, 2010 SCC 25, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 7; Morrison, at para. 4). Although the absence of a specific victim is relevant, it should not be overemphasized in arriving at a fit sentence. The accused can take no credit for this factor. As such, it does not detract from the degree of responsibility of the offender for that offence. After all, to be convicted of child luring in the context of a police sting operation where the person the offender was communicating with was not in fact under age, the offender both must have intentionally communicated with a person who the offender believed to be under age and must have had the specific intent to facilitate the commission of a sexual or other specified offence against that person (Morrison, at para. 153). [Emphasis added; footnote omitted.]\n\t(Friesen, at para. 93)\nIt must be remembered that even when child luring is committed in the context of a police operation, it must never be seen as a victimless crime (Friesen, at para. 94).\nIt is difficult to claim that the conduct of an offender arrested as a result of a sting operation poses no risk of harm. Parliament designed the offence of child luring precisely to prevent such a risk from materializing, that is, to apprehend offenders before they can successfully target and harm children (Friesen, at para. 94). In this sense, police operations are a key element in the arsenal available to law enforcement agencies to apprehend offenders before it is too late (para. 94).\nIn short, requiring a high level of mens rea ensures that the offence of child luring captures only conduct that involves a high degree of moral blameworthiness as well as serious harm or a risk of such harm (Friesen, at para. 76).\nThe Effects of the Minimum Term of Imprisonment on the Offenders in the Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical Scenarios Are Not Incompatible With Human Dignity\nIn addition to the scope of the offence, the grossly disproportionate nature of a mandatory minimum sentence is assessed in light of the effects that the penalty may have on the reasonably foreseeable offender (Hills, at para. 133). If these effects entail so much pain and suffering that they undermine human dignity, the impugned provision cannot survive constitutional scrutiny (para. 133). That is not the case here.\nFor both of the hypothetical offenders, the effects identified by my colleague relate to the treatment they might receive in prison. It seems that imprisonment itself  and not its length  is what plays a major role in her analysis. Although my colleague refrains from concluding that the effects in question, which, I might add, are inherent to incarceration, are such as to undermine human dignity, she nevertheless finds that the first offenders individual circumstances would likely make her experience of incarceration perilously grave (para. 151) and that, for the second offender, [t]he six-month mandatory minimum in this case is a far cry from the shortest possible rehabilitative sentence (para. 152). Such reasoning has major implications; its logical consequence is that any minimum term of imprisonment that may be imposed on an offender who has just reached adulthood or on a person with a mental illness will be grossly disproportionate, regardless of the gravity of the offence or the circumstances surrounding its commission. Such an outcome seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the deference owed to Parliament. Indeed, if few mandatory minimums can survive the scrutiny exemplified in [my colleagues] reasons on s. 12, then one must question what role is left for Parliaments legitimate policy choices in setting punishment (Lloyd, at para. 107, per Wagner J. (as he then was), Gascon and Brown JJ., dissenting).\nIn any event, as explained above, I conclude that a nine-month term of imprisonment would be fit and appropriate for the offender in the first hypothetical scenario and that a six-month term of imprisonment is a fit and appropriate punishment in the second hypothetical scenario. In the first case, the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) results in an additional period of imprisonment of three months. In the second case, the application of s. 172.1(2) Cr. C. would therefore result in an additional six months imprisonment if the offence were prosecuted by indictment.\nI cannot bring myself to conclude that any additional period of imprisonment has effects that are incompatible with human dignity, because this would amount to indirectly introducing a standard of proportionality. I wish to make one important clarification. My remarks should not be taken to mean that, once incarceration is found to be the fit and appropriate punishment, any additional period of imprisonment is immune from constitutional scrutiny because the offender in question already has to deal with the negative effects associated with imprisonment. In this case, however, there is nothing in the record that allows me to identify the precise harm associated with this additional period of imprisonment (Hills, at para. 133). Nevertheless, since the period is relatively short, I am of the view that its effects are not incompatible with human dignity.\nThe Minimum Term of Imprisonment Is Not Grossly Disproportionate to What Is Necessary To Achieve Parliaments Objectives\nThe final stage of the analysis is meant to determine whether the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliaments sentencing objectives relevant to the offence (Hills, at para. 138). In this inquiry, courts must consider the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives (Hills, at para. 138, quoting R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at pp. 1099-1100). However, it is essential to bear in mind at this stage that gross disproportionality is the constitutional standard that applies in the analysis under s. 12 of the Charter. I reiterate this because, in my opinion, my colleagues reasoning transforms the standard of gross disproportionality into one of proportionality.\nThis shift in her analysis can first be seen at para. 158, where she argues that, for offenders whose mental illness contributed to the commission of an offence, specific deterrence, general deterrence and denunciation are of little use. With respect, this argument misses the mark.\nIt is not for this Court to question the appropriateness or usefulness of the penological objectives set by Parliament. The Courts role at this stage of the analysis  and indeed the role of any court tasked with assessing the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence  is to determine whether the punishment goes so far beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliaments sentencing objectives relevant to the offence (Hills, at para. 138 (emphasis added)) that it is grossly disproportionate. The distinction is a subtle but very important one. Otherwise, courts are stepping into a role that is  and must remain  exclusive to Parliament, namely that of assessing the utility of means of responding to social problems (Malmo-Levine, at para. 177; Lloyd, at para. 45). I note that the question is not whether Parliament chose the least restrictive means to achieve its objectives, an inquiry more akin to the one made in the context of applying s. 1 of the Charter than to the scrutiny required under s. 12.\nWith respect, I am of the view that the shift continues in the following paragraph of my colleagues reasons, where she writes that the imposition of a minimum term of imprisonment of 6 or 12 months undermines the principle of proportionality and indicates that Parliament has prioritized denunciation and deterrence to the near complete exclusion of rehabilitation (para. 159 (emphasis added)). But Parliament is perfectly at liberty to do so, provided that it leaves a door open for rehabilitation even in cases where this objective is of minimal importance (Hills, at paras. 141-42, quoting Bissonnette, at para. 85). It has not been shown here how, by creating minimum terms of imprisonment of six months and one year in s. 172.1(2) Cr. C., Parliament has completely excluded this objective.\nThere is a difference of three months (for the offender in the first hypothetical scenario) or six months (for the offender in the second hypothetical scenario) between the fit and appropriate sentence and the sentence provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) Cr. C. In my opinion, this difference is not so great as to show that the punishment chosen by Parliament grossly exceeds what is necessary to achieve its objectives of deterrence and denunciation of sexual violence against children. Perhaps there is some disproportion the application of which leads to a demonstrably unfit punishment, but this is not sufficient to declare s. 172.1(2)(a) and (b) Cr. C. unconstitutional.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios discussed by my colleague do not persuade me that the minimum sentences provided for in s. 172.1(2) Cr. C. are grossly disproportionate. In view of the gravity of this offence, the fact that its scope is clearly circumscribed by the high level of mens rea required, the morally blameworthy and extremely harmful conduct targeted by the offence of child luring, and the deference owed to Parliaments public policy decisions with regard to sentencing, I am of the view that the impugned mandatory minimum sentences are not contrary to s. 12 of the Charter.\nAccordingly, I would allow the appeal of the Attorney General of Quebec and the Crown in Mr. Bertrand Marchands case. I would set aside the Quebec Court of Appeals declaration that s. 172.1(2)(a) Cr. C. is of no force or effect, and I would declare that the one-year minimum term of imprisonment provided for in that section is constitutional. For the reasons given by my colleague, I would set aside the sentence of five months imprisonment imposed on March 11, 2020, on the count of child luring, and I would impose on Mr. Bertrand Marchand a one-year term of imprisonment on that count, to be served consecutively to his term of imprisonment for sexual interference. I would order a permanent stay of execution of the modified sentence. I would also allow the appeal of the Attorney General of Quebec and the Crown in H.V.s case. I would set aside the Quebec Superior Courts declaration that s. 172.1(2)(b) Cr. C. is invalid and of no force or effect, and I would declare that the six-month minimum term of imprisonment provided for in that section is constitutional.

Bertrand Marchand and R. v. H.V. involve two separate incidents of child luring, where the accused used telecommunications to facilitate the commission of a sexual offence against a minor. In R. v. Bertrand Marchand, the accused, Maxime Bertrand Marchand, a 22-year-old man, was charged with child luring and sexual interference for having illegal sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl. In R. v. H.V., the accused, H.V., a 52-year-old man, was charged with child luring for sending sexual text messages to his 16-year-old niece and godchild and touching her breasts. The respondents in both cases challenged the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences for child luring, arguing that they are grossly disproportionate and violate section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process involved two cases, R. v. Bertrand Marchand and R. v. H.V., which were heard together as companion appeals. The trial judges in both cases found the mandatory minimum sentences to be unconstitutional and grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for the respondents. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the trial judges' decisions, and the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part and dismissed it in part, finding that the mandatory minimum sentences for luring a child were unconstitutional and grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for the respondents.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA mandatory minimum sentence is unconstitutional under s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if it is grossly disproportionate to the fit and proportionate sentence for a reasonably foreseeable offender, considering the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty's objectives.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, the court held that the mandatory minimum sentences for child luring in sections 172.1(2)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code are unconstitutional. The court found that these provisions infringe section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects against cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The majority reasoned that the mandatory minimum sentences are grossly disproportionate to the fit sentences for reasonably foreseeable offenders, and that they do not allow for judicial discretion to consider the individual circumstances of each case. The court also noted that the provisions capture a wide range of conduct, including cases where the offender is not morally blameworthy or where the harm caused is minimal. The majority concluded that the mandatory minimum sentences are not saved by section 1 of the Charter and are therefore of no force or effect.", "citation": "2023 SCC 26", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  that mandatory minimum sentences for child luring are unconstitutional. </strong>Section 172.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>sets out the offence of child luring. This offence is  committed when an adult uses telecommunication to target a child, or a person  believed to be a child, for the purposes of committing another offence against  that child, such as sexual exploitation, sexual assault, incest and child  pornography. It is a hybrid offence, which means the Crown prosecutor can  choose to proceed by indictment (a more serious offence) or by summary  conviction (a less serious offence). The mandatory minimum sentence for child  luring is one year\u2019s imprisonment if the offender is guilty on indictment and  six months\u2019 imprisonment if the offender is guilty on summary conviction. In the first case, Maxime Bertrand Marchand pleaded  guilty to one count of sexual interference and one count of child luring. He  met the victim in person in 2013 when he was 22 and she was 13 years old. For  the following two years, they were in contact on social media, met in person  and had illegal sexual intercourse four separate times. At the sentencing stage  of the proceedings, Mr. Bertrand Marchand challenged the one-year mandatory  minimum period of incarceration for persons found guilty of the indictable  offence of child luring, claiming it was inconsistent with section 12 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,  which protects against cruel and unusual punishment. The judge agreed with him,  finding that a one-year mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly  disproportionate to the sentence of five months\u2019 incarceration she imposed for  luring to be served at the same time as his sentence for sexual interference. The  majority of the Court of Appeal upheld both the sentence and the conclusion  that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutional. On appeal before the  Supreme Court of Canada, the Crown asked the Court to substitute Mr. Bertrand  Marchand\u2019s five-month sentence with a sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. It  also asked the Court to find the one-year mandatory minimum sentence  constitutional. \u00a0In an unrelated case, H.V., whose name cannot be  disclosed due to a publication ban protecting the victim, pleaded guilty to one  count of child luring after sending sexual text messages to the victim over a  period of 10 days in 2017. He challenged the six-month mandatory minimum  sentence of incarceration for child luring punishable on summary conviction on  the basis that it violated section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec judge agreed with him, and instead,  imposed a sentence of two years\u2019 probation and 150 hours of community service.  On appeal, the Superior Court varied the sentence to four months\u2019 imprisonment  and agreed that while the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly  disproportionate to H.V.\u2019s sentence, it would be when applied to other  reasonably foreseeable scenarios. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision. On  appeal to this Court, the Crown did not challenge H.V.\u2019s sentence, but it asked  the Court to find the six-month mandatory minimum sentence is constitutional.The Supreme Court has allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal in  part in Mr. Bertrand Marchand\u2019s case and dismissed its appeal in the case of  H.V. <strong>The mandatory  minimum sentences are grossly disproportionate in a range of foreseeable  scenarios.\u00a0 \u00a0</strong>Writing for the  majority, Justice Martin agreed with the courts below in both cases that the  mandatory minimum sentences for luring a child set out in section 172.1(2)(a)  and (b) of the <em>Code </em>are inconsistent  with section 12 of the <em>Charter.</em> As  she explained, invalidating the mandatory minimums did not mean that child  luring was a less serious offence. In some cases, the appropriate penalty for  child luring will be imprisonment for a period equal to or longer than that  contained in the unconstitutional mandatory minimum sentences. That said,  Justice Martin emphasized \u201cthe mandatory periods of incarceration apply to such  an exceptionally wide scope of conduct that the result is grossly  disproportionate punishments in reasonably foreseeable scenarios\u201d.  She dismissed both  appeals on this issue.\u00a0 \u00a0However, Justice Martin allowed the Crown\u2019s appeal  with respect to the length of Mr. Bertrand Marchand\u2019s sentence. In her view,  the first judge minimized the harm caused to the victim by failing to recognize  the grooming that occurred and underestimated Mr. Bertrand Marchand\u2019s actions,  resulting in minimizing the wrongfulness and distinct harms of the luring  offence. For these reasons, Justice Martin increased the sentence from five  months\u2019 to  one year\u2019s imprisonment and said it should be served after rather than at the  same time as his sentence for sexual interference."}, "9": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nAntoine Ponce and\nDaniel Riopel\tAppellants\nv.\nSociete dinvestissements Rheaume ltee,\nMichel Rheaume investissement ltee,\nAgence Andre Beaulne ltee and\n9098-3289 Quebec inc.\tRespondents\nIndexed as: Ponce v.

Rather than revealing this to the groups majority shareholders, the presidents decided to buy the whole of the shareholders interests themselves in order to resell them to the company for a substantial profit. Before the resale, the presidents and the purchaser company entered into an undertaking of confidentiality, which prevented the company from dealing directly with the groups majority shareholders.\n\tUpon learning of the resale, the shareholders filed a motion to institute proceedings for damages in the Superior Court, claiming approximately $24 million as compensation for the gain they would have made through that transaction of which they were deprived. They alleged that the presidents had breached their contractual and legal obligations and their fiduciary obligations, and in particular their obligations to act in good faith, with loyalty and transparency, by failing to inform them of the interest expressed by the purchaser company in acquiring the group. The shareholders argued that, because of the presidents unlawful actions, they were entitled to claim the equivalent of the excess profits made by the presidents. \n\tThe Superior Court ruled in the shareholders favour and ordered the presidents solidarily to pay them $11,884,743, an amount equal to the profits earned by the presidents on the resale. The court found that, under both the Civil Code of Quebec and the Canada Business Corporations Act, the presidents, in their capacity as directors, owed duties of honesty, loyalty, prudence and diligence to the group. The trial judge found that these same duties could be extended to the shareholders because of an incentive pay agreement entered into by the shareholders and the presidents (Presidents Agreement) that governed the parties relationship and entailed implied obligations for the presidents. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judgment and upheld the remedy awarded by the trial judge. However, it was of the view that the trial judge erred in finding that the duties of honesty and loyalty provided for in the Civil Code of Quebec and the Canada Business Corporations Act could be extended to the shareholders. The court held that the presidents conduct fell within the three criteria set out in Bank of Montreal v. Bail Ltee, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 554, and that the presidents breached the obligation of contractual good faith and the obligation to inform they owed to the shareholders.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tThe presidents failure to inform the majority shareholders of the purchaser companys interest in acquiring the group was a breach of the requirements of good faith. They breached the obligation of contractual loyalty linked to good faith, which was an implied obligation under the contract through the combined effect of arts. 1434 and 1375 C.C.Q. The Presidents Agreement involved an implied obligation to inform that required the presidents to provide the shareholders with all information relevant to making an informed decision about the sale of their shares. This implied obligation flowed from the nature of that agreement, which reflected the presumed intention of the parties, in accordance with art. 1434 C.C.Q. The presidents were also required to perform the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of good faith, which was included in the contract through imperative law under art. 1375 C.C.Q. With regard to the remedy, the purpose of damages is to compensate for the gain lost as a result of fault, and the quantum must be assessed so as to place the shareholders in the position they would have been in but for the presidents fault. Disgorgement of profits is not available where there has simply been a breach of the obligation of good faith; in principle, it is available only where a person is charged with exercising powers in the interest of another. However, where a breach of the requirements of good faith prevents the aggrieved party from proving the injury sustained, it should be presumed that the injury is equivalent to the profits made by the party at fault. The presidents have shown no palpable and overriding error in the trial judges conclusion that the shareholders lost gain is equivalent to the profits made by the presidents. There is therefore no reason to interfere with the assessment of the quantum of damages.\n\tWith regard to the possible legal bases for the presidents obligation to inform the shareholders of the interest expressed by the purchaser company in acquiring the group, the obligation of maximalist loyalty arising from the exercise of powers in the interest of another, like the one resting on an administrator of the property of others or a mandatary, is not at issue in this case. The presidents are neither the shareholders mandataries nor administrators of the property of others, which means that they cannot be held to an obligation of loyalty like the one provided for in arts. 1309 para. 2 and 2138 para. 2 C.C.Q. In addition, the extracontractual obligation to inform related to good faith in the formation of contracts is of only theoretical importance in this case given the contractual relationship that the parties chose to establish with one another. The shareholders do not allege that there was a breach of the requirements of good faith at the pre-contractual stage, nor do they ask that the contracts for the sale of their interests in the group to the presidents be annulled. Rather, their focus is on the good faith performance of the Presidents Agreement, which was fully applicable at the relevant time.\n\tThe first legal basis for the duty to inform incumbent on the presidents is therefore the implied contractual obligation to inform the shareholders under the Presidents Agreement. Pursuant to art. 1434 C.C.Q., a contract binds the parties not only as to what they have expressed in it but also as to what is incident to it according to its nature and in conformity with usage, equity or law. In this case, the nature of the Presidents Agreement leads to the conclusion that an implied obligation to inform was incident to it. The Presidents Agreement was the cornerstone of the business relationship between the presidents and the shareholders. The role of each party in this relationship was clear. The Presidents Agreement was a long-term agreement formalizing a mutually beneficial business relationship between the presidents and the shareholders, and it required reciprocal contractual loyalty. It reinforced the high level of trust that the shareholders placed in the presidents, and it expressly set out incentive pay terms and conditions for the presidents benefit without spelling out reciprocal obligations for them. In light of the very nature of the Presidents Agreement, the presidents had an implied obligation to inform the shareholders of any fact that might enable them to assess the companies profits and value and decide whether to sell their shares and, if so, at what price. The non-disclosure of the purchaser companys interest was a direct breach of this implied obligation.\n\tThe second legal basis is the obligation to perform the Presidents Agreement in accordance with the requirements of good faith under art. 1375 C.C.Q. Good faith in Quebec civil law is now an enacted standard of public order. Unlike maximalist loyalty arising from the exercise of legal powers, contractual loyalty is reciprocal because of the mutual nature of good faith. It requires a contracting party to act with loyalty by taking into account, within the limits of reasonable conduct, the interests of the other contracting party. Nevertheless, the obligation of loyalty rooted in contractual good faith in the performance of a contract does not require a contracting party to subordinate their interests to those of the other party. In this case, contractual loyalty tied to good faith did not prevent the presidents from performing the contract to further their self-interest, but it did require them to consider the interests of the other contracting parties. For this reason, it could impose on them a duty to inform. While they did not have to subordinate their interests to those of the shareholders, the presidents could not conceal the purchaser companys interest in the group without incurring contractual liability to the shareholders. By concealing that interest, they breached their obligation of good faith.\n\tThe interest expressed by the purchaser company satisfies, in the context of the Presidents Agreement, each of the three criteria set out in Bail, which serve to determine whether particular information falls within the duty to inform: (1) knowledge of the information, whether actual or presumed, by the party owing the obligation to inform; (2) the fact that the information in question is of decisive importance; (3) the fact that it is impossible for the party to whom the duty to inform is owed to inform itself, or that the creditor is legitimately relying on the debtor of the obligation. With regard to the first criterion, the presidents knew of the purchaser companys interest and were fully aware of the financial value of that information. The second criterion is also satisfied because the purchaser companys interest would have had a major impact on the decision and on the determination of the value of the shareholders shares and the sale price. The last criterion is doubly satisfied given the atmosphere of trust that existed between the parties and the fact that it was impossible for the shareholders to inform themselves of the purchaser companys interest. As a result, the requirements of good faith in the performance of the Presidents Agreement imposed a duty on the presidents to inform the shareholders of the interest expressed by the purchaser company.\n\tDetermining the appropriate remedy in this case helps to clarify the boundary between restitution and compensation in the civil law. Compensation for the injury caused by a breach of contractual loyalty is distinct from disgorgement of profits arising from non-performance of the obligation of maximalist loyalty in the exercise of powers. Disgorgement of profits without regard to injury is not an appropriate remedy in this case, because it is not in keeping with the compensatory function of civil liability. It is available only where a person is charged with exercising powers in the interest of another, and it is meant to ensure compliance with the obligation of maximalist loyalty owed by a person on whom a power is conferred. An award of damages, on the other hand, serves to compensate the victim of a fault for the injury sustained, reflecting a compensatory logic related to contractual loyalty under art. 1375 C.C.Q., and its purpose is to compensate for the gain lost as a result of fault. To justify an award of damages, the party wronged by a breach of contractual loyalty bears the burden of establishing compensable injury, in accordance with the fundamental principle of restitutio in integrum (or full reparation) that is central to the law of civil liability in Quebec.\n\tIn this case, the gain lost by the shareholders is compensable under the rule for assessing damages set out in art. 1611 C.C.Q. Although the law of civil liability does not, as a general rule, excuse a plaintiff from proving the injury sustained, it is the presidents disloyal conduct that prevents the shareholders from making such proof. The presidents non-disclosure of information to the shareholders was accompanied by efforts to conceal the purchaser companys interest in the group. The presidents cannot be allowed to profit from their breach of the requirements of good faith by arguing that the shareholders failed to prove their injury. In accordance with Biotech Electronics Ltd. v. Baxter, [1998] R.J.Q. 430 (C.A.), the presidents wrongdoing gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the shareholders lost advantage is equivalent to the profits unjustly realized by the presidents. The presumption established in Baxter serves as the basis for a method of calculating damages to compensate the aggrieved party for the injury sustained. It is based on a compensatory objective that is distinct from disgorgement of profits where disgorgement is awarded for a restitutionary purpose in the absence of any injury. The presidents have not rebutted this presumption, and the damages owed to the shareholders are equivalent to the difference between the sale price received by the presidents on their resale of the shares to the company and the price received by the shareholders on the initial sale of the shares to the presidents.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Biotech Electronics Ltd. v.

Appeal dismissed.\n\tAudrey Boctor, Etienne Morin-Levesque and Laurence Boudreau, for the appellants.\n\tJean-Remi Thibault, Louis P. Belanger and Samuel Nadeau, for the respondents.\nEnglish version of the judgment of the Court delivered by\n\n\tKasirer J.  \nOverview\nAntoine Ponce and Daniel Riopel, presidents of a group of three thriving companies in the insurance industry, learned that a major company was interested in acquiring the group of companies that they ran. Rather than revealing this to the groups majority shareholders, Michel Rheaume and Andre Beaulne and their investment companies (the shareholders), the two presidents decided to buy the companies themselves and then resell them at a substantial profit. The shareholders felt betrayed; not only had they trusted the presidents, but they had entered into an incentive pay agreement that gave the presidents significant benefits, including a right of first refusal in the event that the shareholders decided to divest themselves of their interests in the group.\nConsidering this conduct to be disloyal, the majority shareholders blamed the presidents for not disclosing to them the interest expressed by a prospective purchaser in acquiring the companies, arguing that this was a breach of the presidents duty to inform that justified disgorgement of the profits they had made by unlawfully appropriating that business opportunity. The presidents answered that, during the negotiations leading to their purchase of the companies, they had been under no legal obligation to subordinate their interests to those of the shareholders in such a manner.\nThe Superior Court ruled in the shareholders favour and ordered the presidents solidarily to pay them an amount equal to the profits earned on the resale of the shares. The Court of Appeal confirmed the trial judges conclusions, while specifying the nature of the obligations breached by the presidents in relation to the shareholders, and upheld the remedy awarded at trial.\nThis appeal requires the Court to consider the basis for and parameters of the obligation of loyalty in order to determine whether a duty to inform was incumbent on the presidents. The Court must also clarify the conditions under which a court may award disgorgement of profits as a remedy, in particular for a contracting partys disloyal conduct. Specifically, it must trace the boundaries of the moral precept that no one should profit from their own wrongdoing, on which the shareholders rely, as a justification for the remedy of disgorgement of profits made in bad faith.\nA first observation flows from the debate between the parties: the obligation of loyalty arising from the exercise of powers in the interest of another  like the one resting on an administrator of the property of others or a mandatary  is not at issue here. An obligation of that kind would have required the presidents to subordinate their interests to those of the shareholders by requiring them to disclose the prospective purchasers interest in acquiring the group. But as Professor Madeleine Cantin Cumyn has written, the [translation] basis for this loyalty . . . differs substantially from the one dictating contractual loyalty, which applies to a person who performs a prestation or exercises a right under a contract and who is bound to act in good faith (Lobligation de loyaute dans les services de placement (2012), 3:1 B.D.E. 19, at p. 21). Unlike loyalty tied to legal powers that must be exercised in the interest of another or to achieve a particular purpose, the obligation of contractual loyalty rooted in good faith in the performance of a contract under art. 1375 of the Civil Code of Quebec (C.C.Q.) does not require a contracting party to subordinate their interests to those of the other party. In this case, the presidents are neither the shareholders mandataries nor administrators of the property of others, which means that they cannot be held to an obligation of loyalty like the one provided for in arts. 1309 para. 2 and 2138 para. 2 C.C.Q.\nA second observation is in order: despite the absence of an obligation of loyalty arising from the exercise of powers in the interest of another, the presidents conduct is nonetheless wrongful. Although contractual loyalty tied to good faith did not prevent the presidents from performing the contract to further their self-interest, it did require them to consider the interests of the other contracting parties and, for this reason, it could impose on them a duty to inform. Accordingly, while the presidents did not have to subordinate their interests to those of the shareholders, the fact remains that, in pursuing their own interests, they could not conceal the prospective purchasers interest in the companies without incurring contractual liability to the shareholders. By doing so, they breached contractual loyalty linked to good faith, which was an implied obligation under the contract through the combined effect of arts. 1434 and 1375 C.C.Q. Moreover, the trial judge was correct to conclude that the incentive pay agreement involved an implied obligation to inform that required the presidents to provide the shareholders with all information relevant to making an informed decision about the sale of their shares. This implied obligation flowed from the nature of the contract, reflecting the presumed intention of the parties, in accordance with art. 1434 C.C.Q.\nThe wrongful nature of the presidents conduct raises a second issue: Could the non-disclosure of the prospective purchasers interest justify, as a remedy, disgorgement of profits to the shareholders, who lost a business opportunity as a result of that wrongful conduct? An obligation of loyalty like the one resting on an administrator of the property of others or a mandatary in the exercise of their powers may justify disgorgement of profits for a restitutionary purpose, but generally not for a compensatory one. However, the presidents are correct to say that they had no such obligation of loyalty.\nDetermining the appropriate remedy in this case therefore presents an opportunity for the Court to clarify what Professor Pascal Frechette calls [translation] the boundary between restitution and compensation in the civil law (La restitution des prestations (2018), at p. 9). Compensation for the injury caused by a breach of contractual loyalty is distinct from disgorgement of profits arising from non-performance of the obligation of loyalty in the exercise of powers. To justify an award of damages, the party wronged by a breach of contractual loyalty bears the burden of establishing compensable injury, in accordance with the fundamental principle of restitutio in integrum (or full reparation) that is central to the law of civil liability.\nRelying on decisions of this Court in which good faith was in issue, particularly Bank of Montreal v. Kuet Leong Ng, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 429, the shareholders seek disgorgement of profits as a remedy for the presidents breach of the requirements of good faith. In my respectful view, the shareholders are misreading Kuet, which relates to the exercise of a power similar to that of a mandatary. Absent proof of injury, Kuet cannot justify disgorgement of profits based solely on the breach of the presidents obligation of contractual loyalty. That said, this misreading of Kuet does not preclude an award of damages to the shareholders for an amount equivalent to what would have been disgorged to them to compensate for the advantage they lost due to the presidents fault.\nIn this case, the harm resulting from the presidents contractual fault must therefore be proved in accordance with the typical rules of civil liability. The shareholders seek compensation for lost profits under the rule for assessing damages set out in art. 1611 C.C.Q. Although the law of civil liability does not, as a general rule, excuse a plaintiff from proving the injury sustained, it is the defendants disloyal conduct that prevents the plaintiff from making such proof here. This is because, in this case, the presidents non-disclosure of information to the shareholders was accompanied by efforts to conceal the prospective purchasers interest in the companies and, according to a determination that is ultimately left to the trier of fact, by lies told to the shareholders to shut them out of the proposed deal.\nThe presidents cannot be allowed to profit from their breach of the requirements of good faith by arguing that the shareholders failed to prove their injury. In a case such as this one, the presidents wrongdoing gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the shareholders lost advantage is equivalent to the profits unjustly realized by the presidents (see Biotech Electronics Ltd. v. Baxter, [1998] R.J.Q. 430 (C.A.)). The presidents could rebut this presumption by establishing the actual quantum of the lost gain on a balance of probabilities. They did not do so. Since the presidents have shown no palpable and overriding error in the trial judges conclusion that the shareholders lost gain is equivalent to the profits made by the presidents, I am of the view that there is no reason to interfere with the assessment of the quantum of damages.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBackground\nGroupe Excellence was comprised of three companies operating in the insurance industry: two brokerage firms, Michel Rheaume & Associes inc. and Beaulne & Rheaume Assurance ltee, as well as The Excellence Life Insurance Company. At the time of the events in dispute, Michel Rheaume and Andre Beaulne, through the respondent investment companies, owned all the shares of the two brokerage firms and 93.1 percent of the shares of The Excellence. Mr. Rheaume and Mr. Beaulne, who were in their late sixties at the relevant time, describe themselves as having little formal education. However, they were very successful in the insurance field over the years, having founded the companies making up Groupe Excellence in the late 1970s.\nIn February 2002, the appellants, Antoine Ponce and Daniel Riopel, were appointed presidents of the Groupe Excellence companies. An actuary since 1978, Mr. Ponce became the president of The Excellence Life Insurance Company, a position that Mr. Rheaume had offered him several times before. Mr. Riopel, who became a lawyer in 1986, is Mr. Beaulnes nephew. He worked with both of the brokerage firms for more than 20 years before becoming their president.\nOn March 15, 2002, Mr. Ponce and Mr. Riopel, designated in their capacity as [translation] presidents of the Groupe Excellence companies, and the investment companies of Mr. Rheaume and Mr. Beaulne, as majority shareholders, entered into a contract described in its preamble as an incentive pay agreement (Presidents Agreement or Agreement) (A.R., vol. X, at p. 3652). The Agreement governed the parties relationship during the entire period relevant to this litigation, including during the negotiations and then the sale by Mr. Rheaumes and Mr. Beaulnes investment companies of their shares in Groupe Excellence to Mr. Ponce and Mr. Riopel. The Agreement, which had an initial term of five years, was to be renewed automatically for additional two-year periods unless written notice to the contrary was given.\nThe Presidents Agreement formalized a business relationship between the parties that was based on their commitment to work toward the common goal of ensuring the success of Groupe Excellence as an ongoing business, even with a view to a potential sale. To this end, the Agreement provided for various forms of incentive pay for the presidents in addition to what they received as directors of the companies. The Agreement had only eight clauses and, aside from requiring the subsequent negotiation of a non-competition clause in favour of the shareholders, imposed no express obligation on the presidents.\nIt was in this context, and while the Agreement was still applicable, that the actions alleged took place.\nIn April 2005, Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc. (IA) informed the presidents, Mr. Ponce and Mr. Riopel, of its interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence. A series of discussions and exchanges of documents between the presidents and IA took place over several months. In July 2005, during that process, the presidents and IA entered into an [translation] Undertaking of Confidentiality concerning a potential partnership agreement and/or any other form of transaction that may be entered into by the [p]arties (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 1110, cl. 2). In the Undertaking, the presidents and IA agreed to the mutual disclosure of confidential information relative to their circumstances. At the presidents request, an exclusivity clause in their favour was also included with respect to any transaction involving IA and Groupe Excellence. The purpose of that clause  according to the presidents themselves  was to prevent IA from dealing directly with Mr. Rheaume and Mr. Beaulne as well as with their holding companies.\nThe presidents never informed the shareholders of these exchanges with IA or of IAs interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence, nor were the shareholders told of the existence of the Undertaking of Confidentiality.\nIn 2006, when the shareholders had been contemplating the possibility of selling their interests in Groupe Excellence for some time, Mr. Beaulne asked Mr. Ponce whether IA would be interested in buying the shares. Despite the prior exchanges between IA and the presidents, Mr. Ponce answered that he had already checked and that IA was not interested. The parties disagree as to the exact date of that interaction. The appellants say that the conversation took place before IAs interest led to a preliminary valuation in May 2006 and an acquisition proposal in August 2006. The respondents say instead that the conversation took place following these events. Thus, according to the respondents, Mr. Ponce deliberately lied to Mr. Beaulne.\nIn any event, the respondents did not know about the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence at the time they agreed to sell the whole of their interests to the presidents. Mr. Rheaume did so in the fall of 2006, and Mr. Beaulne followed suit in the spring of 2007. As consideration for that sale, Mr. Rheaume received approximately $23,500,000 together with a full release for his debts under the Agreement. Mr. Beaulne received $10,371,210 together with a release similar to Mr. Rheaumes. In the months following those transactions, the presidents in turn resold to IA, for a total of $74,280,000, the interests they had acquired from the shareholders.\nIn December 2007, IA issued a press release announcing its acquisition of Groupe Excellence from the presidents. The respondents learned of the sale at that time. In response, they filed a motion to institute proceedings for damages in the Superior Court, claiming approximately $24 million as compensation for the gain they would have made through that transaction of which they were deprived.\nIn their motion, the respondents alleged that the presidents failure to inform them of IAs interest had caused them a [translation] serious loss (motion to institute proceedings, at para. 57, reproduced in A.R., vol. II, at p. 674). They stated that they had been deprived of the difference between the price they received when they sold their shares to the presidents and the higher price the presidents obtained on the resale to IA. They alleged that the presidents had breached [translation] their contractual and legal obligations, their fiduciary obligations and their obligations to act in good faith, with loyalty and transparency by intentionally failing to inform the shareholders of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence (para. 41). The respondents stated that, because of the [translation] unlawful actions of Mr. Ponce and Mr. Riopel, they were entitled to claim the equivalent of the excess profits made by them (paras. 57-57.1).\nIn defence, the appellants argued that the respondents were conflating the obligations the appellants owed to the companies and the obligations they owed to the shareholders. Here, they said, the appellants [translation] are under no obligation whatsoever to the former shareholders, Beaulne and Rheaume (A.R., vol. II, at p. 689, para. 93). The appellants also argued that they had complied with their obligations under the Presidents Agreement and, more broadly, that they had committed [translation] no fault against the respondents (para. 240). In addition, according to the appellants, Mr. Rheaume and Mr. Beaulne had been aware of the prospective purchasers interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence, so the appellants could not be accused of hiding or concealing relevant information about the transactions that led to the resale of the shares to IA. Finally, the appellants disputed the calculation of the damages arising from the harm allegedly suffered by the respondents, saying that they were in no way [translation] indebted to the respondents (para. 241).\nJudicial History\nQuebec Superior Court, 2018 QCCS 3538 (Deziel J.)\nThe trial judge granted the respondents motion in part. He stated that, under both the Civil Code of Quebec and the Canada Business Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44, the appellants, in their capacity as directors, owed duties of honesty, loyalty, prudence and diligence to Groupe Excellence. The trial judge found that these same duties can be extended to shareholders [translation] where there is an independent relationship between the directors . . . and the shareholders (para. 427 (CanLII)). In his view, this kind of independent relationship existed here, particularly because of the Presidents Agreement, which [translation] is key in illustrating the obligations assumed by the [appellants] (para. 430).\nIn the trial judges opinion, the Agreement entailed three implied obligations for the appellants: (1) to maximize, in the performance of their mandate and for the shareholders benefit, the profits and value of Groupe Excellence; (2) to report to the shareholders, in a full and transparent manner, all information that might enable them to assess the value of Groupe Excellence or make a decision to sell their shares and, in such a case, to determine a sale price; and (3) not to use information for their personal benefit without obtaining the shareholders consent.\nThe judge then found that the appellants had secretly negotiated the resale of Groupe Excellence with IA. He noted that the appellants had signed an Undertaking of Confidentiality with IA to ensure that IA did not deal directly with the shareholders. By doing so, the appellants had intentionally concealed from the shareholders the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence, knowing that if the shareholders had been told of it, they [translation] would have sought to maximize the sale price for their shares and it would then have been more costly for the [appellants] to exercise their right of first refusal under the Presidents Agreement (para. 487; see also paras. 436-37, 445-46 and 486). Considering the appellants conduct in light of the obligational content of the Agreement, the trial judge held that they had breached their duties of good faith and loyalty as well as their duty to inform owed to shareholders Rheaume and Beaulne.\nThe trial judge then assessed the injury resulting from the appellants fault, applying the principle of full reparation (restitutio in integrum). For that purpose, he essentially used the method of assessing injury proposed by the respondents expert, which was based on the following key assumption: [translation] . . . had it not been for the acts alleged against the [appellants], the [respondents] would have received consideration equivalent to what IA paid to acquire the [appellants] interests in Groupe Excellence rather than the amount they obtained from the [appellants] . . . (A.R., vol. VII, at p. 2295, quoted with approval by the trial judge at para. 598; see also paras. 615 and 638-39).\nAccepting the hypothesis put forward by the respondents expert, the trial judge held that the injury corresponded to the gains lost on the business opportunity unlawfully appropriated by the appellants. The gains lost were therefore equivalent to the profits made by the appellants when they resold the shares to IA, which the judge assessed at $11,884,743. He ordered the appellants solidarily to pay that amount and, taking note of the agreement reached by Mr. Rheaume and Mr. Beaulne concerning the distribution of their respective interests in Groupe Excellence, he allocated $7,368,540.60 to Mr. Rheaumes investment companies and $4,516,202.40 to Mr. Beaulnes investment companies.\nQuebec Court of Appeal, 2021 QCCA 1363 (Rancourt J.A., Mainville and Fournier JJ.A. concurring)\nThe Court of Appeal, per Rancourt J.A., unanimously dismissed the appeal and affirmed the trial judgment. However, the court noted that the trial judge erred in finding that the duties of honesty and loyalty provided for in art. 322 C.C.Q. and s. 122(1)(a) of the Canada Business Corporations Act, which the appellants had owed to Groupe Excellence in their capacity as directors, could be extended to the shareholders. But the court found that this error was not an overriding one given the other bases for the appellants liability, which were correctly identified by the trial judge. His analysis of the obligational content of the Presidents Agreement supported his conclusions regarding the appellants fault, namely that they had breached their contractual obligation of good faith and duty to inform (see paras. 84, 94 and 110-11 (CanLII)).\nDiscussing the duty to inform in greater detail, the Court of Appeal held that the appellants conduct fell within the three criteria set out in Bank of Montreal v. Bail Ltee, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 554. The Court of Appeal focused specifically on the fact that it had been impossible for the shareholders to inform themselves of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence as well as on the atmosphere of trust that had existed between the appellants and the shareholders (see paras. 90-91). The court therefore concluded that the appellants breached the obligation of contractual good faith and the obligation to inform they owed to the shareholders, including by keeping them out of the negotiations with IA and secretly signing the Undertaking of Confidentiality with IA (see paras. 93-94; see also paras. 110-11).\nWith respect to the remedy, the Court of Appeal noted that it was not the role of an appellate court to substitute itself for the trial judge in assessing contradictory expert evidence or in fixing the quantum of damages (para. 119). The total award of $11,884,743 in damages was upheld.\nParties Arguments and Issues\nBroadly speaking, two lines of argument are made by the parties before this Court. First, the debate turns on whether the appellants failure to inform the shareholders of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence was a breach of an obligation, be it contractual or legal. In this regard, the appellants argue that their failure cannot constitute a civil fault because there was no legal basis requiring them to share that information in this case. As for the respondents, they take the view that the appellants are minimizing the scope and impact of the Presidents Agreement, which was applicable during the entire period in issue. In their opinion, the requirements of good faith in the performance of that agreement made it obligatory for the appellants to disclose to the respondents the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence.\nSecond, the parties disagree as to the appropriate remedy in the event that fault is established. The appellants submit that there were no grounds upon which the trial judge could award disgorgement of profits or even compensatory damages to the respondents by way of remedy. There are two possibilities: either the trial judge ordered disgorgement of profits without having any legal basis for doing so, or he awarded damages without having sufficient evidence of harm (A.F., at para. 92). Noting that the profits flowed from the appellants wrongdoing, the respondents counter that the appellants must hand over to them the profits made on the resale of Groupe Excellence to IA, in accordance with the general principle of full compensation that is at the heart of the law of civil liability.\nIn light of the parties arguments, two main questions shape the debate before this Court:\nDid the appellants non-disclosure of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence constitute a breach of a contractual or legal obligation to inform owed to the respondents and therefore a civil fault?\nIf this fault is established, did the courts below err in awarding the respondents a sum representing the profits made by the appellants, either through the disgorgement of profits mechanism or as damages to compensate for the gain of which the respondents were deprived?\nThese questions will be analyzed in turn.\nAnalysis\nDid the Appellants Non-Disclosure of the Interest Expressed by IA Constitute a Civil Fault?\nThe trial judge found that the appellants had failed to disclose to the respondents the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence (paras. 485-90). He also found that, in 2005, the appellants had entered into an Undertaking of Confidentiality with IA that was intended to prevent IA from dealing directly with the shareholders (para. 441). These events occurred while the appellants were the presidents of the Groupe Excellence companies and while the Presidents Agreement signed in 2002 was fully applicable.\nThe issue in this case is therefore whether the appellants did have a duty to inform the shareholders of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence that was breached. In this Court, the parties discussed four possible legal bases for such an obligation: (1) an obligation of loyalty arising from a legal power conferred on the presidents that they had to exercise in the shareholders interest, like the obligation resting on a mandatary or an administrator of the property of others; (2) an extracontractual obligation to inform related to good faith in the formation of the contracts for the sale of the respondents interests to the appellants in 2006 and 2007; (3) an implied contractual obligation to inform the shareholders under the Presidents Agreement; or (4) an obligation to perform the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of good faith. The appellants take the view that none of these four bases imposed an obligation on them to inform the respondents of IAs interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence. This being the case, I propose to consider each of these four possibilities in order to determine whether the appellants were required to inform the shareholders of the interest expressed by IA.\nFirst Possible Basis: Obligation of Loyalty Arising From the Exercise of Powers in the Interest of Another\nThe appellants correctly argue that their duty to inform cannot be based on a fiduciary-type obligation of loyalty that would be similar to the fiduciary duties of the common law . . . requir[ing] the debtor to put the interests of the beneficiary first (A.F., at para. 53). In this regard, the Court of Appeal properly stated that, as directors of the Groupe Excellence companies, the presidents did not have such an obligation to act with loyalty toward the majority shareholders, although they did owe such an obligation to the legal persons of the group (see, e.g., art. 322 para. 2 C.C.Q.). The appellants had no duty to inform anchored in this type of loyalty, which would have imposed on them a duty to act selflessly (A.F., at para. 54). The respondents themselves recognize that [translation] [t]here was never any question of requiring the [a]ppellants to subordinate their interests to [theirs] (R.F., at para. 76).\nIn my view, the parties are correct on this point: the appellants did not have, as Professor Lionel Smith puts it, an obligation of maximalist loyalty grounded in the loyal use of power by a fiduciary, that is, not just power over another person, but power held for that other person (Loyalty (2020), 66 McGill L.J. 121, at p. 122 (emphasis in original)). In Quebec civil law, the obligation of maximalist loyalty referred to by the appellants exists mainly where a person exercises a [translation] power in the interest of another or for the fulfilment of a purpose (such as where a trustee exercises a prerogative over a patrimony by appropriation in favour of the beneficiary), not where the holder of a legal right exercises it in their own interest (such as a borrowers prerogative under a contract for the simple loan of property) (see M. Cantin Cumyn and M. Cumyn, Ladministration du bien dautrui (2nd ed. 2014), at para. 91). This is because, [translation] [u]nlike the holder of a right, a person on whom powers are conferred is legally bound to act in the interest of another or for the achievement of the purpose for which the powers were granted (M. Cantin Cumyn, Le pouvoir juridique (2007), 52 McGill L.J. 215, at p. 223; see Resolute FP Canada Inc. v. Hydro-Quebec, 2020 SCC 43, at para. 69).\nTwo types of loyalty must be carefully distinguished. On the one hand, contractual loyalty arising from good faith requires a contracting party to [translation] take the other partys interests into account. On the other hand, loyalty in the exercise of a power, because of the purpose of that power, must be exercised [translation] only in the beneficiarys interest or to achieve the goal that led [it] to be conferred (Cantin Cumyn (2012), at p. 22).\nA comparison can be drawn between the obligation of maximalist loyalty in the civil law and the obligation of loyalty in the English legal tradition that is anchored in the exercise of a fiduciary obligation. In both legal traditions, the person subject to an obligation of maximalist loyalty must subordinate their own interests to those of another (see, e.g., Resolute, at para. 63; Wastech Services Ltd. v. Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District, 2021 SCC 7, at para. 110). However, the prerogatives of a trustee in English law are based on the legal title held by the trustee. In contrast, in Quebec law, an administrator of the property of others has no legal right in the property being administered but only powers that must be exercised over a patrimony by appropriation in the interests of another (see Cantin Cumyn and Cumyn, at para. 4; Smith, at p. 122).\nThe obligation of loyalty of an administrator or mandatary in the civil law tradition therefore relates to the exercise of powers defined on the basis of a purpose  the interest of another or the achievement of a goal  rather than on the basis of the exercise of legal title, as in English law. As Professor Michele Graziadei notes, many fiduciary relationships in civilian countries are framed so to leave title to property subject to fiduciary administration in the name of the beneficiary. Hence, if the property produces profits, those profits automatically belong to the owner (Virtue and Utility: Fiduciary Law in Civil Law and Common Law Jurisdictions, in A. S. Gold and P. B. Miller, eds., Philosophical Foundations of Fiduciary Law (2014), 287, at p. 297). Since the mechanics of the civil law differ from those of English law, the expression fiduciary-type loyalty may seem inaccurate in the civil law tradition (see Gravino v. Enerchem Transport inc., 2008 QCCA 1820, [2008] R.J.Q. 2178, at para. 39). Finally, I note that, in both traditions, the duties associated with the general principle of good faith in the performance of contracts ha[ve] strong conceptual differences from the much higher obligations of a fiduciary (Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 494, at para. 65; see also Resolute, at para. 63).\nIn this case, the appellants were not required, by the Presidents Agreement or otherwise, to exercise powers for the benefit of the shareholders. They were therefore not bound, on that basis, by an obligation of maximalist loyalty. In particular, the Presidents Agreement did not impose on the appellants an obligation of loyalty similar to that of a mandatary, with the attendant obligation to inform (arts. 2138 para. 2 and 2139 C.C.Q.), because they did not have the power to represent the respondents in the sale of Groupe Excellences shares to IA. Moreover, given that they were also not administrators of the shareholders property, the appellants are correct to say that they did not have a duty of loyalty under art. 1309 para. 2 C.C.Q. that required them to subordinate their own interests to those of the shareholders or their holding companies (A.F., at para. 53). Accordingly, the duty to inform owed by the appellants to the shareholders could not originate in any obligation of loyalty in the exercise of powers. This means that the non-disclosure of IAs interest did not breach an obligation of maximalist loyalty.\nI note, however, that in Quebec civil law, the concept of loyalty does not refer solely to the maximalist loyalty contemplated by the appellants. The respondents point out that good faith imposes on the parties a duty of loyalty with a nature and basis that are entirely different, both at the stage of formation of the contract and at the stage of its performance and extinction. While contractual loyalty arising from good faith does not require a party to put the interests of another first, it does affect the way in which the holder of a legal right may exercise it (Cantin Cumyn (2012), at p. 21).\nGiven the absence in this case of an obligation of loyalty arising from the exercise of powers in the interest of another, the appellants alleged obligation to inform, if it exists, must have a different legal basis. I turn now to the other three bases raised by the parties, starting with the appellants possible extracontractual liability for breaching the obligation of good faith in the formation of the contracts for the sale of the respondents interests in 2006 and 2007.\nSecond Possible Basis: Extracontractual Obligation to Inform in the Negotiation and Formation of a Contract\nThe appellants ask this Court to examine their conduct from the standpoint of extracontractual liability. They say that the allegations made against them by the respondents relate to the stage of formation of the contracts by which the respondents sold their interests in 2006 and 2007 (A.F., at para. 46). They submit that the Agreement did not apply in this case because it does not govern the buy-out negotiations (outline of argument, at para. 2.5, in condensed book, at p. 2). As a result, they say, any fault alleged at the stage of the negotiations that led to the making of those contracts of sale can only be extracontractual.\nThe appellants acknowledge that, at the stage of contract formation, the requirements of good faith give rise to a duty to inform (A.F., at para. 48). That said, they submit that the scope of this duty did not extend so far as to require them to disclose IAs interest to the respondents. At the pre-contractual stage, nothing prevented them from acting in their own interests by not disclosing that information.\nThe appellants are correct that the requirements of good faith must be met during the formation of a contract (art. 1375 C.C.Q.; see also B. Lefebvre, La negociation dun contrat: source potentielle de responsabilite extracontractuelle, in P.-C. Lafond, ed., Melanges Claude Masse: En quete de justice et dequite (2003), 571, at pp. 573 and 586-87). Some authors properly connect the legal obligation to act in good faith during negotiations with an obligation to act [translation] with loyalty and fair play (J. Pineau et al., Theorie des obligations (5th ed. 2023), by C. Valcke, at No. 87). While it is not necessarily disloyal to pursue parallel negotiations at the pre-contractual stage, good faith entails a duty to inform, which varies with the context and is intended in part to [translation] make up for a lack of information that might lead to a form of exploitation (B. Lefebvre, La bonne foi, in B. Moore, ed., Les grandes notions (2015), 75, at p. 108). Baudouin, Jobin and Vezina suggest that the criteria from Bail determine the scope of this duty to inform, even at the pre-contractual stage (J.-L. Baudouin and P.-G. Jobin, Les obligations (7th ed. 2013), by P.-G. Jobin and N. Vezina, at No. 313).\nGood faith during the pre-contractual phase  and, by extension, the duty to inform arising from it  must be assessed in light of the parties relationship, which in this case includes the atmosphere of trust that existed between them as well as the Presidents Agreement they had entered into (see J.-L. Baudouin, Justice et equilibre: la nouvelle moralite contractuelle du droit civil quebecois, in G. Goubeaux et al., eds., Etudes offertes a Jacques Ghestin: Le contrat au debut du XXIe siecle (2001), 29, at p. 33). In Quebec, this pre-contractual duty to inform does not require a party to disregard their own interests or subordinate them to those of another. I would note that in France, a recent reform to the law of obligations appears to be consistent, to a large degree, with this understanding of the state of Quebec law (see arts. 1112 and 1112-1 of the French Code civil). As Malaurie, Aynes and Stoffel-Munck explain, the duty of good faith in the formation of a contract in French law now formally recognizes that each party must refrain from any conduct that is likely to mislead the other about their true intentions, a duty that [translation] essentially involves obligations to say and not to say (P. Malaurie, L. Aynes and P. Stoffel-Munck, Droit des obligations (12th ed. 2022), at No. 277).\nThere would have been a meaningful debate in this case about the scope of the extracontractual duty to inform owed to the respondents on the basis of good faith, but it is not a debate that needs to be settled here. The respondents do not allege either in their motion to institute proceedings or before this Court that there was a breach of the requirements of good faith at the pre-contractual stage, nor do they ask that the contracts of sale they entered into with the appellants in 2006 and 2007 be annulled. Rather, their focus in this Court is on the good faith performance of the Presidents Agreement, which was fully applicable at the relevant time. I note that the Agreement anticipated the possibility of the sale of shares by Mr. Rheaume and Mr. Beaulne in various ways, including by granting the appellants a right of first refusal. In this context, both the respondents and the courts below are right to have approached the issue of the appellants liability from a contractual standpoint. In short, the cause of action defended against by the appellants relates not to the formation of the 2006 and 2007 contracts but rather to the performance of the Presidents Agreement entered into in 2002.\nIn sum, arguments based on extracontractual liability are of only theoretical import here given the contractual relationship that the parties chose to establish with one another. That being so, I will now examine the obligational content of the Presidents Agreement to determine whether the appellants were contractually bound to inform the respondents of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence.\nThird Possible Basis: Implied Contractual Obligation to Inform\nThe appellants submit that the trial judge erred in finding that the Presidents Agreement contained an implied obligation to inform, making their non-disclosure of IAs interest a contractual fault. Characterizing the Agreement instead as simply a remuneration agreement, they argue that it could not include such an obligation (outline of argument, at para. 2.5).\nThe appellants are mistaken. Before the scope of an obligation of contractual good faith is even considered, the nature of the Presidents Agreement leads to the conclusion that an implied obligation to inform was incident to it. The Presidents Agreement was the cornerstone of the business relationship between the appellants and the shareholders. The role of each party in this relationship was clear. The shareholders provided the capital needed for the common enterprise while retaining ownership of the shares and the right to dispose of them, while the appellants agreed to contribute their expertise. This was how the parties chose to join forces contractually to pursue a common goal, the success of Groupe Excellence. As noted above, the wording of the Presidents Agreement created obligations only for the appellants benefit, as the parties did not expressly provide for any correlative obligation for the shareholders benefit (aside from requiring the subsequent negotiation of a non-competition clause). In this regard, art. 1434 C.C.Q. provides that a contract binds the parties not only as to what they have expressed in it but also as to what is incident to it according to its nature and in conformity with usage, equity or law. Implied obligations result in what Professor Crepeau, in an article discussing art. 1024 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, called the [translation] widening of the contractual circle (P.-A. Crepeau, Le contenu obligationnel dun contrat (1965), 43 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at p. 7).\nIn this case, the appellants implied obligations arose primarily from the very nature of the Presidents Agreement. As this Court has noted, the nature of a contract will be the source of an implied duty if the contracts coherency seems to require such a duty and if the duty is consistent with the general scheme of the contract (Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corp. v. Hydro-Quebec, 2018 SCC 46, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 101, at para. 74). In other words, an implied obligation arising from the nature of a contract must not have the effect of adding new obligations to the contract but must instead fill the gaps in its express content (D. Lluelles and B. Moore, Droit des obligations (3rd ed. 2018), at No. 1542). According to Professor Crepeau, the justification for the inclusion of implied obligations arising from the nature of a contract rests first and foremost on the presumed intention of the parties (pp. 7-8). In this sense, implied obligations have the same basis as express obligations, thereby linking autonomy of the will to the [b]inding force and content of contracts, as the subheading preceding art. 1434 C.C.Q. now states (see Churchill Falls, at para. 74, per Gascon J., and para. 170, per Rowe J., dissenting, but not on this point).\nHere, by its very nature, the Presidents Agreement was a long-term agreement that formalized a business relationship between the appellants and the majority shareholders, parties who each had different roles to play to maximize the value of Groupe Excellence. Regardless of whether the Agreement is characterized as a relational contract, it required reciprocal contractual loyalty (Churchill Falls, at paras. 122-23, quoting Provigo Distribution Inc. v. Supermarche A.R.G. Inc., 1997 CanLII 10209 (Que. C.A.), at p. 25). The Agreement was certainly not a contract of employment  the element of subordination was absent  under which an obligation of contractual loyalty specific to that nominate contract would have arisen pursuant to art. 2088 C.C.Q. (Cabiakman v. Industrial Alliance Life Insurance Co., 2004 SCC 55, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 195, at paras. 27-28). As mentioned above, the Agreement was also not analogous to a contract of mandate that involves an obligation of maximalist loyalty. However, the Agreement was similar in some respects to a contract for services (art. 2098 C.C.Q.), since the appellants undertook, in exchange for compensation and with no relationship of subordination, to perform physical and intellectual acts for the respondents benefit. From this standpoint, and by analogy with art. 2100 para. 1 C.C.Q., the appellants were bound to act in the best interests of Mr. Rheaume and Mr. Beaulne, but without subordinating their interests to those of the shareholders (Cantin Cumyn (2012), at pp. 20-21; see also Smith, at p. 121).\nAccording to clause 1 of the Agreement, [translation] [t]he SHAREHOLDERS agree to share with the PRESIDENTS part of the excess profits and part of the increase in corporate value of [Groupe Excellence] (A.R., vol. X, at p. 3652). In addition, clauses 2 and 3 of the Agreement suggested the possibility of a future sale by the shareholders of their interests in Groupe Excellence and stipulated the benefits that the appellants could derive from such a sale. Specifically, clause 2 gave the appellants an option to purchase 40 percent of the majority shareholders capital stock in the event of a full or partial transaction, and clause 3 gave the appellants a right of first refusal in such a scenario. Clauses 4 to 8 were miscellaneous clauses that, among other things, provided for special compensation owed to the appellants in certain circumstances if there was a sale or merger of Groupe Excellence (clause 4) and stipulated the term of the Agreement  five years, renewable automatically for two-year periods (clause 6).\nAn analysis of the general scheme of the Presidents Agreement shows that it was intended to formalize a mutually beneficial business relationship between the appellants and the shareholders. In this sense, the Agreement reflected and reinforced the high level of trust on which a common enterprise of this kind rests, including, above all, the trust that the shareholders placed in the appellants, as the trial judge found based on the evidence (see, in particular, Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 36). The sharing of Groupe Excellences profits and increase in value was the centrepiece of the Agreement, because this mechanism encouraged the appellants to step up their efforts to ensure its success, which would ultimately benefit each of the parties. Furthermore, the Agreement was such that it provided the appellants with significant benefits, even if the shareholders sold their shares. It expressly set out these incentive pay terms and conditions for the appellants benefit without spelling out any reciprocal obligations for them.\nHaving regard to the very nature of the Presidents Agreement, the trial judge found that the appellants had an implied obligation to maximize the value of Groupe Excellence, including with a view to a sale. That interpretation of the contract  based on the evidence  is consistent with the way the parties relationship was structured: the appellants took care of the management of the companies and left it to the shareholders to decide Groupe Excellences ultimate destiny. Moreover, I agree with the trial judge that the appellants also had an implied obligation to inform the shareholders of any fact [translation] that might enable the Shareholders to assess the companies profits and value and decide whether to sell their shares and, if so, at what price (para. 432). These implied obligations served to ensure the Agreements internal coherence. Grounded in the presumed intention of the parties, they could have been configured differently, through an express clause. They were the logical counterpart of the significant benefits conferred on the appellants and of the high level of trust existing in such a business relationship. This is all the more reason why the trial judges interpretation of the contract is entitled to deference, as the Court of Appeal noted, and the appellants have failed to raise any reviewable error in this regard (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 32).\nAccording to the appellants, the scope of this implied obligation to inform was not so wide as to impose on them a duty to tell the shareholders of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence (A.F., at para. 78). They submit that IAs interest in Groupe Excellence was no more than an indication of its market value, which is information that a buyer cannot be obligated to provide to a prospective seller (A.F., at para. 73).\nThis argument advanced by the appellants is without merit. In my view, the scope of the implied obligation to inform recognized by the trial judge supports his conclusion regarding the wrongful nature of the appellants omission. I reiterate that, in keeping with that obligation, the appellants had to provide the shareholders with [translation] all information they have that might enable the Shareholders to assess the companies profits and value and decide whether to sell their shares and, if so, at what price (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 432). According to the trial judges findings of fact, which are not directly contested in this Court, knowledge of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence would have had a major impact on the shareholders decision to sell to the appellants and on the price of that sale (paras. 446, 487, 492 and 499). IAs interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence was therefore information that might have helped the shareholders make a decision to sell their interests and determine a price. Accordingly, the non-disclosure of IAs interest was a direct breach of the implied obligation found by the trial judge.\nBut there is more.\nNot only did the appellants breach their implied obligation to inform arising from the nature of the Presidents Agreement, but they may also have breached their duty to perform the Agreement in a manner consistent with the requirements of good faith (art. 1375 C.C.Q.). Indeed, it is from this latter perspective that the respondents invite us to assess the appellants fault, alleging that they failed to meet these requirements in performing the Presidents Agreement (R.F., at paras. 46-48). As we will see, regardless of the existence of an implied obligation to inform under the Presidents Agreement, it can be concluded that in this case the requirements of good faith, on their own, imposed a duty on the appellants to inform the shareholders of IAs interest, as an obligation of public order (see S. Grammond, A.-F. Debruche and Y. Campagnolo, Quebec Contract Law (3rd ed. 2020), at para. 327).\nAlthough they sometimes overlap, there is a fundamental difference between non-performance of a contractual obligation and performance of the obligation in a manner contrary to the requirements of good faith. The former relates to implementation of the content of the contractual obligation, whereas the latter relates instead to the manner in which the obligation is performed. For example, if the appellants worked to maximize the value of Groupe Excellence but secretly took action to prevent the shareholders from reaping the resulting benefits in the event of a sale, the appellants would indeed have performed their contractual obligation to maximize Groupe Excellences value, but they would have done so in a manner contrary to the requirements of good faith. Of course, the content of an implied contractual obligation to inform  arising from the presumed intention of the parties  may differ from the content of the duty to inform arising from good faith, which is imposed on the parties by imperative law.\nI note that it is not always easy, helpful or necessary to draw a distinction between non-performance of a contractual obligation, on the one hand, and performance of such an obligation in a manner contrary to the requirements of good faith, on the other. That said, it may be relevant in certain respects to recognize that a party has not only failed to perform a contractual obligation but has also breached the requirements of good faith. As I note below, even once non-performance of a contract is established, evidence of an additional breach of the requirements of good faith can have a significant impact at the remedy stage. In this context, and in light of the respondents arguments, it is therefore appropriate to continue our analysis in order to determine whether the appellants performed the obligational content of the Presidents Agreement in a manner consistent with the requirements of good faith.\nFourth Possible Basis: Obligation to Perform the Presidents Agreement in Accordance With the Requirements of Good Faith\nThe appellants submit that their non-disclosure of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence was not contrary to the requirements of good faith. In their opinion, the trial judge erred in concluding that they [translation] clearly breached their duties of good faith and loyalty and their duty to inform (para. 544). They say that the Court of Appeal also erred in upholding that conclusion (para. 110).\nSpecifically, according to the appellants, the trial judge erred at para. 546 of his reasons when he faulted them for breaching their duty to [translation] put the interests of [the respondents] ahead of their own. In so doing, they argue, he misapprehended the scope of the obligation to perform a contract in good faith. They argue that unlike the fiduciary-type obligation of loyalty, contractual loyalty flowing from art. 1375 C.C.Q. does not require a contracting party to subordinate their interests to those of the other party.\nIn keeping with what they consider to be the proper scope of the obligation of good faith under art. 1375 C.C.Q., the appellants submit that they were not bound to disclose IAs interest to the respondents because that information does not meet the criteria laid down in Bail relating to the duty to inform arising from good faith. The appellants thus argue that, in reality, IAs interest was simply an indication of market value, or information that Rheaume and Beaulne could, and should, [have] obtain[ed] for themselves (outline of argument, at para. 2.8).\nThe appellants are mistaken. It is true that the trial judge misspoke in stating that the appellants had to put the respondents interests ahead of their own (para. 546). Nonetheless, in finding that the appellants had breached the obligation to perform the Presidents Agreement in good faith, the trial judge correctly assessed the scope of contractual loyalty and did not require the appellants to subordinate their interests to those of the respondents. His findings concerning the appellants concealment of IAs interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence  as the Court of Appeal affirmed (at para. 93)  are not tainted by a reviewable error. In short, the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal were right in finding two breaches  which were also interrelated  of contractual loyalty, which attached to the Presidents Agreement through art. 1375 C.C.Q.: failing to properly inform the shareholders at the time their interests in Groupe Excellence were purchased and thereby lacking the elementary probity required by contractual public order.\nGood faith in Quebec civil law, which has been fully recognized since National Bank of Canada v. Soucisse, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 339, Houle v. Canadian National Bank, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 122, and Bail, is now an enacted standard of public order; it infuses every contract as if a clause provided for it (Lluelles and Moore, at No. 1977). Through the combined effect of arts. 1375 and 1434 C.C.Q., good faith performance is an implied obligation that by law must be included in a contract (Tardif v. Succession de Dube, 2018 QCCA 1639, 51 C.C.L.T. (4th) 54, at para. 75; Provigo, at pp. 20-22; Baudouin, Jobin and Vezina, at No. 307; Lluelles and Moore, at No. 2017). To this end, art. 1434 C.C.Q. [translation] sets out a mechanism of implied prestations and art. 1375 establishes one of those prestations by requiring reciprocally from the contracting parties a general attitude  even a state of being  in the course of their contractual relationship (Lluelles and Moore, at No. 1977 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted)).\nEven before art. 1375 C.C.Q. was enacted, Professor Crepeau explained that an implied obligation may arise from legislation, under either a suppletive or an imperative provision (pp. 27-29). The inclusion of an implied obligation through a legislative provision supplementing contractual intention is, of course, justified by the statutory presumption that this was what the parties intended; the parties may exclude the obligation through an express clause (see, e.g., with respect to marriage contracts, arts. 431 and 432 C.C.Q.). The justification for the inclusion of an implied obligation based on an imperative statutory provision rests upon another conception of contractual fairness grounded not in autonomy of the will but in public order. This is the foundation of the duty to perform the Presidents Agreement in good faith, an imperative obligation under art. 1375 C.C.Q. In this sense, good faith differs from the implied prestations that arise, in part, from the nature of the contract. The imperative standard of good faith applies to all contracts; its implementation varies with the circumstances. Discussing French law, Professor Benabent explains that good faith, which is [translation] flexible in its content, involves a range of requirements tailored to the specific circumstances of each case (A. Benabent, Droit des obligations (19th ed. 2021), at No. 303 (emphasis deleted)). Here, the Presidents Agreement  a long-term contract formalizing a business relationship  was entered into in the context of the atmosphere of trust found by the trial judge and had to be performed accordingly. The Agreement did not, however, require the appellants to exercise powers for the respondents benefit.\nThe appellants are therefore right to say that, in this case, they did not have an obligation of loyalty in the exercise of powers in the interest of another. But like any contracting party in Quebec, they had to comply with an obligation of contractual loyalty toward the respondents, which arose from the duty of good faith set out in art. 1375 C.C.Q. Through its so-called completive function, good faith requires a contracting party [translation] to act with loyalty, that is, taking into account, within the limits of reasonable conduct, the interests of [the] other [contracting] party (M. A. Gregoire, Liberte, responsabilite et utilite: la bonne foi comme instrument de justice (2010), at p. 209; see also Dunkin Brands Canada Ltd. v. Bertico Inc., 2015 QCCA 624, 41 B.L.R. (5th) 1, at paras. 66-70). This obligation of loyalty [translation] applies to a person who performs a prestation or exercises a right under a contract and who is bound to act in good faith (Cantin Cumyn (2012), at p. 21). Unlike maximalist loyalty, contractual loyalty is reciprocal because of the mutual nature of good faith. It does not require contracting parties to act in the sole interest of their counterparty, but it does require them to consider the other partys interests when performing the contract (Lluelles and Moore, at No. 1987).\nI pause here to note that the French term loyaute is sometimes used to describe different concepts, which no doubt reflects the [translation] great terminological variety characteristic of this field: . . . reference is made both to good faith and to an obligation of loyalty, of cooperation or, more vaguely, to an obligation of prudence or consistency (Benabent, at No. 303; see, in Quebec law, Smith, at p. 121). For example, some Quebec authors have used this term to refer to the generally prohibitive dimension of good faith (see, e.g., Lluelles and Moore, at No. 1978). On the other hand, Professor Picod distinguishes [translation] loyalty as absence of bad faith from loyalty as a diligent and conscientious attitude, regarding loyalty as reflecting both the prohibitive and proactive dimensions of good faith in French law (Y. Picod, Le devoir de loyaute dans lexecution du contrat (1989), at p. 26). For his part, Professor Cornu explains that the term loyaute may, among other things, refer more generally to contractual good faith (in the performance of a contract) (G. Cornu, ed., Dictionary of the Civil Code (2014), definition of loyaute). This latter approach was echoed in Quebec jurisprudence based on the Civil Code of Lower Canada, including the landmark case of Houle, in which this Court wrote that the implicit obligation of good faith . . . mandates that rights be exercised in a spirit of fair play (p. 158; see also, under the Civil Code of Quebec, Provigo, at pp. 23-26).\nIn these reasons, I use the expression contractual loyalty to refer to the general attitude of a contracting party in good faith, who must take the other partys interests into account (see Cantin Cumyn (2012), at p. 21). In this sense, contractual loyalty is minimalist. It stands in contrast to maximalist loyalty, which is the general attitude that must be adopted by a person on whom a power is conferred and which requires the person to subordinate their interests to those of another (see Smith, at p. 122). I note that the legislature uses the term loyaute in French to describe both maximalist loyalty (see arts. 322, 1309 para. 2 and 2138 para. 2 C.C.Q.) and contractual loyalty (see art. 2088 C.C.Q.). The term loyalty is used as the English equivalent of loyaute in art. 322 C.C.Q., but the legislature sometimes uses the adverb faithfully in analogous contexts (see arts. 1309 para. 2, 2088 and 2138 para. 2 C.C.Q.).\nAuthors have properly recognized that, depending on the context, good faith may have both a prohibitive dimension and a proactive dimension (see Lluelles and Moore, at No. 1978; M. A. Gregoire, Le role de la bonne foi dans la formation et lelaboration du contrat (2003), at pp. 11-12; Baudouin, Jobin and Vezina, at No. 161). In this case, I am of the view that the appellants, through their conduct, breached the obligations flowing from both of these dimensions of good faith.\nFirst, the prohibitive dimension of good faith requires, among other things, that parties to a contract not act dishonestly in performing it (Lefebvre (2015), at p. 93). In this case, contractual loyalty did not require the appellants to forsake their own interests to benefit the respondents, let alone to refrain from exercising the legal rights they had under the Agreement. But in the pursuit of their interests and the exercise of their rights, parties to a contract must conduct themselves loyally by not unduly increasing the burden on the other party or behaving in an excessive or unreasonable manner (see Churchill Falls, at paras. 112-13, per Gascon J., and para. 177, per Rowe J., dissenting, but not on this point). The prohibitive dimension of good faith also requires each contracting party not to jeopardize the existence or equilibrium of the contractual relationship (Lluelles and Moore, at No. 1979).\nHowever, I agree with the trial judge that in this case the appellants conducted themselves in a disloyal manner and lacked probity when they failed to disclose the interest expressed by IA to the shareholders and when they signed the Undertaking of Confidentiality with IA (paras. 544-47). They were, of course, not obliged to subordinate their interests to those of the respondents in performing the Presidents Agreement, but they did have to look out for the interests of the respondents in the legitimate pursuit of their own interests (see Dunkin Brands, at paras. 74-75; Provigo, at pp. 24-25; see also Bhasin, at para. 70). The respondents could therefore legitimately expect the appellants to refrain from scheming in any way to enrich themselves at their expense. In the context of the business relationship in question, the appellants thus engaged in dishonest conduct that thwarted the respondents legitimate expectations in pursuing the goal they all had, which was to maximize the profits and value of the Groupe Excellence companies for the benefit of both the appellants and the respondents.\nFurthermore, I make note once again of the trial judges factual determination that when Mr. Beaulne asked Mr. Ponce whether IA was interested in acquiring Groupe Excellence, Mr. Ponce lied to Mr. Beaulne by telling him that he had checked and that IA was not interested (paras. 67-68 and 449). The appellants urge us to review that finding of fact. According to them, IAs offer to purchase the group had not yet been made at the relevant time. Even if it had been, they say, IA never wanted to do business directly with the shareholders (A.F., at para. 85), so Mr. Ponce did not act dishonestly by telling Mr. Beaulne that IA was not interested in acquiring his shares in the group.\nI disagree with the appellants on this point. Although the interplay of dates makes the chronology of events sometimes difficult to reconstruct on appeal, I am of the view that the appellants have not discharged the onerous burden of showing that the trial judges finding in this regard  which was based in part on his assessment of the credibility of those involved  is tainted by a palpable and overriding error. Regardless of whether Mr. Ponces answer was a lie in the strict sense, his failure to convey to Mr. Beaulne the information he had at the time concerning the definite interest expressed by IA amounted, at the very least, to dishonest concealment that was meant to mislead the shareholders (see Private Law Dictionary and Bilingual Lexicons: Obligations (2003), definition of concealment; P. Stoffel-Munck, Labus dans le contrat: Essai dune theorie (2000), at Nos. 92-98; see also C.M. Callow Inc. v. Zollinger, 2020 SCC 45, at para. 89). That choice not to reveal IAs interest was in keeping with the silence required by the Undertaking of Confidentiality, through which Mr. Ponce and Mr. Riopel sought to prevent IA from dealing directly with the shareholders (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 441). In this context, the trial judge had sufficient grounds for finding that such disloyal conduct was contrary to the requirement of honesty arising from art. 1375 C.C.Q.\nSecond, in addition to these breaches of the prohibitive dimension of good faith, the appellants also contravened its proactive dimension. In this regard, good faith requires, from each contracting party, active behaviour that is intended to assist their contracting partner but that still remains compatible with the partys own interests. Based on the circumstances, each party must, in particular, [translation] inform [their partner], in the course of the contract, of events they had better know about for the performance of the contract (Lluelles and Moore, at No. 1997 (footnote omitted)). Good faith thus imposes on each contracting party a duty to inform that [translation] encompass[es] their partners legitimate expectations (D. Mazeaud, Chronique de jurisprudence civile generale: Obligations et protection des consommateurs, in Repertoire du notariat Defrenois (1996), at p. 1010, quoted in Lluelles and Moore, at No. 2001; see also Desjardins Financial Services Firm Inc. v. Asselin, 2020 SCC 30, [2020] 3 S.C.R. 298, at para. 61). In keeping with this proactive dimension, as Professor Cantin Cumyn helpfully notes, [translation] the duty of [contractual] loyalty requires [a contracting party] to provide the other party with the information that is relevant to the performance of their prestation, in order to facilitate it or avoid making it more onerous than originally intended (Cantin Cumyn (2012), at p. 20). Like its prohibitive counterpart, the proactive dimension of contractual good faith does not require a contracting party to act selflessly. However, it does always require a contracting party to consider the other partys perspective when exercising the legal rights conferred by the contract (p. 21; see, e.g., Dunkin Brands, at para. 74).\nIn the context of this case, which involves a long-term business relationship, contractual good faith imposed a proactive duty to inform on the parties through art. 1375 C.C.Q. Disclosure by the appellants of the interest expressed by IA would not have amounted, in this case, to the subordination of their interests to those of the respondents. Conversely, remaining silent about IAs interest constituted disloyal conduct. Again, we are dealing with a contractual undertaking through which the parties joined forces to achieve a common goal. This is what French authors Malaurie, Aynes and Stoffel-Munck describe as an [translation] alliance contract or cooperation contract, under which the parties unite to some degree to pursue a common goal over time (No. 276). Such contracts are better able to accommodate the duties of initiative and cooperation based on good faith than [translation] exchange contracts, which are not meant to be long-lasting (No. 276; see also Grammond, Debruche and Campagnolo, at paras. 49 and 326).\nAll that remains to be determined is the extent of this duty to inform in the specific context of the business relationship that existed here. For this purpose, I will refer to the landmark decision in Bail. In that case, the Court outlined a general theory regarding the duty to inform arising from the obligation of good faith in contractual matters, which served to determine whether particular information fell within this duty. As the Court of Appeal properly noted, this Court laid down the following three criteria in Bail (at pp. 586-87): (1) knowledge of the information, whether actual or presumed, by the party owing the obligation to inform; (2) the fact that the information in question is of decisive importance; (3) the fact that it is impossible for the party to whom the duty to inform is owed to inform itself, or that the creditor is legitimately relying on the debtor of the obligation.\nIn this case, Rancourt J.A. carefully verified whether these criteria were met in light of the facts found by the trial judge, and I adopt his conclusion that the three criteria are satisfied (paras. 86-91). With regard to the first criterion, the appellants do not dispute that they knew of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence (para. 87, referring to the examination after defence of Daniel Riopel, reproduced in A.R., vol. XVIII, at p. 6699). I also note that they were fully aware of the financial value of that information and of the fact that it was of interest to the shareholders from the standpoint of a possible sale (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 492). The second criterion is also satisfied in this case, as the trial judge found that the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence would have [translation] had a major impact on the decision of Rheaume and Beaulne to sell their interests to the [appellants] and, beyond a shadow of a doubt, on the determination of the value of the shares and the price (para. 446). The trial judge also found that if the shareholders had known of IAs interest, they [translation] would have sought to maximize the sale price for their shares, and Mr. Rheaume would not have signed the act of sale of September 1, 2006 (paras. 487 and 494). Indeed, Mr. Ponce himself acknowledged that, in such circumstances, the presidents and the shareholders could have presented a united front and, as a group of four, obtained a better sale price (paras. 492-93).\nFinally, I am of the view that the last criterion from Bail is doubly satisfied in this case. First, with regard to the atmosphere of trust between the parties, I repeat that they had, for several years, been cultivating a business relationship that involved the pursuit of a common goal, the success of Groupe Excellence. In this sense, the respondents were perfectly entitled to expect to be duly informed of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence. However, the appellants acted disloyally in this regard, betraying the trust that their counterparties, the respondents, had legitimately placed in them. Second, irrespective of the atmosphere of trust that existed between the parties, I am of the view that it was impossible for the shareholders to inform themselves of IAs interest. As noted above, the appellants entered into an Undertaking of Confidentiality with IA a few months after being approached by it, and clause 5 of that undertaking was specifically intended to prevent any transaction between IA and the shareholders (Sup. Ct. reasons, at para. 445). According to the trial judge, clause 5 [translation] no doubt explains why IAs president . . . never returned Beaulnes call in April 2006 to verify IAs interest (para. 447). In addition, when Mr. Beaulne asked Mr. Ponce whether IA would be interested in purchasing his shares in Groupe Excellence, Mr. Ponce answered that he had checked and that IA was not interested (paras. 448-49). As I said above, regardless of whether it was a lie, that interaction  coupled with the signing of the Undertaking of Confidentiality  illustrates the shareholders unsuccessful efforts to inform themselves.\nIn sum, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence satisfies, in the context of the Presidents Agreement, each of the three criteria set out in Bail (paras. 87-91). As a result, the requirements of good faith in the performance of the Agreement imposed a duty on the appellants to inform the shareholders of IAs interest.\nSince the appellants failure to inform the shareholders of IAs interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence was therefore a breach of the requirements of good faith, I turn now to the question of the appropriate remedy.\nBasis for the Remedy and Amount Owed to the Respondents\nThe parties disagree on the legal basis for the appropriate remedy in this case and on the amount, if any, owed to the respondents. As noted above, the trial judge ordered the appellants solidarily to pay the respondents $11,884,743, an amount equivalent to the profits that he found had been made by the appellants in reselling the shares of Groupe Excellence to IA. The Court of Appeal upheld that amount, as it was of the view that the appellants had not established any reviewable error.\nThe appellants submit that the courts below erred in ordering disgorgement to the respondents of the profits made on the resale of Groupe Excellence to IA. In their opinion, there was no legal basis for awarding that remedy in this case. They stress that disgorgement of profits must remain an exceptional remedy, since it is a departure from the cardinal principle of corrective justice. They maintain that ordering disgorgement of profits can be justified only where there is a breach of an obligation of loyalty similar to that of a common law fiduciary, that is, the maximalist loyalty required of a person authorized to exercise powers in the interest of another. According to the appellants in this case, the Court of Appeal correctly found, unlike the trial judge, that the parties legal relationship was not characterized by such a relationship of loyalty. However, they argue that the Court of Appeal erred in upholding disgorgement of profits anyway based on the breach of an obligation of good faith. They submit that a breach of that contractual obligation must be compensated for only where injury is duly proved by the plaintiff.\nAs disgorgement of profits was not, in their view, an available remedy in this case, the appellants maintain that the onus was on the respondents to prove their injury. However, the respondents adduced no evidence to this effect, they say, which means that no damages should be awarded against them. In their opinion, awarding damages without proof of injury, even for a possible breach of the obligation of good faith, would be tantamount to awarding punitive damages, which cannot be justified in the circumstances.\nThe respondents answer that the remedy awarded by the courts below is fully justified in light of the wrong committed (R.F., at para. 89). First, they state that disgorgement of profits is simply an application of the moral precept that no one should profit from their own wrongdoing or bad faith (R.F., at paras. 84-85, citing on this point Kuet, at pp. 439 and 441). Second, and in the alternative, the respondents allege that the remedy awarded by the Superior Court and upheld on appeal can be seen as equivalent to an award of damages. The respondents say that these damages, which are directly related to the appellants fault, compensate here for the injury flowing from lost profits, as permitted by art. 1611 C.C.Q. They argue that this serious loss, raised in the motion to institute proceedings in the Superior Court, materialized when the appellants resold Groupe Excellence to IA at a price higher than the one they had paid to purchase it from the respondents. This price difference [translation] would therefore be the value most representative of the profits of which the respondents were allegedly deprived as a result of the appellants wrongful omission (R.F., at para. 118). In support of their position, the respondents rely in part on the testimony of Mr. Ponce, who stated the following regarding the sale price for Groupe Excellence: [translation] . . . of course, we could have gotten more, but as a group of four (examination in chief, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXVII, at p. 9465).\nTo determine the appropriate remedy in this case before considering the issue of assessment of damages, I must begin by identifying the legal basis for awarding disgorgement of profits.\nAvailability of Disgorgement of Profits as a Remedy\nDisgorgement of Profits Where There Is an Obligation of Loyalty in the Exercise of a Power\nThe appellants are certainly right on one point: as a general rule, disgorgement of profits does not have the same compensatory function as an award of damages as a remedy for breach of a contractual obligation. Reparation in civil liability is intended to compensate for loss sustained or profit lost (art. 1611 C.C.Q.). In contrast, other remedies are aimed at restitution and involve returning what has been received. As such, they do not have this compensatory aspect that reparation does in the law of liability (on this distinction, see the comments of Professor Pascal Frechette, particularly at pp. 14 and 135). As for disgorgement of profits  which straddles restitution and compensation in the law of liability, and which was recognized by this Court in Kuet under the Civil Code of Lower Canada  the conditions for its application, which are somewhat uncertain in positive law, are disagreed upon by the parties in this case.\nTo begin, the appellants are correct in stating that disgorgement of profits is, in principle, available only where a person is charged with exercising powers in the interest of another: a mandatary and an administrator must hand over the property when the administration ends, and this [translation] normal restitution would encompass the profits accrued during the administration (Frechette, at p. 154; see also Cantin Cumyn (2012), at p. 22). For example, because an administrator of the property of others exercises the powers attached to their office for the benefit of others, any profit resulting from the exercise of those powers, along with the administered property, returns to the administered patrimony when the administration ends (arts. 1365 and 1366 para. 1 C.C.Q.). In this regard, the first part of art. 1366 para. 1 C.C.Q. provides that an administrator of the property of others must hand over to the beneficiary all that the administrator has received in performing the obligation of loyalty attached to their duties, even if the beneficiary has not sustained any injury (see L. Smith and J. Berryman, Disgorgement of Profits in Canada, in E. Hondius and A. Janssen, eds., Disgorgement of Profits: Gain-Based Remedies throughout the World (2015), 281). Moreover, under the second part of art. 1366 para. 1 C.C.Q., an administrator is also accountable for any personal profit or benefit he has realized by using, without authorization, information he had obtained by reason of his administration. In this exceptional case, disgorgement of profits sanctions the breach of the administrators obligation of maximalist loyalty, from a perspective farther removed from restitution (Cantin Cumyn and Cumyn, at para. 376). Even in such a case, disgorgement of profits differs, as I will endeavour to explain, from the traditional sanction of damages, which depends on proof of injury.\nThese two remedies are indeed conceptually distinct. Disgorgement of profits, which is more restitutionary in its focus, is in principle meant to ensure compliance with the obligation of maximalist loyalty owed by a person on whom a power is conferred. An award of damages, on the other hand, serves to compensate the victim of a fault for the injury sustained and thus reflects a compensatory logic related in part to contractual loyalty under art. 1375 C.C.Q. As some authors explain, disgorgement of profits is therefore different from damages, as it is [translation] not in keeping with the compensatory function of civil liability (Frechette, at p. 161; see also Gregoire (2010), at pp. 50-51).\nThe respondents assert that in Kuet, this Court extended the scope of the remedy of disgorgement of profits beyond just cases in which a party exercises a power (R.F., at paras. 84-85). More particularly, they argue that Kuet made disgorgement of profits a remedy to sanction a person who has committed a fault for financial gain and breached the requirements of good faith in contractual matters (paras. 84 and 88). The appellants, on the other hand, give Kuet a much narrower scope. Noting that the bank in that case had sustained no injury due to the conduct of its foreign currency trader, who had made personal profits in the performance of his duties, the appellants say that Kuet does not permit the scope of the exceptional remedy of disgorgement of profits to be extended beyond cases in which the debtor at fault was required to subordinate their own interests to those of their creditor (A.F., at para. 101). This interpretation of Kuet leads the appellants to conclude that disgorgement of profits is not available as a remedy in this case because, as we know, the appellants did not breach an obligation of maximalist loyalty given that they were not charged with exercising powers in the respondents interest. Accordingly, the appellants say, the breach of the obligation of contractual loyalty they were found to have committed can give rise only to damages as compensation for proven injury, not to disgorgement of profits. However, the respondents have not proved such injury.\nI agree with the appellants that Kuet should not be given an interpretation that departs from the foundations of the law of civil liability. That judgment, when properly read, indicates that the remedy of disgorgement of profits is not available to a court where there has simply been a breach of the obligation of good faith by a person who is not subject to an obligation of loyalty in the exercise of a power. Kuet therefore provides no basis to support disgorgement of profits to the respondents as a remedy.\nIt is true, as the respondents note, that Gonthier J. relied on the precept that no one should profit from his own wrongdoing in deciding to award disgorgement of profits (Kuet, at p. 439). That said, Gonthier J. did not base his reasoning solely on that adage, which might have suggested that he tied disgorgement of profits simply to a breach of good faith. He took care to ground his decision to award disgorgement of profits in an analogy with the obligation of a mandatary to turn over profits to the mandator, since the specific relationship between the bank and its currency trader in that case was similar to mandate.\nA brief overview of the facts of the case is necessary to fully appreciate this reality. In Kuet, a banks chief foreign currency trader had taken advantage of his position to make secret arrangements with his clients. Under those arrangements, he was to conduct foreign exchange transactions for their benefit and, in return, keep a percentage of the profits made. When the bank was made aware of those unauthorized activities, it brought a civil action against the currency trader, who by that point had made more than $600,000 in profits. Because the plaintiff bank had not suffered any loss, it did not seek damages but rather disgorgement of the profits made by the trader.\nUpon concluding his analysis, Gonthier J. allowed the banks claim and ordered the trader to turn over the profits he had made. That conclusion did not rest solely on the traders misconduct but thus related rather to the underlying function and relationship between the parties to the contract (p. 436). The strong resemblance between that relationship and the one arising under a contract of mandate, due to the control exercised by the trader over the banks affairs, was what led Gonthier J. to require the trader to account for all that he had received in the context of his administration (see the analysis proposed by Professor Frechette, at pp. 10 and 155-56). Gonthier J. based that disgorgement of profits, by analogy, on art. 1713 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada (see today art. 2184 C.C.Q.), a provision applicable first and foremost to mandataries that required them to deliver all that they had received under the authority of their mandate to the mandator, even if it was not due (p. 436).\nProfessor Frechette, commenting on the case, is therefore right to emphasize the parallel between the role of mandatary and the representative position held by the currency trader and in noting that this Court required the trader [translation] to account for all that he had received in the context of his administration, in keeping with the general logic of the rules of mandate (p. 155). Similarly, Professors Cantin Cumyn and Cumyn, at para. 376, take the view that Gonthier J. required specific performance of an obligation to hand over profits, an obligation analogous to that of a mandatary or administrator of the property of others (arts. 1366 para. 1, 2146 para. 2 and 2184 C.C.Q.). It was thus the existence of an obligation of maximalist loyalty in the context of exercising a power that justified disgorgement of profits in Kuet even though the bank had sustained no injury. I note that in Abbas-Turqui v. Labelle Marquis Inc., 2004 CanLII 26082 (Que.), which concerned a fault committed by a contracting party for financial gain in the context of a sale, the Court of Appeal took care to distinguish Kuet based on this same logic (see para. 13).\nI conclude that the principles spoken to in Kuet cannot be usefully transposed to this case. Of course, it might be said that by concealing the interest expressed by IA, the appellants, like the currency trader in Kuet, breached the obligation of good faith imposed on them through the combined effect of arts. 1434 and 1375 C.C.Q. But unlike the defendant in Kuet, the appellants were not required to turn over profits, as a mandatary or administrator would be, because they were not charged with exercising powers in the respondents interest.\nAccordingly, I am of the view that unlike the relationship that existed in Kuet but like the one in Abbas-Turqui, the specific relationship between the appellants and the respondents cannot ground disgorgement of the profits made by the appellants as a remedy.\nDisgorgement of Profits Where There Is No Exercise of Power\nIn addition to Kuet, the respondents rely on Uni-Select inc. v. Acktion Corp., [2002] R.J.Q. 3005, arguing that in that case the Quebec Court of Appeal ordered disgorgement of profits where a fault was committed for financial gain but there was no exercise of power in the interest of another. In Uni-Select, the contracting party at fault had purchased a company in violation of a non-competition clause. Faced with the trial judges finding that injury had not been proved, the Court of Appeal held that the injury was equivalent to the profits made by the contracting party at fault (paras. 58-63). The Court of Appeal thus reversed the trial judges factual determination, stating that the [translation] benefit in the marketplace derived by the contracting party at fault, that is, the profits it made, inevitably caused, in [this] context, a loss for the [aggrieved contracting party] (para. 59). For this reason, it declared that the beneficiary of the non-competition clause [translation] must be compensated for this loss pursuant to art. 1611 C.C.Q. (para. 59; see also para. 36). The respondents are therefore incorrect in arguing that the Court of Appeal in Uni-Select ordered the contracting party at fault to disgorge profits for a purpose other than compensation and without any proof of injury. Accordingly, insofar as it was established that the profits realized were equivalent to the injury caused by the contracting partys wrongful conduct, disgorgement of profits in Uni-Select was justified as compensation for fault. The respondents certainly cannot rely on that case to obtain disgorgement of profits directly, in the absence of an obligation of maximalist loyalty.\nIndependently of the foregoing, the respondents argue that disgorgement of profits can be a non-compensatory remedy that is available in the case of conduct [translation] that truly deviates from that of an honest, prudent contracting party (R.F., at para. 100). But as I have said, it must be recognized that they are above all seeking disgorgement of profits based on the compensatory function of this remedy, since they are claiming the profits made by the appellants as the equivalent of the gain of which they were allegedly deprived because the appellants unlawfully appropriated the business opportunity. As the motion to institute proceedings clearly indicates, the disgorgement of profits sought by the respondents is more akin to damages, which are in keeping with the general principles of civil liability (motion to institute proceedings, at para. 57.1). Unlike the bank in Kuet, the respondents say that they have sustained serious loss. They are therefore seeking disgorgement of profits as compensation for that injury caused by the breach of the appellants obligation of contractual loyalty. It follows that there is no need, in the context of the facts of this case, to decide whether disgorgement of profits is available to a court as a confiscatory and [translation] rather novel sanction in the absence of such injury (see Lluelles and Moore, at No. 2037; G. Viney, La condamnation de lauteur dune faute lucrative a restituer le profit illicite quil a retire de cette faute, in B. Moore, ed., Melanges Jean-Louis Baudouin (2012), 949). \nIn sum, I am of the view that disgorgement of profits without regard to injury is not an appropriate remedy in this case. The sanction requested is to compensate for a wrong. The demand is not simply for restitution of profits, much less for disgorgement of profits for a confiscatory or punitive purpose, a remedy that would potentially deviate from the general law of civil liability. It is thus appropriate to assess, on the basis of the respondents alternative argument, the quantum of the damages to be awarded to them to compensate for the loss they claim to have suffered.\nAward of Damages Pursuant to the Presumption in Baxter\nIn Quebec, the law of civil liability is based on the principle of full compensation for injury sustained, often expressed through the phrase restitutio in integrum. Pursuant to this principle, the purpose of damages is to compensate for loss sustained or gain lost as a result of fault. The quantum of such damages must be assessed so as to place the respondents in the position they would have been in but for the appellants fault (see arts. 1611 et seq. C.C.Q.).\nHere, the trial judge found that the appellants failure to tell the shareholders of the interest expressed by IA in acquiring Groupe Excellence had a major impact on the respondents decision to sell their shares and on the sale price (para. 446). In the Superior Court, Mr. Ponce acknowledged that if the shareholders had been duly informed, they and the presidents could have presented a united front in negotiating with IA and thus obtained a better price (paras. 492-93). That said, despite that concession, the appellants argue that the outcome of such negotiations is speculative and that it is therefore impossible to accurately determine the position the respondents would have been in but for the appellants fault. Since the existence of lost profits has not been established, they say, what the respondents are claiming is compensation for loss of chance, which is not compensable in Quebec law.\nThe respondents answer that, since the start of the proceedings, they have been seeking compensation for the gain lost due to the bad faith of the appellants, who unlawfully appropriated the proceeds from the resale of Groupe Excellence to IA. The trial judge accepted the existence of this lost gain, they say, and any difficulty proving it with precision is directly attributable to the appellants wrongdoing.\nThis situation is not unlike the one in Baxter, to which the trial judge referred (paras. 590-93). In that case, the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the majority shareholders had breached the requirements of good faith by failing to disclose to the minority shareholders the possibility of a public offering of their shares. Not having been informed of such a possibility, the minority shareholders agreed to sell their interests to the majority shareholders for $25 per share. A few months later, the majority shareholders resold those shares in the public offering for $150 each, thus earning a profit of $125 per share.\nWriting for the majority, Rothman J.A. found that if the minority shareholders had been told of the possibility of a public offering, they would not have sold their interests for $25 per share. However, determining the price at which they would have sold their interests  if they had indeed decided to sell them  involved speculation (Baxter, at p. 443), because the dishonest concealment of information prevented the minority shareholders from precisely establishing the position they would have been in but for the fault committed against them.\nIn that context, Rothman J.A. stated that the loss sustained by the minority shareholders should be presumed to be equivalent to the profit made by the majority shareholders (p. 443). He explained that this presumption is compatible with the principles governing the awarding of damages in the civil law (pp. 443-44, quoting Rainbow Industrial Caterers Ltd. v. Canadian National Railway Co., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 14-16). First, the presumption is consistent with the principle of restitutio in integrum, which requires that the aggrieved party be restored to their former position. Second, it is consistent, from an evidentiary standpoint, with the principle that the perpetrator of a wrongful act should not be permitted to profit from his own bad faith or wrongdoing (Baxter, at p. 443).\nI note that Deschamps J.A., dissenting on the issue of the quantum of damages, found instead that the evidence had established that, if they had been duly informed, the minority shareholders would still have sold their interests prior to the public offering, at a price of $91 per share (p. 447). That being said, there is nothing to suggest that, in reaching that conclusion, she rejected the soundness of the presumption endorsed by the majority. She agreed that the minority shareholders had provided sufficient proof of their injury; the disagreement concerned only the assessment of the quantum of damages.\nIn accordance with the presumption helpfully identified by Rothman J.A., where a breach of the requirements of good faith prevents the aggrieved party from proving the injury sustained, it should be presumed that the injury is equivalent to the profits made by the party at fault. However, this presumption is rebuttable, as it can be displaced by evidence to the contrary showing that the quantum of damages differs from the amount of the profits (pp. 443-44, quoting Rainbow Industrial Caterers, at pp. 14-16).\nThe presumption relied upon in Baxter draws from the common law, which has long recognized that where a fact cannot be proved because of a partys dishonesty, that fact will be assumed to be true in the absence of evidence to the contrary (see Rainbow Industrial Caterers, at pp. 14-16; Lamb v. Kincaid (1907), 38 S.C.R. 516, at pp. 539-40; see also Callow, at para. 116). In both legal traditions, this presumption is consistent with the principle of restitutio in integrum (see Rainbow Industrial Caterers, at p. 16, where Sopinka J. relied on National Bank of Canada v. Corbeil, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 117, and Provincial Bank of Canada v. Gagnon, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 98; see also Baxter, at p. 444, citing Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229).\nThe presumption established in Baxter therefore serves as the basis for a method of calculating damages to compensate the aggrieved party for the injury sustained. In this way, it is based on a compensatory objective that is distinct from disgorgement of profits where disgorgement is awarded for a restitutionary purpose in the absence of any injury. It should be noted that this presumption is not a departure from corrective justice, which is the foundation of the general rules of civil liability in Quebec: the sanction dependent on it is not punitive or confiscatory, but compensatory. Applying the presumption set out in Baxter therefore does not amount to awarding punitive damages, since the damages awarded on this basis have reparatory purposes.\nIn this case, the respondents are seeking disgorgement of profits as the equivalent of the serious loss they claim to have sustained as a result of the appellants breach of the requirements of good faith in the performance of the Agreement (motion to institute proceedings, at paras. 1, 47, 57, 57.1 and 58). That injury is equivalent here to the gain lost by the respondents, which is compensable under art. 1611 C.C.Q. Based on the presumption set out in Baxter, it can be assumed that, had it not been for the appellants wrongful omission, the respondents would have sold their interests to IA at the same price the appellants did. This was in fact the premise underlying the analysis by the respondents experts, which was accepted by the trial judge, as can be seen from his explanations about calculating the value of the lost advantage (see paras. 598 and 615). Consequently, what the appellants describe as loss of chance to negotiate ceases to be hypothetical and becomes simply a loss for which the respondents must be compensated in the absence of evidence to the contrary (A.F., at paras. 119-29; R.F., at para. 117). The onus was therefore on the appellants to establish on a balance of probabilities that the respondents would have sold their interests to IA for a price lower than the one obtained by the appellants.\nThe appellants did not discharge this burden. The trial judge accepted the assumption put forward by the respondents firm of experts, namely that, had it not been for the acts alleged against the [appellants], the [respondents] would have received consideration equivalent to what IA paid to acquire the [appellants] interests in Groupe Excellence rather than the amount they obtained from the [appellants]. At the hearing in this Court, the appellants did not show that this finding of fact, which is entitled to deference, was tainted by a palpable and overriding error (Housen, at para. 10; Grenier v. Grenier, 2011 QCCA 964, at para. 45 (CanLII); M.H. v. Axa Assurances inc., 2009 QCCA 2358, [2010] R.R.A. 15, at para. 19). Therefore, because the presumption in Baxter has not been rebutted, the damages owed to the respondents are equivalent to the difference between the sale price received by the appellants on the resale to IA and the price received by the respondents on the initial sale to the appellants.\nThe injury sustained by the respondents in the form of a lost gain thus amounts to $11,884,743, and the trial judges award, upheld on appeal, is solidary. I take note of the agreement reached by the respondents that the amount awarded would be divided in proportion to their shares in Groupe Excellence, that is, 62 percent for Mr. Rheaumes companies and 38 percent for Mr. Beaulnes companies. Accordingly, the damages are allocated as follows: $7,368,540.60 to Mr. Rheaumes companies and $4,516,202.40 to Mr. Beaulnes companies.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal, with costs.\n\tAppeal dismissed with costs.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants: IMK, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the respondents: Litige Forseti Inc., Montreal.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds Damages for Breach of Contractual Good Faith**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether the presidents of a group of companies breached their contractual obligation of good faith by failing to inform the majority shareholders of a prospective purchaser's interest in acquiring the group.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe complainants, Michel Rheaume and Andre Beaulne, were the majority shareholders of Groupe Excellence, a group of companies in the insurance industry. The accused, Antoine Ponce and Daniel Riopel, were the presidents of Groupe Excellence. The alleged offences were breaches of contractual and legal obligations, fiduciary obligations, and obligations to act in good faith, with loyalty and transparency. Specifically, the complainants alleged that the accused failed to inform them of the interest expressed by Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc. (IA) in acquiring Groupe Excellence, and instead purchased the shares themselves and resold them to IA at a substantial profit. The case involved the interpretation of various provisions of the Civil Code of Quebec, including articles 1375, 1434, and 1611.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began in the Superior Court of Quebec, where the respondents (shareholders) claimed damages against the appellants (presidents) for breach of contractual and legal obligations, fiduciary obligations, and obligations to act in good faith. The trial judge found that the appellants had breached their duties of good faith and loyalty, as well as their duty to inform the shareholders of IA's interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence. The judge assessed the injury resulting from the appellants' fault and ordered them to pay $11,884,743 in damages, equivalent to the profits made by the appellants on the resale of the shares to IA. The Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the trial judgment and the remedy awarded by the trial judge. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal, finding that the appellants had breached their contractual obligation of good faith and their duty to inform the shareholders of IA's interest in acquiring Groupe Excellence.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA contracting party's breach of the obligation of good faith in the performance of a contract can give rise to a presumption that the injury sustained by the other party is equivalent to the profits made by the party at fault, where the breach prevents the injured party from proving the injury sustained.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer concludes that the appeal should be dismissed. The majority opinion holds that the presidents' failure to inform the majority shareholders of the purchaser company's interest in acquiring the group was a breach of the requirements of good faith. This breach was rooted in the implied contractual obligation to inform under the Presidents Agreement, which was an incident to the contract according to its nature and in conformity with usage, equity, or law. The majority opinion further clarifies that disgorgement of profits is not available where there has simply been a breach of the obligation of good faith; in principle, it is available only where a person is charged with exercising powers in the interest of another. However, where a breach of the requirements of good faith prevents the aggrieved party from proving the injury sustained, it should be presumed that the injury is equivalent to the profits made by the party at fault.", "citation": "2023 SCC 25", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court  dismisses the appeal of two company presidents who breached their contractual duty  to act in good faith.</strong>In 2002, Antoine\u00a0Ponce and Daniel\u00a0Riopel became presidents of three Quebec companies in  the insurance industry that were grouped under the name \u201cGroupe Excellence\u201d. A \u201cPresidents\u2019  Agreement\u201d to that effect was entered into by the presidents and the companies\u2019  majority shareholders, Michel\u00a0Rh\u00e9aume and Andr\u00e9\u00a0Beaulne. The  Agreement gave the presidents significant benefits, including incentive pay. It  also formalized a business relationship between the parties that was based on  their commitment to work toward the common goal of ensuring the success of Groupe  Excellence, even with a view to a potential sale.In 2005, while the Agreement was  still in force, the presidents learned that a third party, Industrial Alliance  Insurance and Financial Services Inc., was interested in acquiring the  companies. Rather than revealing this to the shareholders, the presidents  decided to buy the whole of the shareholders\u2019 stakes themselves and then resell  them to the third party. This earned them a substantial profit.The shareholders blamed the  presidents for not disclosing the interest expressed by the third party in  acquiring the companies and, as a result, depriving them of that business  opportunity. They claimed that the presidents had breached their obligation to  perform the Agreement in accordance with the requirements of good faith. The  presidents answered that contractual loyalty did not require them to subordinate  their interests to those of the shareholders.In Quebec civil law, contractual  good faith is an implied obligation resulting from the combination of articles\u00a01375  and 1434 of the <em>Civil Code of Qu\u00e9bec </em>(<em>Code</em>). Article\u00a01375 states that  \u201c[t]he parties shall conduct themselves in good faith both at the time the  obligation arises and at the time it is performed or extinguished\u201d. Article\u00a01434  provides that a validly formed contract binds the parties \u201cas to what they have  expressed in it but also as to what is incident to it according to its nature  and in conformity with usage, equity or law\u201d.The Quebec Superior Court judge ruled  in the shareholders\u2019 favour. He found that the presidents had used their roles  to obtain information for their own benefit. By doing so, they had breached the  duties of honesty and loyalty they owed to Groupe Excellence as company directors,  duties that could be extended to the shareholders because of the Agreement. The  judge ordered the presidents to pay the shareholders approximately $12\u00a0million,  an amount equal to the profits earned on the resale of the group to the third  party. The presidents appealed that  decision to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which confirmed the trial judge\u2019s  conclusions. It specified, however, that the obligations breached by the  presidents, that is, the obligation to act in good faith and the obligation to  inform, were only contractual obligations arising from the Agreement. The  presidents appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The presidents\u2019 non-disclosure of the third party\u2019s interest in  acquiring the group was wrongful.</strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice\u00a0Kasirer  ruled that the presidents\u2019 failure to inform the shareholders of the third  party\u2019s interest in acquiring the group was a breach of the requirements of  good faith. The presidents breached contractual loyalty linked to good faith,  which was an implied obligation under the contract through the combined effect  of articles\u00a01434 and 1375 of the <em>Code</em>.  While the presidents did not have to subordinate their interests to those of  the shareholders, the requirements of good faith in the performance of the  Agreement included a duty for the presidents to inform the shareholders of the  third party\u2019s interest.Justice\u00a0Kasirer added that the  Agreement also involved an implied obligation to inform that required the  presidents to provide the shareholders with all information relevant to making  an informed decision about the sale of their shares. He specified that this implied  obligation flowed from the nature of the Agreement, which reflected the  presumed intention of the parties, in accordance with article\u00a01474 of the<em> Code</em>. In short, the Agreement was  intended to \u201cformalize a mutually beneficial business relationship between the [presidents]  and the shareholders\u201d.Since the presidents did not show  any palpable error in the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the shareholders\u2019 lost gain  was equivalent to the profits made by the presidents, Justice\u00a0Kasirer did  not interfere with the assessment of the damages to be paid to the shareholders."}, "10": {"original_text": "\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\nDon Johnson\tAppellant\nv.\nHis Majesty The King\tRespondent\nIndexed as: R. v.

We are all of the view that the majority in the Court of Appeal was correct to conclude that party liability was properly left to the jury by the trial judge (2022 ONCA 534, 162 O.R. (3d) 92). The evidence on the record provided party liability with an air of reality.\n[2]\tWe agree, however, with Nordheimer J.A., dissenting, that the trial judge erred in law in his instructions on party liability. In one part of the charge, the judge gave instructions that resembled co-principal liability, but said he was instructing on aiding. In other parts of the charge, the jury was given partially correct instructions on aiding. We share Nordheimer J.A.s view that the jury was never clearly told that the appellant would have needed to know that the principal intended to kill the victims in a planned and deliberate manner in order to be liable for first degree murder as an aider.\n[3]\tThat said, we would apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Abdullahi, 2023 SCC 19, at para. 33; R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para. 25).

The core allegations against Johnson were that he aided in the planned and deliberate killing of the victims, making him a party to the offence of first-degree murder. The applicable sections of the Criminal Code include those related to parties to an offence and section 229, which governs first-degree murder.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process began with Johnson's conviction of two counts of first-degree murder. Johnson appealed, claiming the trial judge erred in charging the jury on party liability. The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, with a dissenting judge finding insufficient evidentiary foundation and inadequate instructions on party liability. The Supreme Court of Canada agreed that the trial judge properly left party liability to the jury but erred in instructions, which resembled co-principal liability in some parts and partially correct instructions on aiding in others. However, the Court applied the curative proviso, deeming the errors harmless as there was no reasonable possibility the jury would have reached a different verdict. Ultimately, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the convictions.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA trial judge's error in instructing the jury on party liability can be considered harmless if there is no reasonable possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Kasirer concludes that the trial judge properly left party liability with the jury, as the evidence provided an air of reality to this aspect of the case. However, the majority agrees with the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in his instructions on party liability, failing to clearly convey that the appellant's knowledge of the principal's intent to kill was necessary for liability as an aider. Despite this error, the majority applies the curative proviso, finding that the errors were harmless and did not impact the jury's verdict, given the overlapping evidence for party and co-principal liability and the lack of undermining of the appellant's defence. Ultimately, the majority upholds the convictions, dismissing the appeal.", "citation": "2023 SCC 24", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms a double  murder conviction. </strong><strong> </strong>This appeal is about the instructions given to the  jury on criminal liability in the case of Don Johnson, who was tried and later  convicted in the shooting deaths of two brothers, aged 18 and 22. They were  shot in the stairwell of a Toronto apartment complex in February 2012. There were no eyewitnesses to the murders, and no security  cameras in the stairwell where the shootings occurred. However, surveillance  footage captured Mr. Johnson, the two brothers, and a fourth man heading  towards the stairwell just prior to the shooting. Video also showed Mr. Johnson  and the fourth man running away from the stairwell a short while later. In the  absence of footage from within the stairwell, it is impossible to know who,  between Mr. Johnson and the fourth man, killed the two brothers. Mr. Johnson was the only one charged in the deaths. At  trial, the Crown\u2019s theory was that Mr. Johnson murdered the first brother as  revenge for implicating him in a previous crime, and killed the second brother  in order to prevent him from avenging the first brother\u2019s death. Before the  jury started its deliberations, however, the trial judge instructed it on two  possible ways they could find Mr. Johnson guilty under Section 21 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: either as the \u201cprincipal\u201d  who shot the deceased, or as a party who \u201caided\u201d the fourth person in  committing the crimes, a concept known as \u201cparty liability.\u201d In terms of guilt,  there is no difference between being an aider or the principal to an offence,  as they are all equally culpable. The jury subsequently convicted Mr. Johnson  of two counts of first-degree murder. Mr. Johnson appealed his conviction to  the Court of Appeal for Ontario. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed his  appeal. It decided the trial judge had been correct to include the possibility  of Mr. Johnson\u2019s party liability as an alternative basis for conviction because  there was an \u2018air of reality\u2019 to the evidence in support of finding that Mr.  Johnson helped in the murders. According to the majority\u2019s review of the  evidence, Mr. Johnson had recruited the fourth person on the day of the  shooting, scoped out the location of the shooting in advance, and disposed of  his phone containing incriminating messages after the events. \u00a0\u00a0One judge disagreed. He said there was no air of  reality to the suggestion that, if Mr. Johnson was not the shooter, he aided  the actual shooter during the murders. In his view, entertaining this  alternative basis for liability despite weak evidence created the risk that one  or more jurors who were not convinced Mr. Johnson was the shooter could still  have convicted him on the basis that he was present during the murders and  could have helped in the outcome. He would have allowed the appeal, set aside  Mr. Johnson\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial. \u00a0Mr. Johnson appealed to the  Supreme Court of Canada. <strong>The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.\u00a0 \u00a0</strong>This means Mr. Johnson\u2019s  murder convictions are upheld and he will serve his sentence.

The IAA and the Regulations establish a complex information gathering and regulatory scheme, which is essentially two schemes in one. First, a discrete portion of the scheme  contained in ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA  deals with projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or outside Canada. Second, the balance of the scheme  made up of the IAAs remaining provisions and the Regulations  deals with designated projects as defined in the IAA.\n\tThe impact assessment process for designated projects can be divided into three main phases: the planning phase, the impact assessment phase and the decision-making phase. The planning phase focuses on initial information gathering. The proponent of a designated project must provide the Impact Assessment Agency with an initial project description. The Agency then consults with a number of parties, and decides whether the project requires an impact assessment. In the impact assessment phase, the proponent is required to provide the necessary information or studies to the entity conducting the assessment, which will be the Agency or its delegate. This phase culminates in the preparation of an assessment report, which sets out the effects that are likely to be caused by the carrying out of the designated project and indicates those that are adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and those that are adverse direct or incidental effects, terms defined in s. 2 of the IAA. The assessment report must also take into account numerous mandatory assessment factors listed in s. 22 of the IAA. The mandatory factors include changes to the environment or to health, social or economic conditions and the positive and negative consequences of these changes. Finally, during the decision-making phase, the decision maker must determine whether the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and the adverse direct or incidental effects are in the public interest. If the decision maker concludes that the effects in question are in the public interest, the Minister of the Environment must establish any condition that the Minister considers appropriate in relation to those effects.\n\tThe assessment process set forth in ss. 81 to 91 focuses on a narrow set of projects: physical activities carried out on federal lands or outside Canada in relation to a physical work that are not designated projects or physical activities designated by regulation, and physical activities designated under s. 87 or that are part of a designated class of physical activities. Sections 81 to 91 do not dictate an impact assessment process but rather require the federal authority that carries out or finances the project to decide if the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. If so, it must then be determined whether these effects are justified in the circumstances.\n\tAlbertas Lieutenant Governor in Council referred two questions to the provinces Court of Appeal. They asked whether the IAA was unconstitutional, in whole or in part, as being beyond the legislative authority of Parliament under the Constitution, and whether the Regulations were unconstitutional, in whole or in part, by virtue of purporting to apply to certain activities listed in Schedule 2 that relate to matters entirely within the legislative authority of the provinces under the Constitution. A majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that the IAA and the Regulations are ultra vires Parliament and therefore unconstitutional in their entirety. The Attorney General of Canada appeals as of right to the Court.\n\tHeld (Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. dissenting in part): The appeal should be allowed in part.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Cote, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: The reference questions should be answered in the affirmative: the federal impact assessment scheme is unconstitutional in part. Although the process set forth in ss. 81-91 of the IAA is constitutional and can be separated out, the balance of the scheme  that is, the designated projects portion  is ultra vires Parliament and thus unconstitutional. The designated projects scheme is ultra vires for two overarching reasons: it is not in pith and substance directed at regulating effects within federal jurisdiction as defined in the IAA because these effects do not drive the schemes decision-making functions, and the defined term effects within federal jurisdiction does not align with federal legislative jurisdiction. The overbreadth of these effects exacerbates the constitutional frailties of the schemes decision-making functions. Environmental protection remains one of todays most pressing challenges, and Parliament has the power to enact a scheme of environmental assessment to meet this challenge, but Parliament also has the duty to act within the enduring division of powers framework laid out in the Constitution.\n\tThe division of powers analysis has two steps: characterization and classification. At the characterization step, a court must consider the purpose and effects of the challenged law in order to identify its pith and substance. In order to determine a laws purpose, a court looks to both intrinsic evidence (the text of the law, its preamble, its purpose clause, if it has one, its title and its overall structure) and extrinsic evidence (the context of the law in question, the minutes of parliamentary committees and relevant government publications). In analyzing the effects of the challenged law, a court considers both legal effects (effects that flow directly from the provisions of the statute itself) and practical effects (effects that flow from the application of the statute). Finally, the court must characterize the pith and substance of the challenged law as precisely as possible, capturing the laws essential character in terms that are as precise as the law will allow. Characterization is distinct from classification, and it is imperative that the characterization and classification analyses be kept distinct. In determining the pith and substance of a law, courts must not refer to the heads of power contained within the Constitution Act, 1867. The characterization step of the analysis must focus exclusively on the pith and substance or dominant characteristic of the law. Only after precisely stating the matter to which the law relates should a court proceed to the classification phase of the analysis and consider specific heads of power.\n\tIn addition, the presumption of constitutionality is a cardinal principle of the Courts division of powers jurisprudence. According to this presumption, every legislative provision is presumed to be intra vires the level of government that enacted it, so a court should approach any question as to its validity on the assumption that it was validly enacted unless the party challenging it demonstrates otherwise. This presumption also functions as a principle of statutory interpretation: it directs a court to assume that a legislative body does not intend to exceed its powers under the Constitution. Therefore, when characterizing a challenged law, a court faced with competing, plausible characterizations should normally choose that one that would support the validity of the law. However, this presumption is not an impermeable shield that protects legislation from constitutional review by courts, nor can they employ the presumption of constitutionality to rewrite legislative text as they see fit in order to bring it into compliance with the Constitution. Courts cannot rely on the presumption of constitutionality to disregard a statute that speaks clearly and is ultra vires its enacting body, and the presumption does not displace the duty of courts to meaningfully review the constitutionality of legislation. Similarly, a court cannot circumvent its duty to meaningfully review the constitutionality of legislation by suggesting that, insofar as an administrative decision maker applies a law unconstitutionally, the application of that law may be judicially reviewed. The constitutional validity of a law and its administrative application are distinct concepts. Where a law is ultra vires and therefore unconstitutional, it cannot be saved by the prospect of administrative judicial review.\n\tAfter a court characterizes the matter of a law, it must determine the classes of subjects into which the matter falls by reference to the heads of power set out in s. 91 or 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. If the matter of law is properly classified as falling under a head of power assigned to the adopting level of government, the legislation is intra vires and valid. A law is classified based on its main thrust or dominant characteristic, and its secondary effects are not the focus of the validity analysis. The fact that a valid law incidentally touches on a head of power belonging to the other level of government does not affect its validity. \n\tClassifying environmental legislation presents a challenge because the environment is not a head of power under s. 91 or 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Environmental management cuts across many different areas of constitutional responsibility. Accordingly, neither level of government has exclusive jurisdiction over the whole of the environment or over all environmental assessment. Both levels of government can legislate in respect of certain aspects of environmental protection, including certain aspects of the environmental assessment of physical activities. Shared federal and provincial responsibility for environmental impact assessment is neither unusual nor unworkable; rather, it is a central feature of environmental decision making in Canada. This is consistent with the double aspect doctrine, which reflects the idea that the same fact situation can be regulated from different perspectives, one falling within s. 91 and the other falling within s. 92. Nonetheless, the double aspect doctrine must be applied with caution. First, not all fact situations have a double aspect, and each fact situation must be identified with precision. Environmental assessment of physical activities may or may not have a double aspect in relation to a specific project. Second, the fact that environmental assessment of physical activities may have a double aspect  with some elements falling within the legislative authority of each level of government  does not mean that it is an area of concurrent jurisdiction. If a fact situation can be regulated from both a federal perspective and a provincial perspective, it follows that each level of government can only enact laws which, in pith and substance, fall under its respective jurisdiction. The notion that both levels of government may legislate in respect of certain aspects of environmental protection, each pursuant to its own legislative competence, is also consistent with the principle of cooperative federalism. However, while flexibility and cooperation are important to federalism, they cannot override or modify the separation of powers. Courts may not, under the guise of cooperative federalism, erode the constitutional balance inherent in the Canadian federal state.\n\tIn the instant case, a careful analysis of the purpose and effects of the IAA and Regulations reveals that the scheme they establish has two distinct components: one dealing with designated projects and another addressing projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or outside Canada (ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA). The intrinsic and extrinsic evidence reveal that the scheme articulates a broad array of purposes, including protecting the environment and fostering sustainability; satisfying Canadas environmental obligations; assessing and regulating the broad effects of certain physical activities, such as effects on health, social and economic conditions; facilitating the participation of Indigenous peoples and the public; and establishing an efficient and transparent process. The legal and practical effects, considered together, reveal that the scheme establishes a comprehensive information-gathering and regulatory process. The pith and substance of the designated projects component is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social and economic impacts. The pith and substance of the component set out in ss. 81 to 91 is to direct the manner in which federal authorities that carry out or finance a project on federal lands or outside Canada assess the significant adverse environmental effects that the project may have.\n\tThere is no doubt that Parliament can enact impact assessment legislation that is directed at the federal aspects of projects. The breadth of these federal aspects will vary with the circumstances. Where Parliament is vested with jurisdiction to legislate in respect of a particular activity, it has broad discretion to regulate that activity and its effects, but Parliaments jurisdiction is more restricted where the activity falls outside of its legislative competence. In those cases, it can validly legislate only from the perspective of the federal aspects of the activity. The designated projects scheme treats all designated projects in the same way, regardless of whether Parliament is vested with broad jurisdiction over the activity itself or narrower jurisdiction over the activitys impacts on federal heads of power. And many of the physical activities to which the scheme applies are primarily regulated through the provincial legislatures powers over local works and undertakings or natural resources. Parliament can enact impact assessment legislation to regulate these projects from a federal perspective, so long as the regulation of federal aspects represents the dominant characteristic of the law.\n\tThe designated projects scheme is ultra vires, as its pith and substance exceeds the bounds of federal jurisdiction. This is so for two overarching reasons. First, the effects within federal jurisdiction do not drive the schemes decision-making functions. Consequently, the scheme is not in pith and substance directed at regulating these effects. There are four decision-making junctures embedded in the scheme: (i) the designation of physical activities as designated projects; (ii) the screening decision; (iii) the delineation of the scope of the impact assessment and the factors to be considered therein; and (iv) the public interest decision and resulting regulation and oversight. The scheme requires the decision maker to consider a host of factors but does not specify how those factors are to drive the ultimate conclusion. The schemes decision-making mechanism thereby loses its focus on regulating federal impacts. Instead, it grants the decision maker a practically untrammelled power to regulate projects qua projects, regardless of whether Parliament has jurisdiction to regulate a given physical activity in its entirety. In this respect, the screening decision and the public interest decision are constitutionally problematic. The screening decision as to whether an impact assessment is required for a particular project must be rooted in the possibility of adverse federal effects. However, because the decision maker must take into account an open-ended list of factors, all of seemingly equal importance, only two of them tied to federal jurisdiction, an impact assessment could be required for reasons other than, or not sufficiently tied to, the projects possible impacts on areas of federal jurisdiction. Similarly, the public interest decision must focus on the projects federal effects. However, because the mandatory public interest factors are not all confined to federal legislative competence, and because some factors are framed in relation to the assessment of the project as a whole rather than to the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction, a determination of whether adverse federal effects are in the public interest is transformed into a determination of whether the project as a whole is in the public interest.\n\tSecond, the defined term effects within federal jurisdiction does not align with federal legislative jurisdiction under s. 91, but rather, goes far beyond its limits. Its overbreadth manifests itself in two distinct ways. First, the definition of effects within federal jurisdiction is central to the schemes decision-making functions. Its overbreadth dilutes the focus at the key decision-making junctures, shifting it away from federal aspects and encompassing aspects that are within provincial jurisdiction. Second, the defined effects within federal jurisdiction result in impermissibly broad prohibitions. Due to the overbreadth of these defined effects, the conduct prohibited by s. 7 of the IAA extends beyond the range of conduct that Parliament can validly regulate pursuant to its assigned heads of power.\n\tThe component of the scheme set out in ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA is clearly intra vires Parliament. These provisions have not been challenged as unconstitutional. Furthermore, the process established by these provisions resembles the process upheld by the Court in Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3. Though the test for severance in division of powers cases is stringent, ss. 81 to 91 can be separated from the balance of the scheme and upheld as constitutional.\n\tPer Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. (dissenting in part): The IAA and the Regulations are intra vires in their entirety. The environment, by its very nature, is complex and diffuse. It is not a subject matter assigned to either Parliament or the provinces under the Constitution Act, 1867, but instead cuts across many areas of constitutional responsibility, some federal, some provincial, and all levels of government bear an all-important duty to use their powers to protect it. This shared responsibility is neither unusual nor unworkable in a federal state such as Canada. Rather, it reflects the Courts flexible approach to federalism, which recognizes that overlapping powers are unavoidable and intergovernmental cooperation is essential. Legislation must be approached from a posture of respect and presumed good faith on the part of legislatures, interpreted to comply with constitutional limits, and evaluated on the basis that the courts should favour the operation of statutes enacted by both levels of government whenever possible. Courts must presume that the regime will be administered in a constitutionally compliant manner and will not find legislation unconstitutional simply because it could conceivably be misused. Courts must also recognize and respect the constitutional bargain struck with respect to the exclusive catalogue of both federal and provincial powers.\n\tThe IAA builds on earlier federal environmental assessment regimes by establishing a multi-stage process to assess the effects of designated projects and protect against adverse effects in specified areas, unless allowing them would be in the public interest. The IAA contains two distinct schemes: a primary scheme addressing physical activities designated as designated projects, which takes up most of the IAA, and a secondary scheme in ss. 81 to 91 that applies to federal projects. There is no dispute that the secondary scheme in ss. 81 to 91 for projects funded by the federal government or carried out either on federal lands or outside Canada is intra vires Parliament.\n\tThe IAAs purpose and its practical and legal effects indicate that the pith and substance of the designated projects scheme is to establish an environmental assessment process to (1) assess the effects of physical activities or major projects on federal lands, Indigenous peoples, fisheries, migratory birds, and lands, air, or waters outside Canada or in provinces other than where a project is located, and (2) determine whether to impose restrictions on the project to safeguard against significant adverse federal effects, unless allowing those effects is in the public interest. This description of the pith and substance is more precise and highlights the critical role of the public interest decision-making process under the legislation. Based on that characterization, the public interest decision-making process under the IAA is constitutional, provided that it is anchored in adverse federal effects within Parliaments legislative jurisdiction over fisheries, navigable waters, Indians and lands reserved for Indians, criminal law, international and interprovincial rivers, and the national concern branch of the peace, order, and good government power.\n\tThe intrinsic and extrinsic evidence shows that the purpose of the IAA is to establish a transparent information-gathering and decision-making process about whether physical activities or designated projects have adverse federal effects, and if so, whether they should be permitted in the public interest, with or without conditions. The intrinsic evidence suggests that the information-gathering process and decision-making function are more specifically directed at whether the project under consideration has any adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and, if so, whether those effects are nonetheless in the public interest. This more precise purpose of the IAA is reflected in the long title of the statute, the text and structure of the legislation, and the IAAs stated purposes and preamble. Most importantly, the IAA is intended to protect the components of the environment and the health, social and economic conditions that are within the legislative authority of Parliament from adverse effects caused by a designated project. Extrinsic evidence confirms that the IAAs dominant purpose is to allow well-informed, transparent decisions as to whether allowing a projects adverse federal effects is in the public interest.\n\tThe IAAs legal effects support that conclusion. The main legal effects of the IAA are that: (1) projects are designated based on the likelihood they would cause non-trivial adverse federal effects; (2) the Agency decides whether to assess projects on the same basis; (3) the Agencys report must identify the adverse federal effects that a project is likely to cause and specify the extent to which those effects are significant; and (4) the ultimate public interest determination and any resulting conditions imposed on the project must be reasonable and proportionate, based on the adverse federal effects, the extent to which they are significant, and whether they can be mitigated. The statutory text, context and purpose, along with the applicable interpretive principles, show that Parliament did not intend to capture de minimis effects. Indeed, the significance threshold for adverse environmental effects permeates every major stage and decision taken under the IAA with respect to designated projects. Moreover, even if interpreting the IAA to capture de minimis effects were a reasonably available interpretation, the presumption of constitutionality demands that it be rejected in favour of a constitutionally-conforming interpretation. The IAAs practical effects, including potential delays or the expenditure of resources, may be important policy matters for Parliament, but they are irrelevant for constitutional purposes.\n\tParliament chose broad language for what constitutes an effect within federal jurisdiction under the IAA, but each of the adverse federal effects is properly classified as falling under Parliaments exclusive legislative jurisdiction. Each of the adverse federal effects anchor federal review and decision making under the IAA legislative scheme and fit within multiple heads of Parliaments legislative jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867. There are four decision-making junctures under the IAA: (a) designating physical activities as designated projects; (b) the screening decision as to whether a project should proceed to an impact assessment; (c) identifying the scope of the assessment and the factors to be considered; and (d) the public interest decision and resulting regulation and oversight. The adverse federal effects are not overbroad or misaligned with federal legislative jurisdiction.\n\tAt the first juncture, the designation process is driven by the potential for a physical activity to cause adverse federal effects. The designation process appropriately reflects the precautionary principle and the need to gather information at an early stage of an environmental impact assessment process, to properly inform federal decision making about whether a designated project may cause adverse federal effects.\n\tOnce a project is designated under the Regulations or by ministerial order, the project moves to the second juncture, at which the Agency decides whether to conduct an impact assessment of the designated project based on mandatory factors in s. 16(2) of the IAA. This screening decision is anchored in the possibility that the designated project will cause adverse federal effects. Each of the discretionary factors in ss. 16(2)(a), (b), and (c) is rooted in adverse federal effects, and s. 16(2)(d) may also reflect adverse federal effects, depending on the comments of the public or the Indigenous group consulted. Section 16(2)(e) is largely irrelevant for most provincially regulated projects, unless they occur on federal lands or relate to a federal government policy, program, or plan, in which case there is a clear nexus to federal jurisdiction. Section 16(2)(f) applies only where another jurisdiction conducts an assessment, in which case it is appropriate for the Agency to consider what the other jurisdiction has to say. Finally, s. 16(2)(g) is a residuary clause that allows the Agency to consider other factors it considers appropriate, but, like any discretionary power granted under legislation, it must be exercised reasonably and consistent with the object and purpose of the IAA, which is to prevent significant adverse environmental effects. Fidelity to the principles of cooperative federalism confirms the constitutionality of the discretion granted under s. 16. A court, in evaluating the constitutionality of the legislation as a whole, must favour, where possible, the ordinary operation of statutes enacted by both levels of government and must avoid blocking the application of measures enacted to promote the public interest, while the presumption of constitutionality requires a court to interpret the discretion granted under the legislation as being exercised in good faith and within constitutional bounds. Finally, if the Agency were to exercise its discretion to require a project with little or no potential for adverse federal impacts to proceed to an impact assessment, such a decision would be unreasonable and would not reflect the object and purpose of the IAA to prevent significant adverse federal environmental effects. Such a decision in a particular case, and based on an appropriate evidentiary record, would be subject to judicial review.\n\tAt the third juncture  the impact assessment phase  the Agency must take account of the broad range of factors in s. 22(1) of the IAA. When establishing the process for considering the environmental costs and benefits of a designated project that potentially has an adverse federal effect, Parliament is constitutionally entitled to instruct the decision maker to consider the full range of costs and benefits of the project. Some of the listed factors are effects that fall within federal jurisdiction, while others are intended to allow federal authorities to make a fully informed decision about the costs and benefits of proceeding with the project, with or without conditions, and about potential mitigation measures. This is essential for federal authorities to make an integrated decision as to the designated projects overall costs and benefits.\n\tAt the final juncture, the decision-making phase requires a cost-benefit analysis based on public interest factors identified in s. 63 of the IAA, including the extent to which the designated project contributes to sustainability, has adverse federal effects that are significant as indicated in the impact assessment report, has an impact on any Indigenous group or adverse effects on the rights of Indigenous peoples protected under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and hinders or contributes to the Government of Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and climate change commitments. Section 63 requires a reasonable and proportionate weighing of the public interest factors in deciding whether a project may proceed, and if so, whether any conditions should be imposed. This involves a cost-benefit balancing of the adverse federal effects and all other relevant public interest considerations relating to the project. As long as the public interest decision is anchored in federal jurisdiction based on adverse federal effects, federal authorities are entitled to make an integrated and proportionate decision that weighs the costs and benefits of allowing the project to proceed, and, if it is allowed to proceed, whether conditions should be imposed. When there is a clear impact on an area of federal jurisdiction, the decision whether to allow the project to go ahead in spite of the impact can be an integrated decision that takes into account issues that are within provincial jurisdiction. It does not serve to protect provincial jurisdiction to force the federal decision to be made in a partially blind manner. Nor can the decision be limited to whether adverse federal effects are in the public interest, without considering other factors. Adverse federal effects will rarely, if ever, be in the public interest. For a project to be in the public interest, its adverse federal effects need to be outweighed by other positive benefits of the project, so the federal decision maker must consider the socio-economic benefits that will flow from a project and that will outweigh the negative impacts. It cannot be constitutional for federal authorities to consider whether a project has economic benefits, but unconstitutional for them to consider whether the same project promotes sustainable development.\n\tThe defined effects within federal jurisdiction serve as triggers or gateways for the prohibitions under s. 7 of the IAA and for the application of the designated projects scheme of the IAA. Parliament chose broad language for what constitutes an effect within federal jurisdiction under the IAA, but each effect, as defined, is properly classified as falling under Parliaments exclusive legislative jurisdiction. None of the adverse federal effects is constitutionally overbroad. If Canada ever attempts to treat a projects greenhouse gas emissions as an effect within federal jurisdiction, then whether an individual projects greenhouse gas emissions, in context of the global scale of the climate crisis, may cause non-trivial changes to the environment is best assessed through case-specific judicial review. \n\tFinally, the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity does not apply. Characterizing a project as provincial is not a basis to reject the application of federal environmental assessment legislation  provincial works or undertakings are not shielded from otherwise valid federal legislation.\nCases Cited\nBy Wagner C.J.\n\tApplied: Friends of the Oldman River Society v.

The Canadian judiciary, in tandem with the other branches of government, has an important role to play in protecting the right to a safe environment (Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031, at para. 55 (emphasis deleted), quoting the Law Reform Commission of Canada, Crimes Against the Environment (1985), Working Paper 44, at p. 8). At the same time, as the guardian of the Constitution, the judiciary has a vital role to play in ensuring that legislative efforts aimed at environmental protection comport with Canadas constitutional framework. \nThree decades ago, this Court acknowledged that the protection of the environment has become one of the major challenges of our time (Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 16). In a long line of cases since then, this Court has affirmed that both Parliament and the provincial legislatures have the ability to enact laws to address various facets of environmental protection, including schemes of environmental assessment (see, e.g., Oldman River; R. v. Hydro-Quebec, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 213; MiningWatch Canada v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans), 2010 SCC 2, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 6; Quebec (Attorney General) v. Moses, 2010 SCC 17, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 557; References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11 (References re GGPPA)). But this Court has also affirmed that each level of government must confine its legislative efforts to its own constitutional sphere. \nThis appeal is not about whether Parliament can enact legislation to protect the environment. It is clear that Parliament can do so under the heads of power assigned to it in the Constitution Act, 1867. Rather, this appeal calls upon this Court to evaluate the constitutional validity of the specific legislative scheme Parliament has enacted to protect the environment from certain human activities: the Impact Assessment Act, S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 1 (IAA), and the related Physical Activities Regulations, SOR/2019-285 (Regulations). This Court must ensure that, in its laudable pursuit of environmental protection and sustainability, Parliament has not overstepped its constitutional limits. \nI emphasize at the outset that, while environmental protection is a fundamental Canadian value, it must always comport with the constitutional division of powers. Because environmental protection cuts across many different areas of constitutional responsibility, it necessarily touches on both federal and provincial legislative powers. Given the sweeping nature of environmental regulation, division of powers disputes in the environmental context must be approached with [g]reat sensitivity (see Hydro-Quebec, at para. 154). Respect for the division of powers drives the enactment of robust environmental protection legislation and facilitates cooperation between the two levels of government. \nHaving carefully considered the complex legislative scheme at issue in this appeal, I conclude that it is unconstitutional in part. As I will explain, the scheme is essentially two schemes in one. First, a discrete portion of the scheme  contained in ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA  deals with projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or outside Canada. In pith and substance, this portion of the scheme directs the manner in which federal authorities assess the significant adverse environmental effects that such projects may have. This portion of the scheme is clearly intra vires. \nSecond, the balance of the scheme  made up of the IAAs remaining provisions and the Regulations  deals with designated projects as defined in the IAA. The pith and substance of this designated projects scheme is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social and economic impacts. In my view, Parliament has plainly overstepped its constitutional competence in enacting this designated projects scheme. This scheme is ultra vires for two overarching reasons. First, it is not in pith and substance directed at regulating effects within federal jurisdiction as defined in the IAA because these effects do not drive the schemes decision-making functions. Second, I do not accept Canadas contention that the defined term effects within federal jurisdiction aligns with federal legislative jurisdiction. The overbreadth of these effects exacerbates the constitutional frailties of the schemes decision-making functions. \nEnvironmental protection remains one of todays most pressing challenges. To meet this challenge, Parliament has the power to enact a scheme of environmental assessment. Parliament also has the duty, however, to act within the enduring division of powers framework laid out in the Constitution.\nThese reasons will proceed as follows. I will begin by reviewing the evolution of federal environmental assessment as well as the structure and operation of the impugned scheme. With this background in mind, I will summarize the reasons of the Court of Appeal of Alberta and frame the issue on appeal. I will then analyze the constitutional validity of the scheme and, finally, address two additional discrete issues raised in this appeal. \nThe Evolution of Federal Environmental Assessment\nThe Nature and Purpose of Environmental Assessment\nFor decades, both the federal and provincial governments have engaged in environmental assessment. Canadas first environmental assessments were carried out in the 1970s, and by the 1990s, most Canadian jurisdictions had enacted mandatory environmental assessment legislation (M. Doelle and C. Tollefson, Environmental Law: Cases and Materials (3rd ed. 2019), at p. 593). Before I canvass the evolution of Canadian legislation in this area, it will be useful to consider the nature and purpose of environmental assessment.\nIn Oldman River, this Court described environmental assessment as a planning tool that is . . . an integral component of sound decision-making (p. 71). The basic idea of environmental assessment is that certain proposed activities should be scrutinized in advance from the perspective of their possible environmental consequences (J. Benidickson, Environmental Law (5th ed. 2019), at p. 257). Accordingly, environmental assessment processes are prospective in nature; they seek to anticipate, prevent or reduce environmental impacts of proposed new activities rather than try to manage the impacts of existing activities (Doelle and Tollefson, at p. 593; see also O. P. Dwivedi et al., Sustainable Development and Canada: National & International Perspectives (2001), at p. 157). \nAs many of the interveners in this appeal highlighted, the environment is of concern not only to the federal government but also to the provincial governments and to communities from coast to coast. There exists a great diversity of provincial environmental assessment legislation across the country. At the federal level, environmental assessment legislation has evolved substantially over the last four decades. I turn now to this evolution.\nA History of Federal Environmental Assessment\nAs a prelude to evaluating the constitutional validity of the scheme, it will be helpful to situate it within the broader history of federal environmental assessment frameworks. In the sections that follow, I canvass the evolution of federal environmental assessment since the 1980s. Two key trends emerge from this discussion. \nFirst, over time, the federal environmental assessment process has undergone a dramatic shift from employing a decision-based trigger to employing an effects- or project-based trigger. The first iterations of the process required an environmental assessment when the federal government had a decision-making responsibility in respect of a particular activity. This responsibility arose under separate federal legislation, such as provisions of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, or Navigable Waters Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-22, related to the granting of permits. In contrast, more recent iterations of the environmental assessment process have applied on the basis of the types of projects involved or the types of effects these projects may cause.\nThe second key trend is evident from the title of the impugned statute: Impact Assessment Act. Whereas previous federal enactments focused on environmental effects specifically, the current scheme focuses on impacts of various kinds  including but not limited to environmental impacts. Although the environment was already understood broadly under previous schemes, this recalibrated focus makes it clear that social, health and economic impacts are also included in the assessment process.\nThe federal environmental assessment process traces its roots back to 1973, when the federal Cabinet approved a recommendation for an Environmental Assessment and Review Process that was to apply to all federal development proposals (Dwivedi et al., at p. 157). Then, in 1984, the federal government issued the Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order, SOR/84-467 (Guidelines Order), through an order in council, to set out and clarify roles, responsibilities and procedures under the Environmental Assessment and Review Process (Dwivedi et al., at p. 158). I will begin my review of the federal assessment schemes with this Guidelines Order.\nThe 1984 Guidelines Order\nThe goal of the Guidelines Order was to ensure that the environmental effects of all proposals for which the federal government had a decision-making responsibility were considered fully and as early in the planning process as possible (J. B. Hanebury, Environmental Impact Assessment in the Canadian Federal System (1991), 36 McGill L.J. 962, at p. 969). The Guidelines Order applied to any proposed initiative, undertaking or activity for which the Government of Canada has a decision making responsibility (s. 2 proposal).\nUnder the Guidelines Orders approach, a federal department would conduct an initial assessment of a proposal for which it was the decision-making authority. If the department determined that the project was likely to have significant environmental effects, then it would refer the project to the Minister of the Environment, who in turn would request an independent assessment from the Federal Environmental Assessment and Review Office. That office would establish a panel, which would ultimately submit an advisory report (Dwivedi et al., at p. 158; see also Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office, The Federal Environmental Assessment and Review Process (1987), at pp. 2-4). \nWhile there was initially some debate as to the binding force and constitutional validity of the Guidelines Order, this Court held in Oldman River that it was mandatory in nature and intra vires Parliament. Justice La Forest, writing for the Court on the vires issue, interpreted the Guidelines Order as applying where the federal government has an affirmative regulatory duty pursuant to an Act of Parliament which relates to the proposed initiative, undertaking or activity (p. 47). He reasoned that [i]t cannot have been intended that the Guidelines Order would be invoked every time there [was] some potential environmental effect on a matter of federal jurisdiction (p. 47). Rather, the Guidelines Order has merely added to the matters that federal decision makers should consider (p. 71).\nCanadian Environmental Assessment Act (1992)\nThe Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, S.C. 1992, c. 37 (CEAA 1992), was enacted in 1992 and came into force in 1994 and 1995. Like the Guidelines Order, the operation of the CEAA 1992 was triggered by exercises of federal decision-making responsibility, including where the federal government proposed a project, where it provided financial assistance to a project, where the project involved federal lands, or where the federal government issued a permit or authorization for a project (s. 5(1)). \nAlthough there were similarities between the Guidelines Order and the CEAA 1992, the latter nonetheless introduced major changes to the federal environmental assessment regime. A key innovation of the CEAA 1992 was that the bounds and steps of the federal environmental assessment regime were now set out in legislation. Placing the federal scheme on statutory footing made the environmental assessment process less susceptible to interference by government without the approval of Parliament (Doelle and Tollefson, at p. 597; see also R. B. Gibson, The Major Deficiencies Remain: A Review of the Provisions and Limitations of Bill C-19, an Act to Amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (2001), 11 J.E.L.P. 83, at p. 85).\nThe scope of environmental assessment under the CEAA 1992 was broad. The CEAA 1992 defined environmental effect as including any change that the project may cause in the environment as well as any health and socioeconomic effects of such a change (s. 2(1)). Assessments considered a variety of factors, including comments from the public, mitigation measures, the purpose of the project and alternative ways of carrying out the project (s. 16). These assessments could take one of four forms: screening, comprehensive study, panel review and mediation (s. 14; see also A. Koehl, EA and Climate Change Mitigation (2010), 21 J.E.L.P. 181, at p. 185). Projects that did not require a specific federal decision could be referred to a mediator or review panel if the Minister of the Environment was of the opinion that the project might cause significant adverse effects in another province, outside of Canada or on federal lands (ss. 46 to 48).\nCanadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012\nThe CEAA 1992 was repealed and replaced in 2012 as part of omnibus budget legislation (Jobs, Growth and Long-term Prosperity Act, S.C. 2012, c. 19 (assented to on June 29, 2012)). In at least five respects, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 52 (CEAA 2012), represented the next generation of federal environmental assessment. \nFirst, the CEAA 2012 introduced a new triggering process that dictated when that statute applied (M. Doelle, CEAA 2012: The End Of Federal EA As We Know It? (2012), 24 J.E.L.P. 1, at p. 3). The CEAA 2012 was the first federal assessment scheme that involved a project-based approach. It applied to projects that were designated by regulations or ministerial order (ss. 2(1) designated project, 14(2) and 84(a); Regulations Designating Physical Activities, SOR/2012-147). This project-based scheme created an out unless included model; only designated projects were subject to the CEAA 2012, and all other projects were excluded. \nSecond, the CEAA 2012 granted the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency broad discretion to screen designated projects for an assessment (s. 10). As a result, not all designated projects were automatically subject to an assessment. Indeed, far fewer environmental assessments were conducted under the CEAA 2012 than under the former scheme (Doelle and Tollefson, at pp. 621-22; R. B. Gibson, In full retreat: the Canadian governments new environmental assessment law undoes decades of progress (2012), 30 Impact Assess. and Proj. Apprais. 179, at pp. 181-82). \nThird, the CEAA 2012 significantly narrowed the scope of federal environmental assessments. The CEAA 2012 limited the definition of environmental effects to a small number of environmental components listed in s. 5. Some commentators have written that this was perhaps the most fundamental change to the federal environmental assessment process (Doelle, at p. 11; Gibson (2012), at p. 182). \nFourth, the CEAA 2012 reinvented the decision-making phase of the environmental assessment process. Following the assessment, the decision maker (typically the Minister of the Environment, the National Energy Board or the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission) would decide whether the project was likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects (s. 52(1)). If it was, then the matter would be referred to the Governor in Council to decide whether the effects were justified in the circumstances (s. 52(2) to (4)). Conditions could be imposed if the project was not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects or if the significant adverse environmental effects it was likely to cause were justified in the circumstances (s. 53). Section 52(1) and (4), which grant the authority to make the decisions, did not enumerate the factors that could or had to be considered in the exercise of that authority. \nFinally, the CEAA 2012 contained a secondary regime for projects carried out on federal lands or outside Canada (ss. 66 to 72; M. Z. Olszynski, Impact Assessment, in W. A. Tilleman et al., eds., Environmental Law and Policy (4th ed. 2020), 453, at p. 473). The provisions in question did not set out a formal assessment process. Rather, the relevant federal authorities had to be satisfied that no significant adverse environmental effects were likely or, if they were likely, that they were justified in the circumstances. This process harkened back to the Guidelines Order and the CEAA 1992, which similarly required federal decision makers to consider adverse environmental effects in discharging their responsibilities in respect of certain activities.\nMany of the significant innovations introduced by the CEAA 2012 have been retained in the impugned statute. I note, as did the court below, that the provinces did not challenge the constitutionality of the CEAA 2012, and the only challenge to its constitutionality was addressed briefly and in the alternative (2022 ABCA 165, 470 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at para. 93; R.F., at para. 45; but see Taseko Mines Limited v. Canada (Environment), 2017 FC 1100, 15 C.E.L.R. (4th) 53, at para. 6). \nIAA \nThe IAA was the result of a four-year review of the federal environmental assessment process. The federal government established the Expert Panel for the Review of Environmental Assessment Processes, which recommended a major overhaul of the CEAA 2012 (Building Common Ground: A New Vision for Impact Assessment in Canada (2017), at pp. 2-7; Olszynski, at p. 468; see also Natural Resources Canada, Environmental and Regulatory Reviews: Discussion Paper (2017) (2017 Discussion Paper), at p. 7). Whether the IAA actually reflects the recommendations for reform has, however, been questioned (see, e.g., Olszynski, at p. 469). \nThe IAA was enacted as Part 1 of An Act to enact the Impact Assessment Act and the Canadian Energy Regulator Act, to amend the Navigation Protection Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 28, assented to June 21, 2019. The Governor in Council has made regulations under the IAA, including the Regulations at issue in this appeal. \nI turn now to the basic architecture and operation of the IAA and the Regulations.\nThe Legislative Scheme\nThe IAA and the Regulations establish a complex information gathering and regulatory scheme. To understand the scheme, one must have a grasp of both its general framework and its operation. I agree with the Court of Appeals observation that the IAA is essentially two acts in one (para. 190). The bulk of the IAA covers physical activities that are designated as designated projects. Sections 81 to 91 of the IAA, however, establish a secondary scheme covering activities on federal lands or outside Canada that are not designated as designated projects. \nI will begin with the designated projects scheme and provide an overview of its three-phase impact assessment process. I will then turn to ss. 81 to 91 and summarize the operation of this secondary scheme.\nThe Designated Projects Regulatory Scheme\nLike its predecessor, the IAA applies to designated projects, which are defined in s. 2 as physical activities . . . carried out in Canada or on federal lands [that] are designated by regulations made under paragraph 109(b) or designated in an order made by the Minister under subsection 9(1). This includes any physical activity that is incidental to those physical activities (s. 2). \nPursuant to s. 109(b), the Governor in Council has made the Regulations, which are sometimes called the Project List because they set out a list of designated physical activities. This Project List includes activities that, in the governments view, are major projects with the greatest potential for adverse effects on areas of federal jurisdiction related to the environment (Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR/2019-285, Canada Gazette, Part II, vol. 153, No. 17, August 21, 2019). \nIn addition, pursuant to s. 9(1), the Minister may designate a physical activity that is not prescribed by regulations . . . if, in his or her opinion, either the carrying out of that physical activity may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or adverse direct or incidental effects (two defined terms, to which I will return), or public concerns related to those effects warrant the designation. The IAA imposes some limitations on ministerial designation, including that it must occur before the carrying out of the physical activity has substantially begun (s. 9(7)(a)). \nThe impact assessment process for designated projects can be divided into three main phases: the planning phase, the impact assessment phase and the decision-making phase. These phases are followed by ongoing regulation in the form of monitoring, binding conditions and follow-up programs. Below, I provide a broad overview of each phase.\nThe Planning Phase\nThe planning phase focuses on initial information gathering. The introduction of this phase represented a major change from previous practice (Expert Panel, at pp. 58-61; R. Northey, A Guide to Canadas Impact Assessment Act (2023 ed.), at pp. 10-14).  \nThe proponent of a designated project must provide the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (Agency) with an initial project description that includes the information prescribed by regulations (s. 10(1); Information and Management of Time Limits Regulations, SOR/2019-283, Sch. 1). The Agency then consults with a number of parties  including Indigenous groups, other jurisdictions and the public  and provides the proponent with a summary of issues with respect to the project (IAA, ss. 11 to 13 and 14(1)). The proponent responds by way of a notice setting out how it intends to address the issues and providing a detailed project description (s. 15(1)). \nThe planning phase culminates in the Agencys decision as to whether the project requires an impact assessment (s. 16). This is referred to as the screening decision. In making this decision, the Agency must consider the factors set out in s. 16(2). I will review this decision-making function in greater detail in the course of my analysis. If the Agency decides that the project requires an assessment, it must provide the proponent with a notice of commencement setting out the required information or studies (s. 18(1)(a)). \nMoreover, if the Minister, before the notice of commencement is issued, forms the view that it is clear that the designated project would cause unacceptable environmental effects within federal jurisdiction, then the Minister must provide the proponent with a written notice to that effect (s. 17(1)). This notice does not stop the impact assessment process.\nThe Impact Assessment Phase\nIn the impact assessment phase, the proponent is required to provide the necessary information or studies to the entity conducting the assessment, which will be the Agency or its delegate (ss. 25 to 29). Assessments may be referred to a review panel or may be substituted for another jurisdictions assessment process if appropriate (ss. 31(1), 33(1) and 36(1)). \nThe assessment phase culminates in the preparation of an assessment report, which must set out the effects that . . . are likely to be caused by the carrying out of the designated project and indicate those that are adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and those that are adverse direct or incidental effects (s. 28(3)). These two subcategories of effects are central to the schemes operation, and I will therefore set out the relevant definitions in full. The umbrella term, effects, is defined as follows (s. 2):\neffects means, unless the context requires otherwise, changes to the environment or to health, social or economic conditions and the positive and negative consequences of these changes.\nThe subcategories of effects  direct or incidental effects and effects within federal jurisdiction  are defined as follows in s. 2:\ndirect or incidental effects means effects that are directly linked or necessarily incidental to a federal authoritys exercise of a power or performance of a duty or function that would permit the carrying out, in whole or in part, of a physical activity or designated project, or to a federal authoritys provision of financial assistance to a person for the purpose of enabling that activity or project to be carried out, in whole or in part.\n\neffects within federal jurisdiction means, with respect to a physical activity or a designated project,\n\n(a) a change to the following components of the environment that are within the legislative authority of Parliament:\n\n(i) fish and fish habitat, . . .\n\n(ii) aquatic species, . . .\n\n(iii) migratory birds, . . . and\n\n(iv) any other component of the environment that is set out in Schedule 3;\n\n(b) a change to the environment that would occur\n\n(i) on federal lands,\n\n(ii) in a province other than the one where the physical activity or the designated project is being carried out, or\n\n(iii) outside Canada;\n\n(c) with respect to the Indigenous peoples of Canada, an impact  occurring in Canada and resulting from any change to the environment  on\n\n(i) physical and cultural heritage,\n\n(ii) the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes, or\n\n(iii) any structure, site or thing that is of historical, archaeological, paleontological or architectural significance;\n\n(d) any change occurring in Canada to the health, social or economic conditions of the Indigenous peoples of Canada; and\n\n(e) any change to a health, social or economic matter that is within the legislative authority of Parliament that is set out in Schedule 3.\nThe assessment report must also take into account the factors listed in s. 22 of the IAA. I will return to these mandatory assessment factors in the course of my analysis. For now, I note that this list expands upon the previous list of assessment factors under s. 19 of the CEAA 2012. For example, the IAA requires a consideration of alternative means of carrying out the designated project and any alternatives to the designated project, whereas the CEAA 2012 only required consideration of the former (IAA, s. 22(1)(e) and (f); CEAA 2012, s. 19(1)(g)). Indigenous knowledge concerning the designated project was previously a discretionary consideration, but it is now mandatory (CEAA 2012, s. 19(3); IAA, s. 22(1)(g)). Finally, the IAA introduces a few new factors, including the extent to which the designated project contributes to sustainability and the extent to which the effects of the designated project hinder or contribute to the Government of Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and its commitments in respect of climate change (s. 22(1)(h) and (i)).\nThe Decision-Making Phase\nFinally, the impact assessment process advances to the decision-making phase. The identity of the decision maker will depend on which entity conducted the impact assessment. Where the assessment was conducted by the Agency, the decision maker is the Minister (s. 60(1)(a)). Where it was conducted by a review panel, or where the Minister exercises the discretion to refer the decision to the Governor in Council, the decision maker is the Governor in Council (ss. 60(1)(b), 61(1) and 62). The decision maker must determine whether the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction  and the adverse direct or incidental effects  that are indicated in the report are, in light of the factors referred to in section 63 and the extent to which those effects are significant, in the public interest (s. 60(1)(a) and (b)). If the decision maker concludes that the effects in question are in the public interest, the Minister must establish any condition that the Minister considers appropriate in relation to those effects (s. 64(1) and (2)).\nSections 81 to 91: Non-Designated Projects on Federal Lands or Outside Canada\nAs discussed, the CEAA 2012s secondary scheme for projects on federal lands or outside Canada has been retained in the IAA, with some modifications (ss. 81 to 91; Olszynski, at p. 473; Northey, at pp. 27-28; J. Kneen, Impact Assessment for Projects on Federal Lands and Outside Canada: The Federal Projects Process, in M. Doelle and A. J. Sinclair, eds., The Next Generation of Impact Assessment: A Critical Review of the Canadian Impact Assessment Act (2021), 388, at pp. 391-92; see also CEAA 2012, ss. 66 to 72). \nThe assessment process set forth in ss. 81 to 91 is materially different from that contained in the balance of the IAA. The most significant difference is that the ss. 81 to 91 regime focuses on a narrow set of projects. A project under this portion of the scheme is defined as follows in s. 81: \nproject means\n\n(a) a physical activity that is carried out on federal lands or outside Canada in relation to a physical work and that is not a designated project or a physical activity designated by regulations made under paragraph 112(1)(a.2); and\n\n(b) a physical activity that is designated under section 87 or that is part of a class of physical activities that is designated under that section.\nThe second major difference is that ss. 81 to 91 do not dictate an impact assessment process but rather require the federal authority that carries out or finances the project to decide if the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects (ss. 84 to 89). This retains the CEAA 2012s focus on significant adverse effects. By contrast, the designated projects portion of the scheme has done away with this significance threshold, though the significance of adverse effects remains a consideration in the assessment and decision-making phases (ss. 59(2) and 60(1)). If the non-designated project on federal lands or outside Canada is found to be likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, it must then be determined whether these effects are justified in the circumstances (s. 90).\nThe Judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta, 2022 ABCA 165, 470 D.L.R. (4th) 1\nAlbertas Lieutenant Governor in Council referred two questions to the provinces Court of Appeal: \nIs Part 1 of An Act to enact the Impact Assessment Act and the Canadian Energy Regulator Act, to amend the Navigation Protection Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2019, c. 28 unconstitutional, in whole or in part, as being beyond the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada under the Constitution of Canada? \n\nIs the Physical Activities Regulations, SOR/2019-285, unconstitutional in whole or in part by virtue of purporting to apply to certain activities listed in Schedule 2 thereof that relate to matters entirely within the legislative authority of the Provinces under the Constitution of Canada? [para. 4]\nA majority of the Court of Appeal (Fraser C.J.A. and Watson and McDonald JJ.A.) concluded that the IAA and the Regulations are ultra vires the federal government and therefore unconstitutional in their entirety. Justice Strekaf concurred in the result but did not sign on to the portion of the majoritys reasons dealing with de facto expropriation (para. 435). Justice Greckol, writing in dissent, concluded that both the IAA and the Regulations are a valid exercise of Parliaments authority to legislate in respect of the environment (para. 443).\nThe majority considered s. 92A of the Constitution Act, 1867, which it referred to as the Resource Amendment. It held that s. 92A assures exclusive provincial jurisdiction over the exploration, development, management and conservation of the provinces . . . natural resources and that approval of natural resource projects is therefore vested exclusively in the province that owns the resources (paras. 72 and 81 (emphasis deleted)). The majority referred to projects that are wholly within a province and are primarily regulated by the province as intra-provincial projects. \nThe majority then turned to the two-step constitutional validity analysis. At the characterization step, the majority concluded that the pith and substance of the IAA and the Regulations is the establishment of a federal impact assessment and regulatory regime that subjects all activities designated by the federal executive to an assessment of all their effects and federal oversight and approval (para. 372). The majority held that this matter intrudes fatally into provincial jurisdiction and the provinces proprietary rights as owners of their public lands and natural resources (para. 372). \nTurning to classification, the majority concluded that the matter of the scheme does not fall under any of the federal heads of power relied upon by Canada: sea coast and inland fisheries (s. 91(12) of the Constitution Act, 1867), imperial treaties (s. 132), Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians (s. 91(24)) and the national concern branch of the peace, order and good government (POGG) power (s. 91). Nor does the matter fall under the federal heads of power proposed by the interveners: trade and commerce (s. 91(2)) and the criminal law power (s. 91(27)). Instead, the majority held that the matter of the scheme, when applied to intra-provincial designated projects, falls squarely within multiple heads of provincial power, including the development and management of natural resources (s. 92A) and property and civil rights in the province (s. 92(13)). \nThe majority thus found the IAA and the Regulations to be ultra vires Parliament and unconstitutional in their entirety. Canada argued before the Court of Appeal that the IAA and the Regulations are not severable and must therefore stand or fall as a whole. The majority agreed and noted that it would not be practical to sever offending provisions from the IAA or to sever the Regulations from the IAA (para. 426). \nFinally, the majority considered the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. It held, in the alternative, that if the scheme were valid, then the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity would apply to protect the core of relevant provincial heads of power (para. 430).\nThe dissenting justice characterized the pith and substance of the IAA and the Regulations as the establishment of a federal environmental assessment regime that facilitates planning and information gathering with respect to specific projects to inform decision-making, cooperatively with other jurisdictions, as to whether the project should be authorized to proceed on the basis that identified adverse environmental effects purported to be within federal jurisdiction are in the public interest (para. 593).\nThe dissenting justice concluded that this matter can be classified under a number of federal heads of power. She found that each of the effects within federal jurisdiction defined in the IAA falls within Parliaments legislative authority (paras. 605-6 and 611). In addition, she rejected the majoritys characterization of the public interest determination as a federal veto power (para. 717). Instead, she concluded that the IAA is designed to facilitate interjurisdictional cooperation rather than creating a competitive veto (paras. 723 and 730). The Attorney General of Canada appeals as of right to the Court.\nIssue on Appeal\nThe sole issue in this appeal is whether the IAA and the Regulations are ultra vires Parliament. I will consider the validity of the IAA and the Regulations together as they are tightly linked and function as a unified scheme (see MiningWatch, at para. 31). The Regulations complete the statutory scheme by specifying the scope of the IAAs application to certain designated projects; they are indispensable to the IAAs characterization and classification (see R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 463, at p. 481). I note that the Court of Appeal adopted the same approach in its analysis (paras. 165 (majority) and 554 (dissent)). \nThe division of powers analysis has two steps: characterization and classification. I will begin by canvassing the principles governing the characterization inquiry.\nStep 1: Characterization\nThe Governing Principles\nThe Pith and Substance Analysis\nAt the characterization step, a court must consider the purpose and effects of the challenged law in order to identify its pith and substance (Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580 (P.C.), at p. 587; Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 14, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 693 (Quebec (Attorney General) 2015), at paras. 28-29; Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation, 2018 SCC 48, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 189, at para. 86; References re GGPPA, at para. 51). The objective of the characterization inquiry is to identify the precise matter to which the law in question relates (Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 26). \nIn order to determine a laws purpose, a court looks to both intrinsic and extrinsic evidence (Reference re Firearms Act (Can.), 2000 SCC 31, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783, at para. 17; Canadian Western Bank, at para. 27; Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, 2020 SCC 17, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 283, at para. 34; References re GGPPA, at para. 51). Intrinsic evidence refers to material contained within the four corners of the law in question, including the text of the law, its preamble, its purpose clause, if it has one, its title and its overall structure. Extrinsic evidence refers to evidence that speaks to the context of the law in question, such as Hansard debates, the minutes of parliamentary committees and relevant government publications.\nIn analyzing the effects of the challenged law, a court considers both legal and practical effects. Legal effects are those effects that flo[w] directly from the provisions of the statute itself, while practical effects are those side effects [that] flow from the application of the statute which are not direct effects of the provisions of the statute itself (Kitkatla Band v. British Columbia (Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture), 2002 SCC 31, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 146, at para. 54; see also Morgentaler, at pp. 482-83; References re GGPPA, at para. 51).\nFinally, the court must characterize the pith and substance of the challenged law as precisely as possible (References re GGPPA, at para. 52). If the pith and substance is characterized in overly broad terms, then there is a danger of its being superficially connected with a power of the other level of government (Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 2010 SCC 61, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 457, at para. 190). In other words, an imprecise formulation of the pith and substance of the law can infect the subsequent classification analysis. An artificially narrow characterization can similarly distort the analysis. The court should capture the laws essential character in terms that are as precise as the law will allow (References re GGPPA, at para. 52; Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, at para. 32).\nCharacterization Is Distinct From Classification\nWhen formulating the pith and substance of a law, litigants and courts may be inclined to glance ahead to the classification step and the catalogue of potential heads of power. It is imperative, however, that the characterization and classification analyses be kept distinct (References re GGPPA, at para. 56). In determining the pith and substance of a law, courts must not refer to the heads of power contained within the Constitution Act, 1867. Only after precisely stating the matter to which the law relates should a court proceed to the classification phase of the analysis and consider specific heads of power. \nThe judges in the court below, the parties and the interveners adopt differing articulations of the impugned schemes pith and substance. With respect, several of these articulations erroneously combine or conflate the characterization of the scheme with its classification. \nThe Attorney General of Canada submits that the pith and substance of the IAA is to establish a federal environmental assessment process to safeguard against adverse environmental effects in relation to matters within federal jurisdiction (A.F., at para. 47). The latter part of this characterization  in relation to matters within federal jurisdiction  predetermines the classification of the matter of the scheme under federal heads of power. It amounts to a statement that the main thrust of the scheme is to do what it does in a constitutionally valid manner. \nThe majority of the Court of Appeal fell into the same error when it concluded, as part of its characterization inquiry, that the schemes purpose and effects reveal an impermissible degree of federal jurisdictional overreach (para. 373). This is the language of classification; the characterization step of the analysis must focus exclusively on the pith and substance or dominant characteristic of the law.\nThe Presumption of Constitutionality\nThe presumption of constitutionality remains a cardinal principle of our division of powers jurisprudence (Murray-Hall v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2023 SCC 10, at para. 79; Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, [1957] S.C.R. 198, at p. 255; Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 662, at pp. 687-88; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 25; see also Severn v. The Queen (1878), 2 S.C.R. 70, at p. 103; Rogers Communications Inc. v. Chateauguay (City), 2016 SCC 23, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 81). Several consequences flow from the application of the presumption of constitutionality in federalism cases. Two of these consequences are germane for our purposes.\nFirst, according to this presumption, every legislative provision is presumed to be intra vires the level of government that enacted it (Murray-Hall, at para. 79; P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  15:13). In other words, a court should approach any question as to the validity of legislation on the assumption that it was validly enacted, unless the party challenging the validity of the legislation demonstrates otherwise (McNeil, at pp. 687-88; Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, at p. 255; Murray-Hall, at para. 80). \nSecond, the presumption of constitutionality functions as a principle of statutory interpretation. It directs a court to assume that a legislative body does not intend to exceed its powers under the Constitution (Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 69, at p. 103). As this Court explained in McKay v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 798, at pp. 803-4:\n. . . if an enactment, whether of Parliament or of a legislature or of a subordinate body to which legislative power is delegated, is capable of receiving a meaning according to which its operation is restricted to matters within the power of the enacting body it shall be interpreted accordingly. An alternative form in which the rule is expressed is that if words in a statute are fairly susceptible of two constructions of which one will result in the statute being intra vires and the other will have the contrary result the former is to be adopted.\nTherefore, when characterizing a challenged law, a court faced with competing, plausible characterizations . . . should normally choose that one that would support the validity of the law (Hogg and Wright, at  15:13; see also Siemens v. Manitoba (Attorney General), 2003 SCC 3, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 33; Desgagnes Transport Inc. v. Wartsila Canada Inc., 2019 SCC 58, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 228, at para. 28). And where a law is open to both a narrow and a wide interpretation, and under the wide interpretation the laws application would extend beyond the powers of the enacting legislative body, the court should read down the law so as to confine it to those applications that are within the power of the enacting legislative body (Hogg and Wright, at  15:13).\nI emphasize, however, that the presumption of constitutionality is not an impermeable shield that protects legislation from constitutional review by courts. Nor can courts employ the presumption of constitutionality to rewrite legislative text as they see fit in order to bring it into compliance with the Constitution. Courts cannot rely on the presumption of constitutionality to disregard a statute that speaks clearly and is ultra vires its enacting body. As Justice Gonthier held in Law Society of British Columbia v. Mangat, 2001 SCC 67, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 113, at para. 66, the presumption of constitutionality only applies when both competing interpretations are reasonably open to the court. In that case, Justice Gonthier declined to interpret the impugned provisions as being consistent with constitutional norms because doing so would be repugnant to the text and context of the federal legislation (para. 66; see also McKay, at pp. 803-4; J. M. Keyes and C. Diamond, Constitutional Inconsistency in Legislation  Interpretation and the Ambiguous Role of Ambiguity (2017), 48 Ottawa L. Rev. 313, at pp. 321-22). Thus, while the presumption of constitutionality is a cardinal principle that must be borne in mind, it does not displace the duty of courts to meaningfully review the constitutionality of legislation. \nSimilarly, a court cannot circumvent its duty to meaningfully review the constitutionality of legislation by suggesting that, insofar as an administrative decision maker applies a law unconstitutionally, the application of that law may be judicially reviewed. The constitutional validity of a law and its administrative application are distinct concepts. Where a constitutionally valid law grants a decision maker broad and imprecise discretion, that discretion must be exercised reasonably and in accordance with the purpose for which it was given (References re GGPPA, at para. 73). But where a law is ultra vires and therefore unconstitutional, it cannot be saved by the prospect of administrative judicial review. As Justice La Forest explained in Hydro-Quebec, at para. 73:\n. . . the constitutional validity of a statute cannot depend on the ebb and flow of existing government practice or the manner in which discretionary powers appear thus far to be exercised. It is the boundaries to the exercise of that discretion and the scope of the regulatory power created by the impugned legislation that are at issue here. It is no answer to a charge that a law is unconstitutional to say that it is only used sparingly. If it is unconstitutional, it cannot be used at all. [Emphasis in original.]\nWith these governing principles in mind, I now turn to the characterization of the impugned scheme.\nThe Application of the Governing Principles\nIn my view, a careful analysis of the purpose and effects of the impugned statute and Regulations reveals that the scheme they establish has two distinct components: one dealing with designated projects and another addressing projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or outside Canada. In my view, the pith and substance of the designated projects component of the scheme is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social and economic impacts. By contrast, the pith and substance of the secondary component in ss. 81 to 91 is to direct the manner in which federal authorities that carry out or finance a project on federal lands or outside Canada assess the significant adverse environmental effects that the project may have.\nI will begin my analysis with the purpose of the scheme as revealed by the intrinsic evidence.\nPurpose\nIntrinsic Evidence\nAs this Court has previously noted, courts have frequently used a statutes title as a tool for the purposes of characterization (References re GGPPA, at para. 58; see also Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, at para. 35). The short title of the impugned statute is Impact Assessment Act (s. 1). The long title is An Act respecting a federal process for impact assessments and the prevention of significant adverse environmental effects. The short title is relatively broad in scope, as it speaks not of environmental assessment but rather of impact assessment, which presumably includes within its ambit domains other than the environment. The long title would, by contrast, seem to indicate a fairly tailored scheme. It indicates that the federal process is designed to prevent those environmental effects that are both significant and adverse. \nAlthough the long title of the statute suggests a tailored scheme, its preamble and stated purposes sweep far more broadly. The preamble to the IAA proclaims Canadas commitments to, inter alia, fostering sustainability, providing Canadians with the opportunity to participate in [the impact assessment] process, and ensuring respect for the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada . . . and . . . fostering reconciliation. Section 6(1) sets out the IAAs 15 purposes, as follows: \n6 (1) The purposes of this Act are\n\n(a) to foster sustainability;\n\n(b) to protect the components of the environment, and the health, social and economic conditions that are within the legislative authority of Parliament from adverse effects caused by a designated project;\n\n(b.1) to establish a fair, predictable and efficient process for conducting impact assessments that enhances Canadas competitiveness, encourages innovation in the carrying out of designated projects and creates opportunities for sustainable economic development;\n\n(c) to ensure that impact assessments of designated projects take into account all effects  both positive and adverse  that may be caused by the carrying out of designated projects;\n\n(d) to ensure that designated projects that require the exercise of a power or performance of a duty or function by a federal authority under any Act of Parliament other than this Act to be carried out, are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and adverse direct or incidental effects;\n\n(e) to promote cooperation and coordinated action between federal and provincial governments  while respecting the legislative competence of each  and the federal government and Indigenous governing bodies that are jurisdictions, with respect to impact assessments;\n\n(f) to promote communication and cooperation with Indigenous peoples of Canada with respect to impact assessments;\n\n(g) to ensure respect for the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, in the course of impact assessments and decision-making under this Act;\n\n(h) to ensure that opportunities are provided for meaningful public participation during an impact assessment, a regional assessment or a strategic assessment;\n\n(i) to ensure that an impact assessment is completed in a timely manner;\n\n(j) to ensure that an impact assessment takes into account scientific information, Indigenous knowledge and community knowledge;\n\n(k) to ensure that an impact assessment takes into account alternative means of carrying out a designated project, including through the use of best available technologies;\n\n(l) to ensure that projects, as defined in section 81, that are to be carried out on federal lands, or those that are outside Canada and that are to be carried out or financially supported by a federal authority, are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects;\n\n(m) to encourage the assessment of the cumulative effects of physical activities in a region and the assessment of federal policies, plans or programs and the consideration of those assessments in impact assessments; and\n\n(n) to encourage improvements to impact assessments through the use of follow-up programs.\nThus, the stated purposes of the IAA  evidenced in its preamble and in s. 6  are considerably broader than the long title of the IAA might suggest. Though the long title refers to environmental effects, the intrinsic evidence, taken together, indicates a broader approach to assessing impacts  including but not limited to environmental impacts. In particular, s. 6 confirms that the IAA uses a wide lens, aiming to take into account all effects  both positive and adverse (s. 6(1)(c))  in order to provide protection from the adverse effects caused by a designated project (s. 6(1)(b)). \nIn sum, the intrinsic evidence reveals that the scheme encompasses both procedural and substantive components of impact assessment. It establishes an information-gathering process in the service of an ultimate decision-making function.\nExtrinsic Evidence\nThe extrinsic evidence supports the notion that the purpose of the IAA and the Regulations is to establish a preventative, project-based impact assessment and regulatory regime to identify potential changes to the environment or to health, social or economic conditions, and to mitigate or prevent these changes.\nIn February 2018, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change moved for a second reading of Bill C-69 and made several comments about the bills purpose. In her remarks, the Minister identified the central purpose of the bill as follows: \nBill C-69 aims to restore public trust in how the federal government makes decisions about major projects, such as mines, pipelines, and hydro dams. These better rules are designed to protect our environment while improving investor confidence, strengthening our economy, and creating good middle-class jobs. They will also make the Canadian energy and resource sectors more competitive. \n\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 264, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., February 14, 2018, at p. 17202)\nThe first theme that runs through the extrinsic evidence is that the impact assessment process is designed to account for more than just the environmental effects of a proposed project. In the 2017 Discussion Paper, the federal government outlined a number of possible changes to the environmental assessment and regulatory processes, including that Canadas new environmental assessment system must consider impacts on more than just the environment (p. 13). This broader focus was echoed in the report of the Expert Panel, which recommended a process that would move beyond the bio-physical environment to encompass all impacts, both positive and negative, likely to result from a project (p. 13). \nAt second reading in the House of Commons, the Minister indicated that impact assessments under Bill C-69 would examine matters such as health, social, gender, and economic impacts over the long term as well as the impacts on indigenous peoples (House of Commons Debates, February 14, 2018, at p. 17203). Similarly, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons stated that the bill was born of the recognition that we need to respect our environment, take into consideration all the factors at play and look at the economic benefits and the national interest (p. 17211).\nThe Minister expanded on this theme in her remarks to the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development. She stated that, in making decisions as to whether a project is in the public interest, the executive branch would consider such factors as whether companies are using the best available technologies and practices to reduce impacts on the environment and the results of a gender-based analysis designed to ensure that potential impacts on women, men, or gender-diverse people are identified and addressed (House of Commons, Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, Evidence, No. 99, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., March 22, 2018, at p. 2).\nA second theme that emerges from the record is that the federal scheme was designed to not only gather information about the impacts of a proposed project but also to grant the executive branch a decision-making power. In its 2017 Discussion Paper, the federal government referred to the forthcoming scheme as involving environmental assessment and regulatory processes that would culminate in Regulatory Decision(s) and ongoing monitoring, compliance, enforcement and follow-up (pp. 3 and 8). At second reading, the Minister explained that the aim would be to ensure that good projects go ahead in a timely way to create new jobs and economic opportunities for the middle class and that the final decision on major projects will rest with me or with the federal cabinet (House of Commons Debates, February 14, 2018, at p. 17203). Impact assessment thus provides the foundation for an ultimate decision by the executive branch. \nThe Minister did not speak as extensively about the Regulations but did mention that the Project List would identify those projects that have the most potential for adverse effects in areas of federal jurisdiction related to the environment (Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, at p. 18; see also Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement).\nThis Court has observed that parliamentary debates should be approached with caution. In Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 35, this Court noted that the frailties of Hansard evidence are many, though it recognized that such evidence can play a limited role in the interpretation of legislation. In Morgentaler, Sopinka J. noted the criticism that Hansard evidence cannot represent the intent of the legislature, an incorporeal body, and cautioned that courts must remain mindful of the limited reliability and weight of Hansard evidence (p. 484). Courts must approach parliamentary debates with great care, acknowledging that the record will often be full of contradictory statements, that speakers may make inadvertent errors in presenting and discussing legislation and that it is bad practice to cherry-pick seemingly helpful passages from the record.\nIn the current case, however, a consideration of this extrinsic evidence confirms what is already apparent from the intrinsic evidence: that the scheme is designed to identify potential changes not just to the environment, but also to health, social or economic conditions, and that it grants the executive branch broad impact assessment powers as well as an ultimate decision-making power.\nReading the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence together, I conclude that the scheme articulates a broad array of purposes, including protecting the environment and fostering sustainability; satisfying Canadas environmental obligations; assessing and regulating the broad effects of certain physical activities, such as effects on health, social and economic conditions; facilitating the participation of Indigenous peoples and the public; and establishing an efficient and transparent process. To achieve these purposes, the scheme not only involves information gathering but also has a regulatory component.\nEffects\nLegal Effects\nLegal effects flow directly from each step in the operation of the designated projects portion of the scheme: the designation of physical activities as designated projects and the three phases of the impact assessment process (planning, impact assessment and public interest decision making). Certain legal effects also flow from ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA, which deal with physical activities carried out on federal lands or outside Canada. I will address each cluster of effects in turn.\nDesignation\nTwo principal effects flow from the designation of a physical activity as a designated project. First, the designation process brings certain major projects within the schemes ambit. A direct effect of a project having been designated, therefore, is that it becomes subject to the schemes application and, at the very least, will be required to proceed through the planning phase. \nSecond, designation places two immediate, but temporary, holds on projects. The first of these temporary holds is set out in s. 7 of the IAA, which imposes a series of broad prohibitions on proponents of designated projects. Contravening s. 7 is a strict liability offence punishable by steep fines (s. 144). Section 7(1) prohibits the proponent of a designated project from doing any act or thing in connection with the carrying out of the designated project . . . if that act or thing may cause any of the enumerated effects. These effects track the definition of effects within federal jurisdiction in s. 2. They include a change to fish and fish habitat, aquatic species or migratory birds (s. 7(1)(a)); a change to the environment that would occur in another province or outside Canada (s. 7(1)(b)(ii) and (iii)); an impact on Indigenous peoples heritage or traditions (s. 7(1)(c)); and any change to the health, social or economic conditions of the Indigenous peoples of Canada (s. 7(1)(d)). \nIn practice, these effects-based prohibitions serve to pause all projects immediately upon designation. This pause applies to both designated physical activities and any physical activity that is incidental to those physical activities (s. 2). The restrictions on acts that may cause a change or impact encompass both positive and adverse changes of any magnitude. And, as a qualitative matter, it is difficult to envision a proposed major project in Canada that would not involve any activities that may cause at least one of the enumerated effects. \nFor example, the prohibition on doing any act that may cause a change to the environment in another province prima facie captures any act that may result in greenhouse gas emissions, which represent a pollution problem that is not merely interprovincial, but global, in scope (References re GGPPA, at para. 173). Similarly, Alberta submits that the prohibition on doing any act that may cause an effect on Indigenous peoples traditional land use would bar any physical activity associated with a designated project proposed to be carried out on provincial lands where traditional use is asserted by Indigenous peoples (s. 7(1)(c)(ii)). \nThe second temporary hold that flows directly from designation is set out in s. 8, which prohibits a federal authority from exercis[ing] any power or perform[ing] any duty or function . . . that could permit a designated project to be carried out and from providing financial assistance for the purpose of enabling a designated project to be carried out. This decision-based prohibition bears some resemblance to the Guidelines Order scheme upheld by this Court in Oldman River (p. 47).\nThe Planning Phase\nTwo principal legal effects flow from the schemes planning phase. First, the proponent of a designated project must provide a detailed project description that includes the information prescribed by regulations (IAA, s. 10; Information and Management of Time Limits Regulations, Sch. 1). Sections 19 to 24 of Schs. 1 and 2 of the Information and Time Management Regulations require the proponent to provide information about the projects potential effects, including effects within federal jurisdiction, an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions, and a list of the types of waste and emissions that are likely to be generated.\nSecond, the effects-based prohibitions and the decision-based prohibition remain in effect throughout the planning phase (IAA, ss. 7 and 8). The Agency may grant an exception to the effects-based prohibitions to allow the proponent to do an act or thing for the purpose of providing the Agency with information (s. 7(3)(c)). Absent such an exception, however, the project is put on hold until the Agency is satisfied that it has sufficient information to decide whether an impact assessment is required pursuant to s. 16(1). If the Agency decides that an impact assessment is not required, the ss. 7 and 8 prohibitions are lifted and the impact assessment process comes to an end (ss. 7(3)(a) and 8(a)). If an impact assessment is required, the project moves to the next phase.\nThe Impact Assessment Phase\nThe legal effects flowing from this phase of the scheme are similar to those flowing from the planning phase. First, the proponent must provide the Agency with the information or studies that it requires within the prescribed time (s. 19(1)). Second, the project remains subject to the ss. 7 and 8 prohibitions.\nThe Decision-Making Phase\nThe assessment process culminates in the Ministers decision statement. If the decision maker determines that the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or the adverse direct or incidental effects are in the public interest, the Minister can impose binding conditions in relation to those effects (s. 64). If the proponent complies with these conditions, the effects-based prohibitions are lifted (s. 7(3)(b)). The s. 8 decision-based prohibition is also lifted by the issuance of a positive decision statement (s. 8(b)). Through the imposition of binding conditions, however, the federal executives oversight of the project continues, even where it determines that the adverse effects are in the public interest.\nOn the other hand, if the decision maker determines that the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or the adverse direct or incidental effects are not in the public interest, this marks the end of the road for the proposed project. The effects-based and decision-based prohibitions remain in effect indefinitely, and the threat of steep fines for committing the strict liability offence of failing to comply with them persists. The scheme does not provide for the imposition of any conditions in the case of a negative decision statement.\nSections 81 to 91: Non-Designated Projects on Federal Lands or Outside Canada\nAs discussed, a key feature distinguishing this secondary scheme from the designated projects scheme is that assessments under ss. 81 to 91 are conducted by the federal authority with primary regulatory decision making responsibility for the project rather than by the Agency or a review panel. The principal legal effect of this secondary scheme is that it requires federal decision makers to consider the environment in discharging their existing duties. In this way, the scheme is similar to the 1984 Guidelines Order.\nPractical Effects\nIn contrast to legal effects, practical effects are the actual or predicted results of the legislations operation and administration (Morgentaler, at p. 486). The practical effects of a law may shed light on its essential character (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 26; Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, at paras. 30 and 51; References re GGPPA, at para. 51). But in some cases, a laws practical effects will not be particularly helpful in the characterization exercise (References re GGPPA, at para. 78). Ultimately, it is not for this Court to assess the effectiveness of the scheme or to attempt to predict its practical consequences in the absence of relevant evidence (para. 78). \nIn this appeal, a number of interveners offered submissions about the practical effects of the scheme in the context of their operations and industries (e.g., I.F., Attorney General of Ontario, at paras. 24-26; I.F., Attorney General of Quebec, at para. 27; I.F., Business Council of Alberta, at paras. 3-5 and 32-41; I.F., Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, at paras. 24 and 28-30; I.F., Canadian Taxpayers Federation, at paras. 5 and 37-40; I.F., Hydro-Quebec, at paras. 4 and 11; I.F., Indian Resource Council, at paras. 28-31). Though these practical effects are not determinative of the schemes pith and substance, I pause to note that the scheme gives rise to two general practical effects.\nFirst, the scheme results in delays of indeterminate duration (C.A. reasons, at paras. 358-61 (majority) and at para. 590 (dissent)). While each discrete phase of the impact assessment process is time-limited, the executive branch has the discretion to extend the time limits, sometimes indefinitely. For example, during the decision-making phase, a decision statement must be issued within a set time frame (s. 65(3) and (4)). But the Minister can extend that set time frame for any reason the Minister deems necessary (s. 65(5)), and the Governor in Council can, on the Ministers recommendation, extend the extension any number of times (s. 65(6)). \nA second practical effect is that the impact assessment process requires the Agency, the project proponent, federal authorities and other implicated jurisdictions to expend resources. It should be noted that the IAA envisions some degree of cooperation with other jurisdictions and thus can avoid duplication in certain circumstances. A frequent refrain in government publications and during the legislative debates was that there should be one project, one assessment and that there was a need to embrace cooperation and reduce red tape and duplication (see, e.g., 2017 Discussion Paper, at p. 17; Expert Panel, at pp. 22-26; House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 267, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., February 27, 2018, at p. 17412 (Hon. Jim Carr)). However, the IAAs substitution provisions practically ensure that the one assessment will be federal, at least in substance. Substitution is permitted only if the substituted process considers the mandatory factors listed in s. 22 of the IAA, and even then, the Agency may require the proponent to provide additional information before a federal public interest decision statement is issued (ss. 31(1), 33(1) and 35). \nConsidering the legal and practical effects together, I conclude that the scheme establishes a comprehensive information-gathering and regulatory process. From the designation stage through to the ultimate public interest determination, the IAA places broad temporary holds on the designated project. Following the public interest determination, the IAA continues to regulate the designated project with a view to mitigating or preventing its effects. The IAA also grants the executive branch broad regulatory powers and discretion by, for example, allowing the Governor in Council or the Minister to extend time limits.\nConclusion on Characterization\nIn sum, having considered the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence of purpose as well as the legal and practical effects of the scheme, I conclude that it contains two distinct components. The pith and substance of the first component of the scheme, the designated projects component, is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social and economic impacts. The pith and substance of the second component, set out in ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA, is to direct the manner in which federal authorities that carry out or finance a project on federal lands or outside Canada assess the significant adverse environmental effects that the project may have.\nStep 2: Classification\nThe Governing Principles\nGeneral Principles\nAfter a court characterizes the matter of a law, it must determine the class[es] of subjects into which the matter falls (Desgagnes Transport, at para. 38, quoting Quebec (Attorney General) 2015, at para. 29). The court does so by reference to the heads of power set out in the Constitution (References re GGPPA, at para. 114). If the matter of the law is properly classified as falling under a head of power assigned to the adopting level of government, the legislation is intra vires and valid (Reference re Securities Act, 2011 SCC 66, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 837, at para. 65).\nCanadian federalism recognizes the diversity of the original members of the Canadian Confederation (Hodge v. The Queen (1883), 9 App. Cas. 117 (P.C.), at p. 132; Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick, [1892] A.C. 437 (P.C.), at pp. 441-42; Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at para. 43; Canadian Western Bank, at para. 22; Consolidated Fastfrate Inc. v. Western Canada Council of Teamsters, 2009 SCC 53, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 407, at para. 29). The constitutional division of powers fosters this diversity within a single nation (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 22). Sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 confer broad legislative powers on provincial legislatures while granting the powers better exercised in relation to the country as a whole to the federal Parliament (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 22). \nEach head of power has been assigned to one level of government (or, exceptionally, assigned concurrently to both levels (ss. 92A(3), 94A and 95)). Only the level of government to which a head of power has been assigned can validly legislate in respect of matters falling within that head of power. The burden is on the party challenging the validity of a law to establish that it is ultra vires the enacting level of government (see Hogg and Wright, at  15:13; see also McNeil, at pp. 687-88; Rogers Communications, at para. 81).\nA law is classified based on its main thrust or dominant characteristic, and its secondary effects are not the focus of the validity analysis (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 28). The fact that a valid law incidentally touches on a head of power belonging to the other level of government does not affect its validity. In other words, effects that are merely incidental  in the sense that they are collateral and secondary to the mandate of the enacting legislature  will not disturb the constitutionality of an otherwise intra vires law (para. 28; Global Securities Corp. v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2000 SCC 21, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 494, at para. 23; British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2005 SCC 49, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 473, at para. 28; Rogers Communications, at para. 37; Quebec (Attorney General) 2015, at para. 32). \nThe Environmental Context\nThe Environment Is an Aggregate of Matters\nClassifying environmental legislation presents a challenge because the environment is not a head of power under s. 91 or 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. This Court has recognized that the environment is a constitutionally abstruse matter which does not comfortably fit within the existing division of powers without considerable overlap and uncertainty (Oldman River, at pp. 16 and 63-64; see also Hydro-Quebec, at para. 86). Indeed, Professors Hogg and Wright observed that the environment is an aggregate of matters ( 30:31; see also K. Harrison, Passing the Buck: Federalism and Canadian Environmental Policy (1996), at pp. 32-33). \nIn Oldman River, Justice La Forest explained that environmental management cuts across many different areas of constitutional responsibility . . . [and] could never be treated as a constitutional unit under one order of government . . . because no system in which one government was so powerful would be federal (pp. 63-64, quoting D. Gibson, Constitutional Jurisdiction over Environmental Management in Canada (1973), 23 U.T.L.J. 54, at p. 85; see also B. Downey et al., Federalism in the Patch: Canadas Energy Industry and the Constitutional Division of Powers (2020), 58 Alta. L. Rev. 273, at pp. 286 and 312; J. Leclair, Letendue du pouvoir constitutionnel des provinces et de lEtat central en matiere devaluation des incidences environnementales au Canada (1995), 21 Queens L.J. 37, at pp. 39-40; G. A. Beaudoin, La protection de lenvironnement et ses implications en droit constitutionnel (1977), 23 McGill L.J. 207, at p. 224).\nAccordingly, neither level of government has exclusive jurisdiction over the whole of the environment or over all environmental assessment (Oldman River, at p. 65; Hydro-Quebec, at para. 59, per Lamer C.J. and Iacobucci J., dissenting; Reference re Environmental Management Act (British Columbia), 2019 BCCA 181, 434 D.L.R. (4th) 213 (Reference re Environmental Management Act (BCCA)), at para. 93, affd 2020 SCC 1, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 3). Rather, this Court has acknowledged that both levels of government can legislate in respect of certain aspects of environmental protection, including certain aspects of the environmental assessment of physical activities (Moses; Reference re Environmental Management Act (BCCA), at para. 93). Shared federal and provincial responsibility for environmental impact assessment is neither unusual nor unworkable (Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada (National Energy Board), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 159, at p. 193). Rather, it is a central feature of environmental decision making in Canada (S. A. Kennett, Oldman and Environmental Impact Assessment: An Invitation for Cooperative Federalism (1992), 3 Const. Forum 93, at p. 94).\nIn Moses, for example, this Court recognized that both the federal and provincial governments can, in certain circumstances, validly exercise legislative jurisdiction over the same activity or project. Justice Binnie, writing for the majority, explained that, although a mining project considered in isolation might seem to fall within provincial jurisdiction over natural resources, a federal permit would nonetheless be required if that project placed fish habitat at risk (para. 36). Put simply, [t]he mining of non-renewable mineral resources aspect falls within provincial jurisdiction, but the fisheries aspect is federal (para. 36).\nThis is consistent with the double aspect doctrine, which reflects the idea that the same fact situation can be regulated from different perspectives, one falling within s. 91 and the other falling within s. 92 (References re GGPPA, at paras. 129-30; Desgagnes Transport, at para. 84; Hodge, at p. 130; Rio Hotel Ltd. v. New Brunswick (Liquor Licensing Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 59, at p. 65; Canadian Western Bank, at para. 30; H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at paras. VI-2.41 to VI-2.43). \nMany significant legislative matters cannot be reduced to one discrete subject. Indeed, Canadian governments must address complex and multifaceted issues that may fall within multiple heads of power (Downey et al., at p. 282). The double aspect doctrine explains how laws enacted by both the federal and provincial levels of government may validly regulate the same fact scenario from different perspectives, pursuant to their respective heads of power. Overlaps of this nature are an inevitable and legitimate feature of the Canadian federal system (Desgagnes Transport, at para. 83; Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161, at pp. 180-81; Canadian Western Bank, at paras. 36 and 42). \nNonetheless, the double aspect doctrine must be applied with caution. First, not all fact situations have a double aspect, and each fact situation must be identified with precision. Environmental assessment of physical activities may or may not have a double aspect in relation to a specific project. \nSecond, the fact that environmental assessment of physical activities may have a double aspect  with some elements falling within the legislative authority of each level of government  does not mean that it is an area of concurrent jurisdiction (Reference re Securities Act, at para. 66; Desgagnes Transport, at paras. 82-83; Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, at para. 268-71, per LeBel and Deschamps JJ.; Oldman River, at pp. 71-72; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. VI-2.41). If a fact situation can be regulated from both a federal perspective and a provincial perspective, it follows that each level of government can only enact laws which, in pith and substance, fall under its respective jurisdiction. In other words, both levels of government have the exclusive power to legislate within their respective jurisdictions, even if by doing so they both regulate the same fact situation (Bell Canada v. Quebec (Commission de la sante et de la securite du travail), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 749, at p. 766). \nThe notion that both levels of government may legislate in respect of certain aspects of environmental protection, each pursuant to its own legislative competence, is also consistent with the principle of cooperative federalism. This more flexible view of federalism . . . accommodates overlapping jurisdiction and encourages intergovernmental cooperation (Reference re Securities Act, at para. 57; see also Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation, at para. 17; Rogers Communications, at para. 85). However, [w]hile flexibility and cooperation are important to federalism, they cannot override or modify the separation of powers or make ultra vires legislation intra vires (Reference re Securities Act, at paras. 61-62; Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation, at para. 18; Rogers Communications, at para. 39). The division of federal and provincial powers, including more recent additions such as exclusive provincial jurisdiction over non-renewable natural resources under s. 92A, is the product of negotiation and compromise. Courts may not, under the guise of cooperative federalism, erode the constitutional balance inherent in the Canadian federal state (Reference re Securities Act, at para. 62).\nThe Source and Scope of Jurisdiction Over Aspects of the Environment\nThe constitutionally abstruse nature of the environment means that legislative jurisdiction over the environment must be rooted in specific heads of power (Oldman River, at pp. 64-65; Hydro-Quebec, at para. 154, quoting W. R. Lederman, Unity and Diversity in Canadian Federalism: Ideals and Methods of Moderation (1975), 53 Can. Bar Rev. 597, at p. 610; Attorney General of Quebec v. IMTT-Quebec inc., 2019 QCCA 1598, 79 Admin. L.R. (6th) 1, at paras. 223-26). Since the heads of power differ in their nature and scope, the extent to which a level of government may address environmental concerns may vary from one head of power to another (IMTT, at para. 55; Oldman River, at p. 67).\nSome heads of power relate to activities  for example, Parliament can legislate in respect of pollution from ships pursuant to its jurisdiction over the activity of navigation and shipping (s. 91(10); Oldman River, at pp. 67-68; Desgagnes Transport, at para. 44). It can similarly legislate in respect of environmental issues arising from interprovincial works and undertakings, such as interprovincial railways or pipelines (ss. 91(29) and 92(10)(a); Oldman River, at p. 65; Reference re Environmental Management Act (BCCA), at para. 11). Provinces can legislate in respect of local works and undertakings, property and civil rights in the province, and matters of a local nature (s. 92(10), (13) and (16)). \nOther heads of power relate to what has been described as management of a resource  for example, in Oldman River, Justice La Forest viewed the fisheries power under s. 91(12) in this light (pp. 67-68). As another example, provinces can exclusively make laws in respect of non-renewable natural resources, forestry resources and electrical energy pursuant to s. 92A (see A. R. Lucas and C. Sharvit, Constitutional Powers, in A. R. Lucas and R. Cotton, eds., Canadian Environmental Law (3rd ed. (loose-leaf)), 3-1, at  3.13).\nThese distinctions serve as convenient descriptors rather than fully explaining the scope of a head of power. Indeed, the same head of power can cover both activities and resources, depending on the fact situation. For example, the provinces jurisdiction over natural resources, forestry resources and electrical energy could be viewed as relating to activities when it is exercised to regulate the activity of developing these resources on provincial lands. Conversely, Parliaments power to legislate in respect of navigation and shipping could be viewed as being in relation to management of a resource when it is exercised to regulate the impact of the construction of a bridge or dam on navigable waters (Oldman River; S. A. Kennett, Federal Environmental Jurisdiction After Oldman (1993), 38 McGill L.J. 180, at pp. 189-91). I also note that some heads of power, such as the criminal law power and the POGG power, have been used in relation to specific environmental matters (e.g., Hydro-Quebec; References re GGPPA).\nThe activities and management of a resource descriptors help to explain how a particular project may be validly regulated by both levels of government. An activity that seems to fall within a head of power assigned to one level of government may nevertheless have certain aspects  such as its impacts on certain resources  that can be regulated pursuant to a head of power assigned to the other level of government. Thus, for example, while the activity of constructing a mine falls primarily within provincial jurisdiction, the constructions impacts on resources such as fisheries and navigable waters are aspects that may be regulated pursuant to federal legislative competence (Moses, at para. 36). \nIn Oldman River, Justice La Forest cautioned that it is unhelpful to describe a project as a provincial project or as a project primarily subject to provincial regulation, as this erroneously suggests that such projects are shielded from otherwise valid federal legislation (p. 68). I agree that it is important to avoid the impression that some projects fall within an enclave of exclusivity. Nonetheless, while both levels of government may have the ability to regulate different aspects of a given project, one levels jurisdiction may be broader than the others. Recognizing that an activity is primarily regulated by one level of government highlights the fact that the pith and substance of any legislation enacted by the other level of government must be tailored to the aspects of the project that properly fall within the latters jurisdiction.\nThe Application of the Governing Principles \nWith the governing principles in mind, I now turn to classifying the matter of the impugned scheme. The question at this step is as follows: under which head or heads of power does the matter of the scheme fall? Because the environment is constitutionally abstruse and an aggregate of matters, the relevance of particular heads of power may vary with the context. In this appeal, absent a specific fact scenario, I will focus on determining whether the main thrust of the scheme is directed at federal matters.\nAs I concluded following the characterization exercise, the impugned scheme contains two discrete components. As I will explain, the provisions of the IAA dealing with projects on federal lands or outside Canada are clearly intra vires Parliament. However, classifying the matter of the designated projects portion of the scheme is a more challenging task. I will deal first with this portion of the scheme.\nThe Designated Projects Scheme\nAs discussed, there is no doubt that Parliament can enact impact assessment legislation that is directed at the federal aspects of projects. The breadth of these federal aspects will vary with the circumstances. Where Parliament is vested with jurisdiction to legislate in respect of a particular activity, it has broad discretion to regulate that activity and its effects (Oldman River, at pp. 67-68; Harrison, at p. 36; Kennett (1993), at pp. 187-89). But Parliaments jurisdiction is more restricted where the activity falls outside of its legislative competence; in these cases, it can validly legislate only from the perspective of the federal aspects of the activity, such as the impacts of the activity on federal heads of power. Federal legislation that is insufficiently tailored  that is, whose pith and substance is to regulate the activity qua activity, rather than only its federal aspects  is ultra vires (Reference re Environmental Management Act (BCCA), at paras. 98-101).\nThe scheme treats all designated projects in the same way, regardless of whether Parliament is vested with broad jurisdiction over the activity itself or narrower jurisdiction over the activitys impacts on federal heads of power. And many of the physical activities to which the scheme applies are primarily regulated through the provincial legislatures powers over local works and undertakings or natural resources. Parliament can enact impact assessment legislation to regulate these projects from a federal perspective, so long as the regulation of federal aspects represents the dominant characteristic of the law. \nCanada relies on four heads of power to support the designated projects scheme: sea coast and inland fisheries (s. 91(12)), Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians (s. 91(24)), imperial treaties (s. 132) and the national concern branch of the POGG power (s. 91). It argues that the schemes grounding in these heads of power achieves the necessary tailoring and confines Parliament to its constitutional lane. The crux of Canadas position is that the scheme targets effects within federal jurisdiction and direct or incidental effects, two defined terms in the IAA that are said to align with Parliaments legislative jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867. \nIn my view, the pith and substance of the portion of the scheme that deals with designated projects exceeds the bounds of federal jurisdiction, and this portion of the scheme is therefore ultra vires. This is so for two overarching reasons.\nFirst, even if I were to accept Canadas contention as to the defined federal effects, these effects do not drive the schemes decision-making functions. Consequently, the scheme is not in pith and substance directed at regulating these effects. \nSecond, I do not accept that the defined term effects within federal jurisdiction aligns with federal legislative jurisdiction under s. 91. This overbreadth exacerbates the constitutional frailties of the schemes decision-making functions. \nThis analysis will proceed in two parts that correspond to these two overarching problems. First, setting aside my concerns about the scope of the defined effects within federal jurisdiction, I will consider the four decision-making junctures embedded in the scheme: (i) the designation of physical activities as designated projects; (ii) the screening decision; (iii) the delineation of the scope of the impact assessment and the factors to be considered therein; and (iv) the public interest decision and resulting regulation and oversight. As I will demonstrate, only some of these decision-making functions are constitutionally vulnerable. Nonetheless, I will address them in sequence to provide context and guidance. \nThereafter, I will explain why, in my view, the defined effects within federal jurisdiction do not align with federal legislative jurisdiction. Rather, their overbreadth further dilutes the schemes already tenuous focus on the federal aspects of designated projects. In the result, the scheme invites the federal government to make decisions in respect of projects that it has no jurisdiction to regulate, at least from the perspective of the heads of power upon which it relies.\nAs I have noted, the IAA addresses another subcategory of effects, direct or incidental effects, which are defined in part as effects that are directly linked or necessarily incidental to . . . a federal authoritys provision of financial assistance to a person for the purpose of enabling [a physical] activity or [designated] project to be carried out, in whole or in part (s. 2). I will not discuss this defined term in great detail in the course of these reasons, except to note that, as Canada recognized, this part of the definition refers to the federal spending power. This defined term received little attention in this appeal, perhaps because, as Canada also acknowledged, the exercise of this federal spending authority would likely have to be considered in the context of the facts of a particular case. \nI turn now to the schemes first overarching problem.\nThe Defined Federal Effects Do Not Drive the Schemes Decision-Making Functions\nDesignation of Physical Activities as Designated Projects\nThe designation mechanism brings certain physical activities within the schemes ambit. Alberta asserts that the designation mechanism is overbroad in two related ways. First, Alberta raises the concern that the Regulations do not draw a distinction between federal and local projects and, accordingly, include several physical activities with no obvious ties to federal jurisdiction (R.F., at para. 59). Second, Alberta submits that there are no thresholds or criteria . . . with respect to the physical activities that the Governor in Council may designate in the Regulations (para. 56).  \nAlbertas concerns about the schemes designation mechanism are, with respect, misplaced. The fact that a project involves activities primarily regulated by the provincial legislatures does not create an enclave of exclusivity. Even a provincial project may cause effects in respect of which the federal government can properly legislate. Accordingly, the inclusion in the Regulations of some provincial projects  in the sense that they involve activities primarily regulated by the provinces  is not itself problematic. \nFurthermore, the jurisprudence and academic literature make plain that a low threshold for the application of an impact assessment scheme is a practical necessity. In Oldman River, this Court described environmental assessment as a planning tool that offers an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development (p. 71). As a planning tool, impact assessment is necessarily prospective and launches from a point of informational uncertainty (Expert Panel, at pp. 18-19; J. MacLean, M. Doelle and C. Tollefson, Polyjural and Polycentric Sustainability Assessment: A Once-in-a-Generation Law Reform Opportunity (2016), 30 J.E.L.P. 35, at p. 43). \nIt logically follows that the full implications of proposed activities cannot be properly understood, if at all, until an assessment is well underway if not completed (MacLean, Doelle and Tollefson, at pp. 39-40; see also A. Johnston, Federal Jurisdiction and the Impact Assessment Act: Trojan Horse or Rational Ecological Accounting?, in Doelle and Sinclair, The Next Generation of Impact Assessment, 97, at pp. 104-5). \nThe IAA expressly states that it must be administered in a manner that, among other things, applies the precautionary principle (s. 6(2)). This Court has previously referred to the precautionary principle when determining the validity of environmental legislation (114957 Canada Ltee (Spraytech, Societe darrosage) v. Hudson (Town), 2001 SCC 40, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241, at paras. 31-32). This principle instructs that [w]here there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation (para. 31, quoting the Bergen Ministerial Declaration on Sustainable Development (1990), at para. 7). \nRequiring definitive proof that a project will have effects on areas of federal jurisdiction prior to an impact assessment would put the cart before the horse and undermine the precautionary principle (Johnston, at pp. 105-6). Therefore, in my view, the designation mechanisms imperfect focus on federal effects is both practically necessary and constitutionally sound.\nThough I conclude that the designation mechanism, on its own, is unproblematic, I note that it is necessarily linked to the IAAs definition of effects within federal jurisdiction. I will return to this definition, and to its influence on the designation mechanism and the balance of the scheme, later in my reasons.\nThe Screening Decision\nWhile all designated projects are subject to the IAAs planning phase, they are not automatically subject to an impact assessment. Rather, following the planning phase, the Agency is empowered to make a screening decision as to whether an impact assessment is required for a particular project. \nThe Agency must decide whether an impact assessment of a designated project is required by taking into account the mandatory factors set out in s. 16(2): \n(2) In making its decision, the Agency must take into account the following factors:\n\n(a) the description referred to in section 10 and any notice referred to in section 15;\n\n(b) the possibility that the carrying out of the designated project may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or adverse direct or incidental effects;\n\n(c) any adverse impact that the designated project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982;\n\n(d) any comments received within the time period specified by the Agency from the public and from any jurisdiction or Indigenous group that is consulted under section 12;\n\n(e) any relevant assessment referred to in section 92, 93 or 95;\n\n(f) any study that is conducted or plan that is prepared by a jurisdiction  in respect of a region that is related to the designated project  and that has been provided to the Agency; and\n\n(g) any other factor that the Agency considers relevant.\nIn my view, the Agencys broad discretion to require an impact assessment of a designated project demonstrates that the matter of the scheme exceeds the bounds of federal legislative competence. The decision to require an assessment must be rooted in the possibility of adverse federal effects (MacLean, Doelle and Tollefson, at pp. 44-45). This is a corollary of the schemes broad designation mechanism: the wider the scheme casts its net, the more critical the funneling function of the screening decision becomes to keeping the overall scheme within the bounds of federal legislative powers. As drafted, the screening decision under s. 16(2) is not driven by possible federal effects and therefore fails to focus the scheme on the federal aspects of designated projects.\nThe IAA requires the Agency to take into account an open-ended list of factors, all of seemingly equal importance. Only s. 16(2)(b) and (c) relate to adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and adverse direct or incidental effects. As a result, an impact assessment of a designated project could be required for reasons other than, or not sufficiently tied to, the projects possible impacts on areas of federal jurisdiction. Given the breadth of the considerations permitted to drive the screening decision, I am not satisfied that this decision performs the funneling function necessary to maintain the schemes focus on federal impacts. \nCanada argues that the key decision-making factor is the possibility that the carrying out of the designated project may cause Adverse Federal Effects (A.F., at para. 92). This submission is not reflected in the text of s. 16(2), which gives no primacy to the possibility of adverse effects relative to the other mandatory considerations. \nCanada also argues that [w]here there is insufficient linkage to federal jurisdiction, a reasonable exercise of the Agencys discretion under s. 16(1) will not require an impact assessment (A.F., at para. 113). However, under s. 16(2), the discretion granted to the Agency is not limited to projects that may cause federal effects. The Agency can require projects with little or no possibility of federal effects to undergo an impact assessment on the basis of, for example, any comments received . . . from the public, regardless of whether such comments are in respect of areas of federal jurisdiction (s. 16(2)(d)). The IAAs expansive purposes, set out in s. 6, do little to confine the exercise of this discretion.\nDue to the wide net cast by the schemes designation mechanism, the screening decision is constitutionally problematic. The risk is that projects with little or no potential for adverse federal effects will nonetheless be required to undergo an impact assessment on the basis of less relevant, yet mandatory, considerations. The fact that this decision is not driven by the likelihood of federal impacts demonstrates that the main thrust of the scheme strays from federal matters. I am unable to resort to the presumption of constitutionality in relation to s. 16 because its text, context, and purpose preclude a reasonable interpretation consistent with constitutional validity.\nThe Scope of Information Gathering and Assessment\nI turn next to the impact assessment phase of the scheme. The impact assessment must take into account the factors listed in s. 22(1) of the IAA: \n22 (1) The impact assessment of a designated project, whether it is conducted by the Agency or a review panel, must take into account the following factors:\n\n(a) the changes to the environment or to health, social or economic conditions and the positive and negative consequences of these changes that are likely to be caused by the carrying out of the designated project, including\n\n(i) the effects of malfunctions or accidents that may occur in connection with the designated project,\n\n(ii) any cumulative effects that are likely to result from the designated project in combination with other physical activities that have been or will be carried out, and\n\n(iii) the result of any interaction between those effects;\n\n(b) mitigation measures that are technically and economically feasible and that would mitigate any adverse effects of the designated project;\n\n(c) the impact that the designated project may have on any Indigenous group and any adverse impact that the designated project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982;\n\n(d) the purpose of and need for the designated project;\n\n(e) alternative means of carrying out the designated project that are technically and economically feasible, including through the use of best available technologies, and the effects of those means;\n\n(f) any alternatives to the designated project that are technically and economically feasible and are directly related to the designated project;\n\n(g) Indigenous knowledge provided with respect to the designated project;\n\n(h) the extent to which the designated project contributes to sustainability;\n\n(i) the extent to which the effects of the designated project hinder or contribute to the Government of Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and its commitments in respect of climate change;\n\n(j) any change to the designated project that may be caused by the environment;\n\n(k) the requirements of the follow-up program in respect of the designated project;\n\n(l) considerations related to Indigenous cultures raised with respect to the designated project;\n\n(m) community knowledge provided with respect to the designated project;\n\n(n) comments received from the public;\n\n(o) comments from a jurisdiction that are received in the course of consultations conducted under section 21;\n\n(p) any relevant assessment referred to in section 92, 93 or 95;\n\n(q) any assessment of the effects of the designated project that is conducted by or on behalf of an Indigenous governing body and that is provided with respect to the designated project;\n\n(r) any study or plan that is conducted or prepared by a jurisdiction  or an Indigenous governing body not referred to in paragraph (f) or (g) of the definition jurisdiction in section 2  that is in respect of a region related to the designated project and that has been provided with respect to the project;\n\n(s) the intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors; and\n\n(t) any other matter relevant to the impact assessment that the Agency requires to be taken into account.\nAlberta argues that the s. 22 factors go significantly beyond matters with a clear connection to federal jurisdiction (R.F., at para. 90). In its submission, this broad list of factors demonstrates that the IAA is far from focused on matters of federal jurisdiction (para. 91). \nIn my view, the assessment phase, on its own, does not involve an unconstitutional exercise of federal legislative authority. To understand why the assessment phase of the federal scheme is constitutionally compliant, it is necessary to distinguish between the concepts of environmental assessment on the one hand and environmental decision making on the other. As I will explain, the permissible scope of the former is wider than that of the latter. Although the federal government can legislate only in respect of activities over which it has jurisdiction or in respect of environmental effects that impact its areas of jurisdiction, it is not similarly limited in its information gathering and assessment. In other words, at the assessment stage, the federal government is not restricted to considering environmental effects that are federal in nature.\nIn Oldman River, Justice La Forest explained that, when the federal government makes a decision about the acceptability of a proposed dams impacts on marine navigation, it must be able to look beyond those specific impacts in its cost-benefit analysis. Otherwise, as Justice La Forest warned, at p. 39: \n. . . it seems to me that the Minister would approve of very few works because several of the works falling within the ambit of [the relevant provision] do not assist navigation at all, but by their very nature interfere with, or impede navigation, for example bridges, booms, dams and the like. If the significance of the impact on marine navigation were the sole criterion, it is difficult to conceive of a dam of this sort ever being approved. It is clear, then, that the Minister must factor several elements into any cost-benefit analysis to determine if a substantial interference with navigation is warranted in the circumstances.\nSince Oldman River, this Court has affirmed that the federal government, in conducting an environmental assessment, can gather information about effects beyond those that fall within federal jurisdiction (National Energy Board, at pp. 191 and 193; see also MacLean, Doelle and Tollefson, at pp. 44-45). \nThus, while the federal government may have more limited room for manoeuvre in exercising its decision-making authority with respect to projects that affect federal areas of jurisdiction, it can gather information about a wide range of factors in conducting an environmental assessment. This broad information-gathering power is a natural by-product of the breadth and complexity of environmental regulation (see Hydro-Quebec, at para. 134; R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd., [1988] 1 S.C.R. 401, at p. 420; Canadian Pacific, at para. 43). In light of the interrelated nature of environmental matters, it would be both artificial and uncertain to limit the factors that can be studied or considered to those that are federal. What matters most is how the information is used at the decision-making stage.\nIn the current case, therefore, the breadth of the factors listed in s. 22 of the IAA does not pose a constitutional issue. Whether a given project falls primarily under federal or provincial jurisdiction, the level of government undertaking an impact assessment has wide latitude to evaluate the projects anticipated effects. It is not restricted to studying or gathering information about those effects that fall within its legislative jurisdiction.\nPublic Interest Decision\nThe public interest decision lies at the heart of this scheme. The impact assessment process enables and is auxiliary to this decision (see IMTT, at para. 226; Oldman River, at p. 72). Accordingly, this Court must closely examine the provisions of the IAA that relate to the public interest decision stage (see Johnston, at p. 111).\nSections 60 to 64 of the IAA appear below the heading Decision-Making. The operative question for the decision maker is whether the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction  and the adverse direct or incidental effects  that are indicated in the [assessment] report are, in light of the factors referred to in section 63 and the extent to which those effects are significant, in the public interest (ss. 60(1)(a), 61(1) and 62). \nSection 63 sets out the mandatory public interest factors that the decision maker must take into consideration: \n63 The Ministers determination under paragraph 60(1)(a) in respect of a designated project referred to in that subsection, and the Governor in Councils determination under section 62 in respect of a designated project referred to in that subsection, must be based on the report with respect to the impact assessment and a consideration of the following factors:\n\n(a) the extent to which the designated project contributes to sustainability;\n\n(b) the extent to which the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and the adverse direct or incidental effects that are indicated in the impact assessment report in respect of the designated project are significant;\n\n(c) the implementation of the mitigation measures that the Minister or the Governor in Council, as the case may be, considers appropriate;\n\n(d) the impact that the designated project may have on any Indigenous group and any adverse impact that the designated project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982; and\n\n(e) the extent to which the effects of the designated project hinder or contribute to the Government of Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and its commitments in respect of climate change.\nAs discussed, the public interest decision dictates the nature and extent of ongoing federal oversight of a project. If the decision maker determines that the defined effects are in the public interest, the Minister must establish conditions with which the proponent of the project must comply, including the implementation of mitigation measures and follow-up programs (s. 64). The mandatory conditions must be in relation to the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or direct or incidental effects (s. 64(1) and (2)). On the other hand, if the decision maker determines that the defined effects are not in the public interest, the Minister will issue a negative decision statement. This results in the continuation of the ss. 7 and 8 prohibitions and therefore amounts to placing a permanent hold on the project. \nIn my view, s. 63 of the IAA represents an unconstitutional arrogation of power by Parliament. Even if this Court were to accept Canadas submission that the defined effects within federal jurisdiction are aligned with federal legislative competence  a point to which I will return  the public interest decision is constitutionally vulnerable. This decision-making process transforms what is prima facie a determination of whether adverse federal effects are in the public interest into a determination of whether the project as a whole is in the public interest. \nTwo features of the mandatory public interest factors warrant attention. First, these factors are not all confined to federal legislative competence. For example, s. 63(a) requires a consideration of sustainability, a term defined as meaning the ability to protect the environment, contribute to the social and economic well-being of the people of Canada and preserve their health in a manner that benefits present and future generations (s. 2). This encompasses all environmental, social and economic effects, not only those that the federal government has jurisdiction to regulate. \nSecond, some factors are framed in relation to the assessment of the project as a whole rather than to the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction. To use the same example, s. 63(a) requires a consideration of the extent to which the designated project contributes to sustainability. Similarly, s. 63(e) requires a consideration of the extent to which the effects of the designated project  in other words, not only its federal effects  hinder or contribute to the Government of Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and its commitments in respect of climate change. \nThe central problem with the public interest decision is not the s. 63 factors themselves but rather the manner in which these factors drive decision making. The public interest decision must reflect a focus on the projects federal effects. As I will explain, however, s. 63 permits the decision maker to blend their assessment of adverse federal effects with other adverse effects that are not federal, such as the projects anticipated greenhouse gas emissions (under s. 63(e)). Put another way, the adverse non-federal effects can amplify the perceived severity of the adverse federal effects and, effectively, become the underlying basis for the conclusion that the latter are not in the public interest. The mandatory cumulation of adverse non-federal effects shifts the focus of the decision from the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction to the overall adverse effects of the project.\nTwo hypothetical scenarios illustrate this point. Consider a proposed mining project that, following an impact assessment, is understood to pose a potential risk to fish habitat and aquatic species. The mining aspect of the project is provincial, but the fisheries aspect is federal (Moses). Accordingly, the scheme requires the federal executive to decide whether the projects cumulative adverse impact on fish habitat and aquatic species is in the public interest. \nIn the first hypothetical scenario, the decision maker considers the mandatory public interest factors listed in s. 63 and determines, under s. 63(a), that the overall effects of the designated project would contribute to sustainability. [I]n light of this contribution, the decision maker would conclude, under s. 60(1)(a) or 61(1), that the cumulative impact on the fisheries is in the public interest, and would impose conditions to mitigate the adverse impact. The thrust of the decision and the force of federal regulation would clearly be aimed at protecting the fisheries through mitigation measures, follow-up programs, and any other conditions that the Minister considers appropriate under s. 64(1) and (4). \nIn the second scenario, the decision maker determines, under s. 63(a), that the overall effects of the designated project would hinder sustainability. [I]n light of this adverse impact, the decision maker would conclude, under s. 60(1)(a) or 61(1), that the cumulative impact on the fisheries would not be in the public interest. The thrust of the decision and the force of federal regulation would no longer be driven by the fisheries aspect of the mine; rather, the fisheries aspect would have been subsumed into consideration of the projects overall sustainability, an abstract concept that, much like the environment, is constitutionally abstruse. This is not to say that sustainability must never be considered in impact assessment. To the contrary, sustainability is a general guiding principle under this scheme that infuses the impact assessment process with a longer-term view for the benefit of both present and future generations (s. 2 sustainability). The concern in this second hypothetical scenario is that the presence of potential harm to the fisheries serves as the gateway to making a decision about the public interest in the project as a whole. Thus, rather than focusing on the fisheries, the Ministers decision is predominantly focused on the regulation of the project qua project on the basis of its overall sustainability. \nThis concern is less salient when the s. 63 factors are used to assess an activity that itself falls under federal jurisdiction. For example, as Justice La Forest recognized in Oldman River, if a federal decision maker were to assess an interprovincial railway project, its decision could be based on a variety of environmental and socio-economic concerns, including a general concern for sustainability (pp. 66-67). The federal decision maker could make an integrated decision that considers both adverse federal and non-federal effects, because the decision would ultimately be about an interprovincial railway under ss. 92(10)(a) and 91(29) of the Constitution Act, 1867. This is the context in which Justice La Forest. asserted that it defies reason for Parliament to be constitutionally barred from weighing broad environmental repercussions (p. 66). However, as I have explained, the IAA makes no distinction between the assessment of activities that fall under federal jurisdiction and the assessment of impacts of activities that are primarily regulated by the provinces.\nThe hypothetical scenarios set out above demonstrate how the dominant thrust of the public interest decision-making process veers away from federal heads of power because there are so few constraints on how the s. 63 factors may be used. It is self-evident that adverse federal effects, considered in isolation, would rarely (if ever) be in the public interest (see Oldman River, at p. 39). My colleagues, in dissent, agree that [t]o be in the public interest, adverse federal effects need to be outweighed by other positive benefits of the project (para. 333 (emphasis in original)). In other words, adverse federal effects must be outweighed on the other side of the ledger by public interest factors in s. 63 (para. 293 (emphasis added)). But s. 63 expressly permits non-federal concerns to stack up on the adverse side of the ledger  regardless of whether the activity itself falls under federal jurisdiction  and thereby alter the fundamental character of the public interest decision. This shifts the dominant thrust of the decision away from the acceptability of adverse federal effects and directs it, instead, at the wisdom of proceeding with the project as a whole.\nI note that, under the CEAA 2012, the central question for the decision maker was not whether the adverse federal effects were in the public interest but rather whether they were justified in the circumstances (s. 52(2) and (4)). This language made it clear that the circumstances could be used to justify the adverse federal effects and thus render a positive decision; they could not be used to magnify the adverse federal effects and thus render a negative decision. This assurance is absent from the impugned statutes decision-making provisions.\nIn Oldman River, at p. 69, Justice La Forest explained that [t]he practical purpose that inspires the legislation and the implications [the legislative body] must consider in making its decision . . . will not detract from the fundamental nature of the legislation. But Justice La Forest was also mindful of the concern that a federal assessment scheme might function as a constitutional Trojan horse enabling the federal government, on the pretext of some narrow ground of federal jurisdiction, to conduct a far ranging inquiry into matters that are exclusively within provincial jurisdiction (pp. 71-72). \nFor this scheme to be intra vires, it must be consistently focused on federal matters. As I have explained, it is both inevitable and permissible for the schemes focus to broaden at the assessment stage. It would be artificial and ineffective to restrict the collection of information at the assessment phase to those components of the environment that are within federal jurisdiction. Nevertheless, at the ultimate decision-making juncture, the focus on federal impacts must be restored. Parliament can validly regulate only the impacts that fall within its jurisdiction or that arise from activities within its jurisdiction. \nIn sum, even if one sets aside any concerns about the schemes definition of effects within federal jurisdiction, its core decision-making function is constitutionally problematic. The scheme requires the decision maker to consider a host of factors but does not specify how those factors are to drive the ultimate conclusion. As a result, the projects overall adverse effects, such as hindering sustainability broadly or Canadas climate change commitments, can substantiate a negative public interest decision. The schemes decision-making mechanism thereby loses its focus on regulating federal impacts. Instead, it grants the decision maker a practically untrammelled power to regulate projects qua projects, regardless of whether Parliament has jurisdiction to regulate a given physical activity in its entirety.\nAs Defined, Effects Within Federal Jurisdiction Exceed Federal Jurisdiction \nThe constitutional frailties of the schemes decision-making functions are exacerbated by its focus on regulating an overbroad range of impacts. The mere fact that certain effects are defined as being within federal jurisdiction is, of course, not determinative of their status within the constitutional division of powers (Desgagnes Transport, at para. 137, per Wagner C.J. and Brown J., concurring). In my view, the defined effects within federal jurisdiction go far beyond the limits of federal legislative jurisdiction. This overbreadth reinforces the conclusion that the pith and substance of the scheme cannot be classified under federal heads of power. \nThe overbreadth of the defined effects within federal jurisdiction is manifested in two distinct ways. First, the definition is central to the schemes decision-making functions. Its overbreadth dilutes the decision makers focus at the key decision-making junctures, shifting it away from federal aspects and encompassing aspects that are within provincial jurisdiction. Second, the defined effects within federal jurisdiction form the basis of the s. 7 prohibitions. Due to the overbreadth of these defined effects, the conduct prohibited by s. 7 extends beyond the range of conduct that Parliament can validly regulate pursuant to its assigned heads of power.\nThe Defined Effects Within Federal Jurisdiction Dilute the Decision Makers Focus at the Key Decision-Making Junctures\nAs discussed, the scheme contains four decision-making junctures: (i) the designation of physical activities as designated projects; (ii) the screening decision; (iii) the delineation of the scope of the impact assessment and the factors to be considered therein; and (iv) the public interest decision and resulting regulation and oversight. The definition of effects within federal jurisdiction is of central importance to most of these key decision-making junctures. First, it is on the basis of potential adverse effects within federal jurisdiction that some physical activities are designated as designated projects (s. 9(1); see also Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement). Second, the ultimate decision made under the scheme is, at least on its face, concerned with whether the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction are in the public interest (ss. 60(1) and 62). Finally, conditions imposed along with a positive public interest determination must be in relation to the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction (s. 64(1)). \nThe defined effects within federal jurisdiction thus influence each of these key decision-making junctures. Due to the overbreadth of this definition, the scheme permits the Minister to designate a project based on effects that cannot be regulated from a federal perspective, to impose conditions in relation to these effects, or to declare these effects not to be in the public interest and put a permanent halt to the project as planned.\nFor example, one of the effects within federal jurisdiction is a change to the environment that would occur . . . in a province other than the one where the physical activity or the designated project is being carried out (s. 2 effects within federal jurisdiction (b)(ii)). The breadth of this interprovincial effects clause is astonishing. The IAAs expansive definition of environment captures every component of the Earth (s. 2):\nenvironment means the components of the Earth, and includes\n\n(a) land, water and air, including all layers of the atmosphere;\n\n(b) all organic and inorganic matter and living organisms; and\n\n(c) the interacting natural systems that include components referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).\nThe interprovincial effects clause therefore captures an unlimited range of interprovincial environmental changes. This would include, for example, greenhouse gas emissions, which this Court has acknowledged represent a pollution problem that is not merely interprovincial, but global, in scope (References re GGPPA, at para. 173). As a result, the IAA expressly permits projects to be designated, assessments to be required and public interest decisions to be made on the basis that a project emits greenhouse gases that cross provincial and national borders.\nCanada submits that this clause of the definition is supported by the POGG power. Specifically, Canada relies on this Courts treatment of the POGG power as the basis for legislation aimed at preventing certain environmental harms. In Crown Zellerbach, this Court considered and applied the national concern branch of the POGG power to legislation that, in pith and substance, was aimed at preventing marine pollution (pp. 431-32 and 436-38). In Interprovincial Co-operatives Ltd. v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 477, Justice Pigeon, for the majority, recognized that the federal government can legislate in relation to the pollution of interprovincial rivers, which is a pollution problem that is not really local in scope but truly interprovincial (p. 514). Although Justice Pigeon did not explicitly refer to the POGG power, the application of that power explains the result (References re GGPPA, at para. 99).\nIn the References re GGPPA, this Court upheld a law whose matter was limited to carbon pricing of greenhouse gas emissions, a narrow and specific regulatory mechanism (para. 199). By contrast, the designated projects schemes defined interprovincial effects lack specificity as to the type or scale of the change to the environment that is said to be a federal effect. In the References re GGPPA, this Court expressly cautioned that [a]ny legislation that related to non-carbon pricing forms of [greenhouse gas] regulation  legislation with respect to roadways, building codes, public transit and home heating, for example  would not fall under the matter of national concern (para. 199). If the matter of national concern recognized by this Court in the References re GGPPA does not extend to enabling the federal government to comprehensively regulate greenhouse gas emissions, then the inclusion of such sweeping regulatory powers in impact assessment legislation is likewise impermissible. \nWhen pressed at the hearing of this appeal, Canada asserted that it is not relying on greenhouse gases as a basis for anchoring jurisdiction over major projects. It is plain, however, that the broadly worded interprovincial effects clause permits Canada to do just that. \nFurthermore, the record demonstrates that the federal government has adopted this very interpretation of interprovincial effects. For example, in a 2019 discussion paper, the federal government explained that onshore oil and gas projects would be included in the Regulations in part because [p]rojects that process or consume large quantities of oil and gas have impacts in areas of federal jurisdiction due to their greenhouse gas emissions (Discussion Paper on the Proposed Project List: A Proposed Impact Assessment System, May 2019 (online), at p. 10). In addition, the Minister has issued letters to project proponents pursuant to s. 17(1) of the IAA to advise that certain projects would cause unacceptable environmental effects within federal jurisdiction. Alberta directed this Courts attention to two such letters, in which the sole unacceptable environmental effects were greenhouse gas emissions (Letter from the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson to Coalspur Mines (Operations) Ltd., June 11, 2021 (online); Letter from the Honourable Steven Guilbeault to Suncor Energy Inc., April 6, 2022 (online)). \nAccordingly, while Canada asserts that it is simply relying on this Courts prior holdings, it is, in substance, attempting to do an end run around this Courts recent national concern jurisprudence. Our jurisprudence has recognized that preventing marine pollution and preventing pollution of interprovincial rivers are matters of national concern. However, Canada has made no attempt to apply the clarified national concern framework set out in the References re GGPPA or to lead any evidence on which to base the recognition of a new and broader matter of national concern (para. 133 and 162-66). With respect, neither have my colleagues, who simply assert that the interprovincial effects clause is a matter of national concern without applying the legal framework or evidentiary requirements endorsed by this Court in the References re GGPPA.\nThe Defined Effects Within Federal Jurisdiction Result in Impermissibly Broad Prohibitions\nThe overbreadth of the effects regulated by the scheme also influences the ongoing supervision and regulation imposed at the back end of the scheme. As discussed, the federal role in impact assessment does not end with the issuance of a decision statement. The scheme provides for ongoing supervision and regulation in the form of mandatory conditions (in the case of a positive decision statement) or prohibitions (in the case of a negative decision statement). The latter  specifically the effects-based prohibitions imposed by s. 7  demonstrate the overbreadth of the defined effects within federal jurisdiction.\nPursuant to s. 7, the proponent of a designated project must not do any act or thing in connection with the carrying out of the designated project, in whole or in part, if that act or thing may cause any of the enumerated effects, which mirror the definition of effects within federal jurisdiction. These effects-based prohibitions play a dual role; they apply as a matter of course during the planning and assessment phases of the scheme, and they serve as an ongoing oversight mechanism following a negative decision statement. \nThe s. 7 effects-based prohibitions may well be necessary for practical reasons during the planning and assessment phases of the impact assessment process, when the potential effects of a proposed project have yet to be identified. However, the indefinite application of these same prohibitions following a negative public interest decision statement raises significant concerns. I note that my colleagues disregard the dual role of the s. 7 prohibitions and focussing exclusively on the temporary pause these prohibitions impose during the planning and assessment phases. They do not address the ongoing regulatory function performed by s. 7 following a negative public interest decision and, as a result, they discount the overbroad and indefinite prohibitions imposed by the IAA.\nThe indefinite s. 7 prohibitions forbid the proponent from doing any act or thing that may cause any change or impact specified in the provision. This prohibits causing any positive or negative changes or impacts of any magnitude. My colleagues, in dissent, assert that the term a change incorporates a significance threshold, such that it describes only changes that are significant, non-trivial or more than de minimis. This interpretation is untenable and is inconsistent with established principles of statutory interpretation. My colleagues point to their reading of the IAAs purposes to support their novel interpretation, but as I have explained, the IAAs purposes are considerably broader than my colleagues suggest. The sole reference to a significance threshold in the IAAs extensive purpose clause is found in s. 6(1)(l), which relates to the distinct secondary scheme contained in ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA. Parliament has expressly incorporated a significance threshold into that secondary scheme (e.g., ss. 82 to 84, 87, 88 and 90, all referring to significant adverse environmental effects). Had Parliament intended the designated projects scheme to target only significant changes, it could have similarly used that adjective in defining effects within federal jurisdiction. It did not do so. This Court must respect Parliaments drafting choices and cannot amend the IAA as it sees fit. As this Court has held, however generously one may interpret the statute, one cannot rewrite it (Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 571, at para. 90; see also Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. SODRAC 2003 Inc., 2015 SCC 57, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 615, at para. 53; Krayzel Corp. v. Equitable Trust Co., 2016 SCC 18, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 273, at para. 32; R. v. Hinchey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1128, at para. 36; R. v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37, at para. 73; M. Mancini, The Purpose Error in the Modern Approach to Statutory Interpretation (2022), 59 Alta. L. Rev. 919, at pp. 921-22). \nAs a result of the overbreadth of the effects within federal jurisdiction, which are mirrored in s. 7, the IAA prohibits the project proponent from doing any act or thing in connection with the carrying out of the designated project, in whole or in part, following a negative public interest determination. This is so even where federal legislative authority does not support such wide-ranging regulation of the proposed project. A few examples will illustrate this point. \nFollowing a negative decision statement, the proponent must not do any act or thing in connection with the carrying out of the project that may cause . . . a change to . . . fish and fish habitat (s. 7(1)(a)(i)). But in Fowler v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 213, this Court struck down a provision of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-14, that prohibited the deposit of logging debris into water frequented by fish because the provision made no attempt to link the proscribed conduct to actual or potential harm to fisheries (p. 226; see also Hogg and Wright, at  30:26). Were Parliament to amend the Fisheries Act to include a prohibition against doing any act or thing that may cause a change to fish or fish habitat, the prohibition would be invalid for the same reason. Yet this is precisely the prohibition that s. 7 imposes.\nSimilar issues arise with respect to the prohibitions related to the health, social and economic conditions of Indigenous peoples and Indigenous cultural heritage (s. 7(1)(c) and (d)). I acknowledge that the unique position of Indigenous peoples means that designated projects may affect them differently than other residents of a province and that, by virtue of s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, the federal government is vested with primary constitutional responsibility for securing the welfare of Indigenous peoples (Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at para. 176). Nonetheless, the schemes indefinite prohibitions, following a negative decision statement, on any act or thing that may have an impact on or cause any change to these areas overshoot Parliaments legislative authority under s. 91(24). \nTo place these prohibitions in context, it is useful to recall that there are specific provisions in the IAA for projects on federal lands, including reserves under the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5 (s. 82), and projects that require the exercise of a federal power, duty or function or that involve federal funding (s. 8). Accordingly, the s. 7 prohibitions must be aimed at capturing privately or provincially funded projects that are on provincial lands and that do not otherwise require the exercise of a federal power, duty or function. \nSection 7(1)(c) prohibits doing any act or thing in connection with the carrying out of a designated project that may cause, with respect to the Indigenous peoples of Canada, an impact  occurring in Canada and resulting from any change to the environment  on (i) physical and cultural heritage, (ii) the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes, or (iii) any structure, site or thing that is of historical, archaeological, paleontological or architectural significance. This prohibition is cast broadly, capturing both positive and adverse impacts of any magnitude that are caused by any change (again, positive or adverse) to any component of the Earth. \nSection 7(1)(d) is also framed as a broad and general prohibition. It prohibits doing any act or thing that may cause any change occurring in Canada to the health, social or economic conditions of the Indigenous peoples of Canada. While s. 7(4) provides an exception for changes that are non-adverse where the council, government or other entity that is authorized to act on behalf of the Indigenous group, community or people consents, this does little to narrow the prohibition. Section 7(1)(d) continues to bar any acts that may cause a combination of adverse and non-adverse changes, even with the consent of the affected Indigenous group, community or people. \nUltimately, these provisions do not bring the matter of the scheme within the scope of s. 91(24). The indefinite prohibition on acts that may cause even trivial or non-adverse impacts is inconsistent with s. 91(24)s focus on protection of and concern for the welfare of Indigenous peoples (Delgamuukw, at para. 176). \nFinally, a proponent is prohibited from doing anything in connection with the carrying out of a project that would cause a change to migratory birds, as that term is defined in s. 2(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, S.C. 1994, c. 22 (s. 7(1)(a)(iii)). Canada submits that this prohibition flows from Parliaments power to implement Treaties between the Empire and . . . Foreign Countries under s. 132 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Neither of the parties devoted much attention in their written or oral submissions to this prohibition or to Canadas reliance on s. 132. \nThe original convention entered into by the British Empire and the United States was the Convention Between the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada and the United States, August 16, 1916, [1917] Gr. Brit. T.S. No. 7 (Cd. 8476). Canada and the United States later amended that convention in 1995 through a protocol (Protocol between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America Amending the 1916 Convention between the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada and the United States, Can. T.S. 1999 No. 34). Canada then implemented the protocol domestically through the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994. \nIt is far from obvious that s. 132 covers the substantial amendments made by Canada to an imperial treaty. Even if this were the case, the matter of the designated projects scheme cannot be said to fall within federal jurisdiction. Given my conclusion that the matter of that scheme cannot be classified as falling under s. 91(12), s. 91(24) or the POGG power, federal legislative jurisdiction with respect to migratory birds is not sufficient by itself to support the constitutional validity of the s. 7 prohibition or the IAA more broadly (see Crown Zellerbach, at p. 422). The designated projects scheme does not, in pith and substance, relate exclusively to the implementation of a British Empire treaty for the protection of migratory birds.\nConclusion on the Classification of the Designated Projects Regulatory Scheme\nIn sum, I am satisfied that the matter of the designated projects scheme cannot be classified under federal heads of power and that the scheme is therefore ultra vires. Its pith and substance is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social and economic impacts. It exceeds the bounds of federal jurisdiction for two overarching reasons. First, even if this Court were to accept Canadas submission that the defined effects within federal jurisdiction are within federal jurisdiction, these effects do not drive the schemes decision-making functions. Consequently, the scheme is not in pith and substance directed at regulating these effects. Second, I do not accept Canadas submission that effects within federal jurisdiction comport with federal legislative competence under s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867. As I have explained, this overbroad definition further dilutes the focus of the schemes decision-making functions. It also extends the conduct prohibited by s. 7 beyond that which Parliament can validly regulate pursuant to its assigned heads of power.\nRather, the designated projects scheme intrudes more than incidentally into the provinces constitutional sphere. As I explained, that sphere encompasses exclusive legislative jurisdiction to regulate in areas including property and civil rights in the province (s. 92(13)), matters of a local nature (s. 92(16)), local works and undertakings (s. 92(10)), and non-renewable natural resources, forestry resources, and electrical energy (s. 92A).\nAs I emphasized at the outset, it is clear that Parliament can enact legislation to protect the environment under the heads of power assigned to it in the Constitution Act, 1867. It is also open to Parliament to enact an impact assessment scheme as part of its laudable pursuit of environmental protection and sustainability. In this respect, I am in agreement with my colleagues, in dissent, as well as Greckol J.A. in the Court of Appeal. However, such a scheme must be consistently focused on federal matters. At certain stages of an impact assessment process, the focus on federal matters will necessarily be imperfect or imprecise. Projects ought to be designated based on their potential effects on areas of federal jurisdiction because, as I have explained, requiring definitive proof of such effects would put the cart before the horse. At the assessment stage, it would be both artificial and uncertain to limit the factors that can be considered to those that are federal. But, for the scheme to be intra vires, its main thrust must be directed at federal matters. The Agencys screening decision must be rooted in the possibility of adverse federal effects. The public interest decision must focus on the acceptability of the adverse federal effects. The scheme must ensure that, in situations where the activity itself does not fall under federal jurisdiction, the decision does not veer towards regulating the project qua project or evaluating the wisdom of proceeding with the project as a whole. Finally, the effects regulated by the scheme must align with federal legislative competence. When they exceed these bounds  as the effects within federal jurisdiction do  their overbreadth permeates the schemes decision-making functions and prohibitions and thereby dilutes the schemes focus on federal matters. \nThe Scheme for Non-Designated Projects on Federal Lands or Outside Canada\nHaving concluded that the designated projects component of the scheme is ultra vires Parliament, I now turn back to the secondary scheme contained in ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA. I have little trouble in concluding that this secondary scheme is intra vires Parliament.\nFirst, I note that these provisions have not been challenged as unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal impliedly accepted that this portion of the scheme is intra vires when it reasoned that the inclusion in this legislative scheme [of] two distinct regimes, one of which is constitutionally intra vires, does not enhance the constitutionality of the other (para. 191). Though the Court of Appeal concluded that the scheme was ultra vires in its entirety, it provided no reasons for declining to separate out the manifestly distinct scheme established by ss. 81 to 91 (para. 191). I recognize that this may have been a consequence of Canadas position on appeal that the scheme must stand or fall as a whole. Canada abandoned that position before this Court. Nonetheless, it remains the case that no serious challenge has been levelled against ss. 81 to 91. \nSecond, and as discussed, the process established by ss. 81 to 91 resembles the Guidelines Order process that this Court upheld in Oldman River. The Guidelines Order, just like ss. 81 to 91, provided direction to federal authorities exercising their decision-making power in relation to projects that they undertook or funded themselves on federal lands or outside Canada. The federal government can consider all potential impacts of the projects it undertakes or funds and make decisions about those projects accordingly. \nIn my view, though the test for severance in division of powers cases is stringent, ss. 81 to 91 can be separated from the balance of the scheme and upheld as constitutional. These provisions are not inextricably bound up with the part declared invalid, and it can be assumed that the Legislature would have enacted them on their own (Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada, [1947] A.C. 503 (P.C.), at p. 518; see also Harper v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 33, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827, at para. 46, per McLachlin C.J. and Major J., dissenting in part, but not on this point of law; Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, at para. 18, per McLachlin C.J.). \nIn light of the fundamental differences between ss. 81 to 91 and the designated projects portion of the scheme, this Courts holding in Oldman River in respect of a scheme resembling the one in ss. 81 to 91, and the absence of any serious challenge to these provisions, I am satisfied that ss. 81 to 91 are constitutional and should not fall with the rest of the scheme.\nAdditional Issues\nBefore concluding, I will deal briefly with two discrete arguments. \nFirst, Alberta has raised the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. It suggests that if the designated projects portion of the scheme is intra vires, then it is inapplicable to intra-provincial projects by virtue of this doctrine. As I have concluded that this portion of the scheme is ultra vires, I need not address this alternative argument. \nSecond, I would not grant the motion to adduce fresh evidence made by the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario. The evidence relates to a provincial highway, Highway 413, which has been subject to the IAAs planning phase since May 3, 2021. Ontario has failed to establish that this evidence, when taken with the other evidence adduced, could reasonably be expected to have affected the result in this appeal (Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775). The evidence does not demonstrate anything that is not already apparent from a close reading of the legislative scheme. Furthermore, in the circumstances of this case, I would decline to exercise this Courts discretion to receive further evidence (see, e.g., Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297, at p. 318; Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, s. 62(3); Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR/2002-156, r. 46(2)).\nConclusion\nIn my view, the reference questions should be answered in the affirmative. The federal impact assessment scheme, consisting of the Impact Assessment Act and the accompanying Physical Activities Regulations, is unconstitutional in part. Although the process set forth in ss. 81 to 91 of the IAA is constitutional and can be separated out, the balance of the scheme  that is, the designated projects portion  is ultra vires Parliament and thus unconstitutional. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part.\nAs I stated at the outset, there is no doubt that Parliament can enact impact assessment legislation to minimize the risks that some major projects pose to the environment. This scheme plainly overstepped the mark. But it remains open to Parliament to design environmental legislation, so long as it respects the division of powers. Moreover, it is open to Parliament and the provincial legislatures to exercise their respective powers over the environment harmoniously, in the spirit of cooperative federalism. While it is not for this Court to direct Parliament as to the way forward, I note the growing practice of resolving the complex governance problems that arise in federations . . . by seeking cooperative solutions that meet the needs of the country as a whole as well as its constituent parts (Reference re Securities Act, at para. 132). Through respect for the division of powers in Canadas constitutional structure, both levels of government can exercise leadership in environmental protection and ensure the continued health of our shared environment (Hydro-Quebec, at para. 154).\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tKarakatsanis and Jamal JJ.  \nIntroduction\nThis reference asks for the Courts opinion on whether the Parliament of Canada has the legislative jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867 to enact the modern federal environmental assessment regime in the Impact Assessment Act, S.C. 2019, c. 28, s. 1 (IAA), and related Physical Activities Regulations, SOR/2019-285 (Regulations). In our view, the answer is yes. Both the IAA and Regulations are constitutional in their entirety.\nFor decades, this Court has recognized that the Constitution is a framework for life and political action in Canada and must be interpreted to ensure that Canadian federalism operates flexibly (Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 42). Our jurisprudence instructs courts to approach both federal and provincial legislation from a posture of respect by applying a presumption that legislators enact laws with a good-faith intent to stay within the limits of their jurisdiction, and by interpreting legislation to comply with the Constitution when possible (Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Quebec Police Commission, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 618, at p. 641, citing Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, [1957] S.C.R. 198, at p. 255; see also Murray-Hall v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2023 SCC 10, at para. 79; Desgagnes Transport Inc. v. Wartsila Canada Inc., 2019 SCC 58, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 228, at para. 28).\nTo date, these themes have animated this Courts environmental jurisprudence. The Court has stated that the environment, by its very nature, is broad, diffuse, and all-pervasive (Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 37 and 64). Because the environment touches on federal and provincial heads of power, all levels of government bear an all-important duty to use their powers to protect the environment (R. v. Hydro-Quebec, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 213, at para. 86). This Court has also recognized that [t]he social importance of environmental protection is obvious, yet the nature of the environment does not lend itself to precise codification (Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031 (Canadian Pacific), at para. 51). It has therefore warned that a strict requirement of drafting precision in the environmental protection context might well undermine the ability of the legislature to provide for a comprehensive and flexible regime, and may hinder, rather than promote, public understanding of what conduct is prohibited (paras. 52-53).\nInterpreting the IAA and Regulations, and evaluating their constitutionality, requires the Court to continue in the tradition of flexibility, cooperation, and mutual respect that has characterized its recent federalism jurisprudence. The IAA and Regulations build on earlier federal environmental assessment regimes to establish a modern regulatory regime that allows federal authorities to assess the impacts of designated major projects and to determine whether they are in the public interest, despite their adverse effects in areas of federal jurisdiction. The IAA contains two distinct schemes: a primary scheme addressing physical activities designated as designated projects, which takes up most of the IAA, and a secondary scheme in ss. 81 to 91 that applies to federal projects. Like the majority of this Court, we focus on the designated projects regulatory scheme, because there is no dispute that the secondary scheme in ss. 81 to 91 for projects funded by the federal government or carried out either on federal lands or outside Canada is intra vires Parliament (paras. 207-11). Parliament undoubtedly has legislative jurisdiction to regulate projects that federal authorities undertake or fund (majority reasons, para. 209).\nAs for the balance of the IAA, in enacting the designated projects regime, Parliament chose broad language for what constitutes an effec[t] within federal jurisdiction under the IAA  for example, any change to fish and fish habitat (s. 2 effects within federal jurisdiction (a)(i)). Parliament similarly chose general language to detail the factors decision makers must consider in determining whether allowing a projects direct or incidental effects and effects within federal jurisdiction (collectively referred to below as adverse federal effects) is in the public interest  for example, sustainability (s. 22(1)(h)). This approach is neither novel nor concerning.\nLike all regulatory regimes, the IAA scheme is constrained by the statute itself and by the Constitution. The IAAs text, context, and purpose demonstrate that all major decisions under the federal impact assessment scheme must be based on a projects adverse effects within federal jurisdiction. The presumption that legislatures do not intend to exceed the constitutional limits on their authority confirms this interpretation. The breadth of the factors that may be considered under the IAA scheme simply ensures that federal authorities can make a fully informed decision on whether a project that adversely impacts areas of federal jurisdiction should be allowed to proceed based on identified and transparent public interest considerations. Federal authorities are directed to make an integrated decision that involves a cost-benefit analysis weighing the adverse federal effects against the projects other positive and negative effects. \nInterpreting the IAA with reference to its purpose and effects, consistently with this Courts cooperative, flexible approach to the division of powers, we conclude that the IAAs subject matter is to establish an environmental assessment process to (1) assess the effects of major projects on federal lands, Indigenous peoples, fisheries, migratory birds, and lands, air, or waters outside Canada or in provinces other than where a project is located, and (2) determine whether to impose restrictions on those projects and to safeguard against adverse effects in those areas, based on whether the adverse effects are significant, unless allowing those effects is in the public interest.\nThe subject matter of the IAA is anchored in several federal heads of legislative power under the Constitution Act, 1867 in relation to fisheries and aquatic species (s. 91(12)), migratory birds (s. 132), Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians (s. 91(24)), and interprovincial and international pollution (s. 91). Particular instances of government action that may exceed statutory authority, federal jurisdiction, or both, can be challenged on judicial review in future cases with a well-developed evidentiary record, rather than through this reference. The fact that the IAA could conceivably be used unconstitutionally in some cases does not mean that the legislation is unconstitutional.\nWe agree with Greckol J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal of Alberta, and with much of her analysis. In our opinion, the IAA and Regulations are intra vires Parliament.\nFederalism and the Environment\nThe common future of all Canadians  and humanity as a whole  depends on a healthy environment (114957 Canada Ltee (Spraytech, Societe darrosage) v. Hudson (Town), 2001 SCC 40, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241, at para. 1). Over 25 years ago, this Court recognized that environmental protection had become a major challenge of our time (Hydro-Quebec, at para. 127). Since then, major environmental risks have only intensified. As this Court recently warned, the environmental harms caused by climate change pose an existential challenge and a threat of the highest order to the country, and indeed to the world (References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11 (References re GGPPA), at para. 167). Today, [t]he undisputed existence of a threat to the future of humanity cannot be ignored (para. 167).\nThe environment, by its very nature, is complex and diffuse (Canadian Pacific, at para. 43; Oldman River, at pp. 37 and 64; Spraytech, at para. 33; Hydro-Quebec, at para. 86). This Court has recognized that the environment is not a subject matter assigned to either Parliament or the provinces under the Constitution Act, 1867, but instead cuts across many different areas of constitutional responsibility, some federal, some provincial (Hydro-Quebec, at para. 112; Oldman River, at pp. 63-64; Spraytech, at para. 33). Environmental protection requires action by all levels of government because each  whether by action or inaction  can affect the environment (Hydro-Quebec, at para. 127; Oldman River, at p. 65; Canadian Pacific, at paras. 59 and 84). This shared responsibility is neither unusual nor unworkable in a federal state such as Canada (Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada (National Energy Board), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 159, at p. 193). Rather, it reflects this Courts flexible approach to federalism, which recognizes that overlapping powers are unavoidable and intergovernmental cooperation is essential (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 42; see also References re GGPPA, at para. 50).\nBecause the Constitution is a framework for life and political action in Canada, this Court has directed that courts must approach constitutional interpretation in a way that allows governments to address complex and evolving issues and that foster[s] co-operation among governments and legislatures for the common good (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 22; see also para. 42). The dominant tide of modern constitutional interpretation finds expression in the idea that a court should favour, where possible, the ordinary operation of statutes enacted by both levels of government (para. 37 (emphasis in original)). Thus, [i]n the absence of conflicting enactments of the other level of government, the Court should avoid blocking the application of measures which are taken to be enacted in furtherance of the public interest (para. 37; see also Canada (Attorney General) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, at para. 63; Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation, 2018 SCC 48, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 189, at para. 17). This Court has repeatedly stressed that overlap of legislation is to be expected and accommodated in a federal state (Reference re Firearms Act (Can.), 2000 SCC 31, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783, at para. 26, quoting General Motors of Canada Ltd. v. City National Leasing, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 641, at p. 669). Cooperative federalism and the modern approach to constitutional interpretation must guide every step of the analysis in this reference.\nThis modern approach to constitutional interpretation is reflected in the presumption of constitutionality. According to this presumption, every legislative provision is presumed to be intra vires the level of government that enacted it (Murray-Hall, at para. 79). The party challenging legislation that has emerged from the democratic process bears the onus of demonstrating that the enactment does not fall within the legislatures jurisdiction (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  15:13; Murray-Hall, at para. 80; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 25; P. Daly, Constitutionally Conforming Interpretation in Canada, in M. Klatt, ed., Constitutionally Conforming Interpretation  Comparative Perspectives, vol. 1, National Reports (forthcoming), at p. 8; H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at para. IV.56). The presumption of constitutionality was helpfully explained by Beetz J. in Canadian Broadcasting Corp.:\nMany statutes are drafted in terms so general that it is possible to give them a meaning which makes them ultra vires. It is then necessary to interpret them in light of the Constitution, because it must be assumed the legislator did not intend to exceed his authority: \n\nThere is a presumptio juris as to the existence of the bona fide intention of a legislative body to confine itself to its own sphere and a presumption of similar nature that general words in a statute are not intended to extend its operation beyond the territorial authority of the Legislature. \n\n(p. 641, quoting Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, at p. 255, per Fauteux J.)\nIt bears emphasis that legislation is not unconstitutional simply because it could conceivably be misused. Rather, the particular exercises of discretion in such cases would be unreasonable and properly subject to judicial review based on an appropriate evidentiary record. That approach flows from what Professor Daly calls the presumption of constitutionally conforming administration (p. 1). As he explains, [w]here there is a constitutional challenge to a legislative regime which is administered by an administrative decision-maker, the courts will presume that the regime will be administered in a constitutionally compliant manner (p. 7). Because any statute enacted by Parliament or a legislature that is inconsistent with the Constitution is ultra vires and invalid, any body exercising statutory authority . . . is also bound by the Constitution (Hogg and Wright, at  37:8). The alternative  treating broad grants of statutory discretion as unconstitutional based on the texts furthest reaches, without regard for constitutional or administrative law constraints  would render ultra vires many provincial and federal statutes currently in force.\nFor present purposes, the presumption of constitutionality has two related legal consequences. First, as noted by Professors Hogg and Wright, in choosing between competing, plausible characterizations of a law, the court should normally choose that one that would support the validity of the law ( 15:13; see also Daly, at p. 7; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at para. IV.57; G.-A. Beaudoin, in collaboration with P. Thibault, La constitution du Canada (3rd ed. 2004), at p. 338). Second, where a law is open to both a narrow and a wide interpretation, and under the wide interpretation the laws application would extend beyond the powers of the enacting legislative body, the court should read down the law so as to confine it to those applications that are within the power of the enacting legislative body (Hogg and Wright, at  15:13; Daly, at p. 10; Brun, Tremblay and Brouillet, at paras. IV.47 and IV.57). The presumption of constitutionality operates as a principle of [j]udicial restraint in determining the validity of statutes that has the effect of reducing interference by unelected judges with the affairs of the elected legislative branch of government (Hogg and Wright, at  15:13). The presumption remains a cardinal principle of our division of powers jurisprudence (Murray-Hall, at para. 79). \nIn applying these principles of constitutional interpretation, courts have upheld the constitutionality of both federal and provincial environmental legislation (Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Corporation of the Parish of Notre Dame de Bonsecours, [1899] A.C. 367 (P.C.); Northwest Falling Contractors Ltd. v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 292; R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd., [1988] 1 S.C.R. 401; Oldman River; Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1028; Hydro-Quebec; Spraytech; References re GGPPA). However, where Parliament or provincial legislatures have plainly overstepped their constitutional competence, legislation has been found unconstitutional (Interprovincial Co-operatives Ltd. v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 477; Fowler v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 213; Reference re Environmental Management Act, 2020 SCC 1, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 3). As we will explain, that cannot be said about Parliament in enacting the IAA.\nAlthough the principles of cooperative federalism inform all stages of the division of powers analysis, concerns for flexibility and cooperation cannot override the division of powers (References re GGPPA, at para. 50). Courts must recognize and respect the constitutional bargain struck with respect to the exclusive catalogue of both federal and provincial powers. One such head of power is s. 92A, which was intended to fortif[y] a provinces exclusive legislative jurisdiction over non-renewable natural resources in the province by seeking to respond to . . . insecurity about provincial jurisdiction over resources, including by authorizing the provinces for the first time, . . . to legislate for the export of resources to other provinces subject to Parliaments paramount legislative power in the area (Ontario Hydro v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 327, at pp. 376-77). As with other provincial heads of power, the constitutional bargain underlying s. 92A is one that this Court must recognize and respect.\nTo sum up, the goals of flexibility and cooperation animate this Courts federalism jurisprudence, including in the environmental context. Legislation must be approached from a posture of respect and presumed good faith on the part of legislatures, interpreted to comply with constitutional limits, and evaluated on the basis that the courts should favour the operation of statutes enacted by both levels of government whenever possible.\nThe Evolution of Federal Environmental Assessment Regimes\nCanada has had four federal environmental assessment regimes since 1984: (1) the Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order, SOR/84-467 (Guidelines Order); (2) the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, S.C. 1992, c. 37 (CEAA 1992); (3) the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, S.C. 2012, c. 19, s. 52 (CEAA 2012); and (4) since 2019, the IAA. Although these regimes have evolved considerably over the past 40 years, they have also maintained strong threads of continuity.\nIn broad terms, all the federal environmental assessment regimes have shared three core elements.\nFirst, all the federal regimes have used a stage-based information-gathering and decision-making process. At the initial stage, federal authorities evaluate the projects effects to determine whether further assessment is warranted (Guidelines Order, s. 10; CEAA 1992, ss. 18 and 21; CEAA 2012, s. 8; IAA, ss. 10 to 15). If it is, then the projects effects are examined more closely and an assessment report is prepared (Guidelines Order, s. 12; CEAA 1992, s. 34; CEAA 2012, ss. 19 to 25; IAA, s. 28). Ultimately, federal authorities decide whether the projects adverse effects should be allowed (Guidelines Order, s. 12; CEAA 1992, s. 37; CEAA 2012, s. 52(1); IAA, ss. 60 to 63).\nSecond, all the federal regimes have considered a broad range of effects  including health, social, and economic effects  rather than just effects on the physical environment (Guidelines Order, s. 4; CEAA 1992, s. 2(1); CEAA 2012, ss. 4(1), 5(1) and 19(1); IAA, ss. 22 and 63). Parliament has long recognized the link between the environment, the economy, and health by identifying sustainable development as a key purpose of environmental assessment regimes (CEAA 1992, s. 4(b); CEAA 2012, s. 4(1)(h); IAA, s. 6(1)(a)).\nThird, to focus assessment efforts, all the federal regimes have used lists of projects considered likely to have significant environmental effects by providing that listed projects skip initial screening and go straight to assessment (Guidelines Order, s. 11(b)); that listed projects would undergo more intensive evaluation at the initial stage (CEAA 1992, s. 59(b); Comprehensive Study List Regulations, SOR/94-368); or that only listed projects would be subject to the federal regime (CEAA 2012, s. 84(a); IAA, s. 109(b)).\nParliament has also changed the federal regimes over time, moving from a model in which projects were assessed only if they required federal involvement (such as a federal permit or federal funding) to a model in which projects were assessed only if they could have significant adverse effects in areas of federal authority. This change allowed Parliament to focus federal assessment efforts on a much smaller number of major projects. \nThe Guidelines Order and the CEAA 1992 applied to projects or proposals initiated by the federal government, those for which a federal authority had a decision-making function (such as a permit or licence requirement), and those that received federal funding (Guidelines Order, s. 6; CEAA 1992, s. 5(1)). Under those triggers, the CEAA 1992 regime applied to roughly five to six thousand projects annually (Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR/2012-147, Canada Gazette, Part II, vol. 146, No. 15, July 18, 2012). \nBy contrast, the CEAA 1992 and IAA designated projects for assessment based on the likelihood that the project would cause effects in areas of federal authority. Under the CEAA 2012, Parliament eliminated federal initiation, funding, and decision-making functions as triggers for assessment (House of Commons, Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, Statutory Review of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act: Protecting the Environment, Managing our Resources (2012), at pp. 9 and 13). Instead, Parliament decided that the federal assessment regime would apply only to projects designated by inclusion in the Regulations, commonly known as the Project List, or by the Minister, based on their potential to cause adverse effects in areas of federal authority, such as in relation to fish, aquatic species, migratory birds, or Indigenous peoples (CEAA 2012, ss. 4(1)(a) and 5(1)(a); IAA ss. 9(1) and 109(b)). This change significantly narrowed the scope of the federal environmental assessment regimes under both statutes. While the CEAA 1992 applied to thousands of projects annually, the CEAA 2012 regime applied to only about 70 projects (A. Johnston et al., Is Canadas Impact Assessment Act Working?, May 2021 (online), at p. 32, note 4; Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, Departmental Results Report 2017-18 (2018), at p. 19). Similarly, only seven new projects entered the IAA regime during its first year (Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, Departmental Results Report 2020-21 (2021), at p. 8).\nThe Impact Assessment Act\nThe IAA builds on earlier federal environmental assessment regimes by establishing a multi-stage process to assess the effects of designated projects and protect against adverse effects in specified areas, unless allowing them would be in the public interest. Under the designated projects scheme, the adverse federal effects act as a jurisdictional trigger and impact each stage of the IAA regime (as it did under the CEAA 2012). An impact assessment under the IAA moves from designation of a project, to the statutory prohibitions, to three main phases of an environmental impact assessment process: a planning phase, an impact assessment phase, and a decision-making phase based on public interest considerations.\nDesignation of Projects on the Project List Based on Adverse Federal Effects\nThe main scheme of the IAA applies only to designated projects. A designated project is defined as one or more physical activities that are carried out in Canada or on federal lands and that are designated by regulations or by order of the Minister of the Environment, if the Minister is of the opinion that the physical activity may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or adverse direct or incidental effects, or public concerns related to those effects warrant the designation (s. 9(1)). Designated projects are listed under the Project List, described further below.\nThe generic term effects and the two more specific terms adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and direct or incidental effects are each defined under the IAA and play an important role at each stage of the assessment process: \neffects is defined as meaning, unless the context requires otherwise, changes to the environment or to health, social or economic conditions and the positive and negative consequences of these changes (s. 2); \ndirect or incidental effects are defined, in essence, as effects that flow from the federal government exercising a power or providing financial assistance to allow a physical activity or designated project to proceed (s. 2);\neffects within federal jurisdiction are defined, substantially similarly as environmental effects in the CEAA 2012, with respect to a physical activity or a designated project as (a) a change to certain components of the environment within the legislative authority of Parliament, including fish and fish habitat, aquatic species, or migratory birds; (b) any change to the environment on federal lands, in another province, or outside Canada; (c) any change to the environment of Indigenous peoples that has an impact on physical and cultural heritage, use of lands for traditional purposes, or structures of significance; (d) any change to the health, social or economic conditions of Indigenous peoples; or (e) any change to a health, social or economic matter within the legislative authority of Parliament set out in Sch. 3 (as yet undefined) (s. 2).\nThe Regulations, or Project List, contain a list of physical activities designated as projects to which the IAA applies. The objective of the Project List is to identify those major projects with the greatest potential for adverse effects on areas of federal jurisdiction related to the environment, so that they can enter into the impact assessment process (Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR/2019-285, Canada Gazette, Part II, vol. 153, No. 17, August 21, 2019, at p. 5661). It was developed using the previous list under the CEAA 2012 as a starting point (p. 5661). The Project List currently includes the following categories of physical activities based on listed criteria: National Parks and Protected Areas, Defence, Mines and Metal Mills, Nuclear Facilities, Including Certain Storage and Long-term Management or Disposal Facilities, Oil, Gas and Other Fossil Fuels, Electrical Transmission Lines and Pipelines, Renewable Energy, Transport, Hazardous Waste, and Water Projects.\nProhibitions\nDesignation of a physical activity as a designated project under the IAA triggers a range of prohibitions, pausing activity that may cause federal effects while such effects can be assessed and decided on. Proponents of designated projects are prohibited from taking actions that would cause prohibited effects, defined in identical terms to effects within federal jurisdiction in s. 2 (s. 7). Federal authorities are also prohibited from acting under any other federal legislation to permit the designated project to proceed and from financially supporting the designated project (s. 8).\nA designated project then proceeds, as required, through the phases of the environmental impact assessment process under the IAA: (1) the planning phase, (2) the impact assessment phase, and (3) the decision-making phase (also known as the public interest determination). Each phase is described briefly below.\nThe Planning Phase\nAll designated projects enter the planning phase. At this stage, the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada gathers information about the designated project from the proponent; provides the public with an opportunity to participate meaningfully in its preparations for a possible impact assessment of the project; offers to consult another jurisdiction that has powers, duties, or functions in relation to an assessment of the environmental effects of the designated project and any Indigenous group that may be affected by the carrying out of the designated project; and then decides whether an impact assessment is necessary (ss. 10 to 12 and 16). The Agencys decision must be based on several factors, including the possibility that the carrying out of the designated project may cause adverse [federal] effects or have an adverse impact on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (s. 16(2)). If the Agency determines that an impact assessment is unnecessary, the prohibitions terminate and the project exits the regime (s. 7(3)(a)). Otherwise, the project proceeds to the impact assessment phase.\nThe Impact Assessment Phase\nAt the impact assessment phase, the Agency gathers more information about the designated project from the proponent, ensures public participation in the impact assessment process, and prepares an impact assessment report (ss. 19(1) and (2), 27 and 28). The report must set out what effects the Agency views as likely to be caused by the carrying out of the designated project, which of those effects are adverse federal effects, and the extent to which those likely adverse effects are significant (s. 28(3)). The report must consider a broad range of factors, including mitigation measures, the purpose and need for the designated project, alternative means of carrying out the project, and impacts of the project on any Indigenous group and any adverse impact the project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (s. 22(1)).\nThe Decision-Making Phase (the Public Interest Determination)\nFinally, the Minister or Governor in Council decides whether allowing the likely and adverse federal effects of a designated project, as detailed in the report, is in the public interest and, if so, whether specific conditions should be imposed (ss. 60(1) and 62). The IAA lists the public interest factors that the relevant decision maker must consider: (1) the extent to which the adverse federal effects of the project are significant, the extent to which the project contributes to sustainability, and the extent to which the effects of the project hinder or contribute to Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and climate change commitments; (2) impacts of the project on Indigenous groups or the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982; and (3) whether mitigation measures may alleviate the adverse federal effects of the project (s. 63). The Minister must provide detailed reasons demonstrating that the determination was based on the impact assessment report and considered all the required public interest factors (s. 65(2)). Any conditions imposed on the project may relate only to a projects adverse federal effects (s. 64). A positive public interest determination means that all prohibitions terminate, provided that the proponent of the designated project complies with any conditions imposed (s. 7(3)(b)).\nAnalysis\nA court reviewing a law on federalism grounds proceeds in two steps: first, the court characterizes the challenged law by determining its pith and substance or dominant or most important characteristic; second, based on that characterization, the court classifies the law by assigning it to one or more of the heads of legislative power under the Constitution Act, 1867 (Murray-Hall, at paras. 22-23; Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, 2020 SCC 17, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 283, at para. 26; References re GGPPA, at para. 47; Hogg and Wright, at  15:4).\nCharacterization of the Impact Assessment Act Scheme\nTo characterize a challenged law, a court must determine its dominant or most important characteristic by considering the laws purpose and its practical and legal effects (Murray-Hall, at paras. 23-24; References re GGPPA, at para. 51; Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, at paras. 28 and 30; Hogg and Wright, at  15:5). The laws secondary objectives or incidental effects do not affect its constitutionality, even though they may be of significant practical importance (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 28; PHS Community Services, at para. 51; Global Securities Corp. v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), 2000 SCC 21, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 494, at para. 23). The pith and substance doctrine is founded on the recognition that, in a federal state like Canada, with legislative jurisdiction divided between two levels of government, it is in practice impossible for a legislature to exercise its jurisdiction over a matter effectively without incidentally affecting matters within the jurisdiction of another level of government (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 29).\nCharacterizing or determining the pith and substance of a challenged law requires interpreting the law and should not be approached in a technical or formalistic manner (Murray-Hall, at para. 24, quoting Ward v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 17, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 569, at para. 18, and P. W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada (loose-leaf ed.), vol. 1, at pp. 15-12 and 15-13; References re GGPPA, at para. 51). Whether the law will achieve its intended purpose relates to the laws wisdom or efficacy and is a matter exclusively for the enacting legislature to consider (Murray-Hall, at para. 44; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 18; Reference re Securities Act, 2011 SCC 66, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 837, at para. 90).\nAs part of the characterization exercise, the law should be described as precisely as possible, without considering potential heads of power that might support the law, to avoid the characterization stage being overly influenced by the classification stage (References re GGPPA, at paras. 52 and 56; Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, at paras. 31-32).\nIn what follows, we first address the purpose of the IAA based on intrinsic and extrinsic evidence, followed by the schemes legal and practical effects. \nWe disagree with the majoritys conclusion that the pith and substance of the designated projects scheme of the IAA is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social and economic impacts (para. 76; see also paras. 6, 109 and 204). In our view, the pith and substance of the designated projects scheme is, more specifically, to establish an environmental assessment process to (1) assess the effects of physical activities or major projects on federal lands, Indigenous peoples, fisheries, migratory birds, and lands, air, or waters outside Canada or in provinces other than where a project is located, and (2) determine whether to impose restrictions on the project to safeguard against significant adverse federal effects, unless allowing those effects is in the public interest. This description of the pith and substance is more precise and highlights the critical role of the public interest decision-making process under the legislation.\nPurpose\nTo determine a laws purpose, a court looks to intrinsic evidence, such as the laws text, title, and structure, as well as any preamble and purpose clause, and extrinsic evidence, such as parliamentary debates, minutes of parliamentary committees, legislative history, and the events preceding the enactment of the law (Murray-Hall, at para. 25; Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, at para. 34; References re GGPPA, at para. 62).\nThe intrinsic and extrinsic evidence shows that the purpose of the IAA is to establish a transparent information-gathering and decision-making process about whether physical activities or designated projects have adverse federal effects, and if so, whether they should be permitted in the public interest, with or without conditions.\nIntrinsic Evidence\nWe agree with the majority that the intrinsic evidence suggests that the purpose of the IAA is to establish an information-gathering process in the service of an ultimate decision-making function (para. 81). We would add, however, that the information-gathering process and decision-making function are more specifically directed at whether the project under consideration has any adverse effects within federal jurisdiction as defined in s. 2 of the IAA, and, if so, whether those effects are nonetheless in the public interest.\nThis more precise purpose of the IAA  to establish an information-gathering process and decision-making function as to whether designated projects have adverse federal effects and if so, whether it is in the public interest to allow them to go forward  is reflected in several aspects of the intrinsic evidence. As the majority notes, the long title of the statute  An Act respecting a federal process for impact assessments and the prevention of significant adverse environmental effects  highlights that the legislation establishes a federal process designed to prevent those environmental effects that are both significant and adverse and would . . . seem to indicate a fairly tailored scheme (para. 78). This purpose permeates the text and structure of the legislation. At every stage, the major decisions taken by federal authorities under the IAA are closely linked to adverse federal effects:\nThe Minister may designate projects based on their potential to cause adverse federal effects (s. 9(1)). \nThe Agency decides whether an assessment is required on the same basis (s. 16(2)), and must set out in the assessment report adverse federal effects likely to be caused by the carrying out of the designated project (s. 28(3)). \nUltimately, in light of the report, the Minister or Governor in Council decides whether allowing the likely adverse federal effects is in the public interest based on the extent to which those effects are significant and whether they can be mitigated (ss. 60 to 63). \nAny conditions attached to a positive public interest determination may relate only to those likely, adverse federal effects (s. 64(1) and (2)).\nThe IAAs stated purposes and preamble confirm this view of its more precise purpose. Most importantly, the IAA is intended to protect the components of the environment, and the health, social and economic conditions that are within the legislative authority of Parliament from adverse effects caused by a designated project (s. 6(1)(b)). \nThe majority notes that the IAAs preamble also refers to Canadas commitments to fostering sustainability and to fostering reconciliation with the Indigenous peoples of Canada, and lists fifteen stated purposes in s. 6, which, in the majoritys view, collectively sweep far more broadly (para. 79). However, these stated commitments in the preamble and purposes set out in s. 6 are all directed at how the information-gathering process and the public interest decision-making function are to be undertaken in service of the dominant protective purpose set out in s. 6(1)(b). For example, procedurally, the IAAs stated purposes include promoting cooperation with Indigenous peoples (s. 6(1)(f)); completing assessments in a timely manner (s. 6(1)(i)); enabling meaningful public participation (s. 6(1)(h)); and establishing a fair, predictable and efficient process that enhances Canadas competitiveness (s. 6(1)(b.1)). As to public interest determinations, Parliament sought to be transparent by specifying that public interest decisions under the IAA must consider both positive and adverse effects of a project (s. 6(1)(c)), promote sustainability (s. 6(1)(a)), consider alternative means (s. 6(1)(k)), and ensure respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples (s. 6(1)(g)). These detailed goals do not suggest that the IAAs purpose is to regulate all aspects of the designated projects; instead, they must be read in light of the statutory scheme as a whole  they guide decision makers on how to assess when allowing likely adverse federal effects may be in the public interest, and thus to make an integrated decision that considers all the positive and negative effects of the designated project.\nExtrinsic Evidence\nExtrinsic evidence, such as the events preceding the IAAs introduction in the House of Commons, confirm that the IAAs dominant purpose is to allow well-informed, transparent decisions as to whether allowing a projects adverse federal effects is in the public interest.\nThe Expert Panel for the Review of Environmental Assessment Processes, established in 2016 to review the CEAA 2012 regime and recommend reforms, recognized the central role of federal jurisdiction and the importance of transparent federal decision-making. The Expert Panels report noted that it should be clear when a federal [impact assessment] will be required, and thus recommended that careful consideration and incorporation of federal jurisdiction [be] the starting point from which to answer the question of when federal [impact assessment] should apply (Building Common Ground: A New Vision for Impact Assessment in Canada (2017), at pp. 17-18). The Expert Panels report also endorsed a holistic sustainability inquiry at the public interest determination stage, and highlighted that federal jurisdiction was essential and that effects within federal jurisdiction must be consequential (p. 21). \nIn response to the Expert Panels report, the federal government issued a discussion paper outlining its contemplated reforms. The discussion paper confirmed that adverse federal effects would be central to a transparent assessment process. The federal government would: (1) review the Project List to ensure those types of major projects that have the greatest potential impacts in areas of federal jurisdiction are assessed; and (2) provide clear criteria and more transparency around the ministerial designation, without changing the fact that the Minister can only designate projects that could have adverse effects on areas of federal jurisdiction (Natural Resources Canada, Environmental and Regulatory Reviews: Discussion Paper (2017), at p. 18).\nConclusion on the Purpose of the IAA\nThe intrinsic and extrinsic evidence confirms that the IAAs purpose is to establish a transparent information-gathering and decision-making environmental assessment process which is focused on whether physical activities or designated projects have adverse federal effects, and if so, whether they should be permitted in the public interest, subject to any conditions.\nLegal Effects\nThe legal effects of a law relate to how the legislation as a whole affects the rights and liabilities of those subject to its terms (R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 463, at p. 482; see also Kitkatla Band v. British Columbia (Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture), 2002 SCC 31, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 146, at para. 54; Murray-Hall, at para. 25).\nTo identify the IAAs legal effects, the key parts of the IAA must be interpreted based on ordinary rules of interpretation, including the modern approach to statutory interpretation, which examines the text, context, and purpose of legislation; the presumption against absurdity; and the presumption of constitutionality. A proper statutory interpretation shows that the main legal effects of the IAA are that: (1) projects are designated based on the likelihood they would cause non-trivial adverse federal effects; (2) the Agency decides whether to assess projects on the same basis; (3) the Agencys report must identify the adverse federal effects that a project is likely to cause and specify the extent to which those effects are significant; and (4) the ultimate public interest determination and any resulting conditions imposed on the project must be reasonable and proportionate, based on the adverse federal effects, the extent to which they are significant, and whether they can be mitigated. In what follows, we address the interpretive issues at each stage of the IAA regime that result in these four main legal effects.\nEffects Within Federal Jurisdiction Does Not Encompass Trivial Effects\nThe proper interpretation and scope of the defined term effects within federal jurisdiction determines the legal effects of the IAA at every stage  from designation (s. 9(1)), to the scope of prohibitions (s. 7), to whether an assessment is required (s. 16), to what effects the assessment report must identify (ss. 28(3) and 51(1)(d)), to the basis for the decision as to the public interest (ss. 60(1) and 62) and any conditions that may be imposed (s. 64(1)).\nIn the decision under appeal, the majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal interpreted the IAA as including no materiality threshold and asserted that there is no requirement that any purported adverse federal effects actually be significant (2022 ABCA 165, 470 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at paras. 239-40 (emphasis in original); see also para. 302). It thus claimed that the IAA allows the federal executive to stop any intra-provincial designated project whenever there are any adverse federal effects of that project on the components of the environment (para. 241 (emphasis in original)). The majority of our Court seems to share this view, stating that effects within federal jurisdiction applies to positive and adverse changes of any magnitude, and concluding that projects with little or no potential for adverse federal effects will nonetheless be required to undergo an impact assessment (paras. 95 and 154 (emphasis added); see also paras. 138, 151-53, 180, 198 and 200). We disagree.\nThe term effects within federal jurisdiction, when properly interpreted, does not encompass de minimis, trivial, or insignificant effects. Although effects within federal jurisdiction is defined as a change to listed components of the environment that are within the legislative authority of Parliament, in light of the context and purpose of the IAA, the change contemplated cannot be an insignificant change that has no potential to make a difference to the environment (s. 2 effects within federal jurisdiction (a)). The whole scheme of the IAA is concerned with identifying and protecting against significant adverse environmental effects in areas of federal jurisdiction.\nStarting with the text, the Oxford English Dictionary defines a change as an alteration in the state or quality of something; a modification (online). The word change in relation to the environment necessarily connotes a materiality threshold, contrary to the conclusion of the majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal: if the designated project does not cause an alteration in the state or quality of the environment, there would be no change. A de minimis, trivial, or insignificant change would be no real change to the environment. \nThe context and purpose of the IAA as environmental protection legislation confirms that effects within federal jurisdiction does not encompass de minimis, trivial, or insignificant effects. The long title of the IAA speaks of a federal assessment process for significant adverse environmental effects. The Expert Panel recognized that consequential effects were necessary to ground federal jurisdiction (p. 21). The Minister of the Environment and Climate Change testified that the IAAs goal was to assess the projects with the most potential to have a significant impact on areas of federal jurisdiction (House of Commons, Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, Evidence, No. 99, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., March 22, 2018, at p. 18). And a key purpose of the IAA and CEAA 2012  in contrast to the Guidelines Order and CEAA 1992  was to focus assessment efforts on major projects most likely to have significant adverse effects in areas of federal authority.\nIndeed, the significance threshold for adverse environmental effects permeates every major stage and decision taken under the IAA with respect to designated projects. Under s. 28(3), the Agency must report on adverse federal effects and specify the extent to which those effects are significant; under ss. 31(1) and 33(2), the Minister may permit substitution of another jurisdictions assessment if satisfied that the other jurisdictions report would identify the adverse federal effects and specify the extent to which those effects are significant; under s. 51(1)(d)(ii), a joint federal-provincial review panel must prepare a report identifying the adverse federal effects and specify the extent to which those effects are significant; under s. 59(1) and (2), when the Agency terminates the assessment by a review panel, it must prepare a report identifying the adverse federal effects and specify the extent to which those effects are significant; under s. 60(1), the Ministers decision-making is based in part on whether there are adverse federal effects and the extent to which those effects are significant; under s. 61(1), the Minister refers a designated project to the Governor in Council to determine whether there are adverse federal effects and the extent to which those effects are significant; under s. 62, the Governor in Councils determination is based in part on whether there are adverse federal effects and the extent to which those effects are significant; and under s. 63(b), the Ministers public interest decision is based in part on whether there are adverse federal effects identified in the Agencys report and the extent to which those effects are significant.\nIn addition, these provisions of the IAA consistently recognize that the significance of adverse federal effects fall along a spectrum, and may be more or less significant. Throughout the IAA, federal authorities must review, specify, evaluate, and decide based on the extent to which the adverse federal effects are significant. This statutory language recognizes that not all adverse federal effects are the same. Some may be more significant than others. Under the IAA, adverse federal effects are legally relevant for decision making based on the extent to which they are significant.\nIt would thus undermine the IAAs purpose and scheme for trivial or insignificant effects to be a basis for allowing projects to enter the IAA regime, for the Agency to determine whether an assessment is required, or for the ultimate public interest decision-making and any conditions imposed.\nThe breadth of the definition of effects within federal jurisdiction must also be viewed in the specific context of environmental protection legislation  in this case, the IAA  and by considering related principles of statutory interpretation. This Court addressed the relevant interpretative principles in Canadian Pacific in rejecting the argument that s. 13(1)(a) of Ontarios Environmental Protection Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 141, which imposed a broad and general prohibition of the pollution of the natural environment for any use that can be made of it, was unconstitutionally vague. Justice Gonthier, for the majority, stated that, [i]n the context of environmental protection legislation, a strict requirement of drafting precision might well undermine the ability of the legislature to provide for a comprehensive and flexible regime, and noted the recommendation of the Ontario Law Reform Commission that generally framed pollution prohibitions are desirable from a public policy perspective (para. 52). General language in environmental protection legislation, he stated, ensures flexibility in the law to respond to a wide range of environmentally harmful scenarios which could not have been foreseen at the time of its enactment (para. 52). In addition, Gonthier J. affirmed that the phrase use relating to the natural environment was to be interpreted more narrowly in accordance with both the presumption against absurdity, to ensure that the prohibition was applied reasonably and not in cases of trivial or minimal violations, and the related principle of de minimis non curat lex (the law does not concern itself with trifles) (para. 65). In short, the prohibition was interpreted reasonably, in accordance with its environmental context, and in a way to avoid unjust or inequitable results (para. 65). \nJustice Gonthiers caution in Canadian Pacific is especially apt when considering the broad protective language Parliament used in the IAAs definition of effects within federal jurisdiction. Parliament used broad language in this definition because the IAA is environmental protection legislation with the important purpose of protecting the public through a comprehensive and flexible regime. However, this broad language must be interpreted to avoid a designated project entering the federal assessment regime based on trivial or insignificant environmental effects.\nIn sum, the statutory text, context and purpose, along with the applicable interpretive principles, show that Parliament did not intend to capture de minimis effects. Moreover, even if interpreting the IAA to capture de minimis effects were a reasonably available interpretation, the presumption of constitutionality demands that it be rejected in favour of our constitutionally conforming interpretation.\nDesignation\nThe legal effect of designation under the IAA, whether by the Minister (s. 9(1)) or in regulations made by the Governor in Council (s. 109(b)), is to require projects to be subject to the IAA scheme because of the possibility they will have non-trivial, adverse federal effects. Designation also has the legal effect of triggering the prohibitions under the IAA.\nThe Minister may designate a project if, in his or her opinion, either the carrying out of that physical activity may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or adverse direct or incidental effects, or public concerns related to those effects warrant the designation (s. 9(1)). The word or before public concerns does not mean that the Minister may designate a project based on public concerns alone, when the Minister believes the project would not cause adverse federal effects. At a minimum, for s. 9(1) to apply, the Minister must be of the opinion that the physical activity may cause adverse federal effects; if that threshold is met, public concerns related to those effects may be a relevant consideration in deciding whether to designate a project.\nThe Governor in Councils power to make regulations designating classes of projects is similarly constrained by the IAAs purpose of protecting against significant (and therefore non-trivial) adverse federal effects. A regulation and the exercise of a discretionary regulation-making power must be consistent with the object and purpose of the enabling statute (Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 810, at para. 24; West Fraser Mills Ltd. v. British Columbia (Workers Compensation Appeal Tribunal), 2018 SCC 22, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 635, at para. 12; References re GGPPA, at para. 73). We therefore agree with Canadas submission that the Governor in Council may only designate classes of projects they view as likely to cause significant adverse federal effects on a scale that justifies the process (A.F., at paras. 89-90). This conclusion is also consistent with the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement accompanying the Regulations, which states that the objective of the Project List is to capture those major projects with the greatest potential for adverse effects in areas of federal jurisdiction related to the environment, so that they can enter into the impact assessment process (p. 5663). Lastly, this interpretation is confirmed by the presumption of constitutional conformity: designation of projects under the IAA with an expectation that they may have adverse federal effects suggests that federal discretionary authority is being exercised with a proper basis rooted in federal legislative jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867.\nProhibitions\nThe legal effect of the IAAs prohibitions is to require the proponent to not take any action in relation to the designated project that may cause non-trivial or potentially significant federal effects until either the Agency determines assessment is not required or a positive public interest determination is made. Designation triggers the prohibitions under s. 7: A proponent must not do any act or thing in connection with the carrying out of the designated project, in whole or in part, if that act or thing may cause any of several listed changes to components of the environment within the legislative authority of Parliament. \nTwo legal effects of the prohibitions under s. 7 are noteworthy. \nFirst, the prohibitions under s. 7 apply when the effects may cause environmental changes, and do not require that the effects be proven to be adverse at this stage. This reflects the precautionary approach to environmental regulation. Under the precautionary principle, [e]nvironmental measures must anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation (Spraytech, at para. 31, quoting Bergen Ministerial Declaration on Sustainable Development (1990), at para. 7). The IAA makes clear that the legislation must be administered by federal authorities by applying the precautionary principle (s. 6(2); see also s. 6(1)(d) and (l)). In recognition of the precautionary principle, environmental regimes such as the IAA often require a pause while information about the potential impacts of a project is gathered and evaluated.\nSecond, the prohibitions do not extend to all activities in relation to designated projects; they extend only to those that may cause non-trivial federal effects (s. 7).\nThe Planning Phase\nThe legal effects of the planning phase of the IAA are for the Agency to enable public participation, offer to consult other jurisdictions, and decide whether an assessment of the designated project is necessary, given the factors in s. 16, including the possibility that carrying out the designated project may cause adverse federal effects (ss. 10 to 16). If a project will not potentially cause any adverse federal effects  or if the Agency otherwise decides that no assessment is required  all the prohibitions under s. 7 terminate and the project exits the IAA regime (s. 7(3)(a)). Otherwise, the Agency must provide a notice of commencement and the project proceeds to assessment (s. 18(1)).\nThe Impact Assessment Phase\nAt the impact assessment phase, the IAAs legal effects are to require the proponent to provide the information requested in the notice of commencement; the Agency to enable public participation and consult other jurisdictions; and the Agency to prepare an assessment report setting out what non-trivial adverse federal effects the project is likely to cause and the extent to which they are significant (ss. 22 and 24 to 28). \nThe Decision-Making Phase (the Public Interest Determination)\nAfter the impact assessment phase, the designated project moves to the decision-making phase. At this stage, the Minister or Governor in Council (on referral from the Minister) must determine whether allowing the likely and adverse federal effects set out in the Agencys report is in the public interest, given the extent to which they are significant and considering the public interest factors in s. 63 (ss. 60 to 63). As we explain below, the legal effect of the IAAs public interest decision-making phase is to require federal decision makers to reach a reasonable and proportionate decision on whether allowing the adverse federal effects specified in the Agencys report as likely to occur  in light of the extent to which they are significant and how they can be mitigated  is in the public interest. Its other legal effects are to: (1) provide transparency and constrain the basis of the public interest decision; and (2) require that conditions attached to a positive public interest decision apply only to the likely adverse federal effects specified in the Agencys report.\nSection 60 provides for the Ministers obligation to make a decision regarding the project or refer it to the Governor in Council. It reads in part: \n60 (1) After taking into account the report with respect to the impact assessment of a designated project that is submitted to the Minister under subsection 28(2) or at the end of the assessment under the process approved under section 31, the Minister must\n\n(a) determine whether the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction  and the adverse direct or incidental effects  that are indicated in the report are, in light of the factors referred to in section 63 and the extent to which those effects are significant, in the public interest; or\n\n(b) refer to the Governor in Council the matter of whether the effects referred to in paragraph (a) are, in light of the factors referred to in section 63 and the extent to which those effects are significant, in the public interest.\nSection 63 details the public interest factors the Minister must consider: \n63 The Ministers determination under paragraph 60(1)(a) in respect of a designated project . . . must be based on the report with respect to the impact assessment and a consideration of the following factors:\n\n(a) the extent to which the designated project contributes to sustainability;\n\n(b) the extent to which the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction and the adverse direct or incidental effects that are indicated in the impact assessment report in respect of the designated project are significant;\n\n(c) the implementation of the mitigation measures that the Minister or the Governor in Council, as the case may be, considers appropriate;\n\n(d) the impact that the designated project may have on any Indigenous group and any adverse impact that the designated project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982; and\n\n(e) the extent to which the effects of the designated project hinder or contribute to the Government of Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and its commitments in respect of climate change.\nThese provisions require the decision maker to consider the extent to which a projects federal effects are significant and whether and how they can be mitigated. The Minister or Governor in Council must make the public interest decision in light of the extent to which the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction . . . are significant (s. 63(b); see also ss. 60(1) and 62). Further, they must consider potential mitigation measures  which, particularly for projects with less significant adverse federal effects, may substantially alleviate those effects (s. 63(c); see also s. 64(1) and (2)). Although the decision makers must also consider other factors set out in s. 63 to determine whether the project is in the public interest, those factors are in aid of the ultimate determination required by s. 60(1)(a): . . . whether the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction . . . [are] in the public interest . . . . Likely adverse federal effects, standing alone, cannot be in the public interest. To be in the public interest, adverse federal effects must be outweighed on the other side of the ledger by public interest factors in s. 63, which include both negative and positive effects.\nAs a result, the decision-making phase in ss. 60 and 63 requires a cost-benefit analysis based on identified public interest considerations. In this sense, it is an integrated decision. Although the public interest factors in s. 63 (both positive and negative) may outweigh the adverse effects within federal jurisdiction, any public interest decision must be reasonable and proportionate to the adverse federal effects and potential mitigation measures. Any federal decision that sought to permit negligible federal effects to stop a project, in the face of substantial public interest factors, would be disproportionate, unreasonable, and subject to judicial review (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653). The public interest factors in s. 63 thus promote political accountability, the rule of law, and meaningful judicial review.\nPractical Effects\nThe practical or side effects of legislation consist of the actual or predicted results of the legislations operation and administration for those subject to it (Morgentaler, at p. 486; References re GGPPA, at para. 51). Practical effects are relevant only if they shed light on the laws pith and substance (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 26; References re GGPPA, at para. 51). Sometimes the evidence of practical effects may not be helpful in characterizing a challenged law (References re GGPPA, at para. 78). \nIn Morgentaler, Sopinka J. sounded an important note of caution on the limited relevance of practical effects in determining whether legislation is ultra vires and the need to distinguish between true practical effects, which are relevant in some cases, from concerns presented as practical effects that really relate to the wisdom or efficacy of the legislation, which are never relevant. Justice Sopinka noted that while the legal effect of the terms of legislation is always relevant, . . . [t]he practical effect of legislation, on the other hand, has a less secure status in constitutional analysis (pp. 485-86). He noted that in most cases evidence of practical effects will only be relevant to demonstrate whether there is a colourable or ultra vires purpose (pp. 486-87). He added that, in many cases, the evidence of practical effect would not add anything useful to the task of characterization, but would merely bear on the wisdom or efficacy of the statute (pp. 487-88, quoting P. W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada (3rd ed. 1992), vol. 1, at p. 15-16). It is not the role of the courts to question the wisdom of a statute, its efficacy, or whether it achieves the legislatures goals (Ward, at paras. 18 and 22).\nIn the present reference, the majority of the Court claims that the IAA has two practical effects relevant to the legislations pith and substance: first, the scheme results in delays of indeterminate duration, while the regulatory process evaluates whether a project would have a significant adverse environmental effect; and second, the impact assessment process requires the Agency, the project proponent, federal authorities and other implicated jurisdictions to expend resources (paras. 106-7). In our view, both these inevitable consequences of applying the legislation are irrelevant in determining the pith and substance or constitutionality of the IAA. In the modern regulatory state, federal and provincial legislation often result in delay as regulatory agencies evaluate for compliance with statutory norms enacted to protect the public. Those statutes almost invariably result in the expenditure of resources  and often substantial resources. Legislation regulating toxic substances, food standards, product safety, and medicines come to mind, to name a few. But the delay and costs involved in complying with these and many other statutes that protect the public do not affect their constitutionality under the Constitution Act, 1867. Such concerns relate to the efficacy or wisdom of the legislation. They may be important policy matters for Parliament, but they are irrelevant for constitutional purposes.\nConclusion on Pith and Substance\nIn our view, the proper characterization of the pith and substance of the primary designated projects scheme of the IAA is to establish an environmental assessment process to (1) assess the effects of physical activities or major projects on federal lands, Indigenous peoples, fisheries, migratory birds, and lands, air, or waters outside Canada or in provinces other than where a project is located, and (2) determine whether to impose restrictions on the project to safeguard against significant adverse federal effects, unless allowing those effects is in the public interest.\nWe turn next to the classification of the IAA and Regulations.\nClassification of the IAA Scheme\nTo classify a challenged law, the court must determine whether the laws pith and substance falls within one or more heads of power assigned to the enacting legislature under s. 91 or 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (Murray-Hall, at para. 23; References re GGPPA, at paras. 47 and 114; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 25; Oldman River, at p. 62). This often requires the court to interpret the relevant head or heads of power invoked to support the law (Reference re Securities Act, at para. 65). If the law can be supported under one or more heads of power assigned to the enacting legislature, the law is intra vires and valid (Murray-Hall, at para. 65; Reference re Securities Act, at para. 65; Hydro-Quebec, at para. 112).\nA court classifying environmental legislation must remember that the environment is not a subject matter assigned to either level of government under the Constitution Act, 1867 (Oldman River, at p. 63; Hydro-Quebec, at para. 112). The environment is a diffuse subject that cuts across many different areas of constitutional responsibility, some federal, some provincial (Hydro-Quebec, at para. 112; see also Oldman River, at pp. 63-64). Both levels of government can therefore enact environmental protection legislation within their spheres and may affect the environment, either by acting or not acting (Oldman River, at p. 65). Under the double aspect doctrine, Canada and the provinces are both free to legislate in relation to the same fact situation (References re GGPPA, at para. 129; see also para. 130). The province may legislate regarding the provincial aspects of a project, while Parliament may legislate regarding the federal aspects (Oldman River, at p. 69). Although local projects within a province will generally fall within provincial responsibility, federal participation will be required if the project impinges on an area of federal jurisdiction (p. 69). The coexistence of such shared environmental responsibility over a project is neither unusual nor unworkable in a federal state like Canada (National Energy Board, at p. 193; see also Quebec (Attorney General) v. Moses, 2010 SCC 17, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 557, at para. 36). \nConsistent with these principles of flexible and cooperative federalism, both orders of government have constitutional authority to enact environmental legislation. Thus, Parliament is competent to enact federal environmental legislation under the federal powers over fisheries (Northwest Falling Contractors; Oldman River), navigable waters (Oldman River), Indians and lands reserved for Indians (Oldman River), criminal law (Hydro-Quebec), international and interprovincial rivers (Interprovincial Co-operatives), and the national concern branch of the peace, order, and good government power (Crown Zellerbach; References re GGPPA). There is also no doubt about the authority of the provinces to enact environmental legislation under a host of provincial legislative powers, including the powers over property and civil rights in the province, local works and undertakings, municipal institutions, and matters of a local or private nature, to name but a few (Spraytech, at para. 43; see, generally, Hogg and Wright, at  30:31 to 30:33; Beaudoin, ch. 20; A. Johnston, Federal Jurisdiction and the Impact Assessment Act: Trojan Horse or Rational Ecological Accounting?, in M. Doelle and A. J. Sinclair, eds., The Next Generation of Impact Assessment: A Critical Review of the Canadian Impact Assessment Act (2021), 97, at pp. 98-103; M. Doelle, The Federal Environmental Assessment Process: A Guide and Critique (2008), at pp. 52-61; J. Leclair, Letendue du pouvoir constitutionnel des provinces et de lEtat central en matiere devaluation des incidences environnementales au Canada (1995), 21 Queens L.J. 37, at p. 45; C. Mathen, Courts Without Cases: The Law and Politics of Advisory Opinions (2019), at pp. 103-6).\nLastly, a court classifying environmental legislation must remember that [e]nvironmental protection is a legitimate concern of government, one that involves a very broad subject matter which does not lend itself to precise codification (Canadian Pacific, at para. 84). As a result, [w]here the legislature is pursuing the objective of environmental protection, it is justified in choosing equally broad legislative language in order to provide for a necessary degree of flexibility (para. 84).\nIn what follows, we apply these principles in classifying the IAA scheme. As we will explain, we conclude that the designated projects regulatory scheme is intra vires Parliament. Each of the adverse federal effects set out in the IAA anchor federal review and decision making under the IAA legislative scheme and fit within multiple heads of Parliaments legislative jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867. The majority of this Court concludes otherwise for two main reasons. First, the majority asserts that the adverse federal effects for designated projects do not drive the schemes decision-making functions, and thus the scheme is not in pith and substance directed at regulating these effects (para. 135). Second, the majority claims that the adverse federal effects are overbroad and do not alig[n] with federal legislative jurisdiction under s. 91, which exacerbates the constitutional frailties of the schemes decision-making functions (para. 136). We address both objections below. We also briefly explain why there is no merit to Albertas alternative argument that even if the IAA scheme is constitutionally valid, it is constitutionally inapplicable to provincial projects under the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity.\nAdverse Federal Effects Anchor Federal Review and Decision Making Under the IAA\nThe majority correctly identifies four decision-making junctures under the IAA: (a) designating physical activities as designated projects; (b) the screening decision as to whether a project should proceed to an impact assessment; (c) identifying the scope of the assessment and the factors to be considered; and (d) the public interest decision and resulting regulation and oversight (para. 137). The majority concludes that the first and third junctures are constitutional, but views the second and fourth junctures as unconstitutional because adverse federal effects do not drive the schemes decision-making functions (paras. 147, 154, 161 and 178). We disagree. All four decision-making junctures are constitutional because the adverse federal effects anchor the federal review and decision making at each stage of the IAA.\nDesignation of Physical Activities as Designated Projects\nThe designation process under the IAA is constitutional because it is driven by the potential for a physical activity to cause adverse federal effects. Physical activities can be designated as designated projects by the Minister or by regulation. The ministerial designation under s. 9(1) is based on the Ministers opinion that the carrying out of the physical activity may cause adverse federal effects that warrant the designation, while the designation by regulation under s. 109(b) must be consistent with the object and purpose of the IAA to protect against significant adverse federal effects and to identify those major projects with the greatest potential for adverse effects on areas of federal jurisdiction . . ., so that they can enter into the impact assessment process (Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (2019), at p. 5661). These provisions  together with the Agencys decision on whether to order an impact assessment based in part on the possibility that the carrying out of the designated project may cause adverse federal effects and any adverse impact that the designated project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982  reflect the precautionary principle (s. 16(2)(b) and (c)). As noted by Anna Johnston, the [IAA] does not require proof of federal effects to order an assessment  only the possibility of effects (p. 105).\nInformation must first be gathered before federal decision makers can decide on a project. Environmental impact assessment is a planning tool with an information-gathering and a decision-making component that provides federal decision makers with an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development (Oldman River, at p. 71). As a planning tool, an environmental assessment has a low jurisdictional threshold because it occurs in the early stages of decision making, before information about potential impacts on areas of federal jurisdiction may be known (Johnston, at pp. 104-5). Indeed, [r]equiring federal authorities to obtain evidence of a projects effects prior to the assessment would be to put the cart before the horse and undermine the [IAA]s objectives of precaution and protection of the environment (p. 105). As a result, the decision to carry out an [environmental assessment] has to be made in the face of uncertainty and information gaps, which are to be filled through the assessment process (J. MacLean, M. Doelle and C. Tollefson, Polyjural and Polycentric Sustainability Assessment: A Once-in-a-Generation Law Reform Opportunity (2016), 30 J.E.L.P. 35, at p. 43).\nIn our view, the designation process under the IAA appropriately reflects the precautionary principle and the need to gather information at an early stage of an environmental impact assessment process, to properly inform federal decision making about whether a designated project may cause adverse federal effects. The potential to cause adverse federal effects anchors this first stage of the process, and is therefore intra vires Parliament. \nAlthough the majority accepts that the designation mechanism under the IAA is constitutionally sound, it does not accept that the Agencys decision to order an assessment under s. 16(1) of the IAA  which the majority calls the screening decision  is constitutional (paras. 146 and 154). We address that issue next.\nThe Screening Decision\nAs discussed, once a project is designated under the Regulations or by ministerial order, the Agency decides whether to conduct an impact assessment of the designated project based on mandatory factors in s. 16(2) of the IAA. Section 16 provides: \n16 (1) After posting a copy of the notice on the Internet site under subsection 15(3), the Agency must decide whether an impact assessment of the designated project is required.\n\n(2) In making its decision, the Agency must take into account the following factors:\n\n(a) the description referred to in section 10 and any notice referred to in section 15;\n\n(b) the possibility that the carrying out of the designated project may cause adverse effects within federal jurisdiction or adverse direct or incidental effects;\n\n(c) any adverse impact that the designated project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982;\n\n(d) any comments received within the time period specified by the Agency from the public and from any jurisdiction or Indigenous group that is consulted under section 12;\n\n(e) any relevant assessment referred to in section 92, 93 or 95;\n\n(f) any study that is conducted or plan that is prepared by a jurisdiction  in respect of a region that is related to the designated project  and that has been provided to the Agency; and\n\n(g) any other factor that the Agency considers relevant.\n\n(3) The Agency must post a notice of its decision and the reasons for it on the Internet site.\nThe potential that the designated project will cause adverse federal effects again anchors the Agencys discretionary screening decision under s. 16 of the IAA:\nUnder s. 16(2)(a), the project description provided by the project proponent and the notice that the proponent must provide to the Agency must set out information that includes the projects potential adverse federal effects and the way the proponent is considering to mitigate them (ss. 10 and 15; Information and Management of Time Limits Regulations, SOR/2019-283, ss. 3 and 4, Sch. 1, ss. 19 to 24, and Sch. 2, ss. 19 to 24).\nUnder s. 16(2)(b), the Agency must consider the possibility that the carrying out of the designated project may cause adverse federal effects.\nUnder s. 16(2)(c), the Agency must consider any adverse impact that the designated project may have on the rights of the Indigenous peoples of Canada recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. Again, this is a potential adverse federal effect.\nUnder s. 16(2)(d), the Agency must consider comments from the public and any jurisdiction or Indigenous group consulted. These comments could include comments on adverse federal effects, on adverse non-federal effects, or any other comments.\nUnder s. 16(2)(e), the Agency must consider an assessment conducted in respect of physical activities entirely or in part on federal lands, or in respect of any Government of Canada policy, plan, or program, or any issue relevant in conducting an impact assessment of designated projects or a class of designated projects (ss. 92, 93 and 95).\nUnder s. 16(2)(f), the Agency must consider any study conducted or plan prepared by another jurisdiction related to the designated project.\nUnder s. 16(2)(g), the Agency may consider any other factor it considers relevant.\nThe majority concludes that the Agencys broad discretion under s. 16 is unconstitutional because the decision to require an assessment is not rooted in the possibility of adverse federal effects (para. 150). The majority interprets the screening decision as not driven by possible federal effects and therefore fails to focus the scheme on the federal aspects of designated projects (para. 150). The majority concludes this because s. 16(2) contains an open-ended list of factors, all of seemingly equal importance, but that only s. 16(2)(b) relates to adverse federal effects (para. 151). The majority says that the text of s. 16(2) gives no primacy to the possibility of adverse effects relative to the other mandatory considerations (para. 152). Finally, the majority concludes that, as worded, s. 16 poses a risk that projects with little or no potential for adverse federal effects will nonetheless be required to undergo an impact assessment on the basis of less relevant, yet mandatory, considerations (para. 154). \nWe disagree with the majoritys interpretation of s. 16. Each of the discretionary factors in s. 16(2)(a), (b) and (c) is rooted in adverse federal effects, not just s. 16(2)(b). And s. 16(2)(d) may also reflect adverse federal effects, depending on the comments of the public or the Indigenous group consulted (although it is impossible to anticipate such comments in advance, this hardly poses a constitutional problem). Section 16(2)(e) is largely irrelevant for most provincially regulated projects, unless they occur on federal lands or relate to a federal government policy, program, or plan, in which case there is a clear nexus to federal jurisdiction. Section 16(2)(f) applies only where another jurisdiction conducts an assessment, in which case it is appropriate for the Agency to consider what the other jurisdiction has to say. Finally, s. 16(2)(g) is a residuary clause that allows the Agency to consider other factors it considers appropriate, but, like any discretionary power granted under legislation, it must be exercised reasonably and consistent with the object and purpose of the IAA, which, here, is to prevent significant adverse environmental effects. As a result, we see no constitutional objection to the criteria in s. 16. The Agencys discretionary screening decision is anchored in the possibility that the designated project will cause adverse federal effects.\nThe principles of cooperative federalism also require a court, in evaluating the constitutionality of the legislation as a whole, to favour, where possible, the ordinary operation of statutes enacted by both levels of government and to avoid blocking the application of measures enacted to promote the public interest, while the presumption of constitutionality requires a court to interpret the discretion granted under the legislation as being exercised in good faith and within constitutional bounds (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 37; Canadian Broadcasting Corp., at p. 641; Hogg and Wright, at  15:13). Fidelity to these foundational constitutional precepts confirms the constitutionality of the discretion granted under s. 16.\nFinally, if the Agency were to exercise its discretion to require a project with little or no potential for adverse federal impacts to proceed to an impact assessment, such a decision would be unreasonable and would not reflect the object and purpose of the IAA to prevent significant adverse federal environmental effects. Such a decision in a particular case, and based on an appropriate evidentiary record, would be subject to judicial review. We cannot comment on such hypothetical scenarios involving alleged future improper exercises of discretion. As noted in the References re GGPPA, [i]t is not this Courts role to express opinions about the substance, arguments or merits of future challenges (para. 220).\nThe Impact Assessment Phase\nThe Agencys impact assessment of a designated project must take account of the broad range of factors in s. 22(1) of the IAA. Some of the listed factors are effects that fall within federal jurisdiction while others are intended to allow federal authorities to make a fully informed decision about the costs and benefits of proceeding with the project, with or without conditions, and about potential mitigation measures. The factors under s. 22(1) include:\npositive and negative environmental, health, social, and economic consequences of carrying out the designated project, the extent to which the project contributes to environmental sustainability, and any change to the project that may be caused by the environment (s. 22(1)(a), (h) and (j)); \nmitigation measures that are technically and economically feasible (s. 22(1)(b)); \nthe potential impact of the designated project on any Indigenous group or the s. 35 rights of Indigenous peoples, Indigenous knowledge provided with respect to the project, Indigenous culture considerations raised with respect to the project, and any assessment of the effects of the project conducted by or on behalf of an Indigenous governing body (s. 22(1)(c), (g), (l) and (q)); \nthe purpose of and need for the designated project (s. 22(1)(d)); \nalternative means of carrying out the designated project, or alternatives to the project, that are technically and economically feasible (s. 22(1)(e) and (f)); \nthe requirements of the follow-up program in respect of the designated project (s. 22(1)(k)); \ncommunity knowledge provided with respect to the project and comments received from the public (s. 22(1)(m) and (n)); \ncomments from another jurisdiction received during consultations, any other relevant assessment, or any study or plan conducted or prepared by another jurisdiction (s. 22(1)(o), (p) and (r)); \nthe intersection of sex and gender with other identity factors (s. 22(1)(s)); and\nany other matter relevant to the impact assessment that the Agency requires to be taken into account (s. 22(1)(t)).\nWhen establishing the process for considering the environmental costs and benefits of a designated project that potentially has an adverse federal effect, Parliament is constitutionally entitled to instruct the decision maker to consider the full range of costs and benefits of the project. In Oldman River, in which this Court upheld the constitutionality of the Guidelines Order as falling under federal jurisdiction, La Forest J. emphasized the need for integrated environmental and economic planning and management. He accepted that in evaluating environmental quality under the federal Guidelines Order, the Minister was not limited to considering environmental quality as understood in a physical sense, and could also take into account socio-economic considerations arising from the project (pp. 36-37). This conclusion flowed from the diffuse nature of the environment, which encompasses the physical, economic and social environment (pp. 63-64). He emphasized that environmental and economic planning cannot proceed in separate spheres, and thus [e]conomic and environmental planning and management must . . . be integrated (p. 37 (emphasis added), quoting the Brundtland Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development, in the Report of the National Task Force on Environment and Economy, September 24, 1987, at p. 2). Justice La Forest therefore concluded that the potential consequences for a communitys livelihood, health and other social matters from environmental change are integral to decision making on matters affecting environmental quality (p. 37; see also pp. 66-68 and 72).\nSince Oldman River, this Court has re-affirmed that a federal environmental assessment of a project may consider the overall environmental costs, including effects within a province (National Energy Board, at pp. 191 and 193). For federal environmental assessment purposes, federal authorities may assess all matters in relation to the project as proposed by the proponent (MiningWatch Canada v. Canada (Fisheries and Oceans), 2010 SCC 2, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 6, at para. 40; see also para. 41). Commentators have acknowledged that federal authorities may look beyond those project components that will impact federal matters, and include all related components and activities in the scope of assessment. . . . [T]he federal government may ask proponents to provide information related to all of a projects positive and adverse effects in order to have a comprehensive picture to inform decision making (Johnston, at pp. 108 and 110; see also MacLean, Doelle and Tollefson, at pp. 42 and 44-45; Doelle, at pp. 72 and 77).\nWe therefore agree with the majority that a federal environmental assessment is not restricted to considering environmental effects that are federal in nature and has wide latitude to evaluate the projects anticipated effects (paras. 157 and 161). This is essential for federal authorities to make an integrated decision as to the designated projects overall costs and benefits.\nThe Decision-Making Phase (the Public Interest Determination)\nLastly, the decision-making phase in ss. 60 to 63 of the IAA requires a cost-benefit analysis based on public interest factors identified in s. 63, including the extent to which the designated project contributes to sustainability, has adverse federal effects that are significant as indicated in the impact assessment report, has an impact on any Indigenous group or adverse effects on the rights of Indigenous peoples protected under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and hinders or contributes to the Government of Canadas ability to meet its environmental obligations and climate change commitments. Section 63 requires a reasonable and proportionate weighing of the public interest factors in deciding whether a project may proceed, and if so, whether any conditions should be imposed. \nIn our view, the integrated public interest decision-making process contemplated under the IAA  a process involving a cost-benefit balancing of the adverse federal effects and all other relevant public interest considerations relating to the project  falls within federal legislative jurisdiction.\nAs a matter of precedent and constitutional principle, this Courts decision in Oldman River highlighted the importance of not just integrated federal information collection at the impact assessment stage, but also integrated federal decision making at the public interest determination stage. Justice La Forest stated that it would be unduly myopic to confine environmental decision making to questions of the biophysical environment alone, and highlighted the need to have integrated [e]conomic and environmental planning and management (p. 37). \nTo illustrate this point, La Forest J. later gave the example of a decision to approve the location and construction of a new railway line (a federal undertaking), which would have environmental and human health impacts that would otherwise fall under provincial jurisdiction. He explained that it defies reason and would lead to the most astonishing results to say that Parliament would be precluded from considering provincial harms in deciding whether to allow the railway line to proceed (p. 66). \nJustice La Forest went on to reiterate that, provided federal environmental legislation is anchored in a federal head of power or a federal aspect, the federal legislation may consider impacts within provincial jurisdiction, even though provinces may legislate regarding the same fact situation from a provincial aspect under the double aspect doctrine. As he explained:\nWhat is important is to determine whether either level of government may legislate. One may legislate in regard to provincial aspects, the other federal aspects. Although local projects will generally fall within provincial responsibility, federal participation will be required if the project impinges on an area of federal jurisdiction as is the case here. [p. 69]\nWe agree with Professors Hogg and Wrights view that [t]he effect of the Oldman River decision is to confer on the federal Parliament the power to provide for environmental impact assessment of any project that has any effect on any matter within federal jurisdiction ( 30:32; see also Doelle, at pp. 66-71; Johnston, at pp. 111-16; MacLean, Doelle and Tollefson, at pp. 42-45). \nIt also bears noting that the IAA provides for joint federal-provincial environmental review and assessment and requires federal authorities to consider provincial comments and assessments to promote cooperative federalism and help alleviate potential jurisdictional concerns (Johnston, at pp. 110-11). The IAA allows federal authorities to substitute a provincial assessment for the federal assessment on the request of provincial authorities (s. 31(1)), to delegate a federal assessment to provincial authorities (s. 29), and to provide for a joint federal-provincial assessment (s. 39(1)). A federal impact assessment must also consider comments from provincial authorities received during consultations, a relevant provincial assessment, and any study or plan conducted or prepared by a province (s. 22(1)(o), (p) and (r)). Provincial participation is thus integrated into the IAA scheme as a matter of cooperative federalism. When a federal impact assessment occurs without provincial cooperation, it would be unreasonable not to extend decision-making authority [of federal authorities] to the consideration of all [aspects] of a projects impacts, benefits, risks, and uncertainties (Johnston, at p. 117).\nIn our view, as long as the public interest decision is anchored in federal jurisdiction based on adverse federal effects, federal authorities are entitled to make an integrated and proportionate decision that weighs the costs and benefits of allowing the project to proceed, and, if it is allowed to proceed, whether conditions should be imposed.\nNevertheless, the majority concludes that the public interest decision under s. 63 of the IAA exceeds Parliaments jurisdiction in two respects. First, the majority says that, to be constitutional, the dominant thrust of the public interest factors must focus on the projects federal effects, rather than the adverse federal effects and the other adverse, non-federal considerations (paras. 167 and 178). The majority notes that, although the assessment process can consider non-federal considerations, at the ultimate decision-making juncture, the focus on federal impacts must be restored (para. 177). Second, the majority claims that, during the public interest decision making, federal authorities are constitutionally unable to consider the project as a whole, and they may consider only its adverse federal effects (para. 174). The majority says that the public interest decision-making process under the IAA transforms what is prima facie a determination of whether adverse federal effects are in the public interest into a determination of whether the project as a whole is in the public interest (para. 166). We disagree on both points.\nThe first objection  that public interest decision making under the IAA is unconstitutional because it allows for consideration of adverse, non-federal considerations  conflicts with this Courts guidance in Oldman River that a federal environmental assessment process can involve an integrated decision-making process that weighs both the federal and non-federal harms that may be caused by a designated project, with any benefits that may accrue from the project. To repeat La Forest J.s comments in Oldman River, it defies reason to assert that Parliament is constitutionally barred from weighing the broad environmental repercussions, including socio-economic concerns (p. 66). \nThus, as the late Professor Doelle correctly notes, we can take from Oldman that when there is a clear impact on an area of federal jurisdiction, the decision whether to allow the project to go ahead in spite of the impact can be an integrated decision that takes into account issues that are within provincial jurisdiction (p. 75). Moreover, [t]here is no reason to suggest that harm in an area of provincial jurisdiction should be treated differently than benefits. . . . [I]f there is jurisdiction to make a federal project decision, that decision can be influenced by health and employment benefits as much as it may be influenced by potential harm to forests or risk of harm to the health and welfare of local citizens (p. 75, fn. 78). Simply put, [i]t does not serve to protect provincial jurisdiction to force the federal decision . . . to be made in a partially blind manner (p. 68).\nTo give a concrete example, on the majoritys view, there is (properly) no constitutional objection to federal authorities prohibiting a nickel refinery in a province  a provincially regulated project  which has substantial economic benefits that are outweighed by substantial environmental harms to Indigenous peoples, Indigenous lands, or the rights of Indigenous people protected under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 because such harms are adverse federal effects under the IAA. But, on the majoritys view, if the same project caused less substantial but still significant harm to Indigenous interests (thus triggering an adverse federal effect), federal authorities could not constitutionally prohibit the project on the basis that it might cause cancers or respiratory diseases to non-Indigenous peoples in neighbouring communities, because this would be to consider a constitutionally impermissible non-federal effect. To quote La Forest J. in Oldman River, this approach defies reason (p. 66).\nThe majoritys second objection to the constitutionality of the public interest decision-making process under the IAA  that federal authorities may not constitutionally consider the project as a whole, but only its adverse federal effects  is just as problematic for largely the same reasons. The majoritys view again departs from the integrated decision-making process for the project recognized in Oldman River. In Oldman River, in discussing what federal decision makers may consider in determining whether to approve a dam (a provincial undertaking) that has effects on navigation (a federal matter), Justice La Forest stated that the federal government must be able to look beyond federal effects, as, otherwise, the dam would never be approved because, by its very nature, it interfere[s] with, or impede[s] navigation (p. 39). He continued:\nIf the significance of the impact on marine navigation were the sole criterion, it is difficult to conceive of a dam of this sort ever being approved. It is clear, then, that the Minister must factor several elements into any cost-benefit analysis to determine if a substantial interference with navigation is warranted in the circumstances. [p. 39]\nThe majority, at para. 158, confines this guidance from Oldman River to the information-gathering phase, even though La Forest J. expressly wrote of decisions to approve the project.\nThus, the public interest decision-making process under the IAA cannot be limited to whether adverse federal effects are in the public interest without considering other factors (majority reasons, at para. 166). As Oldman River recognized, adverse federal effects will rarely, if ever, be in the public interest. To be in the public interest, adverse federal effects need to be outweighed by other positive benefits of the project. As Anna Johnston explains:\nIn many (if not most) cases, it is unlikely that federal impacts will be positive. Thus, inherent in federal environmental decision making of all projects is the consideration of socio-economic benefits that will flow from a project and that will (or will not) outweigh the negative impacts on fish navigation, or other areas of federal responsibility. [Footnote omitted; p. 113.]\nIn like manner, as noted by Professors Marie-Ann Bowden and Martin Z. P. Olszynski, to suggest that it is constitutional for federal authorities to consider whether a project has economic benefits, but unconstitutional for them to consider whether the same project promotes sustainable development, would be to suggest that the Constitution is inherently and permanently biased towards an out-dated and discredited model for economic growth  a seemingly untenable proposition (Old Puzzle, New Pieces: Red Chris and Vanadium and the Future of Federal Environmental Assessment (2010), 89 Can. Bar Rev. 445, at p. 484).\nIn closing on this point, we hasten to add that, if federal authorities tried to rely on a trivial adverse federal effect as a constitutional Trojan horse enabling them, on the pretext of some narrow ground of federal jurisdiction, to conduct a far ranging inquiry into a designated project, the federal action would be subject to judicial review on administrative law grounds (Oldman River, at p. 71). Such a federal decision in a particular case would be unreasonable as being contrary to the object and purpose of the IAA.\nWe conclude that the public interest decision-making process under the IAA is constitutional, provided that it is anchored in adverse federal effects within Parliaments legislative jurisdiction. We address that issue next.\nThe Defined Effects Within Federal Jurisdiction Fit Within Parliaments Legislative Jurisdiction\nThe defined effects within federal jurisdiction under s. 2 of the IAA, which serve as triggers or gateways for the prohibitions under s. 7 and for the application of the designated projects scheme of the IAA, each fall under Parliaments legislative jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867. None of the adverse federal effects is constitutionally overbroad.\nProtecting Fish and Fish Habitat and Aquatic Species Falls Under Parliaments Power Over the Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries\nThe IAA defines effects within federal jurisdiction as including a change to the component of the environment involving fish and fish habitat, as defined in s. 2(1) of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, or aquatic species, as defined in s. 2(1) of the Species at Risk Act, S.C. 2002, c. 29. The Fisheries Act defines fish broadly, and as including marine animals. It also defines fish habitat as meaning water frequented by fish and any other areas on which fish depend directly or indirectly to carry out their life processes, including spawning grounds and nursery, rearing, food supply and migration areas. The Species at Risk Act defines aquatic species as meaning a wildlife species that is a fish or a marine plant as defined under the Fisheries Act. Properly interpreted, the IAAs inclusion of changes to the environment of fish, fish habitat, and aquatic species as an adverse federal effect protects non-trivial or more than de minimis changes to this component of the environment. \nProhibiting any change to fish, fish habitat, and aquatic species under the IAA as an adverse federal effect is properly anchored in Parliaments exclusive authority over the sea coast and inland fisheries under s. 91(12) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The s. 91(12) power includes the authority to legislate for the preservation of fish and to protect the environment of fish and other aquatic species (Hogg and Wright, at  30:26 (footnote omitted); Beaudoin, at p. 830; Northwest Falling Contractors, at p. 300). Preventing substances deleterious to fish [from] entering into waters frequented by fish is a proper concern of federal legislation under s. 91(12) (Northwest Falling Contractors, at p. 301). The power to control and regulate the resource must include the authority to protect all those creatures which form a part of that system (p. 300). The fisheries power includes not only conservation and protection, but also the general regulation of the fisheries, including their management and control (Ward, at para. 41). The fisheries power extends to protection of the animals that inhabit the seas, but also embraces commercial and economic interests, aboriginal rights and interests, and the public interest in sport and recreation (para. 41).\nThis conclusion is consistent with Fowler, where this Court held that a provision of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-14, exceeded federal legislative competence because it sought to prohibit broadly putting debris into any water frequented by fish, without any threshold of actual or potential harm to fisheries (pp. 216 and 226). Fowler involved an offence creating a general prohibition of certain conduct  in any circumstances  whether or not it would likely harm fish. By contrast, the IAA contains a threshold of harm to fish or fish habitat by focussing on preventing likely and significant adverse federal effects, subject to the public interest considerations. It also involves an assessment regime, which is project-specific and has as its core the question of whether there are likely adverse federal effects.\nAs a result, the component of the definition of adverse federal effect involving the protection of fish, fish habitat, and aquatic species is constitutional.\nProtecting Migratory Birds Falls Under Parliaments Imperial Treaty Power\nThe IAA defines effects within federal jurisdiction as including a change to the component of the environment including migratory bird[s], as defined in s. 2(1) of the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, S.C. 1994, c. 22. The Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 defines a migratory bird as meaning a migratory bird referred to in the Convention Between the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada and the United States, August 16, 1916, [1917] Gr. Brit. T.S. No. 7 (Cd. 8476) (Migratory Birds Convention), and includes the sperm, eggs, embryos, tissue cultures, and parts of the bird. Properly interpreted, the IAA protects non-trivial or more than de minimis changes to the component of the environment involving migratory birds.\nThe Migratory Birds Convention is an imperial treaty entered into between the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and thus falls under Parliaments legislative power to implement imperial treaties under s. 132 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Canada implemented the Migratory Birds Convention through the Migratory Birds Convention Act, S.C. 1917, c. 18. When Canada and the United States amended the Migratory Birds Convention in 1994, Parliament implemented the amended Convention by adopting the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 (Protocol between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America Amending the 1916 Convention between the United Kingdom and the United States of America for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada and the United States, Can. T.S. 1999 No. 34). \nProtecting migratory birds under the IAA as an effect within federal jurisdiction is properly anchored in Parliaments exclusive authority to implement imperial treaties under s. 132 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The purpose of the Migratory Birds Convention, as stated in its recital, is to preserve and protect migratory birds given their significant environmental and ecological importance. Migratory birds are stated to be of great value as a source of food or in destroying insects which are injurious to forests and forage plants on the public domain, as well as to agricultural crops, in both Canada and the United States, but are . . . in danger of extermination through lack of adequate protection during the nesting season or while on their way to and from their breeding grounds. \nAs a result, the migratory birds component of the definition of adverse federal effect is constitutional.\nProtecting the Indigenous Peoples of Canada and Their Rights Falls Under Parliaments Power Over Indians, and Lands Reserved for the Indians\nThe IAA defines effects within federal jurisdiction as including a change to the component of the environment with respect to the Indigenous peoples of Canada  occurring in Canada and resulting from a change to the environment  on (i) physical and cultural heritage, (ii) the current use of lands and resources for traditional purposes, or (iii) any structure, site, or thing that is of historical, archaeological, paleontological or architectural significance. It also includes any change occurring in Canada to the health, social, or economic conditions of the Indigenous peoples of Canada.\nProtecting the components of the environment affecting Indigenous peoples and their rights falls under Parliaments exclusive legislative jurisdiction over Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians in s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. A critical aspect of s. 91(24) relates to the protection of, and concern for, the welfare of the Indigenous peoples of Canada (Daniels v. Canada (Indian Affairs and Northern Development), 2016 SCC 12, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 99, at paras. 4-5, 13-15 and 49-50; Canadian Western Bank, at paras. 60-61; Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010, at para. 176; Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 85, at pp. 109 and 126; R. Boivin, A qui appartient lobligation de fiduciaire a legard des autochtones? (1994), 35 C. de D. 3, at p. 13). The IAA falls under Parliaments protective legislative authority involving Indigenous peoples by requiring the early identification and safeguarding of the interests of Indigenous peoples and by facilitating their meaningful participation in assessing the impacts of a designated project.\nSection 91(24) is a broad power (Hogg and Wright, at  28:2). It is well established that Indigenous peoples in Canada are uniquely impacted by major projects precisely because of their Indigeneity and the distinctive challenges they face. In our view, the definition of effect within federal jurisdiction involving the Indigenous peoples of Canada and their rights is constitutional.\nThe Protection Against Interprovincial and International Pollution Falls Under the National Concern Branch of Parliaments Peace, Order, and Good Government Power\nThe IAA defines effects within federal jurisdiction as meaning, among other things, a change to a component of the environment that would occur in a province other than one in which the act or thing is done and a change to the environment that would occur outside Canada. Collectively, these aspects of the definition of effects within federal jurisdiction target interprovincial and international pollution.\nThis Court has accepted that federal jurisdiction over several forms of international and interprovincial pollution can be grounded under the national concern branch of Parliaments residuary power of peace, order, and good government in the introductory words of s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Parliament has recognized legislative jurisdiction over the prevention of marine pollution and the pollution of interprovincial rivers (Crown Zellerbach, at pp. 417 and 438; Interprovincial Co-operatives, at pp. 513-14 and 520). The Courts jurisprudence has consistently reflected the view that interprovincial pollution is constitutionally different from local pollution (References re GGPPA, at para. 195). As noted by Professors Hogg and Wright, Parliament has jurisdiction over international and interprovincial rivers, where pollution in one province will be carried into other provinces or countries ( 30:32). They note that [t]he national concern branch of the peace, order, and good government power will support measures to control pollution of air or water that are beyond the capacity of the provinces to control ( 30:32). Because provincial legislative jurisdiction is territorially restricted to pollution in the province, only Parliament can legislate in relation to interprovincial and international pollution (Reference re Newfoundland Continental Shelf, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 86, at pp. 128-29). As this Court has recognized, the basic rule is that general legislative authority in respect of all that is not within the provincial field is federal (Interprovincial Co-operatives, at p. 514).\nWe agree with Canadas concession that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  although relevant to the public interest determination  will generally not be an effect within federal jurisdiction under the IAAs definition. Under the IAAs project-specific approach, the federal government would need to show that an individual projects GHG emissions would cause a non-trivial change to the environment in another province or outside Canada. If Canada attempts to treat a projects GHG emissions as an effect within federal jurisdiction, then whether an individual projects GHG emissions, in context of the global scale of the climate crisis, may cause non-trivial changes to the environment is best assessed through case-specific judicial review of whether a particular exercise of discretion is consistent with the national concern test, set out in the References re GGPPA. Nor, we would add, is there any evidence that Canada has ever treated GHG emissions as an effect within federal jurisdiction in administering the IAA. While the Minister has referred to a projects GHG emissions when discussing the impacts of a project that was otherwise not in the public interest, we are not aware of any instance in which GHG emissions have themselves ever been relied on as an effect within federal jurisdiction (see Impact Assessment Agency of Canada, Ministers Response: Vista Coal Underground Mine Project and Vista Mine Phase II Expansion Project, September 29, 2021 (online), explaining that a mine was designated based on potential adverse effects on fisheries and Indigenous peoples; Suncor Energy Inc., Base Mine Extension: Initial Project Description, February 2020 (online), identifying potential adverse impacts on fisheries, aquatic species, and migratory birds). The majority refers to two letters from federal officials that identified GHG emissions as unacceptable environmental effects, but those letters simply described GHG emissions as a facto[r] . . . considered in the determination of whether the adverse effects of the Project within federal jurisdiction are in the public interest (para. 188; Letter from the Honourable Steven Guilbeault to Suncor Energy Inc., April 6, 2022 (online); Letter from the Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson to Coalspur Mines (Operations) Ltd., June 11, 2021 (online), similarly describing concerns regarding GHG emissions as factors weigh[ing] against the public interest). And although Canada may have contemplated treating GHG emissions as an effect within federal jurisdiction in a discussion paper when proposing the Regulations, neither the Regulations nor the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement take that position. Rather, Canada rejected proposals to use GHG emissions as a standalone basis for an effect within federal jurisdiction.\nBut to repeat: if particular exercises of federal authority under the IAA seek to stretch the boundaries of Parliaments constitutional authority to regulate international and interprovincial pollution, including potentially GHG emissions, such instances can be addressed in future cases reviewing concrete government action and with the benefit of a well-developed evidentiary record. It is neither necessary nor desirable to address speculative concern[s] regarding potential misuse of the IAA in this reference (References re GGPPA, at para. 220). \nAs a result, in our view, the component of the definition of effects within federal jurisdiction involving interprovincial and international pollution is constitutional.\nConclusion on Classification\nEach of the defined effects within federal jurisdiction under s. 2 of the IAA that form the backbone of the IAA is properly classified as falling under Parliaments exclusive legislative jurisdiction under the Constitution Act, 1867 over the sea coast and inland fisheries (s. 91(12)), imperial treaties (s. 132), Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians (s. 91(24)), and peace, order, and good government (s. 91). As a result, the IAA and Regulations are intra vires in their entirety.\nProvincial Undertakings Are Not Immune From Federal Environmental Assessment Under the Doctrine of Interjurisdictional Immunity\nIn closing, we comment briefly on Albertas alternative argument that if the IAA is constitutionally valid, then the IAA and Regulations are constitutionally inapplicable to provincial undertakings under the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. \nUnder the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity, the core of a federal or provincial legislative power is protected from impairment by the other level of government (Rogers Communications Inc. v. Chateauguay (City), 2016 SCC 23, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 59; Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, 2010 SCC 39, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 536 (COPA), at para. 26). The doctrine is applied in two steps (Rogers Communications, at para. 59; COPA, at para. 27). The court first asks whether legislation adopted by one level of government trenches on the core of the power of the other level of government. If it does, the court asks then asks whether the effect of the statute on the protected core is sufficiently serious to trigger the doctrines application.\nAlberta asserts that applying federal environmental assessment legislation would impair the core of the provinces legislative powers under several provisions of the Constitution Act, 1867: ss. 92(5) (management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province and of the timber and wood thereon), 92(10) (local works and undertakings), 92(13) (property and civil rights in the province), 92(16) (matters of a merely local or private nature in the province), 92A(1) (non-renewable natural resources, forestry resources, and electrical energy), and 109 (property in all lands, mines, minerals, and royalties). We would not give effect to this argument. \nIn Oldman River, Justice La Forest dismissed the notion that characterizing a project as provincial could be a basis to reject the application of federal environmental assessment legislation to a project. He stated that such an approach begs the question and posits an erroneous principle that seems to hold that there exists a general doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity to shield provincial works or undertakings from otherwise valid federal legislation (p. 68; see also Johnston, at p. 116). \nIn addition, more recently this Court has held that the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity must be applied with restraint and is generally reserved for situations already covered by precedent (Canadian Western Bank, at paras. 77-78; COPA, at para. 36; Rogers Communications, at para. 63; References re GGPPA, at para. 124). As was found in the Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, [i]n keeping with the movement of constitutional law towards a more flexible view of federalism that reflects the political and cultural realities of Canadian society, the fixed watertight compartments approach has long since been overtaken and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity has been limited (para. 22).\nAlberta offered no precedent to support the application of the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity to the heads of provincial power invoked here. As a result, we see no basis to apply the doctrine in the circumstances.\nConclusion\nIn our opinion, the IAA and the Regulations fall within the legislative competence of the Parliament of Canada under the Constitution Act, 1867. As a result, the constitutional questions should be answered in the negative and the appeal allowed. The motion to adduce new evidence should be dismissed.\n\tAppeal allowed in part.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Attorney General of Canada  Department of Justice Canada, Civil Litigation Sector, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Bennett Jones, Calgary; Alberta Justice, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario  Constitutional Law Branch, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Quebec: Ministere de la Justice du Quebec  Direction du droit constitutionnel et autochtone, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of New Brunswick: Attorney General of New Brunswick  Constitutional Unit, Legal Services Branch, Fredericton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Manitoba: Manitoba Justice  Legal Services Branch, Constitutional Law Section, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Attorney General of British Columbia, Victoria.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Attorney General for Saskatchewan  Constitutional Law, Regina.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador: Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. Johns.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Indian Resource Council: Rae and Company, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the File Hills QuAppelle Tribal Council and the Pasqua First Nation: Maurice Law, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the World Wildlife Fund Canada: Nanda & Company, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the interveners Nature Canada and the West Coast Environmental Law Association: West Coast Environmental Law, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers: Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Taxpayers Federation: Crease Harman, Victoria.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation: Woodward & Company Lawyers, Victoria.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Business Council of Alberta: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Calgary.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Ecojustice Canada Society: Ecojustice Canada Society, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Woodland Cree First Nation: Alberta Counsel, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Mikisew Cree First Nation: JFK Law, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Hydro-Quebec: McCarthy Tetrault, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Constitution Foundation: Borden Ladner Gervais, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Independent Contractors and Businesses Association and the Alberta Enterprise Group: Gall Legge Grant Zwack, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment: Public Interest Law Clinic  University of Calgary, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Advocates for the Rule of Law: McCarthy Tetrault, Toronto; Jordan Honickman, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Oceans North Conservation Society: Arvay Finlay, Victoria.\n\tSolicitor for the interveners the Canadian Environmental Law Association, Environmental Defence Canada Inc. and MiningWatch Canada Inc.: Canadian Environmental Law Association, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada: Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the First Nations Major Projects Coalition Society: Power Law, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener Centre quebecois du droit de lenvironnement: Centre quebecois du droit de lenvironnement, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Lummi Nation: DGW Law Corporation, Victoria.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Sets Aside Parts of the Impact Assessment Act**\n\nThis appeal concerns the constitutionality of the Impact Assessment Act (IAA) and the Physical Activities Regulations, with the Attorney General of Canada challenging the Court of Appeal of Alberta's decision that both laws are ultra vires Parliament.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe Attorney General of Canada, as the complainant, alleged that the IAA and the Regulations are unconstitutional in their entirety. The IAA establishes a complex information-gathering and regulatory scheme, comprising two parts: one dealing with projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or outside Canada, and the other dealing with designated projects as defined in the IAA. The core allegations centered on the constitutionality of these laws, with the Attorney General of Alberta, as the accused, defending their validity.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe court proceedings began with a reference by the Lieutenant Governor in Council to the Court of Appeal of Alberta concerning the constitutionality of the IAA and the Physical Activities Regulations. A majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that both laws were ultra vires Parliament and therefore unconstitutional in their entirety. The Attorney General of Canada appealed as of right to the Supreme Court, which ultimately allowed only parts of the appeal, finding that certain components of the IAA were intra vires Parliament while others were ultra vires.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA regulatory scheme exceeds the bounds of federal jurisdiction if its pith and substance is not directed at regulating effects within federal jurisdiction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority of the court, Wagner C.J. held that the Impact Assessment Act (IAA) is unconstitutional in part, as its pith and substance exceeds the bounds of federal jurisdiction. The IAA's pith and substance is to assess and regulate designated projects with a view to mitigating or preventing their potential adverse environmental, health, social, and economic impacts. However, the federal government has overstepped its constitutional competence by regulating projects that are primarily regulated by provincial legislatures and not tailored to the federal aspects of the activity. The decision highlights the complexities and challenges of environmental assessment and regulatory frameworks in Canada, particularly in the context of federal-provincial relations.", "citation": "2023 SCC 23", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court rules  the federal impact assessment scheme is largely unconstitutional.</strong>In this case, the Supreme Court looked at the constitutionality of  the federal environmental assessment scheme under the <em>Impact Assessment Act</em>, enacted by Parliament in 2019. The Court was  asked to consider whether the Act and one of its regulations went beyond  Parliament\u2019s legislative authority under the Constitution.The Act and the regulations establish a complex information  gathering and regulatory scheme in two parts. One part, which is set out in  sections 81 to 91 of the Act, establishes an impact assessment process for  projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or  outside Canada. It requires the federal authority, in such cases, to decide if  the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. If  so, it must then be determined whether these effects are justified in the  circumstances.<strong></strong>The other part, which includes the remaining provisions in the Act  and the regulations, outlines what projects are considered \u201cdesignated  projects\u201d under the Act and makes them subject to federal review automatically. <strong></strong>Alberta\u2019s Lieutenant Governor referred two questions with respect to  this scheme to the province\u2019s Court of Appeal \u2014 references are when governments  ask courts for their legal opinion on a question of law. First, they asked  whether the Act was unconstitutional, in whole or in part, as being beyond  Parliament\u2019s legislative authority under the Constitution (the legal term for  this is <em>ultra vires</em>). Second, they  asked whether the regulations were unconstitutional, in whole or in part, because  they applied to matters entirely within the legislative authority of the  provinces under the Constitution. A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal concluded  that the Act and the regulations were <em>ultra  vires</em> Parliament and therefore unconstitutional in their entirety.The Attorney General of Canada appealed this decision to the Supreme  Court. Unlike the federal government, which can direct reference questions  straight to the Supreme Court, provincial and territorial governments must  first direct reference questions to their courts of appeal. However, provincial  and territorial opinions can be appealed to the Supreme Court as-of-right (automatically),  which means they do not require leave (permission) to be heard by the Court.<strong> </strong>The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part.<strong> </strong><strong>Although the process set  forth in sections 81 to 91 of the Act is constitutional, the balance of the  scheme is <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament and  thus unconstitutional.</strong>Writing for a majority of the Court, Chief Justice Wagner ruled that  the reference questions should be answered in the affirmative: the federal  impact assessment scheme is unconstitutional in part. While the  constitutionality of sections 81 to 91 of the Act was not challenged, Chief  Justice Wagner said that the process set forth therein is constitutional.  However, the balance of the scheme \u2014 that is, the \u201cdesignated projects\u201d portion  \u2014 is <em>ultra vires</em> Parliament and thus  unconstitutional for two overarching reasons. First, it is not directed at  regulating \u201ceffects within federal jurisdiction\u201d as defined in the Act, because  these effects do not drive the scheme\u2019s decision-making functions. Second, the  defined term \u201ceffects within federal jurisdiction\u201d does not align with federal  legislative jurisdiction. The overbreadth of these effects exacerbates the  constitutional frailties of the scheme\u2019s decision-making functions, he said.As Chief Justice Wagner wrote, \u201c[e]nvironmental protection remains  one of today\u2019s most pressing challenges. To meet this challenge, Parliament has the power  to enact a scheme of environmental assessment. Parliament also has the duty,  however, to act within the enduring division of powers framework laid out in  the Constitution\u201d. Moreover, the Chief Justice noted that \u201cit is open to  Parliament and the provincial legislatures to exercise their respective powers  over the environment harmoniously, in the spirit of cooperative federalism\u201d,  adding that \u201cboth levels of government can exercise leadership in environmental  protection and ensure the continued health of our shared environment.\u201d<strong> </strong>"}, "12": {"original_text": "\n\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\nLa Presse inc.\tAppellant\nv.\nHis Majesty The King and\nFrederick Silva\tRespondents\n- and -\nCanadian Broadcasting Corporation,\nGlobal News, a division of Corus Television Limited Partnership,\nPostmedia Network Inc.,\nCTV News, a division of Bell Media Inc.,\nGlacier Media Inc.,\nCityNews, a division of Rogers Media Inc.,\nGlobe and Mail Inc. and\nTorstar Corporation\tAppellants\nv.\nHis Majesty The King and\nAydin Coban\tRespondents\nand\nBritish Columbia Civil Liberties Association\tIntervener\nIndexed as: La Presse inc. v.

The application judges in both cases dismissed the media applications, concluding that the automatic publication ban found in s. 648(1) of the Criminal Code that prohibits the publication of information about portions of a criminal trial at which the jury is not present applies not only after but also before the empanelment of the jury.\n\tHeld: The appeals should be dismissed.\n\tThe automatic publication ban in s. 648(1) of the Criminal Code applies not only after the jury is empanelled but also before the jury is empanelled with respect to matters dealt with pursuant to s. 645(5) of the Criminal Code, which confers upon trial judges the jurisdiction to deal with certain matters before the empanelment of the jury. In Ss case, the Garofoli application and motion for a stay of proceedings clearly concerned the indictment and had to be dealt with by the trial judge. Therefore, it is only by virtue of s. 645(5) that these matters could be dealt with prior to the empanelment of the jury, and it follows that they were covered by s. 648(1). In Cs case, the media had applied for a declaration that s. 648(1) applies only after the jury has been empanelled. The dismissal of the application by the judge is consistent with the proper interpretation of s. 648(1).\n\tThe words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. The plain meaning of the text is not in itself determinative and must be tested against the other indicators of legislative meaning  context, purpose, and relevant legal norms. A provision is only ambiguous if its words can reasonably be interpreted in more than one way after due consideration of the context in which they appear and of the purpose of the provision. Proposed but abandoned amendments are of no assistance in identifying the meaning of legislation.\n\tThe context and purpose of s. 648(1) reveal its correct interpretation. With respect to context, to understand the operation of s. 648(1), one must read it in light of the numerous relevant provisions that followed its enactment, and most particularly s. 645(5). In this context, trial judges now have the flexibility to hear, before the empanelment of the jury, various matters that are deemed to be part of the trial. These are clearly dealt with in the absence of the jury and, as such, are automatically covered by s. 648(1).\n\tWith respect to purpose, by enacting s. 648(1) in 1972, Parliament intended to enhance trial fairness through the protection of two interconnected interests, which are best served when the trial proceeds only on information properly available to the jury. First, Parliaments intent to protect the fundamental interest of the accused in being tried by jurors who are not exposed to, and biased by, the content of and rulings on matters heard in their absence is immediately apparent from the wording of the provision  which bans the publication of information regarding portions of the trial at which the jury is not present  and readily inferable from Hansard. Parliament aimed to shield the jury from information about any portion of the trial from which it was absent, so that its verdict is based only on the evidence found admissible in court. This objective is relevant with respect to both the existent jury and the jury yet to be empanelled.\n\tSecond, trial fairness under s. 648(1) is also concerned with the interest of both the accused and society in the efficiency of Canadas system of trial by jury. This is revealed by Parliaments choice to introduce an automatic publication ban that applies simply by operation of statute and thus does not require the intervention of a court. Parliament must have had delays and judicial resources in mind when it removed judicial discretion. By shielding information from publication, s. 648(1) gives courts the confidence, flexibility, and ability to hold hearings earlier in time, which can be expected to reduce delays and may also allow the parties to gain certainty about contested matters, leading to earlier resolution.\n\tSection 648(1) applies before the jury is empanelled only when a judge is exercising jurisdiction traceable to s. 645(5) to deal with a matter that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the absence of the jury after it has been sworn. The Courts analysis in R. v. Litchfield, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333, provides a useful framework for assessing whether a matter is being dealt with by virtue of s. 645(5) or whether it could always have been dealt with, even in the absence of s. 645(5), before the jury was empanelled. This framework looks to the following features: whether the matter concerns the indictment, and whether, but for the jurisdiction of case management judges, the matter would have to be dealt with by the trial judge. To avoid uncertainty over what matters are covered by a publication ban under s. 648(1), it would be prudent for judges holding a hearing pursuant to s. 645(5) to announce that they are exercising their jurisdiction under that provision and to note that s. 648(1) automatically prohibits the publication of any information regarding that portion of the trial. It is also open to courts to fill any gap in relation to pre-trial conferences through their rule-making authority under ss. 482 and 482.1 of the Criminal Code, and judges retain inherent jurisdiction to impose discretionary publication bans in accordance with the Dagenais/Mentuck/Sherman principles.\nCases Cited\n\tOverruled: R. v.

Today, this ban is found in s. 648(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46:\n648 (1) After permission to separate is given to members of a jury under subsection 647(1), no information regarding any portion of the trial at which the jury is not present shall be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any way before the jury retires to consider its verdict.\nThe question before this Court is whether and, if so, how this automatic publication ban applies before the jury is empanelled, given the jurisdiction conferred by s. 645(5) of the Criminal Code upon trial judges, since 1985, to deal with certain matters before the empanelment of the jury:\n(5) In any case to be tried with a jury, the judge before whom an accused is or is to be tried has jurisdiction, before any juror on a panel of jurors is called pursuant to subsection 631(3) or (3.1) and in the absence of any such juror, to deal with any matter that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the absence of the jury after it has been sworn.\nIn the cases under appeal, numerous matters were dealt with before the empanelment of the jury. In Mr. Silvas case, these included a Garofoli application and an application for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process. In Mr. Cobans case, these included a constitutional challenge to another publication ban under s. 486.4(3) of the Criminal Code. Certain media outlets (the appellants before this Court) applied for orders or declarations that would allow the publication of information from the hearings on those matters. The judges in both cases dismissed the media applications, concluding that s. 648(1) applies before the empanelment of the jury. Information from the hearings could not be published until the juries retired for deliberations or were dismissed.\nThis Court has addressed s. 648(1) in two cases, although neither of them resolves the interpretive issue in these appeals. In R. v. Brassington, 2018 SCC 37, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 616, footnote 1, Justice Abella noted the diverging approaches to this issue. In R. v. J.J., 2022 SCC 28, para. 283, Justice Brown, dissenting in part, treated s. 648(1) as applying before jury selection to information that would ordinarily be dealt with in the absence of a jury, though he provided little analysis. These appeals call upon this Court to resolve this interpretive issue in light of the provisions text, context, and purpose  the context including the open court principle and the right to a fair trial.\nThe open court principle has been recognized by this Court as fundamental throughout the entirety of criminal proceedings, that is, both at the pre-trial or pre-empanelment stage and during the trial (Vancouver Sun (Re), 2004 SCC 43, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 332, at para. 27, citing Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. MacIntyre, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 175, at pp. 183 and 186). I pause at this point to note that the term pre-trial in English, and the terms avant le proces, prealable au proces, and anterieur au proces in French, have at times been used in the jurisprudence to refer to the period before a jury has been empanelled (see, e.g., R. v. Malik, Bagri and Reyat, 2002 BCSC 80; R. v. Stobbe, 2011 MBQB 293, 277 Man. R. (2d) 65; R. v. Twitchell, 2010 ABQB 692, 509 A.R. 131; La Presse inc. v. Silva, 2022 QCCS 881; R. v. Bebawi, 2019 QCCS 594; R. v. Farhan, 2000 CanLII 18876 (Que. Sup. Ct.); and R. v. Bissonnette, 2021 QCCS 3856, 74 C.R. (7th) 70). Other times, judges have been careful to refer to this period as pre-jury-selection or before the jury is empanelled in English, and avant la selection du jury, prealable a la selection du jury or avant la constitution du jury in French (see, e.g., R. v. Cheung, 2000 ABQB 905, [2001] 3 W.W.R. 713; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Millard, 2015 ONSC 6583, 338 C.C.C. (3d) 227; R. v. Emms, 2012 SCC 74, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 810; R. v. Ouellette, [1998] R.J.Q. 2842 (Sup. Ct.); and R. v. Talon, 2006 QCCS 3031). The latter expressions are more accurate, but I will occasionally use the term pre-trial when I refer to others reasoning.\nPublication bans like the one imposed by s. 648(1) are limitations on court openness that can protect the right of the accused to, and societys interest in, a fair trial (see, e.g., Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 835, p. 879). However, this Court has recognized that the absence of a publication ban can also advance trial fairness: for example, by preventing perjury, prevent[ing] state and/or court wrongdoing by placing the criminal justice process under public scrutiny, and encouraging individuals to come forward with relevant new information after hearing about a case (p. 883).\nThere is no irreconcilable conflict between the open court principle and trial fairness. They both serve to instill public confidence in the justice system. The public can understand the work of the courts, and thus come to trust the judicial process and its outcomes, only if informed of what a judge decides and why the particular decision is made (Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada, 2010 SCC 21, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 721, at para. 65 (emphasis in the original)). Needless to say, the media play a crucial role in making this possible (Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, at para. 30, citing Khuja v. Times Newspapers Ltd., [2017] UKSC 49, [2019] A.C. 161, at para. 16; Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1326, at pp. 1339-40). The protection of fair trial interests, such as the right to an independent, impartial, and representative jury, is also essential to public confidence in the administration of justice (R. v. Chouhan, 2021 SCC 26, at para. 12, citing R. v. Sherratt, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 509, at pp. 523-24; see also R. v. Kokopenace, 2015 SCC 28, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 398, at para. 55, citing Sherratt, at pp. 523-25, and R. v. Church of Scientology (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 65 (C.A.), at pp. 118-20).\nHere, Parliament has chosen to impose a temporary publication ban for the purposes of shielding the jury from information it has never been permitted to consider and promoting efficient trials.\nI conclude that s. 648(1) applies before the jury is empanelled to matters dealt with pursuant to s. 645(5). This conclusion follows from an understanding of the text of s. 648(1) when considered in its full context and in light of Parliaments purpose. This interpretation does not expand the coverage of the publication ban: only matters that were captured by the ban prior to the enactment of s. 645(5) continue to be captured by it today. This interpretation has not evolved or changed in a way that departs from any previous meaning held by s. 648(1). The context of modern trials simply reveals s. 648(1)s full temporal scope.\nJudgments Below\nLa Presse inc. v. Silva, 2022 QCCS 881\nThe accused, Mr. Silva, was charged with four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. During pre-empanelment proceedings, an application for a stay of proceedings and a Garofoli application were brought in relation to the police techniques used to locate and arrest the accused. David J. dismissed both applications and made orders pursuant to s. 648(1) prohibiting the publication and broadcasting of his decisions. (It is anomalous that these orders were made given that, when s. 648(1) applies, it applies automatically, by operation of statute.)\nLa Presse inc. (an appellant in this Court) brought an application to lift the publication bans, relying on Bebawi, for the view that s. 648(1) applies only after the jury is empanelled. David J. dismissed the application on the basis that, on his interpretation, s. 648(1) applies both before and after the jury is empanelled. In the alternative, and regardless of s. 648(1)s temporal scope, David J. would have upheld the publication bans under the test set out in Dagenais, in R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, and in Sherman.\nDavid J. listed four reasons for his interpretation of s. 648(1). First, the interpretation of s. 648(1) as applying both before and after the jury is empanelled best aligns with the purpose of this provision, namely to ensure that the pretrial proceedings do not contaminate the fairness of the later trial (para. 26 (CanLII), quoting Millard, at para. 25). Second, the current practice in criminal proceedings is to deal with many applications before the jury is empanelled. Third, s. 648(1) must be read together with other Criminal Code provisions establishing publication bans for matters dealt with before the jury is empanelled. Fourth, the temporary nature of s. 648(1) bans strikes a fair balance between the protection of freedom of information and the protection of trial fairness.\nFollowing a guilty verdict on the last count against the accused, the orders made under s. 648(1) were lifted.\nR. v. Coban, 2022 BCSC 880\nThe accused, Mr. Coban, was charged with several offences relating to child pornography, extortion, child luring, and harassment (see 2022 BCSC 1810). The underlying facts drew national and international attention (2022 BCSC 14, 420 C.C.C. (3d) 114; A.F., CBC et al., para. 8). Numerous pre-empanelment proceedings occurred over a 15-month period, including a constitutional challenge to s. 486.4(3) of the Criminal Code (see 2022 BCSC 14; A.F., CBC et al., at para. 9). The judge was of the view that the automatic publication ban found in s. 648(1) applied to the information relating to the constitutional challenge. \nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and other media outlets (appellants in this Court, to which I will refer to collectively as CBC) applied for a declaration that the s. 648(1) ban applies only after the jury is empanelled and therefore did not prohibit the publication of information about the constitutional challenge. In her reasons, the judge followed the Supreme Court of British Columbias decision in Malik, in which it had been held that s. 648(1) extends to pre-trial proceedings that take place pursuant to s. 645(5), before a jury has been empanelled, and she dismissed the application (2022 BCSC 880, at para. 6 (CanLII), citing Malik).\nJurisdiction and Mootness\nBoth appeals reached this Court, with leave, directly from the judgment of a superior court by virtue of s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26 (see Dagenais, at pp. 861-62 and 872).\nBoth appeals are also moot because, at this point, neither presents a live controversy. The trials have concluded and s. 648(1) no longer prohibits the publication of any information from them. This Court was aware of the possibility of mootness when it granted leave to appeal.\nThe considerations in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, suggest that this Court should exercise its discretion to hear and decide the appeals, even though they are moot (see also Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), 2003 SCC 62, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 16-22). The parties have provided a clear adversarial context, presenting their arguments capably and with dedication. The operation of s. 648(1) results in automatic publication bans that are often of brief duration relative to the typical timeline of an appeal to this Court, and the issue of its proper interpretation is one that is capable of repetition, yet evasive of review (Borowski, at p. 364). Given the judicial division on this issue across the country without the possibility of appellate guidance other than from this Court, the concern for judicial economy justifies resolving the issue, especially considering the importance of the rights and interests in play. Lastly, resolution of this issue calls for straightforward statutory interpretation, a task well within the institutional competence of the Court.\nIssues in These Appeals\nTrial courts are divided on the interpretation of s. 648(1), as previously noted by this Court in Brassington, at para. 4, fn. 1. Some courts have held that s. 648(1) applies only after the jury is empanelled (Cheung; Twitchell; Bebawi; R. v. Wright, 2020 ONSC 7049, 472 C.R.R. (2d) 296). Others have held that s. 648(1) also applies before the jury is empanelled. Of those holding that s. 648(1) applies to matters dealt with before the jury is empanelled, some have found that it applies to all information about all such matters (R. v. Stanley, 2018 SKQB 27). Others have found that it applies only to certain kinds of hearings (R. v. Sandham (2008), 248 C.C.C. (3d) 543 (Ont. S.C.J.); Stobbe) or have read down the phrase no information such that only information that would be prejudicial to the accused is captured by s. 648(1) when it applies before the jury is empanelled (R. v. Regan (1997), 159 D.L.R. (4th) 350 (N.S.S.C.); Malik; R. v. Pickton, 2005 BCSC 836; R. v. Valentine (2009), 251 C.C.C. (3d) 120 (Ont. S.C.J.)).\nThis judicial divide presents two issues:\nDoes s. 648(1) apply before the jury is empanelled?\nIf s. 648(1) applies before the jury is empanelled, what hearings and what information are captured by a publication ban under this section?\nInterpreting s. 648(1) under the modern approach to statutory interpretation reveals that the provision applies before the jury is empanelled to prohibit the publication of any information from hearings held pursuant to the jurisdiction provided under s. 645(5).\nAnalysis\nPrinciples of Statutory Interpretation\nIt is well established that, under the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87). Confusion as to what this might entail in practice endures, despite the apparent simplicity of Driedgers influential words. For the sake of clarity, I will restate two principles that seem to be at the heart of this confusion.\nFirst, the plain meaning of the text is not in itself determinative and must be tested against the other indicators of legislative meaning  context, purpose, and relevant legal norms (R. v. Alex, 2017 SCC 37, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 967, at para. 31). The apparent clarity of the words taken separately does not suffice because they may in fact prove to be ambiguous once placed in their context. The possibility of the context revealing a latent ambiguity such as this is a logical result of the modern approach to interpretation (Montreal (City) v. 2952-1366 Quebec Inc., 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 141, at para. 10).\nSecond, a provision is only ambiguous in the sense contemplated in Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, if its words can reasonably be interpreted in more than one way after due consideration of the context in which they appear and of the purpose of the provision (paras. 29-30). This is to say that there is a real ambiguity  one that calls for the use of external interpretive aids like the principle of strict construction of penal laws or the presumption of conformity with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  only if differing readings of the same provision cannot be decisively resolved through the contextual and purposive approach set out by Driedger (ibid.).\nWith these principles in mind, I turn now to the interpretive exercise.\nText \nFor ease of reference, I will reproduce the text of s. 648(1) again:\n648 (1) After permission to separate is given to members of a jury under subsection 647(1), no information regarding any portion of the trial at which the jury is not present shall be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any way before the jury retires to consider its verdict.\nAccording to the appellants, the opening words of s. 648(1), [a]fter permission to separate is given to members of a jury, represent a condition precedent that restricts the scope of the prohibition imposed by this provision. More specifically, CBC argues that to interpret s. 648(1) as applying before the jury is empanelled would amount to striking words of limitation from a statutory provision (A.F., CBC et al., at para. 77 (emphasis added)). La Presse, for its part, argues that such an interpretation would require adding words (i.e. before or) to the provision (A.F., La Presse, para. 50).\nThis interpretation may seem plausible when the opening words of s. 648(1) are read in isolation. But look just ahead to the words that create the prohibition: . . . no information regarding any portion of the trial at which the jury is not present shall be published . . . . These additional words already begin to pull one away from the interpretation urged by the appellants.\nIn my view, the opening phrase [a]fter permission to separate is given to members of a jury simply describes the time at which, when it was enacted in 1972, the prohibition would have had any practical value. In 1972, because there were no pre-empanelment proceedings, the only time when jurors could have received information about a portion of the trial from which they were absent was when they were permitted to separate.\nIn any case, to the extent that the wording of the provision is plain, an interpretation based on plain meaning alone is not determinative and cannot prevail if it is at odds with the purpose and context (Alex, at para. 33). Here, the context and purpose reveal the alternative, and correct, interpretation.\nContext\nSection 648 was introduced into the Criminal Code alongside s. 647 by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1972, S.C. 1972, c. 13. Section 647 expanded the trial judges ability to permit the jury to separate. Before the 1972 amendment, the judge could not permit the jury to separate where the accused was charged with an offence punishable by death; in such cases, when the jurors were excluded from the courtroom, they were sequestered under the charge of an officer of the court. After the 1972 amendments, the judge could permit the jury to separate no matter the charged offence. For the first time, jurors were able to go home during portions of capital offence trials. Given that such trials were more likely to attract heightened media scrutiny, s. 648 can be seen as enabling this expanded ability for the jury to separate.\nThe general understanding is that in 1972, the common law precluded a trial judge from making evidentiary rulings until after a jury was empanelled (R. v. Curtis (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 156 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at pp. 157-58; House of Commons Debates, vol. I, 1st Sess., 33rd Parl., December 20, 1984, at p. 1414 (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice, at second reading of Bill C-18); Duhamel v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 555, at p. 560). This appears to be a corollary flowing from three premises: (1) the common law principle that a trial did not begin, and a judge was not seized with the trial, until the accused was placed in the charge of the jury (Morin v. The Queen (1890), 18 S.C.R. 407, at p. 413); (2) the principle that [evidentiary] rulings by one judge do not bind another judge who may later deal with the same matter (Curtis, at p. 158 (emphasis in original), citing Duhamel; see also D. Macdougall, Continuity of Judicial Rulings After a Mistrial (2004), 15 C.R. (6th) 273; R. v. Cliche, 2010 QCCA 408); and (3) the fact that an evidentiary ruling made outside of trial could be shielded from review due to the rule against collateral attack (see, e.g., R. v. Litchfield, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333; R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421).\nJudges have traced the increasing complexity of criminal trials to the introduction, in 1974, of provisions relating to the admissibility of wiretap evidence (see Curtis, at pp. 157-58; Protection of Privacy Act, S.C. 1973-74, c. 50). The volume and scope of pre-trial applications grew further with the proclamation of the Charter (Malik, at para. 21 (CanLII)). Juries were sent home for days or weeks during the hearing of applications prior to the presentation of evidence at trial. Section 645(5) was enacted in response to the evolution of criminal trials and the increasing burdens on the justice system (see Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1985, R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 133 (adding s. 645(5) to the Criminal Code); Malik, at para. 21; Cliche, at paras. 36-37 (CanLII)).\nSection 645(5) allowed the trial judge to hear and adjudicate such applications before the jury was empanelled. Concerns expressed in the parliamentary debates included ensuring respect for the jurors time and comfort as well as reducing the costs and resources needed to keep a jury sequestered (see House of Commons Debates, at pp. 1391 and 1414).\nFurther flexibility was introduced in 2011 with the enactment of the Fair and Efficient Criminal Trials Act, S.C. 2011, c. 16. These provisions, as amended, create the role of a case management judge, who, before the stage of the presentation of the evidence on the merits . . . exercises the powers that a trial judge has before that stage (Criminal Code, s. 551.3(1)). When the case management judge adjudicates in relation to matters listed in s. 551.3(1)(g) (evidence, Charter applications, expert witnesses, severance of counts, or separation of trials), the judges decision is normally binding on the parties for the remainder of the trial (s. 551.3(4)).\nThe result is that in a modern trial, the bulk of so-called pre-trial applications are dealt with by the trial judge or case management judge before the jury is empanelled.\nSection 648(1) operates alongside numerous other provisions establishing publication bans, particularly ss. 517(1), 539(1) and 542(2), and the inherent jurisdiction of a judge to impose a discretionary ban under the Dagenais/Mentuck/Sherman framework. Section 517 allows a judge to prohibit the publication of the evidence taken, the information given or the representations made and the reasons, if any, given or to be given at a bail hearing. Section 539 allows a judge to prohibit the publication of the evidence taken at the preliminary inquiry. The bans in ss. 517 and 539 are mandatory when requested by the accused but discretionary when requested by the Crown. Section 542(2) creates an automatic publication ban with respect to any admission or confession [that] was tendered in evidence at a preliminary inquiry. Discretionary bans are those that may be ordered at the discretion of the court; mandatory bans are those that must be imposed at the request of a particular party, and automatic bans are bans that apply by operation of statute. See generally J. Rossiter, Law of Publication Bans, Private Hearings and Sealing Orders (loose-leaf), at  1:7 and 4:48-4:58.\nI note that one of the decisions interpreting s. 648(1) as applying only after the jury is empanelled  Bebawi  relied on the principle set out in Orphan Well Association v. Grant Thornton Ltd., 2019 SCC 5, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 150, that the plain meaning of a provision [cannot] be contorted to make its scheme more coherent (para. 101). In Orphan Well, a majority of this Court was of the view that the context of a provision in federal bankruptcy legislation confirmed the interpretation flowing from the plain meaning of its text. The majority rejected an alternate interpretation which, even if it might have enhanced the coherence of the scheme, would have impermissibly been at odds with the plain meaning. Here, the context of s. 648(1) does not confirm the interpretation that might arise from an initial impression of the text.\nIn Bebawi, the judges undue reliance on the statement from Orphan Well quoted above led him to give insufficient consideration to the context of s. 648(1), which is a necessary part of the analysis to determine its true meaning. That statement does not necessitate prioritizing the plain meaning of the text to the detriment of the cohesiveness of a statutory scheme. Cohesiveness is a relevant factor, provided that the interpretation to which it leads is one that the words can reasonably bear. Simply put, the interpretive exercise is incomplete if it omits a full consideration of one or more of the indicators of legislative meaning, whether it be the text, context, purpose, or relevant legal norms (Alex, at para. 31). In this consideration, [translation] coherence and logic in a statute . . . provide one argument among others, whose weight varies with the circumstances, and, in particular, with the nature of the statute being interpreted (P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at para. 1120). While the judge in Bebawi acknowledged the role of context and purpose (at paras. 44-45), with respect, his interpretation unduly privileged the plain meaning of the text. Therefore, the reasoning and interpretation in Bebawi should not be followed.\nHere, to understand the operation of s. 648(1), one must interpret it in light of the numerous relevant provisions that followed its enactment, and most particularly s. 645(5). In this context, trial judges now have the flexibility to hear, before the empanelment of the jury, various matters that are deemed to be part of the trial. These are clearly dealt with in the absence of the jury and, as such, are automatically covered by s. 648(1).\nIn situating s. 648(1) in this context, however, I am not suggesting that there is perfect coherence among the various amendments grafted onto the Criminal Code over time. Despite its form as codal legislation, the Criminal Code is not a Code in the civil law sense and is less precise than many others (A. W. Mewett, The Criminal Law, 1867-1967 (1967), 45 Can. Bar Rev. 726, at pp. 730-31). There has been no systematic revision, and amendments have been described as haphazard and inconsistent and as amounting to isolated tinkering (A. W. Mewett, Criminal Law Revision in Canada (1969), 7 Alta L. Rev. 272, at pp. 277-78). This Court has been careful not to insist on a uniform interpretation of words across the Criminal Code (see, e.g., R. v. Hibbert, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 973, at p. 997).\nPurpose\nBy enacting s. 648(1) in 1972, Parliament intended to enhance trial fairness through the protection of two interconnected interests. First, there is the fundamental interest of the accused in being tried by jurors who are not exposed to, and biased by, the rulings rendered on matters dealt with in their absence. I find this to be immediately apparent from the wording of the provision  which bans the publication of information regarding portions of the trial at which the jury is not present  and readily inferable from Hansard. Second, trial fairness under s. 648(1) is also concerned with the interest of both the accused and society in the efficiency of our system of trial by jury. This is revealed by Parliaments choice to introduce an automatic publication ban that applies simply by operation of statute and thus does not require the intervention of a court.\nThese two interests are best served when the trial proceeds only on information properly available to the jury. I elaborate on each in turn below.\nRight to an Impartial Jury\nAll parties agree that s. 648(1) was designed to protect the accuseds right to an impartial jury, which in 1972 was part of the common law and which was later constitutionalized under s. 11(f) of the Charter (see N. R. Hasan, Three Theories of Principles of Fundamental Justice (2013), 63 S.C.L.R. (2d) 339, at p. 354). Section 648(1) protects this interest by providing a safeguard against the very risk of jury contamination that came with the introduction of s. 647 of the Criminal Code. Under the latter provision, as mentioned above, judges were allowed for the first time to permit jurors to separate in capital offence trials, which often attracted considerable media attention.\nThe parties disagree, however, on whether Parliament intended s. 648(1) to act as a safeguard against the contamination of the jury generally or whether it was concerned strictly with the empanelled jury. \nThe appellants submit that the former view improperly assumes that Parliament would not have viewed the factors that distinguish the pre- and post-jury empanelment stages as warranting different treatment. Rather, the appellants say, Parliament must have intended s. 648(1) to apply only during the critical period after the jury is empanelled because of (1) the plethora of mechanisms available before and during selection  challenges for cause, the judges instructions to the jury, the swearing-in of the jury, etc.  to guarantee the impartiality of the jurors; (2) the lower potential for prejudice before the jury is selected, given that many matters dealt with at that stage do not involve information prejudicial to the accused; and (3) the sometimes long period between the laying of charges and the empanelment of the jury. According to the appellants, these factors would have led Parliament to adopt a blanket prohibition applicable only at the post-empanelment stage, thereby leaving pre-empanelment publication bans to be discretionary.\nI disagree with the appellants. While I recognize that the periods before and after the jury is empanelled are distinguishable by the above-cited features, I see no indication that Parliament turned its mind to such features when it enacted s. 648(1). In reality, Parliament would have had no reason to do so because, as I have said, jurors in 1972 were at risk of being exposed to information about matters dealt with in their absence only when they separated. \nI note that s. 648(1)s purpose was formulated broadly in the parliamentary debates, with concerns being expressed about the publicity of matters dealt with in the absence of the jury. When the publication ban was introduced in 1972, it was noted in the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs that the provision would ensure that those matters remain a secret for better functioning of jurors (Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, No. 7, 4th Sess., 28th Parl., May 11, 1972, at p. 7:26). And in the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, it was explained that s. 648(1) would prohibit publication of those things that go on when the jury is out of the courtroom (Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, No. 8, 4th Sess., June 1, 1972, at p. 8:18). The implication was that, without such a provision, the members of the jury could go home at night, and would know exactly what went on in the courtroom (ibid.). There was no other discussion of the publication ban.\nOn careful consideration of the provisions wording and the above excerpts from Hansard, I am led to the conclusion that one of Parliaments objectives was to shield the jury from information about any portion of the trial from which it was absent, so that its verdict is based only on the evidence found admissible in court (see similar expressions of purpose in R. v. Brown (1997), 72 C.R.R. (2d) 312 (Ont. C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at pp. 319-21; Regan; R. v. Bernardo, [1995] O.J. No. 247 (QL), 1995 CarswellOnt 7200 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), at para. 43 (QL); Stobbe, at para. 13; Millard, at para. 25; Wright, at para. 25). \nThis objective is relevant with respect to both the existent jury and the prospective jury, that is, the jury yet to be empanelled. This does not mean that the purpose of s. 648(1) has shifted in response to changing practices in criminal proceedings. Justice Dickson (as he then was) rejected the theory of a shifting purpose: Purpose is a function of the intent of those who drafted and enacted the legislation at the time, and not of any shifting variable (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 335). It is simply that, as a result of the introduction of s. 645(5), the matters that should remain a secret for the jury are now dealt with both before and after its empanelment.\nInterest in an Efficient System of Trial by Jury\nParliament in 1972 intended to protect another interest falling within the right to a fair trial, namely, the interest of both the accused and society in the efficiency of our system of trial by jury. Parliament made information which would otherwise have been covered by discretionary publication bans subject to an automatic publication ban and, in so doing, demonstrated a clear concern for speedy trials and the proper expenditure of judicial resources.\nHistorically, the media were expected not to prejudice judicial proceedings, such that the publication of improper information before a case is heard or the dissemination of improper information about a case which is to be heard or is not fully heard was punishable as contempt of court (see Steiner v. Toronto Star Ltd., [1956] O.R. 14 (H.C.J.), at p. 20, quoting with approval R. v. Evening Standard Co. Ld., [1954] 1 Q.B. 578, at p. 584; see also St. Jamess Evening Post Case (1742), 2 Atk. 469, 26 E.R. 683). In other words, publication could be punished, at the remedy stage, even in the absence of an express publication ban. Eventually, it became the practice for courts to issue publication bans as an exercise of their inherent jurisdiction (see, e.g., R. v. Jansen, [1976] 4 W.W.R. 277 (B.C.S.C.); Scott v. Scott, [1913] A.C. 417 (H.L.); R. v. Clement (1821), 4 B. & Ald. 218, 106 E.R. 918).\nUnder s. 648(1), information about a specific subset of matters which would otherwise have been prohibited from publication by way of discretionary bans was made subject to an automatic publication ban. The latter requires no action to be taken by the parties and the judge; it applies automatically when the stipulated conditions are met. Clearly, Parliament must have had delays and judicial resources in mind when it removed judicial discretion relating to the publication of information about matters dealt with in the absence of the jury.\nAn absurd interpretation of s. 648(1) that would defeat this objective of efficiency must be avoided. Authors Cote and Sullivan note, respectively, that the label of absurdity can be attached to interpretations that are incompatible with the object of the legislative enactment or that defeat the purpose of the statute in question (P.A. Cote, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), at pp. 378-80, and R. Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 88, both cited in Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 27).\nWhile no evidence has been provided to that effect, one can reasonably expect that an interpretation confining the application of s. 648(1) to the post-empanelment stage would lead to a multiplication of applications for discretionary Dagenais/Mentuck/Sherman bans. This, in turn, would most likely result in further delays in the criminal justice system and the diversion of scarce resources of the accused and the court. Such a result would be antithetical to the objective of efficiency pursued by Parliament in enacting s. 648(1) and completely at odds with the teachings of this Court in R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. \nConversely, an interpretation of s. 648(1) as applying before the jury is empanelled can be expected to further the efficiency interest. Plainly, by shielding information arising at many types of hearings from publication, s. 648(1) gives courts the confidence to hold such hearings prior to the empanelment of the jury. This flexibility and ability to hold such hearings earlier in time can be expected to reduce delays. It may also allow the parties to gain certainty about contested matters, such as the admissibility of evidence, in advance of when rulings on those matters would historically have been made, leading to earlier resolution by way of pleas or withdrawal of charges.\nConclusion\nAll of the above leads me to conclude that s. 648(1) was designed to safeguard the right to a fair trial by averting jury bias and by ensuring the efficiency of our system of trial by jury. This is consistent with this Courts existing conception of trial fairness as being concerned not only with averting jury bias by banning pre-trial publicity but also with protecting the accuseds other fundamental interests. In Toronto Star, at para. 23, Justice Deschamps characterized Parliaments primary objectives in enacting the publication ban in s. 517 of the Criminal Code as being (1) to safeguard the right to a fair trial; and (2) to ensure expeditious bail hearings. The former, she wrote, embraces the latter (para. 24). A similar view was adopted in Jordan, where fair trial interests were said to be affected by delays in the criminal justice system. This is so because the longer a trial is delayed, the more likely it is that some accused will be prejudiced in mounting a defence, owing to faded memories, unavailability of witnesses, or lost or degraded evidence (para. 20). More recently, in R. v. Haevischer, 2023 SCC 11, at para. 46, this Court built on the Jordan vocabulary and presented trial fairness and trial efficiency as interdependent values.\nMeaning of Section 648(1)\nAll indicators of legislative meaning  text, context, and purpose  admit of only one interpretation of s. 648(1): that it applies not only after the jury is empanelled but also before the jury is empanelled with respect to matters dealt with pursuant to s. 645(5). Said another way, if a judge would traditionally have had jurisdiction to hear a matter before the jury was empanelled without having to rely on s. 645(5), then that matter is not within the scope of s. 648(1). As I have found no ambiguity after conducting the full interpretive exercise, there is no need, contrary to what some of the parties argued, to resort to external aids such as the principle of strict construction of penal laws or the presumption of conformity with the Charter (Bell ExpressVu, at para. 55).\nIn 1972, information heard at trials in the absence of the jury was prohibited from publication. The law prohibiting the publication of such information has not changed now that those hearings also happen before the jury is empanelled. Without clear language, a statute should not be interpreted as substantially changing the law (R. v. D.L.W., 2016 SCC 22, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 402, at para. 21). Section 648 has not been substantially amended, and s. 645(5) does not contain any language signifying an intent to remove hearings held pursuant to s. 645(5) from the scope of the publication ban. \nIn closing, I will say a word on the use of subsequent legislative history, that is, the record of the process, materials, and debate that followed s. 648(1)s enactment, in the interpretation of this provision.\nThe appellants in both appeals make much of the withdrawal of a clause that would have amended s. 648(1) to make it expressly applicable in respect of any matter dealt with by a judge before any juror is sworn. In 1994, the Minister of Justice explained to the House of Commons that the governments initial intention was to fill a gap with respect to evidence-related pre-empanelment motions whose publication might contaminate members of a prospective jury (House of Commons Debates, vol. 133, No. 143, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., December 13, 1994, at p. 9010 (emphasis added)). He added that the language of clause 62 might be overbroad and that it was accordingly to be removed from Bill C-42 (ibid.).\nIn the submission of La Presse and CBC, the fact that Parliament considered but ultimately refrained from expressly broadening s. 648(1)s scope indicates that this provision has always  from 1972 until today  been meant to apply only after the jury is empanelled. Put differently, they ask this Court to infer that because Parliament in 1994 might have found it necessary to amend s. 648(1), this tells us something about what Parliaments in 1972 or 1985 intended with respect to this provision and its interaction with s. 645(5). \nI would decline to place any weight on the 1994 amending clause and its withdrawal. My view is that proposed but abandoned amendments are of no assistance in identifying the meaning of the legislation that would otherwise have been amended. In this regard, I adopt the reasoning of Justices Cory and Iacobucci in M. v. H., [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 105:\nWith respect, I cannot agree that a failed amendment can provide evidence as to the objective of the legislation that was to have been amended. Section 17 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11, provides: The repeal or amendment of an Act shall be deemed not to be or to involve any declaration as to the previous state of the law. If the amendment of an Act may not be used to interpret the meaning of the Act prior to the amendment, then I do not see how a failed amendment may be used in this manner. [Emphasis in original.]\nThis reasoning applies equally to federal legislation given s. 45(3) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 (stating that the repeal or amendment of an enactment in whole or in part shall not be deemed to be or to involve any declaration as to the previous state of the law) and in light of logical limits of relevance.\nDetermining Whether s. 645(5) Captures a Pre-Empanelment Proceeding\nSection 648(2) makes it a summary conviction offence to violate the s. 648(1) publication ban  a ban that applies automatically, by operation of statute, with no need for a court order.\nI recognize that interpreting s. 648(1) as applying before the jury is empanelled, but only to some matters, could give rise to uncertainty over what matters are covered by the publication ban (see Millard, at para. 65; I.F., British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, at para. 37). And I am mindful that courts should avoid creating uncertainty, especially in criminal law, because [i]t is a fundamental requirement of the rule of law that a person should be able to predict whether a particular act constitutes a crime at the time he commits the act (R. v. Breault, 2023 SCC 9, at para. 27, quoting R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para. 14). While these concerns did not drive the above interpretive exercise, I wish to provide some guidance to mitigate any uncertainty.\nSection 648(2) creates a true crime and thus is subject to the presumption that a person should not be held liable unless the person acted intentionally or recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the offence (R. v. A.D.H., 2013 SCC 28, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 269, at para. 23; R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at pp. 1303 and 1309-10). For the practical effectiveness and clarity of the publication ban itself, and to avoid potential barriers to prosecution for violating the ban, it would therefore be prudent for judges holding a hearing pursuant to s. 645(5) to announce that they are exercising their jurisdiction under that section and to note that s. 648(1) automatically prohibits the publication of any information regarding that portion of the trial.\nI anticipate that the above approach will provide sufficient certainty. It would not be a worthwhile effort to attempt to provide a comprehensive list of matters that would be captured or excluded by s. 648(1). I note, just as a descriptive observation, that most kinds of hearings taking place before a jury is empanelled will be covered by this prohibition. For example, there is no dispute that evidentiary voir dires would be covered (Duhamel, at p. 560; R. v. Lalo, 2002 NSSC 21, 207 N.S.R. (2d) 203, at para. 19; R. v. Ross, [1995] O.J. No. 3180 (QL), 1995 CarswellOnt 3173 (WL) (C.J. (Gen. Div)), at para. 3, per Salhany J.; R. E. Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure (5th ed. 1989), at pp. 189-90): these are matters for which a judge clearly relies on s. 645(5) jurisdiction in order to hold the hearing before the jury is empanelled. There are, however, other kinds of hearings that have never been required to take place at trial; these would not be covered by the prohibition found in s. 648(1). This determination can be made through the analysis outlined in Litchfield.\nThis Courts analysis in Litchfield provides a useful framework for assessing whether a matter is being dealt with by virtue of s. 645(5) or whether it could always have been dealt with, even in the absence of s. 645(5), before the jury was empanelled. In Litchfield, the question was whether a motion for division or severance of counts had to be made at trial or if it could be dealt with before the trial by a judge other than the trial judge. This Court looked to the following features in holding that division and severance motions must be dealt with at trial and can therefore be dealt with only by virtue of s. 645(5) if the jury has not yet been empanelled:\nDoes the motion concer[n] the indictment? Must the indictment have been preferred or, in the language of R. v. Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, does the indictment need to be the operative document? See Litchfield, at pp. 350-52.\nMust the person hearing the matter be the trial judge seized with the trial? This includes a consideration of practical or policy reasons to have the matter dealt with by the trial judge (see Litchfield, at pp. 352-53). Today, this question would be asked in the context of the new jurisdiction of case management judges under s. 551.3: But for the jurisdiction of case management judges, would the matter have to be dealt with by the trial judge?\nIn Litchfield, these features together led to the conclusion that a motion for division or severance of counts had to be dealt with by the trial judge. For one thing, the majority concluded that no one except the trial judge ever has jurisdiction to divide or sever counts since an indictment is only preferred at the opening of an accuseds trial (p. 352). Further, the practical or policy rationale was that if it were open to a judge other than the trial judge to rule on these motions, the resulting order would be immunized from review due to the rule against collateral attack: . . . a court order, made by a court having jurisdiction to make it, may not be attacked in proceedings other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation, or nullification of the order or judgment (p. 348, quoting Wilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, at p. 599).\nJustice Iacobucci, writing for the majority, continued:\n. . . it makes sense that the trial judge consider applications to divide and sever counts since an order for division or severance of counts will dictate the course of the trial itself. . . . Not only are trial judges better situated to assess the impact of the requested severance on the conduct of the trial, but limiting severance orders to trial judges avoids the duplication of efforts to become familiar enough with the case to determine whether or not a severance order is in the interests of justice. It seems desirable, therefore, that in the future only trial judges can make orders for division or severance of counts in order to avoid injustices such as occurred in this case. [Emphasis added; p. 353.]\nConcerns about appealability also played a role in Garofoli. There, the majority held that it is the trial judge, rather than the issuing court, that must review a wiretap authorization when the accused asserts an infringement of s. 8 of the Charter and asks that the resulting evidence be suppressed under s. 24 (pp. 1448-49). The majority first noted that [a]n objection to the reception of evidence is very much a necessary incident of the trial process (p. 1449), and also found that placing this review in the hands of the trial judge would remove any doubts as to the right to appeal a decision rejecting or admitting the evidence (p. 1450). Sopinka J. was skeptical that such a decision would be reviewable on appeal under the former approach, where evidence would be admitted or rejected by the trial judge based on the order of a Wilson judge (p. 1450).\nThis reasoning from Litchfield and Garofoli highlights the sorts of considerations that have drawn courts to conclude that certain matters must be dealt with by the trial judge (again, but for the new jurisdiction of case management judges).\nTo address submissions from the Crown respondents on the pre-empanelment scope of s. 648(1), I wish to make two further observations in relation to case management judges and pre-trial conferences.\nThe Quebec Crown submitted that the list of matters in s. 551.3(1)(g) could help clarify the pre-empanelment scope of s. 648(1). Sections 551.1 to 551.7 were introduced as Part XVIII.1 of the Criminal Code by the Fair and Efficient Criminal Trials Act, s. 4. These provisions, as amended, allow a case management judge to exercis[e] the powers that a trial judge has before the stage of the presentation of the evidence on the merits (s. 551.3(1)). Section 551.3(1)(g) does not expand the powers of a case management judge beyond those of a trial judge. Section 551.3(1)(g) allows the case management judge to adjudicat[e] any issues that can be decided before that stage. Thus, even under s. 551.3(1)(g), some of what a case management judge does is traceable to the jurisdiction that a trial judge only has under s. 645(5) to hear a matter that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the absence of the jury after it has been sworn (see M. Vauclair and T. Desjardins, in collaboration with P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2022 (29th ed. 2022), at p. 587, fn. 117). When a case management judge exercises jurisdiction traceable to s. 645(5), s. 648(1) automatically applies.\nThe B.C. Crown submitted that s. 648(1) covers even the pre-trial conference required for jury trials by s. 625.1(2). Section 625.1 was introduced alongside s. 645(5) in 1985 and came into force in 1988. Section 625.1(2) mandates a conference, not a hearing of matters. These conferences are held under rules enacted by courts of criminal jurisdiction and provincial and territorial courts under ss. 482 and 482.1 of the Criminal Code. They are generally for considering matters that would promote a fair and expeditious trial, including the scheduling of hearings, and that can be resolved before the jury is empanelled (see, e.g., Criminal Rules of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, SI/97-140, r. 5; Rules of Practice of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, Criminal Division, 2002, SI/2002-46, rr. 39 to 44). Discussion at the pre-trial conference will include information such as the nature and particulars of proposed motions (B.C. Rules, r. 5(13)), and statements relating to the respective positions of the parties (Que. Rules, r. 44(b)).\nI reiterate that s. 648(1) applies before the jury is empanelled only when a judge is exercising jurisdiction traceable to s. 645(5) to deal with a matter that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the absence of the jury after it has been sworn. Generally, a pre-trial conference is not that. The Alberta Court of Justice, however, has enacted a rule allowing the pre-trial conference judge to make any ruling a case management judge acting under section 551.3 of the Code may make, except a ruling under sections 551.3(1)(e) or 551.3(1)(g) of the Code (Criminal Rules of the Alberta Court of Justice, r. 4.2(7)(a)). Without deciding whether rules enacted under ss. 482 and 482.1 can expand the jurisdiction of a pre-trial conference judge, I emphasize that s. 648(1) would apply to information from a pre-trial conference only when the pre-trial conference judge exercises jurisdiction ultimately rooted in s. 645(5). The Alberta Court of Justice seems to have excluded several such matters from adjudication at a pre-trial conference.\nPublication of information that comes out at pre-trial conferences may very well be prejudicial to the fair trial interests of the accused. The fact that there will be potentially prejudicial proceedings not covered by the automatic publication ban found in s. 648(1) was recognized as far back as 1979. In R. v. Deol (1979), 20 A.R. 595 (Q.B.), at para. 31, the judge noted that s. 648(1) (then s. 576.1) left a lamentable gap in relation to possibly prejudicial proceedings between the end of the preliminary hearing and the moment when the jury is first permitted to separate. But s. 648(1), as interpreted above, does not reach so far as to apply automatically to all aspects of a pre-trial conference. This would be an interpretation that the text cannot reasonably bear. It is of course open to courts to fill any gap in relation to pre-trial conferences through their rule-making authority under ss. 482 and 482.1 for example, the Superior Court of Quebec has made it a rule that [p]roceedings at the pre-hearing conference are subject to a publication ban (Que. Rules, r. 40) and judges retain inherent jurisdiction to impose discretionary publication bans in accordance with the Dagenais/Mentuck/Sherman principles.\nDispositions\nSince I have interpreted s. 648(1) as applying before the jury is empanelled to matters dealt with pursuant to s. 645(5), I would dismiss both appeals.\nIn Mr. Silvas case, David J. understood s. 648(1) as applying to matters dealt with before the jury is empanelled. He did not specify, however, whether it would cover information about all matters or only those dealt with pursuant to s. 645(5). Regardless, the order dismissing the application to lift the publication bans should be upheld. One of the matters dealt with by David J. concerned the admissibility of evidence (a Garofoli application). The other was a motion for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process. This clearly concerned the indictment and had to be dealt with by the trial judge (or case management judge exercising the powers of a trial judge) so that it would be reviewable on appeal from the conviction. Therefore, it is only by virtue of s. 645(5) that these matters could be dealt with prior to the empanelment of the jury, and it follows that they were covered by s. 648(1). I would dismiss the appeal in this case. \nThe reasoning in Mr. Cobans case was that s. 648(1) applies to all pre-trial applications (para. 2). This is not consistent with the proper interpretation of s. 648(1). However, the order was simply as follows: . . . the Application to clarify or declare that the publication ban herein pursuant to section 648 of the Criminal Code of Canada applies only to proceedings after the jury is empanelled, is dismissed (A.R., CBC et al., at pp. 7-8). The media had applied for a declaration that s. 648(1) applies only after the jury has been empanelled. The judge dismissed that application. That was the extent of the order. While the judge did not adopt the interpretation I have presented, the dismissal is consistent with the proper interpretation of s. 648(1). I would therefore dismiss the appeal in this case as well.\nI would award no costs as none were sought.\n\tAppeals dismissed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant La Presse inc.: Prevost Fortin DAoust, Boisbriand, Que.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Global News, a division of Corus Television Limited Partnership, Postmedia Network Inc., CTV News, a division of Bell Media Inc., Glacier Media Inc., CityNews, a division of Rogers Media Inc., Globe and Mail Inc. and Torstar Corporation: Owen Bird Law Corporation, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent His Majesty The King (40175): Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent His Majesty The King (40223): B.C.

In these cases, Garofoli applications, stay-of-proceedings applications, and constitutional challenges were made prior to jury empanelment. The lower courts determined that Section 648(1) applied before empanelment. The accused individuals had been respondents in their respective cases.\n\nThe trial proceedings involved two appeals: La Presse inc. v. Quebec and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation et al. v. the Crown, both dealing with Section 648(1) interpretation regarding automatic publication bans in criminal trials.\n\nIn both appeals, media outlets argued that Section 648(1) applies only after a jury is empanelled; however, application judges dismissed these claims based on their interpretation that it applies before and after empanelment.\n\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), Chief Justice Wagner held for a unanimous SCC panel that s 648 (1)'s automatic publication ban indeed extends beyond post-empanelment stages and also covers pre-empanelment matters dealt with under s 645 (5). This conclusion follows from an understanding of s 648's text when considered in its full context and light of Parliament's purpose as revealed through Hansard excerpts.\n\nThe critical legal principle established by this court decision is that an automatic publication ban can apply both before and after a significant event or stage in judicial proceedings to protect certain interests or rights.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice Wagner stated that his conclusion follows from an understanding of s 648's text when considered in its full context; this interpretation has not altered or expanded existing scope but rather clarified its full temporal application given modern practices particularly with regards to emergency motions before a jury is sworn in", "citation": "2023 SCC 22", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court confirms  publication bans on matters heard before the juries were empanelled in two criminal  cases.</strong> Section 648(1) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>is an automatic ban prohibiting the publication or  broadcast of information about portions of a criminal trial at which the jury  is not present. At issue in this case is whether and, if so, how this automatic  ban applies before the jury is empanelled (meaning constituted), given section 645(5)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Section 645(5)  confers jurisdiction upon trial judges, since 1985, to deal with any matter  that would ordinarily or necessarily be dealt with in the jury\u2019s absence before  it has been empanelled. The Supreme Court of Canada heard together two appeals  on this issue.In both cases, numerous matters were dealt with before  the empanelment of the jury, including requests to exclude some evidence from the  trial and stop the proceedings for abuse of process, as well as a  constitutional challenge. In the first case, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Silva was tried in the  Superior Court of Quebec on four counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.  In an unrelated case, Aydin Coban was charged in British Columbia with several  offences relating to child pornography, extortion, child luring and harassment. Certain  media outlets applied for orders allowing the publication of information from  the hearings on those matters. The judges in both cases dismissed their applications,  concluding that s.\u00a0648(1) applies before the empanelment of the jury.  Information from those hearings could therefore not be published until the  juries retired for deliberations or were dismissed.The media outlets then asked to appeal directly to the  Supreme Court of Canada, relying on a case called <em><a href=\"https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/1204/1/document.do\">Dagenais</a></em>.  In that case, the Supreme Court said a third party, like the media outlets, could  appeal a publication ban in a criminal proceeding directly to the Court under  section 40 of the <em>Supreme Court Act</em>. The Court granted the media outlets leave to appeal;  however, it ultimately dismissed their appeals. <strong>Section 648(1)  of the <em>Criminal Code </em>applies before  the jury is empanelled only to matters dealt with under section 645(5). </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner ruled  that the automatic publication ban in section 648(1) applies not only after the  jury is empanelled, but also before it is empanelled with respect to matters dealt  with under section 645(5). As the Chief Justice explained, \u201cthis conclusion  follows from an understanding of the text of s. 648(1) when considered in its  full context and in light of Parliament\u2019s purpose. This interpretation does not  expand the coverage of the publication ban: only matters that were captured by  the ban prior to the enactment of s. 645(5) continue to be captured by it  today.\u201d In Mr. Silva\u2019s case, the requests to stop the  proceedings and exclude certain evidence from trial had to be heard by the  trial judge. They could be heard before the jury was empanelled only by virtue  of the trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction under section 645(5). It follows that they  were covered by the automatic publication ban. Likewise in Mr. Coban\u2019s case,  the media had applied for a declaration that section 648(1) applies only after  the jury has been empanelled. Chief Justice Wagner concluded that the trial  judge\u2019s dismissal of that request was consistent with the proper interpretation  of section 648(1). <strong>Court openness and trial fairness</strong>Chief Justice Wagner noted  that both the open court principle and trial fairness serve to instill public  confidence in the justice system. The public can understand the work of the  courts, and thus come to trust the judicial process and its outcomes, only if  informed of what a judge decides and why the particular decision is made. The  media play a crucial role in making this possible. The protection of fair trial  interests, such as the right to an independent, impartial and representative  jury, is also essential to public confidence in the administration of justice.  Publication bans like the one imposed by s. 648(1) are limitations on court  openness that protect the right of the accused to, and society\u2019s interest in, a  fair trial.\r\n  "}, "13": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nEarl Mason\tAppellant\nv.\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration\tRespondent\n- and -\nSeifeslam Dleiow\tAppellant\nv.\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Ontario,\nAttorney General of Saskatchewan,\nCanadian Council for Refugees,\nCanadian Association of Refugee Lawyers,\nSocial Planning Council of Winnipeg,\nCanadian Muslim Lawyers Association,\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,\nAmnesty International Canadian Section (English Speaking),\nCommunity & Legal Aid Services Program,\nAssociation quebecoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration and\nCriminal Lawyers Association (Ontario)\tInterveners\nIndexed as: Mason v.

In 2012, M was charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of discharging a firearm following an argument with a man in a bar during which M fired a gun. The charges were eventually stayed because of delay. In unrelated incidents, D was alleged to have engaged in acts of violence against intimate partners and other persons. Some of the criminal charges flowing from these incidents were stayed and he pled guilty to three charges and received a conditional discharge. \n\tFollowing these incidents, inadmissibility reports were prepared alleging that both M and D were inadmissible to Canada on security grounds under s. 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which provides that a permanent resident or foreign national is inadmissible for engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. The reports were referred to the Immigration Division (ID) for admissibility hearings. It was not alleged that either M or D engaged in acts of violence with a link to national security or the security of Canada. In Ms case, the ID ruled that a security ground under s. 34(1) means a threat to the security of Canada or another country, and that the act of violence in question must have some connection to a threat to the security of Canada. As Ms alleged conduct lacked any element that would elevate it to security grounds, s. 34(1)(e) could not apply. The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD), however, allowed the Ministers appeal and concluded that inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) related to security in a broader sense, namely, to ensure that individual Canadians are secure from acts of violence that would or might endanger their lives or safety. In Ds case, the ID followed the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) in Ms case, concluded that D was inadmissible, and issued a deportation order.\n\tThe Federal Court allowed M and Ds applications for judicial review, ruling that it was unreasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) as applying to acts of violence without a nexus to national security. In both cases, the Federal Court certified, under s. 74(d) of the IRPA, the following serious question of general importance for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal: Is it reasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in a manner that does not require proof of conduct that has a nexus with national security or the security of Canada? The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Ministers appeals, holding that the IAD in Ms case and ID in Ds case had reasonably interpreted s. 34(1)(e) as not requiring a nexus to national security or the security of Canada.\n\tHeld: The appeals should be allowed. In Ms appeal, the IAD decision should be quashed. In Ds appeal, the ID decision and deportation order should be quashed. \n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: Applying the Vavilov framework to the instant appeals, the appropriate standard of review of the administrative decisions is reasonableness. No established exception to the presumption of reasonableness review applies, nor should any new exception be created on the basis that the appeals involved a serious question of general importance certified for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. In the instant cases, both administrative decisions were unreasonable. The relevant legal constraints point overwhelmingly to a single reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1)(e)  a person can be found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) only if they engage in acts of violence with a nexus to national security or the security of Canada.\n\tIn Vavilov, the Court established a presumption that when a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision, the standard of review is reasonableness. This presumption is rebutted in two types of situations  where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard or set of standards to apply or where the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied  which together provide six categories of correctness review. The first situation provides for two categories of correctness review: when the legislature explicitly prescribes the standard of review, and when it provides for an appeal from an administrative decision to a court. With respect to the second situation, Vavilov sets out three categories of questions that the rule of law requires to be reviewed on a standard of correctness: constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies. A sixth category of correctness review was recognized by the Court in Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30: when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction over a legal issue in a statute. \n\tNone of the established exceptions to the presumption of reasonableness review applies in the instant cases: the legislature has not explicitly prescribed the standard of review or provided a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision to a court, and the standard of correctness is not required based on the rule of law. The proper interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA is not a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. Although it is important for the affected persons and the proper administration of the IRPA, it does not affect the legal system or the administration of justice as a whole, have legal implications for many other statutes, or affect other institutions of government; rather, the issues raised are particular to the interpretation of the conditions for inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e). Moreover, the proper interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) is not a constitutional question or a question related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies, nor does it engage the correctness category recognized in Society of Composers.\n\tThe certified question regime under s. 74(d) of the IRPA does not displace the presumption of reasonableness review and warrant a new category of correctness. The Federal Courts certification of a question for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal provides for a statutory appeal of the Federal Courts decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, but it does not change the standard of review to be applied by either court. First, the Federal Courts decision to certify a serious question of general importance under s. 74(d) does not affect the standard of review to be applied by the Federal Court itself on an application for judicial review. The certified question procedure plays a gatekeeping role by requiring that the matter meet a threshold of importance to merit an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. The certified question may be the trigger by which an appeal is permitted, but the subject of the appeal is still the judgment itself, not merely the certified question. Thus, the certified question regime does not amount to rare and exceptional circumstances in which the Federal Court applying reasonableness review would undermine legislative intent or the rule of law in a manner analogous to the existing correctness categories. \n\tSecond, the certification of a serious question of general importance does not require correctness review by the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. As a matter of precedent, the Court has concluded in the immigration context that despite the presence of a certified question, the standard of review is reasonableness. Vavilov does not require that conclusion to be revisited. Certification of a question does not signal that the legislature intended that appellate courts apply correctness review. The Federal Court of Appeals task in an appeal from a decision of the Federal Court in an application for judicial review is to determine whether the Federal Court identified the appropriate standard of review and then to decide whether it applied that standard properly. The certified question regime neither rebuts the presumption of reasonableness, nor alters the Court of Appeals task when it hears appeals from first instance judicial review decisions. Moreover, recognizing a new correctness category in the instant cases would conflict with Vavilovs goal of simplifying and making more predictable the standard of review framework by providing only limited exceptions to reasonableness review.\n\tVavilov provided extensive guidance on conducting reasonableness review of administrative decisions. Although the Federal Court in Ms case did not have the benefit of Vavilov, the Federal Court of Appeal did, and it strayed from Vavilovs methodology of reasonableness review. It grafted onto Vavilov an extra step of conducting a preliminary analysis of the text, context, and purpose of the legislation to understand the lay of the land before examining the administrative decisions. This preliminary step is inconsistent with Vavilov. Vavilov is clear that a reviewing court must start its analysis with the reasons of the administrative decision maker. Starting with its own perception of the merits may lead a court to slip into correctness review.\n\tThe administrative decisions under review did not reasonably interpret s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA by not requiring a nexus with national security or the security of Canada. Vavilov instructed that a reviewing court should conduct reasonableness review mindful of the impact of the decision on the affected individual. According to the principle of responsive justification, where the impact of a decision on an individuals rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes. In the instant cases, the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) will affect whether two individuals could be deported from Canada. The IADs reasons had to reflect these stakes. However, the IADs reasons in Ms case failed to address critical points of statutory context and the broad consequences of its interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) that were raised by M. These omissions were significant, involved a failure of responsive justification and, cumulatively, rendered the IADs decision unreasonable. The IAD also failed to interpret and apply s. 34(1)(e) in compliance with Canadas obligation of non-refoulement under Article 33(1) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, contrary to the express direction in s. 3(3)(f) of the IRPA that it must do so. The IDs decision in Ds case, which simply followed the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in Ms case, was unreasonable for the same reasons.\n\tCumulatively, the relevant legal constraints point overwhelmingly to only one reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1)(e)  the provision requires a nexus to national security or the security of Canada. Section 34(1)(e) can be invoked to render a person inadmissible only when their acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada have a nexus with national security or the security of Canada. Because the Minister has not alleged that M or D engaged in acts of violence with a link to national security or the security of Canada, s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA does not provide a legal basis for the inadmissibility of either person. \n\tPer Cote J.: There is agreement with the majoritys disposition of the appeals, its finding that the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) was unreasonable and its determination that inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence and with national security or the security of Canada. However, the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) should be reviewed on a standard of correctness.\n\tSection 74(d) of the IRPA provides for an exceptional appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal for legal questions certified as serious questions of general importance. This indicates legislative intent for judicial involvement and a desire to subject these particular questions, as distinct from all others arising under the IRPA more broadly, to appellate standards of review. Questions certified under s. 74(d) will, by definition, have implications beyond the immediate parties and raise issues of broad significance within Canadas immigration and refugee protection scheme. \n\tIn Vavilov, the Court held that the categories of correctness review are not closed but that reviewing courts should only derogate from the presumption of reasonableness review where required by a clear indication of legislative intent (legislated standards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms) or the rule of law (constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions regarding jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies). The presumption of reasonableness review from Vavilov does not apply where the legislature expressly involves the court in the administrative scheme. To say that Vavilov is determinative and that the standard of review for certified questions is reasonableness would contradict the Vavilov framework itself. \n\tTo be consistent with the principles and framework set out in Vavilov, a new category of correctness review should be recognized: when appellate courts decide a serious question of general importance certified under s. 74(d) of the IRPA. For the certified question regime to be given its explicitly legislated scope, appellate courts must be able to answer them correctly. Reasonableness review of certified questions under the IRPA is inconsistent with both Parliaments intent and the rule of law. The rule of law requires  and Parliament intended for appellate courts to provide  a singular, determinate and final answer to a question certified as a serious question of general importance under the IRPA. Even a robust form of reasonableness review may be insufficient to guard against the risk, and the consequences, of arbitrariness. By definition, certified questions transcend the interests of the parties and raise issues of broad significance and general importance within Canadas immigration and refugee protection scheme. These are the exact types of questions for which the rule of law demands consistent and definitive answers  and for which the risk of arbitrariness is unacceptable. For serious questions of general importance arising under the IRPA, Parliament did not intend courts to be forced to defer to administrative decisions that may be reasonable, but are wrong in law. The only way s. 74(d) of the IRPA can be given its explicitly legislated scope is if appellate courts are permitted to substitute their own opinion in respect of these serious questions of general importance. The certified question regime would be incoherent if the standard of review were anything other than correctness. \n\tThe IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) was unreasonable and inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence and with national security or the security of Canada. The IADs interpretation would significantly expand the grounds on which foreign nationals or permanent residents may be deported from Canada. It would allow foreign nationals to be returned to countries where they may face persecution, in a manner contrary to Canadas obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Parliament did not intend for appellate courts to defer to reasonable but legally incorrect answers to this or other certified questions. It remains the task of administrative decision makers under the IRPA to apply this interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) going forward, including determining which acts of violence may indeed qualify as a threat to national security or the security of Canada.\nCases Cited\nBy Jamal J.\n\tApplied: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v.

Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, to two administrative decisions involving a question of statutory interpretation in the immigration context.\nThe statutory provision at issue, s. 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), provides that permanent residents and foreign nationals are inadmissible to Canada on security grounds for engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. The key point of disagreement among the administrative decision makers and courts below is whether the acts of violence listed as security grounds in s. 34(1)(e) require a link to national security or the security of Canada, or whether s. 34(1)(e) applies to acts of violence more broadly even without such a link.\nBoth administrative decisions under review interpreted s. 34(1)(e) as not requiring the acts of violence to have a link to national security or the security of Canada. In the first administrative decision, the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) ruled that Mr. Earl Mason, a foreign national, could be found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) if his alleged violent conduct were established. Mr. Mason allegedly shot a gun and wounded two people when he was assaulted during a fight at a bar. Charges against him were stayed and he was not convicted of any criminal offence. In the second administrative decision, the Immigration Division (ID) of the IRB followed the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) in Mr. Masons case and ruled that Mr. Seifeslam Dleiow, a foreign national, was inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) for acts of violence against two intimate partners. It was not alleged that either Mr. Mason or Mr. Dleiow engaged in acts of violence with a link to national security or the security of Canada.\nThe Federal Court allowed Mr. Mason and Mr. Dleiows applications for judicial review. In Mr. Masons case, in reasons released before this Court released Vavilov, the Federal Court ruled that it was unreasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) as applying to acts of violence without a nexus to national security. The Federal Court followed that approach in Mr. Dleiows case. Thus, neither Mr. Mason nor Mr. Dleiow was inadmissible. In both cases, the Federal Court also certified serious questions of general importance, so that the Federal Court of Appeal could consider whether it was reasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) as not requiring proof of conduct having a nexus to national security or the security of Canada.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal allowed both appeals. In reasons addressing both cases  released after this Court released Vavilov  the Court of Appeal ruled that the IAD and ID had reasonably interpreted s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA as not requiring a nexus to national security or the security of Canada.\nMr. Mason and Mr. Dleiow now appeal to this Court. Two issues arise. First, what standard of review should the reviewing courts have applied when reviewing the decisions of the IAD in Mr. Masons case and the ID in Mr. Dleiows case? Second, how should that standard of review have been applied in the circumstances?\nIn Vavilov, this Court revised the framework for determining the standard of review. The Court established a presumption that the standard of review of the merits of an administrative decision is reasonableness, subject to limited exceptions based on legislative intent or when required by the rule of law (paras. 10 and 17). The revised framework seeks to maintain the rule of law, while respecting a legislatures intent to entrust certain decisions to administrative decision makers rather than courts (paras. 2 and 14). It also aims to bring simplicity, coherence, and predictability to the law on the standard of review and to eliminate the unwieldy exercise of determining the standard of review based on contextual factors, as had been required by this Courts jurisprudence following Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 (Vavilov, at paras. 7 and 10).\nVavilov also explained how a court should conduct reasonableness review. This Court stressed that reasonableness review and correctness review are methodologically distinct (para. 12). Reasonableness review starts from a posture of judicial restraint and focusses on the decision the administrative decision maker actually made, including the justification offered for it, and not on the conclusion the court itself would have reached in the administrative decision makers place (paras. 15 and 24). When an administrative decision maker is required to provide reasons for its decision, reasonableness review requires a sensitive and respectful, but robust evaluation of the reasons provided (para. 12). A reviewing court must take a reasons first approach that evaluates the administrative decision makers justification for its decision (para. 84). An administrative decision will be reasonable if it is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and . . . is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker (para. 85). This Court also affirmed the need to develop and strengthen a culture of justification in administrative decision making (para. 2).\nApplying the Vavilov framework to these appeals, I conclude that the standard of review of the administrative decisions at issue is reasonableness. No established exception to the presumption of reasonableness review applies, nor should any new exception be created on the basis that the appeals involved a serious question of general importance certified for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal under s. 74(d) of the IRPA. The certified question regime is a statutory mechanism for the Federal Court to provide for an appeal from a judicial review decision in certain circumstances.\nBoth administrative decisions were unreasonable. In particular, the IAD in Mr. Masons case, whose interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) was followed in Mr. Dleiows case, failed to consider three significant legal constraints bearing on its decision. First, the IAD failed to address critical points of statutory context that Mr. Mason had raised in his submissions to the IAD. Second, the IAD failed to address the potentially broad consequences of its interpretation, which again Mr. Mason had raised in his submissions. These omissions involved significant failures of responsive justification that would cause a reviewing court to lose confidence in the IADs decision. Third, the IAD failed to interpret and apply s. 34(1)(e) in compliance with international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory  specifically, the obligation of non-refoulement under Article 33(1) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (Refugee Convention)  contrary to the express direction in s. 3(3)(f) of the IRPA that it must do so. The IADs failure to consider these three legal constraints rendered its decision unreasonable.\nIn these cases, the relevant legal constraints point overwhelmingly to a single reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1)(e)  a person can be found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) only if they engage in acts of violence with a nexus to national security or the security of Canada.\nAs a result, I would allow both appeals, set aside the judgments of the Federal Court of Appeal, allow the applications for judicial review, and quash the administrative decisions.\nFacts\nMr. Earl Mason\nMr. Earl Mason is a citizen of Saint Lucia and a foreign national in Canada  that is, he is neither a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident (IRPA, s. 2(1), foreign national). He is married to a Canadian citizen and has two daughters in Canada. He entered Canada in June 2010 and has remained here as a foreign national. He claimed refugee protection when he arrived in Canada, but he later withdrew this claim when he applied for permanent residence with his wifes sponsorship.\nThe following allegations were made against Mr. Mason in the inadmissibility proceedings under review. In May 2012, Mr. Mason had an argument with a man at a concert in a bar in Surrey, British Columbia. The man broke a beer bottle over Mr. Masons head, and Mr. Mason responded by drawing a gun from his waistband and firing it eight times, wounding his assailant and another man. In May 2014, Mr. Mason was charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of discharging a firearm with intent to wound or disfigure. The shooting was not linked to terrorism or organized crime. In 2015, the charges were stayed because of delay. As a result, Mr. Mason was not found guilty of any criminal offence.\nThe IRPA sets out several grounds on which a permanent resident or foreign national may be found inadmissible, and thus may be denied entry to or be required to leave Canada (ss. 34 to 42). In April 2016, a Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer prepared a report alleging that Mr. Mason was inadmissible on security grounds under s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA, which provides that a permanent resident or foreign national is inadmissible for engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. Section 34(1) states:\nSecurity\n\n34 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds for\n\n(a) engaging in an act of espionage that is against Canada or that is contrary to Canadas interests;\n\n(b) engaging in or instigating the subversion by force of any government;\n\n(b.1) engaging in an act of subversion against a democratic government, institution or process as they are understood in Canada;\n\n(c) engaging in terrorism;\n\n(d) being a danger to the security of Canada;\n\n(e) engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada; or\n\n(f) being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (b.1) or (c). \nIn May 2016, a delegate of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness referred the CBSAs inadmissibility report to the ID for an admissibility hearing.\nMr. Seifeslam Dleiow\nMr. Seifeslam Dleiow is a citizen of Libya and a foreign national in Canada. He entered Canada in June 2012 on a study permit, which expired in 2014. In 2015, he made a claim for refugee protection. In October 2017, the Refugee Protection Division of the IRB refused his claim, and in October 2018, the Refugee Appeal Division dismissed his appeal.\nIn September 2018, a CBSA officer prepared a report alleging that Mr. Dleiow was inadmissible on security grounds under s. 34(1)(e). The report alleged that since arriving in Canada, Mr. Dleiow had engaged in acts of violence against intimate partners and other persons. Criminal charges flowing from these incidents were stayed, except for 3 charges: being unlawfully in a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence, mischief under $5,000, and uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm. Mr. Dleiow pleaded guilty to these charges and received a conditional discharge. A delegate of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness then referred the CBSAs inadmissibility report to the ID for an admissibility hearing.\nDecisions Below\nImmigration Division Decision (Mr. Mason), 2018 CanLII 57522\nThe ID addressed a preliminary question of law as to whether Mr. Masons alleged conduct, if proven, could be a ground of inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e). The ID ruled that a security groun[d] under s. 34(1) means a threat to the security of Canada or another country, and that the act of violence in question must have some connection to a threat to the security of Canada. In the IDs view, Mr. Masons alleged conduct involved mere criminal offences, which although very serious, lacked any element that would elevate them to security grounds, and thus s. 34(1)(e) could not apply (para. 24).\nImmigration Appeal Division Decision (Mr. Mason), 2019 CanLII 55171\nThe Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness appealed the IDs decision in Mr. Masons case to the IAD, which allowed the Ministers appeal, set aside the IDs decision, and referred the matter back for a full hearing on the merits. The IAD concluded that inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) does not require a link to national security or the security of Canada. In the IADs view, security under s. 34(1)(e) relates to security in a broader sense, namely, to ensure that individual Canadians are secure from acts of violence that would or might endanger their lives or safety (para. 37).\nImmigration Division Decision (Mr. Dleiow), 2019 CanLII 129531\nIn Mr. Dleiows case, the ID saw no basis to depart from the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) in Mr. Masons case, and therefore affirmed that s. 34(1)(e) does not require a link to national security or the security of Canada. The ID also heard evidence and concluded that Mr. Dleiow was inadmissible because he had engaged in violent acts against two intimate partners, which there were reasonable grounds to believe had endangered their safety. The ID based this conclusion on a guilty plea for acts relating to one intimate partner, and on testimony and police occurrence reports relating to the other intimate partner. As a result, the ID ruled that Mr. Dleiow was inadmissible and issued a deportation order.\nFederal Court Decision (Mr. Mason), 2019 FC 1251, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 3 (Grammond J.)\nThe Federal Court granted Mr. Masons application for judicial review of the IADs decision. The court held that the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA was unreasonable because it disregarded the structure of the Act and rendered meaningless statutory provisions for inadmissibility based on criminality. In the Federal Courts view, s. 34(1)(e) requires a link to national security.\nThe Federal Court  whose reasons were released before this Court released Vavilov  outlined how a reviewing court should evaluate the reasonableness of an administrative decision makers interpretation of a statute. In the Federal Courts view, a reviewing court must ensure that an administrative decision maker did not overlook a very strong argument  a knock-out punch, that is, an interpretation that is internally consistent, withstands scrutiny, and is not met by a countervailing interpretation of similar force  or choose an interpretation when the interpretive clues point overwhelmingly in the other direction.\nThe Federal Court ruled that the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) was unreasonable because it conflicted with the broader structure of the IRPA, thus undermining Parliaments intent. In the courts view, this structural argument was a knock-out punch. The IADs decision upset the carefully crafted structure of the IRPA by including under s. 34(1)(e) a vast range of conduct that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. This would thwart Parliaments intent by bringing under the most serious category of inadmissibility conduct falling below the thresholds for less serious categories of inadmissibility, and it would discard Parliaments choice under s. 36 of the IRPA to require a conviction when criminal conduct was committed in Canada. Section 36(1) and (2) of the IRPA provide for inadmissibility based on serious criminality and criminality as follows:\nSerious criminality\n\n36 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality for\n\n(a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, or of an offence under an Act of Parliament for which a term of imprisonment of more than six months has been imposed;\n\n(b) having been convicted of an offence outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years; or\n\n(c) committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years.\n\nCriminality\n\n(2) A foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of criminality for\n\n(a) having been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by way of indictment, or of two offences under any Act of Parliament not arising out of a single occurrence;\n\n(b) having been convicted outside Canada of an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament, or of two offences not arising out of a single occurrence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute offences under an Act of Parliament;\n\n(c) committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament; or\n\n(d) committing, on entering Canada, an offence under an Act of Parliament prescribed by regulations.\nThe Federal Court found all the countervailing points of interpretive context unpersuasive and ruled that only one reasonable interpretation was available. It therefore quashed the IADs decision and restored the IDs decision.\nThe Federal Court certified the following serious question of general importance for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal: Is it reasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in a manner that does not require proof of conduct that has a nexus with national security or the security of Canada?\nFederal Court Decision (Mr. Dleiow), 2020 FC 59 (Barnes J.)\nThe Federal Court allowed Mr. Dleiows application for judicial review of the IDs decision. The court applied the Federal Courts reasoning in Mr. Masons case for reasons of comity, set aside the IDs decision and ordered the matter be reconsidered on the merits by a different decision maker. The court also certified the same serious question of general importance.\nFederal Court of Appeal (Mr. Mason and Mr. Dleiow), 2021 FCA 156, [2022] 1 F.C.R. 3 (Stratas J.A., Rennie and Mactavish JJ.A. concurring)\nThe Federal Court of Appeal decided the appeals in Mr. Masons and Mr. Dleiows cases together, after this Court had released Vavilov. The court held that the administrative decisions reasonably interpreted s. 34(1)(e) as not requiring a nexus with national security or the security of Canada.\nThe Court of Appeal began by discussing how a court should conduct reasonableness review. The court said that Vavilov tells us much but it leaves some things unclear (para. 9). The court cautioned that a reviewing court should not fashion its own yardstick and use it to measure what the administrator did, but should instead conduct a preliminary analysis of the text, context and purpose of the legislation just to understand the lay of the land before they examine the administrators reasons (para. 17). The Court of Appeal also criticized the Federal Courts knock-out punch approach in Mr. Masons case as involving disguised correctness review.\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that the IAD was alive to the essential elements of s. 34(1)(e)s text, context, and purpose, and saw no omitted aspects that would cause a loss of confidence in the outcome. It rejected Mr. Masons argument that reading s. 34(1)(e) without a nexus to national security is inconsistent with the broader statutory context. The court ruled that the IAD reasonably concluded that the conduct captured by s. 34(1)(e), which speaks of the danger posed to the lives or safety of persons in Canada, is only a small subset of what would be considered serious criminality under s. 36 of the IRPA. Sections 34 and 36 address two different matters  conduct and convictions, respectively (para. 55). Section 36 is much broader, and applies to much non-violent criminal behaviour; s. 34(1)(e) is narrower, and applies only to acts of violence. The court noted that when the IAD said that s. 34(1)(e) is not absurdly broad because the conduct captured by the provision is narrowly defined, this could only mean that it interpreted safety in s. 34(1)(e) as something approaching the level of a threat to life, not just minor harm (para. 57). The court stated that although the IAD did not address certain contextual arguments, this failure was not a fundamental gap and did not cause the court to lose confidence in its outcome so as to make its decision unreasonable.\nIn contending that s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus with national security or the security of Canada, Mr. Mason also invoked the Refugee Convention and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 29 (Refugee Protocol). The Court of Appeal declined to entertain this argument because it viewed this as a new issue that should have been raised before the IAD, and because certain background documents and other instruments needed to understand any international obligations were not in evidence (para. 74).\nThe Court of Appeal concluded that some elements of s. 34(1)(e)s text, context, and purpose favoured the need for a nexus with national security or the security of Canada, while others did not. It stated that the issue of legislative interpretation is best described as one where the issue is open to some debate (para. 76).\nIn the result, the Court of Appeal ruled that it is reasonable to interpret s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in a manner that does not require proof of conduct with a nexus to national security or the security of Canada. The court therefore allowed the appeals, set aside the judgments of the Federal Court, and dismissed the applications for judicial review.\nIssues\nThese appeals raise two issues: (1) What is the appropriate standard of review of the administrative decisions at issue? (2) Was that standard of review applied properly in these cases?\nAnalysis\nIn what follows, I first address the applicable standard of review and explain why it is reasonableness. I then summarize Vavilovs guidance on conducting reasonableness review and apply that guidance to these cases. I conclude that the administrative decision makers reasons involved failures of justification that made their decisions unreasonable.\nThe Standard of Review\nThe first issue concerns the appropriate standard of review. As this Court has noted, [a] reviewing judges selection and application of the standard of review is reviewable for correctness (Northern Regional Health Authority v. Horrocks, 2021 SCC 42, at para. 10, citing Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 45-47). An appellate court must ste[p] into the shoes of the lower court and focus on the administrative decision under review (Agraira, at para. 46, citing Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. v. Canada (Health), 2012 SCC 3, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 23, at para. 247, per Deschamps J., dissenting). On this approach, an appellate court accords no deference to the reviewing judges application of the standard of review, but rather performs a de novo review of the administrative decision (Horrocks, at para. 10, citing D. J. M. Brown, with the assistance of D. Fairlie, Civil Appeals (loose-leaf), at  14:45). None of these principles was changed by this Courts decision in Vavilov. As a result, the issue is whether the Federal Court selected the correct standard of review and applied it properly (Agraira, at para. 47).\nBefore this Court, the appellant Mr. Mason and the intervener the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers assert that the standard of review is correctness. Citing pre-Vavilov jurisprudence, they say that because the appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal involved a serious question of general importance certified under s. 74(d) of the IRPA, it would be incoherent if the standard were not correctness (A.F., at para. 49, citing Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, at para. 43). The certified question regime under s. 74(d) of the IRPA provides a mechanism for the Federal Court to provide for a statutory appeal of a judicial review decision that raises a serious question that is dispositive of the appeal, transcends the interests of the parties, and raises an issue of broad significance or general importance (Lunyamila v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FCA 22, [2018] 3 F.C.R. 674, at para. 46; Canada (Immigration and Citizenship) v. Laing, 2021 FCA 194, at para. 11 (CanLII); see also Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. XY, 2022 FCA 113, 89 Imm. L.R. (4th) 173, at para. 7). The appellant Mr. Mason and the intervener the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers say that the certified question regime weighs in favour of a correctness standard and evinces a particular concern that questions of general importance be appropriately resolved (A.F., at para. 49, citing Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 3, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, at para. 23; see also I.F., at paras. 4-10).\nI respectfully disagree with this submission. In my view, the standard of review of the administrative decisions is reasonableness. This conclusion rests on three propositions: (1) Vavilov established that the standard of review of the merits of an administrative decision is presumptively reasonableness; (2) no established exception to the presumption of review for reasonableness applies in these cases; and (3) the certified question regime under s. 74(d) of the IRPA does not displace the presumption of reasonableness review and warrant recognition of a new category of correctness. I will address each point in turn.\nThe Standard of Review Is Presumptively Reasonableness\nIn Vavilov, this Court established a presumption that when a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision, the standard of review is reasonableness (para. 16; Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 900, at para. 27). This presumption is rebutted in two types of situations, which together provide six categories of correctness review (Vavilov, at paras. 17 and 69; Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, at para. 40). The first type of situation is where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard or set of standards to apply, and the second type of situation is where the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied (Vavilov, at para. 17). Vavilov thus sets out a general rule of reasonableness review, subject to limited exceptions (D. Mullan, Reasonableness Review Post-Vavilov: An Encomium for Correctness or Deference As Usual? (2021), 23 C.L.E.L.J. 189, at p. 200).\nThe first situation, based on legislative intent, provides for two categories of correctness review: when the legislature explicitly prescribes the standard of review, and when it provides for an appeal from an administrative decision to a court, thus signalling that appellate standards of review apply (Vavilov, at para. 17; Canada Post, at para. 27). \nAs for the second situation, Vavilov set out three categories of questions that the rule of law requires to be reviewed on a standard of correctness: constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (para. 17; Canada Post, at para. 27). \nAt the time it was rendered, Vavilov thus recognized five categories of correctness review: (1) legislated standards of review; (2) statutory appeal mechanisms; (3) constitutional questions; (4) general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole; and (5) questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (paras. 17 and 69).\nAt the same time, Vavilov did not definitively foreclose the possibility of recognizing new categories of correctness [i]n rare and exceptional circumstances . . . when applying reasonableness would undermine legislative intent or the rule of law in a manner analogous to the five correctness categories already identified (Society of Composers, at para. 27; Vavilov, at para. 70). This Court recently recognized a sixth category of correctness review in Society of Composers, a case involving copyright royalties for works accessed online: (6) when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction over a legal issue in a statute (para. 28). The Court noted that both the Copyright Board and the courts have concurrent first instance jurisdiction regarding the interpretation of the Copyright Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42, which signals a legislative intent for judicial involvement (para. 31) and highlights the need for consistent and definitive interpretation of the Copyright Act to maintain the rule of law (paras. 33-35).\nThe presumption of reasonableness review and the limited circumstances in which it is rebutted provide a comprehensive framework for determining the standard of review. This framework brings simplicity, coherence, and predictability to the law on the standard of review, since reviewing courts need no longer conduct an unwieldy contextual inquiry to identify the appropriate standard of review, as had been the case in the period before Vavilov (Vavilov, at paras. 7 and 17).\nNo Established Exception to the Presumption Applies \nNone of the established exceptions to the presumption of reasonableness review applies in these cases.\nFirst, the legislature has not explicitly prescribed the standard of review or provided a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision to a court. The present cases proceeded to the Federal Court on applications for judicial review under s. 72(1) of the IRPA, which does not prescribe the standard of review. \nSecond, the standard of correctness is not required based on the rule of law. The proper interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA is not a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole under Vavilov (paras. 58-62). Such general questions of law require uniform and consistent answers because of their impact on the administration of justice as a whole or for other institutions of government (para. 59). Examples of general questions of law include questions with legal implications for many other statutes or for the proper functioning of the justice system as a whole (paras. 59-61). It is not enough for the question to touc[h] on an important issue or to raise an issue of wider public concern (para. 61). Although the proper interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) is important for the affected persons and the proper administration of the IRPA, it does not affect the legal system or the administration of justice as a whole, have legal implications for many other statutes, or affect other institutions of government. Rather, the issues raised are particular to the interpretation of the conditions for inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e). Moreover, the proper interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) is not a constitutional question or a question related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies, nor does it engage the correctness category recognized in Society of Composers. Thus, the rule of law does not require the Federal Court to review an administrative interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) for correctness.\nThe Certified Question Regime Under the IRPA Does Not Displace the Presumption \nNor does the certified question regime under s. 74(d) of the IRPA displace the presumption of reasonableness review and warrant a new category of correctness. As I will explain, the Federal Courts certification of a question for appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal provides for a statutory appeal of the Federal Courts decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, but it does not change the standard of review to be applied by either court. \nTo begin with, it is obvious that the Federal Courts decision to certify a serious question of general importance under s. 74(d) does not affect the standard of review to be applied by the Federal Court itself on the application for judicial review under s. 72(1) of the IRPA. The Federal Court does not certify the question until it is rendering its judgment on the application for judicial review. Section 74(d) provides that an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal may be made only if, in rendering judgment, the [Federal Court] certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question. In effect, the certified question procedure plays a gatekeeping role by requiring the matter to meet a threshold of importance to merit an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. As this Court has stated, the certified question may be the trigger by which an appeal is permitted, but the subject of the appeal is still the judgment itself, not merely the certified question (Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para. 44, citing Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 12). Thus, the certified question regime does not amount to rare and exceptional circumstances in which the Federal Court applying reasonableness review would undermine legislative intent or the rule of law in a manner analogous to the existing correctness categories (Society of Composers, at paras. 27 and 41).\nThe issue is then whether the certification of a serious question of general importance requires correctness review by the Federal Court of Appeal or this Court, either because of a legislative intent to apply correctness review or because it is required by the rule of law. In my view, the answer is no.\nAs a matter of precedent, this Court has concluded in the immigration context that [d]espite the presence of a certified question, the . . . standard of review is reasonableness (Kanthasamy, at para. 44; see also Baker, at para. 62). Vavilov does not require that conclusion to be revisited. Certification of a question under s. 74(d) of the IRPA does not signal that the legislature intended that appellate courts apply correctness review. As noted above, the Federal Court of Appeals task in an appeal from a decision of the Federal Court in an application for judicial review  including in an appeal based on a certified question  is to determine whether the Federal Court identified the appropriate standard of review, and then to decide whether it applied that standard properly (Agraira, at paras. 45-47; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Galindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50, 468 D.L.R. (4th) 358, at para. 38, citing Horrocks, at para. 10). The Federal Court of Appeal must step into the shoes of the Federal Court and apply the same standard of review that it should have applied (Galindo Camayo, at para. 38, citing Kanthasamy, at para. 44). Here, the Federal Court had to judicially review the administrative decisions for reasonableness. The Federal Court of Appeal, when stepping into the shoes of the Federal Court on the certified question, had to do likewise. As a result, the certified question regime neither rebuts the presumption of reasonableness, nor alters the Court of Appeals task when it hears appeals from first instance judicial review decisions.   \nWhat is more, recall that Vavilov itself involved an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal on a certified question of general importance under s. 22.2(d) of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29, which provides  in terms materially identical to s. 74(d) of the IRPA  that an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal may be made only if, in rendering judgment, the judge certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question. This Court in Vavilov reviewed the administrative decision at issue for reasonableness, noting that there was no indication that the legislature intended a standard of review other than reasonableness to apply (para. 170).\nFinally, recognizing a new correctness category here would conflict with Vavilovs goal of simplifying and making more predictable the standard of review framework by providing only limited exceptions to reasonableness review (para. 47). Treating s. 74(d) as justifying correctness review would effectively reintroduce a contextual approach to the standard of review  with the certification of a serious question of general importance being a contextual factor suggesting correctness  and thus would revive the approach that Vavilov eliminated because it created uncertainty and was unwieldy (para. 7; see also P. Daly, Unresolved Issues after Vavilov (2022), 85 Sask. L. Rev. 89, at pp. 91-92 (Vavilov is an exercise in simplification and clarification that excised the vexing contextual factors . . . from the standard of review selection exercise.)).\nConclusion\nI conclude that no exception to the presumption of reasonableness applies in these cases. As a result, the standard of review of the decisions of the IAD in Mr. Masons case and the ID in Mr. Dleiows case is reasonableness.\nReasonableness Review\nI now turn to the second issue in these appeals: whether the administrative decisions under review were reasonable. This section recaps Vavilovs guidance on conducting reasonableness review and comments briefly on the methodology of reasonableness review conducted by the courts below. The following section then applies reasonableness review to the two administrative decisions at issue.\nVavilovs Guidance on Reasonableness Review of Administrative Decisions\nVavilov provided extensive guidance on conducting reasonableness review of administrative decisions (paras. 73-142). Without canvassing every detail of that guidance, the main elements of reasonableness review can be summarized as follows.\nThe Purpose of Reasonableness Review: Upholding the Rule of Law While According Deference\nVavilov explained that the purpose of reasonableness review is to give effect to the legislatures intent to leave certain decisions with an administrative body while fulfilling the constitutional role of judicial review to ensure that exercises of state power are subject to the rule of law (para. 82). Reasonableness review starts from a posture of judicial restraint and a respect for the distinct role of administrative decision makers (para. 13), arising from the legislatures institutional design choice to give administrative decision makers rather than courts the jurisdiction to decide certain issues (para. 24). Reasonableness review also serves to maintain the rule of law (para. 2) and to safeguard the legality, rationality and fairness of the administrative process (para. 13). Thus, the purpose of reasonableness review is to uphold the rule of law, while according deference to the statutory delegates decision (Canada Post, at para. 29).\nA Reasons First Approach\nVavilov noted that, given the deference owed to an administrative decision, reasonableness review is methodologically distinct from correctness review (para. 12). The Court explained that [w]hat distinguishes reasonableness review from correctness review is that the court conducting a reasonableness review must focus on the decision the administrative decision maker actually made, including the justification offered for it, and not on the conclusion the court itself would have reached in the administrative decision makers place (para. 15). Reasonableness review is thus concerned with both the administrators decision-making process and the outcome (paras. 83 and 87; see also Canada Post, at para. 29).\nWhen an administrative decision maker is required by the legislative scheme or the duty of procedural fairness to provide reasons for its decision, the reasons are the primary mechanism by which administrative decision makers show that their decisions are reasonable (Vavilov, at para. 81). The purpose of reasons is to demonstrate justification, transparency and intelligibility (para. 81). Reasons are the means by which the decision maker communicates the rationale for its decision (para. 84). This Court emphasized that it is not enough for the outcome of a decision to be justifiable. Where reasons for a decision are required, the decision must also be justified, by way of those reasons, by the decision maker to those to whom the decision applies (para. 86 (emphasis in original)).\nA decision will be unreasonable when the reasons fail to provide a transparent and intelligible justification for the result (para. 136). A reviewing court must therefore take a reasons first approach that evaluates the administrative decision makers justification for its decision (para. 84). It must begin its inquiry into the reasonableness of a decision by examining the reasons provided with respectful attention and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at its conclusion (para. 84, citing D. Dyzenhaus, The Politics of Deference: Judicial Review and Democracy, in M. Taggart, ed., The Province of Administrative Law (1997), 279, at p. 286). As noted by Professor David Mullan, the reasons first approach underscores a commitment to deference and requires that reasons are the principal lens through which the exercise of reasonableness review takes place (p. 202). Thus, as he explains, the starting or focal point for the conducting of truly deferential reasonableness review should be the reasons provided by the decision-maker (p. 215; see also Daly (2022), at pp. 108-10).\nUnder Vavilovs reasons first approach, the reviewing court should remember that the written reasons given by an administrative body must not be assessed against a standard of perfection, and need not include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred (para. 91). The reviewing judge must read the administrators reasons holistically and contextually (para. 97), in light of the history and context of the proceedings in which they were rendered, including the evidence before the decision maker, the submissions of the parties, publicly available policies or guidelines that informed the decision makers work, and past decisions of the relevant administrative body (para. 94). Reasons must be read in light of the record and with due sensitivity to the administrative regime in which they were given (para. 103). Such factors may explain an aspect of the decision makers reasoning process that is not apparent from the reasons themselves, or may reveal that an apparent shortcoming in the reasons is not, in fact, a failure of justification, intelligibility or transparency (para. 94).\nA reviewing court should also avoid engaging in disguised correctness review, or correctness in the guise of reasonableness (para. 294, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., concurring in the result; see also Wilson v. Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., 2016 SCC 29, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 770, at para. 27, citing D. Mullan, Unresolved Issues on Standard of Review in Canadian Judicial Review of Administrative Action  The Top Fifteen! (2013), 42 Adv. Q. 1, at pp. 76-81). Because [t]he role of courts in these circumstances is to review, they should, as a general rule, refrain from deciding the issue themselves (Vavilov, at para. 83 (emphasis in original)). A reviewing court should not create its own yardstick and then use [it] to measure what the administrator did (para. 83, and Canada Post, at para. 40, both citing Delios v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 117, 100 Admin. L.R. (5th) 301, at para. 28). Nor should a reviewing court ask what decision it would have made in place of that of the administrative decision maker, attempt to ascertain the range of possible conclusions that would have been open to the decision maker, conduct a de novo analysis or seek to determine the correct solution to the problem (Vavilov, at para. 83; see also Canada Post, at para. 40). Rather, a reviewing court must consider only whether the decision made by the administrative decision maker  including both the rationale for the decision and the outcome to which it led  was unreasonable (Vavilov, at para. 83).\nFinally, Vavilov cautioned that the reasons first approach is not a rubber-stamping process or a means of sheltering administrative decision makers from accountability (para. 13). Instead, it is a robust form of review (para. 13; see also paras. 12, 67 and 138), one that highlights the need to develop and strengthen a culture of justification in administrative decision making (para. 2).\nIndicators of Unreasonableness\nVavilov identified two types of fundamental flaws indicating that an administrative decision is unreasonable: (1) a failure of rationality internal to the reasoning process; or (2) a failure of justification given the legal and factual constraints bearing on the decision (para. 101). A reviewing court need not categorize unreasonableness as falling into one category or another. They are simply a helpful way of describing how a decision may be unreasonable (para. 101).\nFailures of Rationality in the Reasoning Process\nA failure of rationality in the reasoning process arises if the decision is not rational or logical (paras. 102-4). A decision is unreasonable if, read holistically, it fail[s] to reveal a rational chain of analysis or reveal[s] that the decision was based on an irrational chain of analysis (para. 103). A reviewing court must be able to trace the decision makers reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws in the decision makers overarching logic (para. 102). It must be satisfied that the decision makers reasoning adds up (para. 104).\nFailures of Justification in Light of the Legal and Factual Constraints\nA failure of justification in light of the legal and factual constraints bearing on the decision arises if the decision is not justified in relation to the constellation of law and facts that are relevant to the decision (para. 105). The legal and factual context operate as constraints on the decision maker in the exercise of its delegated powers (para. 105). The burden of justification varies with the circumstances, including the wording of the relevant statutory provisions, the applicable precedents, the evidence, the submissions of the parties, and the impact of the decision on the affected persons. The greater the interpretive constraints in a given case, the greater the burden of justification on the decision maker in deviating from those constraints (see M. Popescu, Larret Vavilov: a la recherche de lequilibre perdu entre la primaute du droit et la suprematie legislative (2021), 62 C. de D. 567, at p. 603). Examples include the seven non-exhaustive constraints set out below. As was highlighted in Vavilov, [t]hese elements are not a checklist for conducting reasonableness review, and they may vary in significance depending on the context. They are offered merely to highlight some elements of the surrounding context that can cause a reviewing court to lose confidence in the outcome reached (para. 106).\nThe Governing Statutory Scheme\nWhether an interpretation of the governing statutory scheme is justified will depend on the context, including the language chosen by the legislature in describing the limits and contours of the decision makers authority (para. 110). Narrower and more precise language imposes a greater constraint on the decision maker, while broad, open-ended or highly qualitative language affords greater flexibility (para. 110). What matters is whether the decision maker has properly justified its interpretation of the statute in light of the surrounding context (para. 110).\nThe Principles of Statutory Interpretation\nAs already noted, a court evaluating the reasonableness of an administrative decision on a question of statutory interpretation does not undertake a de novo analysis of the question or ask itself what the correct decision would have been (para. 116). Instead, the court must examine the administrative decision as a whole, including the reasons provided by the decision maker and the outcome that was reached (para. 116).\nAlthough an administrative decision maker need not engage in a formalistic statutory interpretation exercise in every case (para. 119), its decision must be consistent with the modern principle of statutory interpretation, which focusses on the text, context, and purpose of the statutory provision. The decision maker must demonstrate in its reasons that it was alive to those essential elements (para. 120). The omission of a minor aspect of the text, context, or purpose is unlikely to undermine the decision as a whole: omissions are not stand-alone grounds for judicial intervention (para. 122). In each case, the key question is whether the omitted aspect of the analysis causes the reviewing court to lose confidence in the outcome reached by the decision maker (para. 122). For example, an administrative interpretation may well be unreasonable if it fails to consider the potentially harsh consequences of its interpretation of a statutory provision for a large class of individuals, and whether, in light of those consequences, the legislature would have intended the provision to apply in that way (paras. 191-92). And even if a decision does not explicitly consider the meaning of a relevant provision, the court may be able to discern the interpretation adopted from the record and evaluate whether it is reasonable (para. 123).\nIn interpreting a statute, an administrative decision maker may draw on its institutional expertise and experience and rely on considerations that a court would not have thought to employ, but which enrich and elevate the interpretive exercise (paras. 93 and 119; Canada Post, at para. 43). As Professor Audrey Macklin explains, courts should be genuinely receptive to input beyond the usual techniques that courts use to discern text, context and purpose. These may include operational implications, alignment with broader statutory mandate, and so on (Seven Out of Nine Legal Experts Agree: Expertise No Longer Matters (in the Same Way) After Vavilov! (2021), 100 S.C.L.R. (2d) 249, at p. 261). By being receptive to such factors, courts acknowledge that administrative decision makers have a role to play in elaborating the content of the schemes that they administer (Vavilov, at para. 108). Reasonableness review demands both that administrative decision makers demonstrate their expertise through their reasons and that judges pay [r]espectful attention to the ways in which their reasons reflect that expertise (para. 93; P. Daly, Vavilov and the Culture of Justification in Contemporary Administrative Law (2021), 100 S.C.L.R. (2d) 279, at pp. 285-86).\nFinally, a court may conclude during a reasonableness review that the interplay of text, context and purpose leaves room for a single reasonable interpretation of the statutory provision, or aspect of the statutory provision (Vavilov, at para. 124, citing Dunsmuir, at paras. 72-76, and Nova Tube Inc./Nova Steel Inc. v. Conares Metal Supply Ltd., 2019 FCA 52). In such a case, although a court should generally pause before definitively pronouncing upon the interpretation of a statutory provision, the court may conclude that remitting the question to the administrative decision maker may serve no useful purpose (Vavilov, at para. 124). It must be stressed that the possibility of a single reasonable interpretation is not a starting point of reasonableness review, as this would be contrary to a reasons first approach. Rather, it is a conclusion that a reviewing court may draw as a result of a proper reasonableness review, as part of the courts consideration of the appropriate remedy. \nRelevant Statutory Law, Common Law, and International Law\nStatutory law, common law, and international law may operate as legal constraints on an administrative decision maker (paras. 111 and 114). An administrative decision will be unreasonable if it fails to justify a departure from binding precedents (para. 112). International law can also operate as an important constraint, arising from the presumption that legislation is presumed to operate in conformity with Canadas international obligations and the values and principles of customary and conventional international law, or by informing whether a decision was a reasonable exercise of administrative authority (para. 114).\nThe Evidence and Facts Before the Decision Maker\nAbsent exceptional circumstances, a reviewing court will defer to an administrative decision makers factual findings (para. 125). A reviewing court may intervene, however, if the decision is unreasonable: if it is not justified in light of the facts or when the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the evidence before it (para. 126).\nThe Submissions of the Parties\nAn administrative decision makers reasons must meaningfully account for the central issues and concerns raised by the parties (para. 127). Reasons must be responsive to the parties submissions, because reasons are the primary mechanism by which decision makers demonstrate that they have actually listened to the parties (para. 127 (emphasis in original)). Although an administrative decision does not have to respond to every argument or line of possible analysis raised by the parties, a decision makers failure to meaningfully grapple with key issues or central arguments raised by the parties may call into question whether the decision maker was actually alert and sensitive to the matter before it (para. 128).\nThe Past Practices and Decisions of the Administrative Body\nAdministrative decision makers should be concerned with the general consistency of their decisions, even if they are not bound by their prior decisions in the same way that courts are bound by stare decisis (para. 129). A decision will be unreasonable if the reasons fail to meet the justificatory burden for departing from longstanding practices or established internal authority (para. 131).\nThe Potential Impact of the Decision on the Affected Individual\nVavilov also explained that [w]here the impact of a decision on an individuals rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes (para. 133). The principle of responsive justification means that if a decision has particularly harsh consequences for the affected individual, then the decision maker must explain why its decision best reflects the legislatures intention (para. 133). An administrative decision may be unreasonable if it fails to grapple with particularly severe or harsh consequences for the affected individual (para. 134). An administrative decision makers reasons must demonstrate that they have considered the consequences of a decision and that those consequences are justified in light of the facts and law (para. 135).\nHaving set out Vavilovs guidance on conducting reasonableness review, I now comment briefly on the approach to reasonableness review of the courts below.  \nMethodology of Reasonableness Review in the Courts Below\nThe Federal Court in Mr. Masons case did not have the benefit of Vavilov, and therefore did not apply Vavilovs reasons first approach in judicially reviewing the administrative decisions. The Federal Court essentially conducted its own freestanding interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) based on the provisions text, context, and purpose (paras. 38-51), and then evaluated the administrative decisions against that interpretation (paras. 52-62). As the Court of Appeal noted, this involved the Federal Court fashioning its own yardstick to measure the administrators interpretation and interfering if the difference is too much (para. 24). This approach was eschewed in this Courts decision in Vavilov.\nBut the Federal Court of Appeal also strayed from Vavilovs methodology of reasonableness review. The Court of Appeal grafted onto Vavilov an extra step of conducting a preliminary analysis of the text, context and purpose of the legislation just to understand the lay of the land before . . . examin[ing] the administrators reasons (para. 17). The parties before this Court contended that this preliminary step is inconsistent with Vavilov. The respondent Minister of Citizenship and Immigration  who otherwise agreed with the Court of Appeals conclusion  submitted that the Court of Appeals approach should not be adopted, and urged that [t]he focus in the reasonableness analysis needs to remain, as this Court has instructed, on the reasons of the decision-maker, and not on a range of potential conclusions to be determined by a reviewing court in the abstract (R.F., at para. 54). I agree. Vavilov is clear that a reviewing court must start its analysis with the reasons of the administrative decision maker; starting with its own perception of the merits may lead a court to slip into correctness review.\nWere the Administrative Decisions Reasonable?\nI now turn to consider whether the administrative decisions under review reasonably interpreted s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA as not requiring a nexus with national security or the security of Canada.\nIn reviewing the IADs reasons, I recall this Courts instruction in Vavilov that a reviewing court should conduct reasonableness review mindful of the impact of the decision on the affected individual. The principle of responsive justification means that [w]here the impact of a decision on an individuals rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes (para. 133). Here, the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) will affect whether two individuals  one of whom has not been convicted of a criminal offence  could be deported from Canada. As this Court has noted, individuals facing deportation may experience any number of serious life-changing consequences, including dislocation or permanent separation from their family (R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at para. 72, per Wagner J. (as he then was), dissenting). The IADs reasons must reflect these stakes.\nI begin by summarizing in greater detail the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) in the reasons of the IAD in Mr. Masons case, which were followed by the ID in Mr. Dleiows case, before addressing what the appellants say are failures of justification in the IADs reasons.\nThe IADs Reasons in Mr. Masons Case\nThe IAD in Mr. Masons case ruled that a person can be inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA even without violent conduct linked to national security or the security of Canada. It decided the appeal based on the parties written submissions, and concluded that Parliament intended s. 34(1)(e) to relate to security in a broader sense, including by ensuring that individual Canadians are secure from acts of violence that would or might endanger their lives or safety (para. 37). The IADs chain of reasoning was as follows:\nSection 34(1)(e) cannot be read in isolation. The provision must be interpreted using the modern approach to statutory interpretation. The words used in s. 34(1)(e) must be assessed in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (para. 17, citing Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21).\nThe other paragraphs of s. 34(1) all have a nexus to national security, which may be a signal of Parliaments intent, but is not determinative. Context comes not just from the immediate co-text, but from the overall scheme and object of the IRPA (para. 21). The inadmissibility provisions in Part 1, Division 4 of the IRPA are particularly relevant (para. 21).\nIn at least one prior decision, X (Re), 2017 CanLII 146735 (I.R.B. (Imm. Div.)), in which a foreign national allegedly assaulted his former girlfriends in Canada but was not convicted of any offence in Canada, the ID interpreted the terms security and security grounds in s. 34(1)(e) as meaning the security of Canada or national security. But this interpretation is not consistent with the presumption of consistent expression (IAD reasons, at para. 23). The terms security and security grounds in s. 34 must have different meanings from the terms the security of Canada or national security used elsewhere in the IRPA, including in the phrase being a danger to the security of Canada in s. 34(1)(d), which would otherwise be redundant.\nThe dictionary definition of security, which includes a secure condition or feeling, provides useful guidance (para. 25). This is a broad definition that does not necessarily incorporate a national security element (para. 25).\nObiter comments in prior cases tend to support the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness position on the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) (para. 27 (emphasis added), citing El Werfalli v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 FC 612, [2014] 4 F.C.R. 673, at para. 75, which stated that [t]he provision of reasonable grounds to believe an organization may engage in terrorism in the future serves to maintain national security and public safety being the object of the subsection 34(1); para. 28 (emphasis added), citing Fuentes v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCT 379, [2003] 4 F.C. 249, at para. 62, which interpreted a predecessor provision, s. 19 of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as directed at the key concepts of subversion, terrorism, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ordinary crimes).\nSection 36(1)(a) of the IRPA provides for inadmissibility based on the commission of a criminal offence in Canada, and requires a conviction. Section 34(1)(e) creates a different ground of inadmissibility based on conduct, described in terms of the danger posed to the lives and safety of persons in Canada (para. 33). Such conduct is a small subset of what would be considered serious criminality in section 36 of the IRPA, and is distinct from criminal law (para. 33). Sections 34 and 36 overlap but are distinct (para. 38). Section 36 addresses criminal offences, while s. 34 addresses danger posed to the lives and safety of persons in Canada.\nBecause inadmissibility is not a criminal sanction, it does not offend Canadian values to find a person inadmissible for acts that were arguably criminal, but which did not lead to a criminal conviction (para. 35). The conduct described in s. 34(1)(e) is narrowly defined and anchored in terms of the danger posed to Canadians, not to criminal law (para. 36).\nFailures of Justification in the IADs Reasons\nPlainly, the IADs reasons applied several recognized techniques of statutory interpretation. The IAD adverted to the modern approach to statutory interpretation; attempted to read s. 34(1)(e) in the context of the rest of s. 34 and the broader context of the grounds of inadmissibility in Division 4 of the IRPA; relied on a dictionary definition of security; considered the presumption of consistent expression to give the terms security and security grounds in s. 34(1)(e) a distinct meaning from the terms the security of Canada and national security used elsewhere in the IRPA; and considered the only prior decision, a ruling of the ID, that had interpreted s. 34(1)(e) and was consistent with Mr. Masons position, as well as obiter statements from two Federal Court decisions that it viewed as supporting the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness position. On balance, the IAD concluded that the Ministers interpretive arguments outweighed Mr. Masons.\nAs I will elaborate, although the IAD considered several of Mr. Masons arguments, it failed to address significant legal constraints that he had raised in his written submissions to the IAD: (1) two points of statutory context, and (2) the broad consequences of its decision. The IADs decision also failed to address (3) constraints imposed by international law that s. 3(3)(f) of the IRPA requires to be considered in interpreting and applying the legislation. These omissions establish that the IADs decision was unreasonable.\nFailure to Address Two Significant Points of Statutory Context\nThe IAD failed to address two significant points of statutory context that Mr. Mason raised before the IAD in support of his argument that s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus with national security or the security of Canada. Together, these omissions involve a failure of responsive justification.  \nFirst, Mr. Mason submitted before the IAD that s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus with national security or the security of Canada partly because the ministerial relief from inadmissibility under s. 34 (security grounds) is narrower than that available under s. 36 (serious criminality and criminality). He claimed that this narrower relief suggests that s. 34 is a grave form of inadmissibility concerned with national security (A.R., vol. II, at p. 30).\nMr. Mason submitted as follows. If a foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds under s. 34, the relief available is narrow: the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness may declare that the matters referred to in s. 34 do not constitute inadmissibility in respect of the foreign national if they satisfy the Minister that it is not contrary to the national interest (IRPA, s. 42.1(1)). But a foreign national inadmissible under s. 36 for being convicted of a criminal offence in Canada may seek broader relief: they may be granted ministerial relief from inadmissibility on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (s. 25(1)), and may not be found inadmissible if a record suspension for the conviction is in effect under the Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-47 (IRPA, s. 36(3)(b)).\nHere, for example, because Mr. Mason was not convicted of a criminal offence and his alleged conduct would make him inadmissible under the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e), he could seek relief from inadmissibility only if he satisfied the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness that it is in the national interest. But had Mr. Mason been convicted of a criminal offence for the same conduct, he could have applied for ministerial relief from inadmissibility on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, and he would not have been inadmissible at all had he been convicted of a criminal offence and later pardoned under the Criminal Records Act.\nMr. Mason argued that because the relief available to persons inadmissible on security grounds under s. 34 is narrower than the relief available to persons inadmissible for criminality under s. 36, s. 34 was among the grave forms of inadmissibility and should be interpreted in the context of national security (A.R., vol. II, at p. 30).\nThe IADs reasons, read with sensitivity and in light of the record, did not address this important contextual argument. While perhaps not in itself determinative, this argument supported Mr. Masons position and imposed a significant legal constraint on the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e).\nSecond, Mr. Mason submitted before the IAD that s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus with national security or the security of Canada partly because the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration must consider different criteria when conducting a pre-removal risk assessmen[t] for a foreign national found inadmissible under s. 34 (security grounds) and under s. 36 (serious criminality and criminality) (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 30-31). He submitted that in an assessment involving s. 36 the Minister must consider whether the person poses a danger to the public in Canada. In contrast, in an assessment involving s. 34 the Minister must consider whether the person poses a danger to the security of Canada. He claimed that this distinction supported his position that the security grounds under s. 34 require a nexus to national security or the security of Canada. \nA pre-removal risk assessment is a process under the IRPA by which a person subject to a removal order may apply to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration for protection, resulting in refugee protection or a stay of the removal order (ss. 112 and 114(1)). In any application for a pre-removal risk assessment, the Minister must consider the danger that the person would be subjected to torture, the risk to their life, and the risk they would be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment (s. 97). For persons found inadmissible under s. 36(1) for serious criminality, the Minister must also consider whether they are a danger to the public in Canada (s. 113(d)(i)). But for persons found inadmissible on security grounds under s. 34, the Minister must, in addition to the s. 97 factors, consider whether the application should be refused because of the nature and severity of acts committed by the applicant or because of the danger that the applicant constitutes to the security of Canada (s. 113(d)(ii)).\nMr. Mason argued before the IAD that these diverging considerations for pre-removal risk assessments suggest that Parliament contemplated that conduct captured by s. 36 poses a danger to the public in Canada, while conduct captured by s. 34 poses a danger to the security of Canada (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 30-31). He claimed that this supported his position that the security grounds under s. 34 require a nexus to national security or the security of Canada.\nAgain, the IADs reasons did not address this important contextual argument, which, while not in itself determinative, supported Mr. Masons position and imposed a significant legal constraint on the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e).\nThe Federal Court accepted that the IAD failed to address these two important contextual arguments that Mr. Mason had raised (para. 53). The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed, stating that the IAD had considered these two arguments implicitly (para. 59). In its view, [t]o the extent that the [IAD] failed to mention some elements in its analysis of text, context and purpose, this was not a fundamental gap (para. 59). The Court of Appeal said that although one can quibble that certain elements of text, context and purpose were not mentioned in the reasons, the court was confident from the quality of the [IAD]s overall reasoning that it considered them to be outweighed by other elements (para. 59).\nI respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal. I see no basis to conclude that the IAD considered these two important points of statutory context, even implicitly. Mr. Mason expressly raised both points as core planks supporting his position. The IADs failure to address them, while addressing other points, casts into doubt whether it was alert and sensitive to these issues (Vavilov, at paras. 127-28). Reasons are the primary mechanism for the IAD to demonstrate that it actually listened to Mr. Mason (para. 127). In my view, the IADs reasons did not address  far less meaningfully grapple with  two key arguments that Mr. Mason had raised. The IADs reasons therefore failed to meet Vavilovs standard of responsive justification (para. 127).\nFailure to Address Potentially Broad Consequences\nThe IAD also failed to address Mr. Masons submission that interpreting s. 34(1)(e) without a nexus to national security or the security of Canada would result in two broad consequences, which he claimed ran afoul of the principle of statutory interpretation that a legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences (Rizzo, at para. 27; Vavilov, at para. 120). The IADs failure to address these two broad consequences involves another failure of responsive justification. \nFirst, Mr. Mason submitted that interpreting s. 34(1)(e) without a nexus to national security or the security of Canada would mean that any act of violence against another individual would presumably result in one of the most grave forms of inadmissibility (A.R., vol. II, at p. 31). The acts of violence caught by s. 34(1)(e) would, he submitted, extend from domestic altercations to bar fights and schoolyard fights (p. 31). I note that unlike a criminal conviction triggering inadmissibility under s. 36, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the facts triggering inadmissibility under s. 34 are subject to the much lower standard of facts for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur (IRPA, s. 33). Thus, s. 34(1)(e) would extend to any acts of violence  past, present, or future  that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. Mr. Mason submitted that it would be absurd for such acts to be captured by s. 34(1)(e).\nUnlike the Federal Court of Appeal, I do not read the IADs reasons as having addressed this argument. The Federal Court of Appeal interpreted the IADs reasons as interpreting safety as something approaching the level of a threat to life, not just minor harm (para. 57). The court based this conclusion on the IADs observation that s. 34(1)(e) is narrowly defined and anchored in terms of the danger posed to Canadians, not to criminal law. But the IAD made this statement in explaining that immigration consequences under the IRPA are distinct from criminal sanctions and are subject to different evidentiary thresholds; it did not say that s. 34(1)(e) applied only to a small class of especially serious violent conduct approaching a threat to life. As the IAD explained:\n. . . immigration consequences under the IRPA are not criminal sanctions. Criminal law and the IRPA have different objects. The IRPA operates under a different scheme including, for example, a lower evidentiary threshold. A person can be found inadmissible for conduct even if they have not been convicted criminally for that conduct. The conduct described in paragraph 34(1)(e) is narrowly defined and anchored in terms of the danger posed to Canadians, not to criminal law. [para. 36]\nWith respect, the Court of Appeal effectively buttressed the IADs reasons to provide a justification that the IAD did not itself provide, contrary to Vavilovs direction that it is not open to a reviewing court to disregard the flawed basis for a decision and substitute its own justification for the outcome (para. 96). This Court warned that [t]o allow a reviewing court to do so would be to allow an administrative decision maker to abdicate its responsibility to justify to the affected party, in a manner that is transparent and intelligible, the basis on which it arrived at a particular conclusion (para. 96).\nAs for the second broad consequence, Mr. Mason submitted to the IAD that if s. 34(1)(e) is interpreted without a nexus to national security or the security of Canada, it would do an end-run around the limitations under s. 36(3)(e) with respect to youth offences (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 31-32). Section 36(3)(e) of the IRPA provides that young persons who are permanent residents or foreign nationals found guilty under the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1, or who received a youth sentence under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, cannot be found inadmissible under s. 36(1) (serious criminality) or s. 36(2) (criminality). In effect, under s. 36(3)(e), Parliament exempted young persons from inadmissibility for most criminal offences. But on the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e), young persons can be found inadmissible for any acts of violence that would or might engage the lives or safety of persons in Canada, even without a nexus to national security or the security of Canada, and even without a criminal conviction.\nNeither the IAD nor the Federal Court of Appeal addressed this incompatibility of the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) with the scheme for the inadmissibility of young persons under the IRPA. This omission was also not a minor aspect of s. 34(1)(e)s interpretive context, and should have been addressed.\nFailure to Address Constraints Imposed by International Law\nFinally, the IAD failed to address the legal constraints imposed by international law on its interpretation of s. 34(1)(e). As I will explain, the IADs interpretation allows foreign nationals to be returned to countries where they may face persecution, contrary to Canadas non-refoulement obligation in Article 33 of the Refugee Convention. By contrast, interpreting s. 34(1)(e) as requiring a nexus with national security or the security of Canada means that a removal order would not breach Article 33. Although this argument was not presented to the IAD, the IAD was required by its home statute to interpret and apply the IRPA in a manner that complies with Canadas international human rights obligations, including Canadas non-refoulement obligation under Article 33 of the Refugee Convention.\nVavilov highlighted that international law may be an important constraint on an administrative decision maker, including through the presumption of statutory interpretation that legislation is presumed to operate in conformity with Canadas international obligations (para. 114). Canada has ratified both the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1967 Refugee Protocol (Nemeth v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 281, at para. 17). These international human rights instruments to which Canada is a party trigger the interpretive presumption of conformity with international law.\nThe presumption of conformity with international law assumes added force when interpreting the IRPA, because Parliament has made its presumed intent to conform to Canadas international obligations explicit through two provisions of the IRPA (B010 v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 704, at para. 49). First, s. 3(2)(b) of the IRPA expressly identifies one of the IRPAs objectives as being to fulfil Canadas international legal obligations with respect to refugees and affirm Canadas commitment to international efforts to provide assistance to those in need of resettlement. Indeed, this Court has described the IRPA as the main legislative vehicle for implementing Canadas international refugee obligations (Nemeth, at para. 21). Second, s. 3(3)(f) of the IRPA instructs courts and administrative decision makers to construe and apply the IRPA in a manner that complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory (B010, at para. 49). This Court has stated that [t]here can be no doubt that the Refugee Convention is such an instrument, building as it does on the right of persons to seek and to enjoy asylum from persecution in other countries as set out in art. 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. Res. 217 A (III), U.N. Doc. A/810, at 71 (1948) (para. 49). As a result, the Refugee Convention is determinative of how the IRPA must be interpreted and applied, in the absence of a contrary legislative intention (de Guzman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 436, [2006] 3 F.C.R. 655, at para. 87; B010, at para. 49). \nThe centrepiece of the Refugee Convention is contained in the provisions relating to expulsion and return (Nemeth, at para. 18). Article 33, which has been expressly incorporated into the IRPA (s. 115), bars the expulsion or return of a refugee, by any means, to a country where they are at risk of persecution, unless they are found to pose a danger to the security of the host country or are convicted of a serious crime. Article 33 of the Refugee Convention provides:\nArticle 33\n\nProhibition of Expulsion or Return (Refoulement)\n\n1. No Contracting State shall expel or return (refouler) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\n \n2. The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country.\nArticle 33(1) enshrines the principle of non-refoulement, which has been described as the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime, and which, generally, prohibits the direct or indirect removal of refugees to a territory where they run a risk of being subjected to human rights violations (Nemeth, at paras. 18-19). Article 33(2), which operates as a limited exception to the principle of non-refoulement in Article 33(1), allows a person to be removed in exceptional circumstances: when there are reasonable grounds for regarding the person as a danger to the security of the country in which they are, or when the person is convicted of a serious crime and is a danger to the community of that country (see Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, at para. 25). Article 42 of the Refugee Convention further stipulates that ratifying states may not make reservations to the non-refoulement protections of Article 33 (Nemeth, at para. 18). The principle of non-refoulement is generally recognized as a norm of customary international law (see Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga, ICC-01/04-01/07, Decision on the application for the interim release of detained Witnesses, 1 October 2013 (Trial Chamber II), at para. 30; Zaoui v. Attorney-General (No. 2), [2005] 1 N.Z.L.R. 690 (C.A.), at paras. 34-35; S. E. Lauterpacht and D. Bethlehem, The scope and content of the principle of non-refoulement: Opinion, in E. Feller, V. Turk and F. Nicholson, eds., Refugee Protection in International Law: UNHCRs Global Consultations on International Protection (2003), 87, at paras. 193-253; H. Lambert, Customary Refugee Law, in C. Costello, M. Foster and J. McAdam, eds., The Oxford Handbook of International Refugee Law (2021), 240, at pp. 242-49; and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Advisory Opinion on the Extraterritorial Application of Non-Refoulement Obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (2007), at paras. 14-16).\nThe IADs interpretation allows a foreign national found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) to be subject to refoulement contrary to Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention. On the IADs interpretation, a foreign national can be deported to persecution once they are found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e), without a finding that the person poses a danger to the security of Canada or even if they have not been convicted of a serious offence. Such a person would be entitled to the benefit of Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention, as the exceptions under Article 33(2) would not apply: on the IADs approach to inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e), there need not be reasonable grounds to regard the foreign national as a danger to the security of Canada, or for them to have been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime.\nA person facing such a removal order would not be protected from refoulement under Article 33(1) through the IRPAs pre-removal risk assessment process. Although such a person may apply to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration for a pre-removal risk assessment (IRPA, s. 112), the grounds that the Minister must consider in assessing the risk to the person if the removal order is not stayed do not include those under Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention. The Minister does not consider whether the person is a Convention refugee, that is, whether the person has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion (s. 96). Instead, the Minister need consider only (1) whether the application for a stay of the removal order should be refused because of the nature and severity of acts committed by the person or because of the danger that the person constitutes to the security of Canada, and (2) whether the persons removal would subject them to a danger of torture, to a risk to their life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment (ss. 97(1) and 113(d)(ii)). Thus, as fairly conceded by the respondent Minister, the Minister does not consider the forms of persecution described in Article 33(1) (R.F., at para. 106). And while there are several safety valves under the IRPA that provide discretionary exemptions from the application of the general ineligibility rules under the IRPA (see Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 17, at paras. 43-48), none of these discretionary exemptions detract from the concern that the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) would, as a general rule, allow for a removal order without protection from refoulement, contrary to Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention.\nAs a result, interpreting s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA as not requiring a nexus with national security or the security of Canada  as did the IAD  could subject persons to refoulement contrary to Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention. By contrast, interpreting s. 34(1)(e) as requiring a nexus with national security or the security of Canada would trigger the exception in Article 33(2) to the ability to claim the protection of Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention, and thus a removal order in such circumstances would not breach Canadas obligation of non-refoulement.\nThe respondent Minister contends that s. 115(1) and (2) of the IRPA operate as a safeguard against refoulement and fulfil[l] Canadas international obligations by ensuring that it is only in exceptional cases that a Convention refugee or a protected person will lose the benefit of non-refoulement and be removed from Canada (R.F., at para. 125). Section 115(1) prohibits removal of certain persons to persecution, and s. 115(2) provides for limited exceptions to that prohibition:\nProtection\n\n115 (1) A protected person or a person who is recognized as a Convention refugee by another country to which the person may be returned shall not be removed from Canada to a country where they would be at risk of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion or at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.\n\nExceptions\n\n(2) Subsection (1) does not apply in the case of a person\n\n(a) who is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality and who constitutes, in the opinion of the Minister, a danger to the public in Canada; or\n\n(b) who is inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights or organized criminality if, in the opinion of the Minister, the person should not be allowed to remain in Canada on the basis of the nature and severity of acts committed or of danger to the security of Canada.\nAccording to the Minister, if a person inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) is subject to an enforceable removal order, s. 115(1) and (2) will prevent their refoulement except in limited circumstances, and so s. 34(1)(e) need not be interpreted as requiring a link to national security or the security of Canada. \nI disagree with the Ministers submission for two reasons. First, while the Minister is correct that the s. 115(2) exceptions apply in limited circumstances, they nonetheless allow refoulement of persons inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e) in circumstances outside the scope of the Article 33(2) exceptions. As discussed above, Article 33(2) provides for exceptions to the non-refoulement principle for persons reasonably regarded as a danger to the security of the host country, or who are convicted of a particularly serious crime and are a danger to the community. But s. 115(2) countenances refoulement outside those circumstances: it only requires that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration be of the opinion that the person should not be allowed to remain in Canada on the basis of (1) the nature and severity of acts committed, or (2) danger to the security of Canada. It thus permits the Minister to allow refoulement based on the nature and severity of acts not linked to the security of the country.\nSecond, s. 115(1) affords protection to a narrower set of persons than are protected from refoulement under the Refugee Convention. Section 115(1) only affords protection to a person recognized as having refugee status: [a] protected person or a person who is recognized as a Convention refugee by another country to which the person may be returned. By contrast, Article 33 affords protection to a refugee, and thus does not require a prior recognition of refugee status (Refugee Convention, Article 1; Refugee Protocol, Article 1; G. v. G., [2021] UKSC 9, [2022] A.C. 544, at para. 81 (The obligation not to refoule an individual arises by virtue of the fact that their circumstances meet the definition of refugee, not by reason of the recognition by a contracting state that the definition is met.)). As a result, if s. 34(1)(e) applies to conduct not linked to national security or the security of Canada, s. 115(1) allows the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to subject refugee claimants to refoulement contrary to Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention.\nThat neither Mr. Mason nor Mr. Dleiow is a refugee claimant does not detract from this conclusion. The Refugee Convention imposes an important legal constraint on the interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) generally, irrespective of whether the specific foreign national subject to deportation is a refugee claimant.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal declined to consider this argument because it had not been made to the IAD, and because it said that certain background documents and other instruments needed to understand any international obligations are not in evidence before us (paras. 73-74). The court did not say what documents and instruments might be missing. \nIn any event, the role of the Refugee Convention in constraining the interpretation of the IRPA is a question of law, one that Parliament by s. 3(3)(f) has expressly directed a court or administrative decision maker to consider. The IADs failure to consider this issue did not involve the omission of a minor aspect of the interpretive context (Vavilov, at para. 122). Rather, it involved the omission of the principle of non-refoulement  the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime, and a critical legal constraint on interpretation of the IRPA, one that Parliament has decreed must be considered in construing and applying the IRPA. This crucial omission made the IADs decision unreasonable.\nConclusion and Remedy\nThe IADs reasons in Mr. Masons case failed to address critical points of statutory context and the broad consequences of its interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA, all of which Mr. Mason had highlighted in his written submissions to the IAD. These omissions were significant, not minor; they involved a failure of responsive justification by the IAD. The IAD also failed to interpret and apply s. 34(1)(e) in compliance with Canadas obligation of non-refoulement under the Refugee Convention, a matter that Parliament has decreed it must consider. Cumulatively, these omissions rendered the IADs decision unreasonable. \nThe IDs decision in Mr. Dleoiws case, which simply followed the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA in Mr. Masons case, was unreasonable for the same reasons.\nVavilov cautioned that although a court conducting a reasonableness review is not tasked with determining the correct interpretation of a disputed statutory provision, it may become clear in the course of conducting a judicial review that the relevant constraints bearing on the decision so overwhelmingly favour one interpretation that there is room for only one reasonable interpretation of the provision at issue (para. 124, citing approvingly Nova Tube, at para. 61 (CanLII), per Laskin J.A.). This Court noted that, based on the applicable constraints, a particular outcome may be inevitable (Vavilov, at para. 142). In such a case, while a court should generally pause before definitively pronouncing upon the interpretation of a provision entrusted to an administrative decision maker, it would serve no useful purpose to remit the matter to the original decision maker (para. 124). The Court reached this conclusion not as the starting point of its reasonableness review, but rather as a result of a proper reasonableness review when considering the appropriate remedy.\nThat is also the case here. The relevant legal constraints cumulatively point overwhelmingly to only one reasonable interpretation of s. 34(1)(e)  the provision requires a nexus to national security or the security of Canada. This interpretation is supported by the placement of s. 34(1)(e) amid other security grounds in s. 34, all of which have a link to national security or the security of Canada. And although the IAD noted that some interpretive constraints point in the other direction, the two critical points of statutory context that the IAD failed to consider, and especially, the legal constraints imposed by international law, overwhelmingly support the opposite conclusion: s. 34(1)(e) can be invoked to render a person inadmissible only when their acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada have a nexus with national security or the security of Canada.\nAs a result, the decision of the IAD in Mr. Masons case and of the ID in Mr. Dleiows case were unreasonable and should be quashed. Because the Minister has not alleged that Mr. Mason or Mr. Dleiow engaged in acts of violence with a link to national security or the security of Canada, s. 34(1)(e) of the IRPA does not provide a legal basis for the inadmissibility of either person. And because the Minister has not alleged any other basis for their inadmissibility, there is no need to remit either decision to the ID or IAD for redetermination.\nDisposition\nI would allow the appeals, set aside the judgments of the Federal Court of Appeal and allow the applications for judicial review. In Mr. Masons appeal, I would quash the IAD decision thus restoring the ID decision. In Mr. Dleiows appeal, I would quash the ID decision and deportation order. Since neither appellant requested costs, I would make no order as to costs.\nThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nI agree with my colleagues disposition of these appeals. Inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence and with national security or the security of Canada (see paras. 11 and 121). However, I would review the Immigration Appeal Divisions (IAD) interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) on a standard of correctness, as submitted by the appellant Mr. Earl Mason and the interveners the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers and the Canadian Council for Refugees.\nIn Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, this Court held that reviewing courts should derogate from the presumption of reasonableness review where required by (1) a clear indication of legislative intent or (2) the rule of law (para. 10). In my view, the rule of law requires  and Parliament intended for appellate courts to provide  definitive, correct answers to legal questions certified under s. 74(d) of the IRPA. By definition, these are questions that transcend the interests of the parties and raise issues of broad significance within Canadas immigration and refugee protection scheme (see Lunyamila v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FCA 22, [2018] 3 F.C.R. 674, at para. 46).\nIn Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, this Court noted that the certified question regime would be incoherent if the standard of review were anything other than correctness (para. 43). This is exemplified by the companion appeals before us. The IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) in Mr. Masons case, subsequently applied to Mr. Dleiow, would significantly expand the grounds on which foreign nationals or permanent residents may be deported from Canada. It would allow foreign nationals to be returned to countries where they may face persecution, in a manner contrary to Canadas obligations under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (see Jamal J.s reasons, at paras. 104-17). Parliament did not intend for appellate courts, as the Federal Court of Appeal did in this case, to defer to such interpretations where they may be reasonable, but are nonetheless wrong in law (see Pushpanathan, at para. 43).\nTo be consistent with the principles and framework set out in Vavilov, I would recognize a new category of correctness review: when appellate courts decide a serious question of general importance certified under s. 74(d) of the IRPA.\nAnalysis\nThe Standard of Review for Certified Questions Under the IRPA Is Undecided Post-Vavilov\nPre-Vavilov Jurisprudence\nPrior to Vavilov, this Court was inconsistent in its approach to certified questions. In Pushpanathan, the majority of this Court held that the certified question regime under s. 83(1) of the former Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2  the predecessor to s. 74(d) of the IRPA  would be incoherent if the standard of review were anything other than correctness (para. 43). Writing for the majority, Bastarache J. noted that the only way in which the certification procedure could be given its explicitly articulated scope was if courts were permitted to substitute their own answers for those of the Immigration and Refugee Board in respect of questions of general importance.\nUnder the pre-Vavilov contextual approach, this Court departed from the approach taken in Pushpanathan in some subsequent cases, though not in most. In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, the majority of this Court applied the intermediate standard of review of reasonableness simpliciter, distinguishing Pushpanathan based on the highly discretionary and fact-based nature of the Ministers decision to refuse to exempt the appellant in that case from deportation on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (Baker, at paras. 61-62). Importantly, however, the Court answered the certified question before it definitively:\n\tSimpson J. certified the following as a serious question of general importance under s. 83(1) of the Immigration Act: Given that the Immigration Act does not expressly incorporate the language of Canadas international obligations with respect to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, must federal immigration authorities treat the best interests of the Canadian child as a primary consideration in assessing an applicant under s. 114(2) of the Immigration Act?\n\n. . .\n\n\tThe certified question asks whether the best interests of children must be a primary consideration when assessing an applicant under s. 114(2) and the Regulations. The principles discussed above indicate that, for the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness, the decision-maker should consider childrens best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; paras. 9 and 75.]\nThe Court also applied a standard of review of reasonableness in Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, on the basis that the Ministers decision under the former s. 34(2) of the IRPA was discretionary (para. 50). In Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, the majority of this Court held that the fact that the reviewing judge considered the question to be of general importance was relevant, but not determinative of the standard of review (para. 44). Despite the presence of a certified question, the appropriate standard of review in that case was reasonableness (ibid., citing Baker, at para. 62).\nHowever, as the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers notes in its factum, Agraira and Kanthasamy are outliers. The Court applied a standard of correctness in Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 3, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, at para. 26, and Hilewitz v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 57, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 706, at para. 71. In other cases, the Court gave definitive answers to certified questions of interpretation either without addressing the standard of review (see Ezokola v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 SCC 40, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 678, at paras. 6-9; Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, at paras. 6 and 60) or after finding that it was unnecessary to resolve the issue (B010 v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 704, at paras. 26 and 76; Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289, at paras. 23, 53 and 56).\nRelying on pre-Vavilov authorities, my colleague says that this Court has concluded in the immigration context that the standard of review for certified questions is reasonableness (para. 51, citing Kanthasamy and Baker). With respect, I disagree.\nFirst, this Court did not endorse or even cite Kanthasamy in Vavilov. It relied on Baker in Vavilov, but for reasons unrelated to the determination of the standard of review.\nSecond, prior to Vavilov, this Court consistently provided definitive answers to certified questions of statutory interpretation (see, e.g., Pushpanathan, at paras. 75-76; Baker, at para. 75; Chieu, at para. 90; Ezokola, at paras. 6-9; Febles, at para. 60; Hilewitz, at para. 71; B010, at para. 76; Tran, at para. 56; see also Vavilov v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FCA 132, [2018] 3 F.C.R. 75, at para. 37; Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FCA 113, [2015] 1 F.C.R. 335, at para. 33). In Kanthasamy, the majority of this Court arguably did the same. Indeed, prior to considering the standard of review, Abella J., who wrote the majority reasons, engaged in a lengthy interpretive exercise with respect to s. 25(1) of the IRPA (see paras. 10-41). In dissent, Moldaver J. (Wagner J. (as he then was) concurring) lamented that the majority had adopted a do as we say, not what we do approach to reasonableness review:\n\tIn particular, I am concerned that my colleague has not given the Officers reasons the deference which, time and again, this Court has said they deserve. In her reasons, she parses the Officers decision for legal errors, resolves ambiguities against the Officer, and reweighs the evidence. Lest we be accused of adopting a do as we say, not what we do approach to reasonableness review, this approach fails to heed the admonition in Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses  that reviewing courts must be cautious about substituting their own view of the proper outcome by designating certain omissions in the reasons to be fatal (para. 17). As is the case with every other court, this Court has no licence to find an officers decision unreasonable simply because it considers the result unpalatable and would itself have come to a different result. [Emphasis added; para. 112.]\nFollowing Kanthasamy, a unanimous Court held in Tran that an administrative interpretation of the serious criminality provisions set out in s. 36(1)(a) of the IRPA could not stand under either standard of review (para. 23). The Court did not endorse or cite Kanthasamy and, again, provided definitive answers to the two questions of general importance certified by the Federal Court:\nIs a conditional sentence of imprisonment imposed pursuant to the regime set out in ss. 742 to 742.7 of the Criminal Code a term of imprisonment under s. 36(1)(a) of the IRPA?\n\n\tNo.\n\n2.\tDoes the phrase punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years in s. 36(1)(a) of the IRPA refer to the maximum term of imprisonment available at the time the person was sentenced or to the maximum term of imprisonment under the law in force at the time admissibility is determined?\n\n\t\tIt refers to the maximum term of imprisonment available at the time of the commission of the offence. [para. 56]\nIn sum, the weight of authority confirms that prior to Vavilov, this Court repeatedly answered certified questions definitively and without deference to administrative decision makers. I therefore disagree that, [a]s a matter of precedent, reasonableness review applies (Jamal J.s reasons, at para. 51).\nIn any event, Vavilov overtook prior jurisprudence (para. 143; see Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Entertainment Software Association, 2022 SCC 30, at para. 25). The jurisprudence discussed above must be analyzed in light of the principles and framework set out in Vavilov.\nVavilov\nIn Vavilov, this Court recognized five categories of correctness review, based on either legislative intent (legislated standards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms) or the rule of law (constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions regarding jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies) (paras. 17 and 69). However, it was expressly stated in Vavilov that the categories of correctness review are not closed (para. 70). And indeed, in Society of Composers, this Court recognized a new category: . . . when courts and administrative bodies have concurrent first instance jurisdiction over a legal issue in a statute. Applying correctness to these issues accords with legislative intent and promotes the rule of law (para. 28).\nThe issue in Vavilov reached the Federal Court of Appeal by way of a certified question under s. 22.2(d) of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29. The Federal Court of Appeal provided a definitive answer to that question:\n\tThe proper stated question and my proposed answer to it are as follows:\n\nQuestion: Are the words other representative or employee [in Canada] of a foreign government found in paragraph 3(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act limited to foreign nationals [falling within these words] who [also] benefit from diplomatic privileges and immunities?\n\nAnswer: Yes. [para. 90]\nThis Court upheld the Federal Court of Appeals decision quashing the Registrar of Citizenships decision to cancel Mr. Vavilovs citizenship certificate (para. 194). The majority of the Court concluded that Mr. Vavilovs status was governed by s. 3(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act and that he was a Canadian citizen (para. 196).\nWhile I acknowledge that our Court applied a standard of review of reasonableness to the Registrars decision, I would not read Vavilov as decisive of the standard of review for certified questions under the IRPA moving forward. Let me explain.\nFirst, this Court did not discuss the issue of certified questions in Vavilov. As noted in Society of Composers, when this Court wanted to reject the possibility of a certain correctness category, it did so expressly (para. 42, citing Vavilov, at paras. 71-72). In my view, the standard of review for certified questions  certainly in the unique context of the IRPA, as explained below  remains an open question post-Vavilov.\nI would note that the Federal Court of Appeal does not view Vavilov as dispositive on this point. To the contrary, in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Galindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50, 468 D.L.R. (4th) 358, the court noted that correctness review of certified questions would seem to gain greater credence now that the Supreme Court has held that statutory standards can have a bearing on the standard of review (para. 41 (emphasis added)). Writing for the court, Mactavish J.A. observed that in Vavilov itself, the Federal Court of Appeal gave a precise answer, akin to a correctness review answer, to the certified question before it, an approach that this Court effectively ratified in dismissing the appeal (para. 43). The Federal Court of Appeal in Galindo Camayo appears to have applied a standard of reasonableness based on Kanthasamy, not Vavilov (see para. 42).\nSecond, the certified question in Vavilov arose under different legislation, the Citizenship Act. In the separate and unique context of the IRPA, multiple different ministers, government departments, and agencies, as well as Canadas largest administrative tribunal (the Immigration and Refugee Board) are charged with independently administering the statutory scheme. In many cases, these separate decision makers are required to interpret the same statutory provisions. While it is beyond the scope of these appeals to exhaustively canvass the scheme of the Citizenship Act, the statutory certification process has been widely used under the IRPA to settle divergent interpretations or disagreements on legal issues of general importance (see Huruglica v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 93, [2016] 4 F.C.R. 157, at para. 28).\nFinally, to say that Vavilov is determinative and that the standard of review for certified questions is reasonableness would contradict the Vavilov framework itself. As I explain below, reasonableness review of certified questions under the IRPA is inconsistent with both Parliaments intent and the rule of law.\nCertified Questions Under the IRPA Should Be Recognized as a New Category of Correctness Review\nLegislative Intent\nIn s. 74(d) of the IRPA, Parliament has provided for an exceptional appeal (see Pushpanathan, at para. 43) to the Federal Court of Appeal for legal questions certified as serious question[s] of general importance. This indicates legislative intent for judicial involvement and a desire to subject these particular questions, as distinct from all others arising under the IRPA more broadly, to appellate standards of review (see Society of Composers, at para. 30; Vavilov, at para. 36). Parliaments institutional design choice should be respected by the courts.\nI do not dispute that s. 74(d) provides for statutory appeals following judicial review decisions. If Parliament had provided for statutory appeals from administrative decisions directly, certified questions would fit within the existing Vavilov category. Nonetheless, as this Court noted in Society of Composers, the presumption of reasonableness review no longer applies where the legislature expressly involves the court in the administrative scheme:\n\tReasonableness is the standard of review that, in most instances, gives best effect to legislative intent. When the legislature has granted exclusive jurisdiction to an administrative decision maker, courts presume that the legislature wanted that decision maker to operate without undue judicial interference: Vavilov, at para. 24.\n\n\tWhen the legislature expressly involves the court in the administrative scheme, this presumption no longer applies. That is why legislated standards of review and statutory appeal mechanisms give rise to a correctness standard of review. Such statutory features indicate legislative intent for judicial involvement and a desire to subject those decisions to appellate standards of review: Vavilov, at para. 36. [Emphasis added; paras. 29-30.]\nAs my colleague acknowledges, the certified question regime under the IRPA is a statutory mechanism through which an appeal is provided for in certain circumstances, i.e. based on the nature and importance of the legal question at issue (para. 9). Through s. 74(d), Parliament does not exclude the courts but rather makes them part of the enforcement machinery in certain circumstances (Vavilov, at para. 36, citing Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology v. Bhadauria, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 181, at p. 195). In my view, this strongly rebuts the presumption of reasonableness review for this particular type of legal question, in a manner analogous to the existing categories of correctness review.\nPrior to Vavilov, the Federal Court of Appeal also adopted the practice of providing the definitive answer to a certified question on a point of statutory interpretation (see Kanthasamy, at para. 35). This is consistent with Parliaments express intent for appellate courts to decide certified questions. In Pushpanathan, this Court discussed Parliaments intent as follows:\n\tFirst, s. 83(1) would be incoherent if the standard of review were anything other than correctness. The key to the legislative intention as to the standard of review is the use of the words a serious question of general importance . . . . The general importance of the question, that is, its applicability to numerous future cases, warrants the review by a court of justice. Would that review serve any purpose if the Court of Appeal were obliged to defer to incorrect decisions of the Board? Is it possible that the legislator would have provided for an exceptional appeal to the Court of Appeal on questions of general importance, but then required that despite the general importance of the question, the court accept decisions of the Board which are wrong in law, even clearly wrong in law, but not patently unreasonable? [Emphasis in original; para. 43.]\nThe Court then noted that, for the certified question regime to be given its explicitly legislated scope, appellate courts must be able to answer them correctly:\nThe only way in which s. 83(1) can be given its explicitly articulated scope is if the Court of Appeal  and inferentially, the Federal Court, Trial Division  is permitted to substitute its own opinion for that of the Board in respect of questions of general importance. [Emphasis added; para. 43.]\nI could not agree more. For serious questions of general importance arising under the IRPA, Parliament did not intend courts to be forced to defer to administrative decisions that may be reasonable, but are wrong in law. As with s. 83(1) of the former Immigration Act, the only way s. 74(d) of the IRPA can be given its explicitly legislated scope is if appellate courts are permitted to substitute their own opinion in respect of serious questions of general importance.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal has struggled with this exact issue since Vavilov. In Galindo Camayo, Mactavish J.A. lamented the misfit between answering [a] certified question properly and conducting reasonableness review (para. 41):\n\tHowever, the fact that we have certified questions before us gives rise to an awkward situation. Certified questions generally raise questions of law, including, as in this case, questions of statutory interpretation. However, the questions, as phrased by the Federal Court, require a yes or no answer. This invites correctness review by this Court. That said, as described above, this Court is required to engage in reasonableness review on questions of statutory interpretation. This creates the possibility that, in some cases, this Court may find the [Refugee Protection Divisions] interpretation of a statutory provision to be reasonable, yet this Court may say something entirely different in providing its own view of the matter in answering the certified question  something that the Supreme Court expressly tells us not to do . . . . [Emphasis added; para. 40.]\nThe courts solution to this problem in Galindo Camayo was to reformulate the certified question to ask whether a particular statutory interpretation was reasonable:\nIn this case, the second and third questions, as stated, call for a correctness response. I would therefore amend them to ask whether the particular statutory interpretation or approach suggested by the question is or is not reasonable. [Emphasis added; para. 44.]\nThis is also what the Federal Court did in Mr. Masons case, in an attempt to incorporate reasonableness as the applicable standard of review:\n\tThe parties, however, each proposed their version of the question referring to the correctness of the IADs interpretation. I thus rephrase the question as follows, incorporating reasonableness as the applicable standard of review:\n\nIs it reasonable to interpret section 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, in a manner that does not require proof of conduct that has a nexus with national security or the security of Canada?\n\n(2019 FC 1251, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 3, at para. 70)\nIn my view, this clearly distorts Parliaments intent in s. 74(d). I do not accept that Parliament intended courts to reformulate certified questions, rather than answering them correctly. Where appellate courts conclude that there is only one reasonable interpretation of a disputed statutory provision, I struggle to see any meaningful difference between that interpretation and the correct interpretation of the statutory provision in question. Where there may be multiple reasonable interpretations, appellate courts are faced with the prospect of upholding decisions that incorrectly determine questions of law  for example, the impact of Canadas international law obligations on the interpretation of certain sections of the IRPA (see Jamal J.s reasons, at para. 117).\nIn this case, the IADs failure to consider this issue at all may have been unreasonable (see Jamal J.s reasons, at para. 117). But what if the IAD had considered the issue and reached a reasonable, though incorrect, conclusion? As Bastarache J. warned in Pushpanathan, appellate courts applying reasonableness review would be forced to defer to that decision. In this case, it would result in the deportation of Mr. Mason and Mr. Dleiow from Canada. In future cases, it could result in foreign nationals being returned to countries where they may face persecution, in a manner contrary to Canadas non-refoulement obligations (Jamal J.s reasons, at paras. 104 and 109).\nIn my view, this is untenable, and contrary to Parliaments express intent for serious questions of general importance certified under s. 74(d) of the IRPA to be reviewed and determined by appellate courts.\nThe Rule of Law\nThe presumption of reasonableness review must also give way to the importance of maintaining the rule of law, which requires that certified questions be answered consistently and definitively (see Society of Composers, at para. 33; Vavilov, at para. 53). I say this for two reasons.\nThe Risk of Arbitrariness Is Unacceptable in This Context\nFirst, the rule of law demands a singular, determinate and final answer (Vavilov, at para. 32) to a question certified as a serious question of general importance under the IRPA. In Lunyamila, the Federal Court of Appeal reiterated the criteria for certification under s. 74(d):\nThe question must be a serious question that is dispositive of the appeal, transcends the interests of the parties and raises an issue of broad significance or general importance. [Emphasis added; para. 46.]\n(See also Canada (Immigration and Citizenship) v. Laing, 2021 FCA 194, at para. 11 (CanLII); Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. XY, 2022 FCA 113, 89 Imm. L.R. (4th) 173, at para. 7).\nA question whose answer turns on the unique facts of the case will not be certified (Lunyamila, at para. 46, citing Mudrak v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 178, 43 Imm. L.R. (4th) 199). By definition, then, certified questions concern issues of broad significance or general importance within Canadas immigration and refugee protection regime. In my view, these are exactly the types of questions for which the rule of law demands consistent and definitive answers  and for which the risk of arbitrariness is unacceptable.\nIn Vavilov, our Court accepted that legal incoherence is antithetical to the rule of law (para. 72). While the Court rejected persistent discord within an administrative body as a standalone category of correctness review, this was based on the ability of a more robust form of reasonableness to guard against the risk of arbitrariness:\nWe are not persuaded that the Court should recognize a distinct correctness category for legal questions on which there is persistent discord within an administrative body. In Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission dappel en matiere de lesions professionnelles), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 756, this Court held that a lack of unanimity [within a tribunal] is the price to pay for the decision-making freedom and independence given to the members of these tribunals: p. 800; see also Ellis-Don Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board), 2001 SCC 4, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 221, at para. 28. That said, we agree that the hypothetical scenario suggested by the amici curiae  in which the laws meaning depends on the identity of the individual decision maker, thereby leading to legal incoherence  is antithetical to the rule of law. In our view, however, the more robust form of reasonableness review set out below, which accounts for the value of consistency and the threat of arbitrariness, is capable, in tandem with internal administrative processes to promote consistency and with legislative oversight (see Domtar, at p. 801), of guarding against threats to the rule of law. [Emphasis added; para. 72.]\nThere are two issues with even a robust form of reasonableness review in the context of certified questions. First, the internal administrative processes referenced in Vavilov, in this context, depend on appellate courts resolving disagreements on legal issues of general importance. As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Huruglica, this process has been welcomed by the IAD and the Refugee Protection Division (RPD):\n. . . for many years, the Federal Court resorted to the certification process under paragraph 74(d) to settle divergent interpretations or disagreements on legal issues of general importance. This Courts providing the correct answer to certified questions appears to have been welcomed, particularly by the IAD and the RPD, who saw it as helpful in carrying out their functions. [Emphasis added; para. 28.]\nIn other words, the certified question process is the very way in which internal disputes are resolved within this administrative scheme, for a specific subset of legal questions. This category of questions may be defined with precision (see Society of Composers, at para. 39). As Paul Daly notes, the unique features of [Canadas] immigration regime could allow for correctness review where questions have been certified without having unfortunate consequences in other areas of law (Certified Questions, References and Reasonableness: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Galindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50, April 8, 2022 (online)). In the immigration context, the certified question procedure is tailor-made to achieve correctness review on questions of law (ibid.).\nSecond, the risk of arbitrariness may be acceptable in the context of decisions regarding the extent of an income replacement indemnity during a temporary plant closure (as in Domtar Inc. v. Quebec (Commission dappel en matiere de lesions professionnelles), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 756) or alleged violations of a provincial collective agreement (as in Ellis-Don Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board), 2001 SCC 4, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 221) to use the two examples referred to in Vavilov (para. 72). It is not acceptable when the identity of the individual decision maker is what determines who is permitted to remain in Canada, as in these companion appeals, or in the context of other serious questions of general importance under the IRPA.\nA number of scholars and several interveners in these appeals emphasize the fundamental importance of certified questions, the potential consequences for affected individuals, and the corresponding need for courts to provide correct and definitive answers in this context (see, e.g., J. C. Y. Liew, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: A Preliminary Assessment of Whether the Vavilov Framework Adequately Addresses Concerns of Marginalized Communities in the Immigration Law Context (2020), 98 Can. Bar Rev. 398, at p. 425; G. Heckman and A. Khoday, Once More unto the Breach: Confronting the Standard of Review (Again) and the Imperative of Correctness Review when Interpreting the Scope of Refugee Protection (2019), 42 Dal. L.J. 49, at pp. 62-68 and 82; I.F., Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, at paras. 20-21; I.F., Canadian Council for Refugees, at paras. 14-20; I.F., United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, at paras. 21-24). I agree with my colleague that the potential consequences of a decision are relevant to the substance of reasonableness review (see para. 69). But those consequences are also relevant to the determination of the standard of review, and to the imperative of providing legally correct answers in certain circumstances.\nAs Professors Heckman and Khoday note, where different decision makers adopt different interpretations of the scope of refugee protection under the IRPA, one claimant may receive protection while another presenting an identical claim may be returned to their country of origin to face persecution. Given the momentous impact of these decisions, the existence of divergent interpretations of these key provisions is arbitrary and antithetical to the rule of law, which demands that the inconsistencies be immediately resolved through correctness review (p. 68).\nRelatedly, correctness review serves to ease the burden on lay applicants, many of whom will be facing life-changing immigration consequences. The reasonableness of an administrative decision depends, in large part, on the evidence before the decision maker and the submissions made by the parties (Vavilov, at para. 94; see Jamal J.s reasons, at para. 61). Not all immigration or refugee applicants will have the resources or knowledge to make sophisticated contextual and interpretive arguments. In the context of certified questions, even a robust form of reasonableness review may be insufficient to guard against the risk, and the consequences, of arbitrariness (see Vavilov, at para. 192).\nWhile not all certified questions concern issues of admissibility or deportation, I am satisfied that the rule of law nonetheless demands consistent and definitive answers to all questions that are properly certified. I am unable to tolerate the risk of arbitrariness in this context.\nConsequences for the Justice System as a Whole or Other Institutions of Government\nSecond, questions certified under s. 74(d) will, by definition, have implications beyond the immediate parties. In addition to their potential impacts on Canadas international obligations, they may have impacts on criminal law or on other legislation.\nFor example, the Citizenship Act allows the Minister to commence an action, i.e., in the Federal Court, to have a person declared inadmissible on security grounds, on grounds of violating human or international rights or on grounds of organized criminality under s. 34, 35, or 37 of the IRPA:\nInadmissibility\n\n10.5 (1) On the request of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the Minister shall  in the originating document that commences an action under subsection 10.1(1) on the basis that the person obtained, retained, renounced or resumed his or her citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances, with respect to a fact described in section 34, 35 or 37 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act other than a fact that is also described in paragraph 36(1)(a) or (b) or (2)(a) or (b) of that Act  seek a declaration that the person who is the subject of the action is inadmissible on security grounds, on grounds of violating human or international rights or on grounds of organized criminality under, respectively, subsection 34(1), paragraph 35(1)(a) or (b) or subsection 37(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.\nThe effect of s. 10.5(1) of the Citizenship Act is therefore to create a form of shared jurisdiction between courts and administrative decision makers over inadmissibility on grounds of security (s. 34), human or international rights violations (s. 35), or organized criminality (s. 37). The implications of this were not argued by the parties in these appeals, including in light of the new category of correctness review recognized by this Court in Society of Composers. However, it is clear that a determination of inadmissibility under s. 34, 35, or 37  as distinct from inadmissibility on grounds of criminality (s. 36) or other less serious grounds set out in ss. 38 to 41  has effects beyond the IRPA. Reasonableness review does not adequately safeguard against the need for consistency and legal coherence in this context.\nFurther, as this Court held in Vavilov, certain issues require a high degree of interpretive consistency to ensure conformity with Canadas international obligations (para. 192). While neither Mr. Mason nor Mr. Dleiow is a Convention refugee, the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) could foreseeably impact Canadas future compliance with its non-refoulement obligations (see Jamal J.s reasons, at paras. 104-17). My colleague views the IADs fail[ure] to address the legal constraints imposed by international law as unreasonable (para. 104). With respect, I would have concerns, given the emphasis in Vavilov on a reasons first approach, with finding a decision to be unreasonable based on arguments that were not put before the administrative decision maker and that do not apply to the individuals actually before that decision maker. Correctness review of certified questions eliminates such concerns and ensures respect for Canadas international and treaty obligations.\nThe answers to certified questions under the IRPA may also have impacts on criminal law (see, e.g., Tran, at paras. 39-42). In such situations, a lack of clarity on the scope of inadmissibility under s. 34 may prevent accused persons from making informed decisions about whether to enter into a plea agreement. As Wagner J. (as he then was) noted in R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696 (dissenting, but not on this point),\n[c]ollateral consequences that affect the accused persons fundamental interests could have a more significant impact on the accused than the criminal sanction itself. As a result, it may be essential for an accused to be aware of such consequences in order to enter an informed guilty plea. This is particularly true in the immigration context, in which an accused may be exposed to a collateral consequence as serious as deportation. People who are to be deported may experience any number of serious life-changing consequences. They may be forced to leave a country they have called home for decades. They may return to a country where they no longer have any personal connections, or even speak the language, if they emigrated as children. If they have family in Canada, they and their family members face dislocation or permanent separation. [para. 72]\nIn sum, certified questions tend to have significant consequences for the justice system as a whole or for other institutions of government (Vavilov, at para. 59). In many cases, this will arguably place them within the existing category of general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. If not, the combined effect of their broader significance and Parliaments intent that they be decided by appellate courts justifies a departure from the presumption of reasonableness review.\nTo be clear, this conclusion would not change the standard of review applicable to the vast majority of administrative decisions under the IRPA. Decisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board, as well as those made by various ministers, government departments, and agencies, would continue to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness in most cases. It is only a small and distinct subset of legal questions  those certified as raising issues of broad significance or general importance within the statutory scheme  for which the rule of law, in addition to Parliaments intent, mandates correctness review.\nApplication\nApplying a standard of review of correctness, I agree with my colleague that inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence and with national security or the security of Canada (para. 121). Together with the reasons he identifies, I would briefly emphasize the following points of statutory context.\nFirst, the governments own explanation of the IRPA describes s. 34 as a national security provision:\nThis provision makes a person inadmissible to Canada for reasons of national security, including espionage, subversion, and terrorism. This provision clearly states that permanent residents and foreign nationals are inadmissible on security grounds for engaging in terrorism or for being a member of an organization that engages in terrorism. The facts that constitute inadmissibility under this provision include facts arising from omissions and those for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur. Other inadmissible grounds relating to security include being a danger to the security of Canada and engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Bill C-11: Clause by Clause Analysis (September 2001), at pp. 31-32)\nSecond, the serious nature of inadmissibility on security grounds (see Jamal J.s reasons, at paras. 86-97) is reinforced by several additional distinctions in the statutory scheme. Under s. 36(1), both foreign nationals and permanent residents may be inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality. However, only foreign nationals may be inadmissible on grounds of criminality (s. 36(2)). The difference between criminality and serious criminality, for offences committed in Canada, is that serious criminality requires a conviction for an offence punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years or for an offence for which a sentence of more than 6 months imprisonment has been imposed (s. 36(1)(a)). A permanent resident convicted of an offence falling short of these requirements cannot be found inadmissible under s. 36(2).\nThe IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) eliminates this carefully legislated distinction. A permanent resident who is charged with an act of violence that would not qualify as serious criminality under s. 36(1) could instead be found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e), even if the alleged act did not result in a conviction.\nFurther, s. 64(1) of the IRPA denies a right of appeal to permanent residents or foreign nationals found inadmissible on grounds of security under s. 34, among other serious categories of inadmissibility:\nNo appeal for inadmissibility\n\n64 (1) No appeal may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security [(s. 34)], violating human or international rights [(s. 35)], serious criminality [(s. 36(1))] or organized criminality [(s. 37)].\nThus, a foreign national convicted of assault, an act of violence, and found inadmissible by the Immigration Division (ID) on grounds of criminality under s. 36(2) may appeal that finding to the IAD. If the same conduct could ground inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e)  as the IAD held in this case  the foreign national would lose the ability to appeal. That person would be better off being convicted, and found inadmissible under s. 36(2), than if their charges were dropped or stayed and they were instead found inadmissible under s. 34(1)(e).\nClearly, there is potential overlap between acts of violence contemplated in s. 34(1)(e) and criminality addressed in s. 36. The implication of the respective treatment of these sections throughout the IRPA is that inadmissibility on security grounds, under s. 34, is more serious than inadmissibility on grounds of criminality. As Grammond J. noted in Mr. Masons case, the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) brings under the most severe category of inadmissibility a vast range of conduct that includes acts that are below the thresholds set by section 36 (F.C. reasons, Mason, at para. 50). Given the careful wording of s. 36, this cannot have been Parliaments intention.\nThird, I would return to s. 10.5(1) of the Citizenship Act, which also distinguishes between facts described in ss. 34, 35, and 37 of the IRPA and those described in s. 36. This, too, reinforces the fact that inadmissibility under s. 34 is considered among the gravest forms of inadmissibility and that the section should be interpreted as applying only to acts of violence with a nexus to national security.\nThis conclusion is consistent with the only prior interpretations of s. 34(1)(e) and its predecessor, s. 19(1)(g) of the Immigration Act. In X (Re), 2017 CanLII 146735 (I.R.B. (Imm. Div.)), Member King held that a series of common assaults could not ground inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e):\n\tI conclude that paragraph 34(1)(e) cannot be interpreted to include the type of one-on-one violent acts that exist in this case. While assaults against individuals are undesirable, they cannot be considered to be a threat to the safety of persons in Canada and the security of Canadian society, as contemplated by this section of the IRPA. [para. 42]\nMember King also distinguished the circumstances in X (Re) from those before the Federal Court in Moumdjian v. Canada (Security Intelligence Review Committee), [1999] 4 F.C. 624 (C.A.), which were more obviously related to the security of Canada and dealt with a conspiracy to assassinate a Turkish diplomat in Canada (paras. 77-78; see also Al Yamani v. Canada (Solicitor General), [1996] 1 F.C. 174 (T.D.)).\nFor these reasons, in addition to those identified by my colleague and by Grammond J. in the Federal Court, I would conclude that inadmissibility under s. 34(1)(e) requires a nexus between the relevant act of violence and with national security or the security of Canada. However, it remains the task of administrative decision makers under the IRPA to apply this interpretation going forward, including determining which acts of violence may indeed qualify as a threat to national security or the security of Canada.\nConclusion\nThis Court has made it clear that the focus of reasonableness review is on the decision the administrative decision maker actually made, not on the conclusion the court would have reached in the decision makers place (Vavilov, at para. 15; see Jamal J.s reasons, at para. 8). Yet in the context of certified questions under the IRPA, this Court has repeatedly provided definitive, correct answers to disputed questions of statutory interpretation, including when applying a reasonableness standard of review.\nMy colleague does so again in this case. While I agree that the IADs interpretation of s. 34(1)(e) was unreasonable, I do not accept that Parliament intended for courts to defer to reasonable but legally incorrect answers to this or other certified questions. Invariably, these questions transcend the interests of the parties and raise issues of broad significance and general importance within Canadas immigration and refugee protection regime. These are the exact types of questions for which the rule of law demands  and Parliament expressly intended for appellate courts to provide  correct answers (see Vavilov, at paras. 10 and 69-70). As required by the principles and framework set out in Vavilov, I would recognize certified questions under the IRPA as a new category of correctness review moving forward.\nDisposition\nIn the result, I agree with my colleagues disposition (para. 123). I would allow the appeals, set aside the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal and allow the applications for judicial review. In Mr. Masons appeal, I would quash the IAD decision thus restoring the ID decision. In Mr. Dleiows appeal, I would quash the ID decision and deportation order.\n\tAppeals allowed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant Earl Mason: Edelmann & Company Law Corporation, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant Seifeslam Dleiow: Robert J.

Seifeslam Dleiow was accused of engaging in acts of violence against intimate partners and other persons. The Immigration Division (ID) initially found Mason not to be a threat to national security; however, the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) overturned this decision. The ID followed suit in Dleiow's case, finding him inadmissible under section 34(1)(e). \n\nThe court process commenced with administrative proceedings before the ID, followed by an appeal before the IAD. Both appellants applied for judicial review at the Federal Court, which allowed their applications but certified a serious question for appeal: Is it reasonable to interpret section 34(1)(e) without requiring proof of conduct having a nexus with national security or public safety? On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the Minister's appeals. However, upon further appeal by Mason and Dleiow to the Supreme Court of Canada, it was held that while reasonableness is generally applicable as a standard for reviewing administrative decisions involving questions of statutory interpretation in immigration contexts except when certified questions are involved where correctness should apply.\n\nA person can only be found inadmissible under section 34(1)(e) if they engage in acts with consequences that impact or could potentially impact either national security or public safety within Canada.\n\nWriting for the majority, Jamal J holds that although reasonableness is generally applicable as a standard for reviewing administrative decisions involving questions of statutory interpretation within immigration contexts except when certified questions are involved where correctness should apply; however none such exceptions were present here so reasonableness applied instead - concluding that these particular administrative decisions were unreasonable due failure consider significant legal constraints including international law obligations like principle non-refoulement Refugee Convention allowing appeals quashing those administrative decisions ultimately holding s.34(e)'s requirements necessitate nexus between act violence & either nationalsecurity/publicsafety", "citation": "2023 SCC 21", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court quashes  immigration decisions that found two foreign nationals inadmissible to Canada. \u00a0\u00a0<em>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</em></strong>"}, "14": {"original_text": "\n\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\nEmanuel Kahsai\tAppellant\nv.\nHis Majesty The King\tRespondent\nand\nDirector of Public Prosecutions,\nAttorney General of Ontario,\nEmpowerment Council,\nIndependent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society,\nCriminal Trial Lawyers Association,\nCanadian Civil Liberties Association and\nCriminal Lawyers Association\tInterveners\nIndexed as: R. v.

When given the opportunity to address the court, K failed to cooperate with the trial process or advance any coherent defence. He was repeatedly excluded from the courtroom and trial process because of his chronically disruptive behavior. Partway through the trial, the trial judge determined that the appointment of amicus curiae was necessary to ensure a fair trial. An amicus was appointed to cross-examine Crown witnesses, but was instructed not to advocate on behalf of the defence. K resisted the appointment and mostly refused to cooperate with the amicus. Ks attempt to deliver his own closing argument was cut short by the trial judge, who did not solicit any supplementary closing argument from trial amicus. K was convicted by a jury on both counts of first degree murder. He appealed his convictions, arguing, among other grounds, that failing to appoint amicus with an adversarial role at an early stage in the proceedings tainted the perceived fairness of the trial. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding there was no miscarriage of justice.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tNo miscarriage of justice arose. There is no doubt there was a striking imbalance in this trial. K was unrepresented and often excluded from participating in the proceeding. When he did participate, he advanced no meaningful defence. Although an amicus assisted at trial, more preparation time and a broader adversarial role could have enhanced his ability to advance the interests of the accused. That said, the law imposes a high standard for proving a miscarriage of justice. Any irregularity arising from the amicus appointment in this case does not rise to the level of a miscarriage of justice.\n\tThe power to appoint amicus curiae flows from the inherent jurisdiction of courts to manage their own procedure to ensure a fair trial. In specific and exceptional circumstances, a judge may appoint amicus when the judge believes doing so is required for the just adjudication of a case. The role of amicus is highly adaptable and can encompass a broad spectrum of functions, including adversarial functions. However, the role is not without limits, as there are dangers that arise from blending the roles of defence counsel and amicus. The court may not appoint amicus with functions that would interfere with the right of the accused to represent themselves or undermine the duty of loyalty that an amicus owes to the court. Similarly, an amicus may not perform functions that would undermine the impartiality of the court, a provincial legal aid scheme or a judicial decision to refuse to grant state-funded counsel to the accused. These dangers preclude appointing amicus to assume all of the powers and duties of defence counsel, but they do not impose a bar on appointing amicus with defence-like functions when an adversarial perspective is needed to ensure a fair trial.\n\tThe discretion to appoint amicus and to determine their mandate is informed by the nature of Canadas adversarial system of justice. The adversarial system depends on the ability of parties to advance their own position and to challenge the case presented by an opposing party. A risk of imbalance is particularly acute when an accused is unrepresented. In the vast majority of cases, the duty of the trial judge and Crown counsel to ensure a fair trial for an unrepresented accused will suffice to prevent a miscarriage of justice. However, appointing amicus with adversarial functions may be required in unusual cases, including when an unrepresented accused displays symptoms of mental health challenges but is fit to stand trial or where the unrepresented accused refuses to participate in the trial process. Where assistance from the trial judge and the Crown may not suffice, amicus can be a flexible tool to maintain the integrity of the trial process.\n\tThe trial judge is best positioned to determine what help is required and has wide discretion to tailor the amicus appointment to the exigencies of a case. Exceptionally, appointing amicus with an adversarial mandate may be necessary, particularly when imbalance in the adversarial process threatens to create a miscarriage of justice. In determining the scope of an amicus appointment, the trial judge should consider the circumstances of the trial as a whole, including the nature and complexity of the charges; whether it is a jury trial or judge alone; the attributes of the accused; whether assistance is needed to test the Crowns case or advance a meaningful defence; and what assistance the Crown and trial judge can provide. The judge should canvass the parties for their perspectives about an amicus appointment and should consider whether a limited appointment would suffice. The trial judge should consider whether the mandate assigned to an amicus will make a confidentiality order necessary for the amicus to effectively discharge their role.\n\tIn the instant case, K has not shown that the amicus appointment in his trial created an irregularity so severe that it rendered the trial unfair in fact or in appearance. Although it was open to the trial judge to have instructed amicus to assume a more partial role, the trial judge was under no obligation to do so. Moreover, it is not clear the trial judge would have mandated a broader adversarial role for amicus given the strenuous objections of the accused. There were many troubling aspects to the trial, but the amicus appointment did not create an irregularity so severe that it would shake the public confidence in the administration of justice. The trial judge was managing an exceedingly difficult trial and took many steps to ensure trial fairness, including enlisting the help of amicus. He appointed amicus with a limited mandate in the context of an accused who repeatedly insisted on representing himself without interference, reflecting respect for Ks right to conduct his own defence. This was a highly discretionary decision made in balancing the entire circumstances of the proceeding. In any event, it is not obvious that appointing amicus earlier or with a broader mandate would have provided much value for K given that he resisted the appointment and refused to cooperate with amicus throughout trial. A reasonable member of the public, considering the circumstances of the trial as a whole, would not find that a miscarriage of justice occurred.\nCases Cited\n\tReferred to: Ontario v.

When an unrepresented accused seems unable to advance a competent defence, does the guarantee of trial fairness permit or require the trial judge to appoint amicus with an adversarial mandate to advance the interests of the defence?\nThis appeal invites us to define the limits to the role of amicus. It also presents an opportunity to clarify and affirm the principles established by this Court in Ontario v. Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario, 2013 SCC 43, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 3 (CLAO). As I will explain, in exceptional circumstances, the trial judge retains wide discretion to appoint amicus with adversarial functions that can respond to the needs of a particular case. In tailoring the role for amicus, the judge must respect both the right of the accused to conduct their own defence and the right to a fair trial. These principles of fundamental justice, along with the nature of the role, help define the assistance that amicus can provide. While the role of amicus therefore has limits, the scope is broad enough to assist the judge where necessary to ensure a fair trial.\nWe must also determine whether a miscarriage of justice arose from the circumstances of Mr. Kahsais trial: Did the delayed and limited appointment of amicus create an appearance of unfairness so serious that it taints the administration of justice?\nThere is no doubt there was a striking imbalance in this trial. Mr. Kahsai was unrepresented and often excluded from participating in the proceeding because of his disruptive behavior. When he did participate, he advanced no meaningful defence. Although amicus assisted with cross-examination of Crown witnesses and submissions to the court, more preparation time and a broader adversarial role could have enhanced his ability to advance the interests of the accused.\nThat said, the law imposes a high standard for proving a miscarriage of justice. The inquiry must consider the circumstances of the trial as a whole. Here, the trial judge faced the difficult task of managing a jury trial that Mr. Kahsai seemed determined to derail. Once it became obvious that Mr. Kahsai would not cooperate with the court or advance any viable defence, the trial judge took several measures to preserve trial fairness and restore balance to the proceeding. This included the appointment of an amicus. Although the trial judge seems to have held the view that amicus could not play a more adversarial role, it is not clear that he would have granted a broader mandate in the circumstances, particularly given Mr. Kahsais objections to the appointment of the amicus, and he was under no obligation to do so. Any irregularity does not result in a miscarriage of justice. I would dismiss the appeal.\nBackground\nSelmawit Alem and Tam Julie Tran were found dead in their Calgary home on October 19, 2015. At the time of their death, Ms. Alem was 54 years old and Ms. Tran was 25 years old. Ms. Alem was the biological mother of the accused, Emanuel Kahsai. She lived with Ms. Tran, working as her primary caretaker. Ms. Tran required care because of serious developmental challenges. She had no relation to Mr. Kahsai.\nBoth victims sustained multiple stab wounds to their face, neck and abdomen, along with blunt-force injuries to the face.\nMr. Kahsai emerged as the primary suspect. Evidence led by the Crown suggested that he had a history of threatening to kill his mother. Ms. Alem sought and obtained an emergency protection order against her son in June 2015 and then again in September 2015, which was still in place at the time of her death.\nThe Crowns theory of the case was that Mr. Kahsai targeted his mother out of personal animus. On this theory, he only killed Ms. Tran to eliminate her as an eyewitness. The Crown led circumstantial evidence that connected the appellant to the killings. This included eyewitness and surveillance evidence that after the murders, a man who looks like Mr. Kahsai drove Ms. Alems vehicle from her Calgary home to an Edmonton parking lot near the building where Mr. Kahsai was apprehended, stopping en route to dispose of unknown items in a dumpster. It also included forensic evidence showing blood from both victims on several items seized from the apartment building where Mr. Kahsai was found at the time of his arrest, including his jeans and running shoes.\nMr. Kahsai was charged with two counts of first degree murder, contrary to s. 235(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.\nLeading to his trial, Mr. Kahsai displayed behavior that put his fitness to stand trial into question. Three psychiatric assessments found that he was fit to stand trial but feigning symptoms of mental illness for ulterior motives or strategic purposes. Relying on these assessments, the trial judge found there were no reasonable grounds to proceed with a hearing on the question of fitness. That determination is not challenged on this appeal.\nMr. Kahsai discharged his lawyer before his preliminary inquiry and then refused to retain counsel. He insisted on representing himself for the entire proceedings. \nCourt of Queens Bench of Alberta (Poelman J.)\nMr. Kahsai was tried by a jury in the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta. Before trial, the case management judge appointed counsel under s. 486.3 of the Criminal Code to cross-examine certain Crown witnesses on behalf of the defence. The trial judge appointed an amicus to help the accused with jury selection.\nMr. Kahsai was repeatedly excluded from the courtroom because of his chronically disruptive behavior. He often interrupted the trial judge and trial process with belligerent and disorderly conduct, despite repeated cautions from the judge. When given the opportunity to address the court, the accused expressed various conspiracy theories about the FBI, the U.S. Army, and mind control, rather than asking relevant questions of witnesses or advancing relevant argument. Once Mr. Kahsai was excluded from the courtroom, he would generally participate in the proceedings from a separate room via video conference. Because his outbursts persisted from seclusion, the trial judge ordered that Mr. Kahsais microphone be muted over 60 times.\nPartway through the trial, the trial judge determined that the appointment of a second amicus was necessary for this case to be justly adjudicated:\nIn this case, I have observed and listened to Mr. Kahsai during the voir dire proceedings and this first week [of trial] before the jury. He has not participated in a reasonable fashion. Rather, he has taken every opportunity to disrupt the proceedings. I have had to place him in another courtroom to observe and listen to the proceedings. I have had to mute his mic most of the time. His questioning of witnesses has been ineffective and, insofar as relevant inquiries go, nonexistent.\n\n(A.R., vol. V, at p. 577)\nThe judge appointed the same lawyer who acted as s. 486.3 counsel as amicus to identify and test relevant evidence. He explained that appointing this counsel was in the interest of justice and a fair trial because he was available for much of the remaining trial, already familiar with the case, and another lawyer likely would not be available for the role on such short notice (A.R., vol. V, at p. 577).\nThe trial judge made explicit in his appointment order that amicus would not be representing Mr. Kahsai. Rather, his role was to assist the Court in ensuring that the proceedings are conducted fairly and appropriately (A.R., vol. V, at p. 577). Seeking not to infringe Mr. Kahsais right to represent himself, the trial judge instructed amicus not to advocate on behalf of the defence but to cross-examine Crown witnesses as he saw fit. The accused retained his right to represent himself and cross-examine Crown witnesses himself. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge repeated that trial amicus did not represent the accused and that anything he said was strictly in his capacity as a friend of the court.\nMr. Kahsai resisted the appointment of amicus and mostly refused to cooperate with him throughout the proceedings. On appeal, the trial amicus gave evidence that the accused was generally hostile to him, was not interested in discussing strategy, and disclosed no potential defence. While at times, Mr. Kahsai cooperated with trial amicus  for example, by providing questions for him to ask Crown witnesses  more often, he was confrontational and belligerent towards amicus and the court (A.R., vol. II, at p. 27).\nThroughout the proceeding, trial amicus made remarks that conceded his lack of familiarity with the case. For example, 10 days after he was appointed as amicus, counsel acknowledged that he might have trouble determining an appropriate line of cross-examination for a key Crown witness because [he] was appointed late in the case and [was] not thoroughly familiar with the case (A.R., vol. VI, at p. 972). On the same day, amicus acknowledged that he had still not reviewed all of the disclosure he received from the Crown. On appeal, trial amicus gave evidence that more preparation time would not have changed his capacity to fulfill his role effectively, given Mr. Kahsais attitude of non-cooperation and failure to disclose a viable defence (A.R., vol. II, at p. 30).\nMr. Kahsai advanced no theory that would give rise to a defence. But he maintained that the Crown had not proven his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence was not reliable. In particular, he urged the jury to find him not guilty because the running shoes found on site at the time of his arrest were not his shoe size and did not belong to him.\nMr. Kahsais attempt to deliver his own closing argument was cut short by the trial judge once it became obvious that he was not going to speak coherently on relevant matters. Instead, he used his closing argument as an opportunity to repeat various conspiracy theories, like his theory that the FBI understands and believes [his] testimony, understands the situation at hand, the breaches of national security (A.R., vol. VII, at p. 1236). After a few minutes of this closing address, the trial judge ordered that Mr. Kahsai be removed from the courtroom. The trial judge solicited no supplementary closing argument from trial amicus before proceeding with his final jury charge. Trial amicus did not ask the court for permission to deliver any closing argument, based on his understanding of the scope of his role. Both the judge and the amicus seem to have held the view that CLAO prevents amicus from advocating or making closing argument on behalf of the defence.\nAt the close of trial, Mr. Kahsai was convicted by the jury on both counts of murder. He was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 2 consecutive periods of 25 years. The accused has appealed that sentence separately, given this Courts decision in R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, which held that parole ineligibility periods for first degree murder cannot be served consecutively.\nCourt of Appeal of Alberta, 2022 ABCA 12, 39 Alta. L.R. (7th) 12 (McDonald, OFerrall and Khullar JJ.A.)\nMr. Kahsai appealed his convictions. He argued, among other grounds, that failing to appoint amicus with an adversarial role at an early stage in the proceedings tainted the perceived fairness of his trial.\nWriting for the majority, McDonald J.A. and Khullar J.A. (as she then was) found there was no miscarriage of justice and dismissed the appeal. In the view of McDonald J.A., the appellant deliberately abused the court process to derail the proceedings and abort his trial. After that strategy failed, the appellant sought to complain that a miscarriage of justice had occurred. McDonald J.A. concluded these tactics should not be rewarded with a new trial.\nThe majority reasoned that deference is owed to the discretionary decision of a trial judge not to appoint amicus with an expanded role. Here, the trial judge was limited in his ability to appoint amicus with adversarial functions because the appellant insisted on representing himself and objected to the appointment of even a neutral amicus in his case. Appointing an amicus with defence-like functions would have violated the appellants asserted right to represent himself. In any event, McDonald J.A. found the appellant had not shown how the trial would have unfolded differently had the trial judge made a different amicus appointment.\nIn concurring reasons, Khullar J.A. emphasized this Court did not squarely address the specific functions that amicus may perform in CLAO  it simply made general remarks about the role of amicus. In her view, a bright line should not be drawn for whether amicus can be appointed with defence-like functions in every case with an accused who insists on actively conducting their own defence. Respect for the autonomy of the accused is not always incompatible with amicus performing roles like those of defence counsel. Khullar J.A. found that in this case, it was open to the judge to assign an expanded role to trial amicus, but it was not required by law. She agreed with McDonald J.A. that the appellant had not shown that a miscarriage of justice arose from the role of amicus in his case.\nIn dissent, OFerrall J.A. would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial, with the direction that the appellant be assisted by defence counsel or amicus who could advocate on behalf of the defence.\nOFerrall J.A. reasoned that the obiter in CLAO should not prevent a trial judge from appointing an amicus with an expanded mandate in an exceptional case when it is necessary to ensure a fair and orderly trial. In a complex case in which the accused wishes to self-represent but is hopelessly incompetent to do so, and the court is satisfied that the conduct of the accused will make a fair trial impossible, imposing counsel on the accused does not infringe their right to control their own defence. Rather, it preserves their right to a fair trial.\nAnalysis\nThe issue to be decided is whether a miscarriage of justice arose. Mr. Kahsai does not claim to have suffered actual unfairness, but contends that the delayed and limited appointment of amicus led to an appearance of unfairness that rises to the level of a miscarriage of justice under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code.\nThis question implicates the issue of whether amicus may play an adversarial role to protect the interests of an unrepresented accused. This Court discussed the nature of the role of amicus in CLAO, in the context of deciding whether courts have jurisdiction to set rates of compensation for amicus. CLAO established that amicus can never essentially become defence counsel, identifying several dangers that might arise if amicus were appointed to act as counsel for the defence. However, CLAO did not canvass the many functions that amicus can legitimately perform without engaging the dangers identified by the Court. Nor did it limit amicus to assuming a strictly neutral role. The case law that has emerged shows that trial judges have since struggled to define the permissible scope of roles for amicus. This decision seeks to clarify the functions that amicus can perform to assist the court and the factors that trial judges should consider when tailoring the scope of an amicus appointment.\nMr. Kahsai submits that the role of amicus must be sufficiently flexible to protect against the threat of a miscarriage of justice. In particular, where an unrepresented accused does not advance a meaningful defence, amicus should be entitled to discharge a broader adversarial role. Here, Mr. Kahsai failed to advance his own defence, and the neutral role assumed by trial amicus did little to restore balance to the proceedings. He pleads that in such a circumstance, the trial judge had to appoint amicus who was properly prepared to advocate on behalf of the defence. Failing to do so resulted in an appearance of unfairness that warrants a new trial.\nIn response, the Crown concedes that amicus can assist the court in various ways, but contends there must be limits to the role. The Crown maintains that amicus can never be forced on an unwilling accused or appointed with functions that would undermine the autonomy of the accused to conduct their own defence. In any event, appellate courts must show deference to discretionary decisions about the role of amicus  particularly in cases that involve a party whose conduct undermines trial efficiency and progress. Here, the trial judge took measures to ensure fairness to all the parties, and a miscarriage of justice did not occur.\nIn the following reasons, I affirm and build on the principles established by this Court in CLAO. In the vast majority of cases, trial fairness can be assured by the trial judge, the Crown, and the defence performing their unique roles. However, in exceptional circumstances, the help of amicus may be needed to avoid actual unfairness or the appearance of unfairness. While amicus can never fully assume the role of defence counsel, they can discharge many adversarial functions typically performed by defence counsel where necessary to a fair trial. Although there are limits to the roles amicus can play  informed by the nature of their role as a friend of the court and the constitutional rights of the accused  the scope is broad enough to encompass adversarial functions where those are necessary to permit a particular proceeding to be successfully and justly adjudicated (CLAO, at para. 44).\nAs to whether the delayed and limited amicus appointment in Mr. Kahsais trial created an appearance of unfairness that rises to the level of a miscarriage of justice, I conclude that it did not. The trial judge was under no obligation to appoint amicus at a particular point in the proceeding or with particular adversarial functions. And even if the amicus appointment were based on a misapprehension of the role of amicus, it did not create an irregularity so severe that it would shake the public confidence in the administration of justice.\nInherent Jurisdiction to Appoint Amicus to Ensure Trial Fairness\nTrial fairness is a principle of fundamental justice that is guaranteed under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (R. v. Hart, 2014 SCC 52, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 544, at para. 185; see also R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, at p. 603). It encompasses both the rights of the accused, including the right to make full answer and defence, and broader societal interests, like the interest in an effective and truth-seeking adversarial process (R. v. Khelawon, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 48, citing R. v. Mills, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at paras. 69-76; see also R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 651, at para. 22, citing R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, per McLachlin J.).\nThe power to appoint amicus curiae flows from the inherent jurisdiction of superior courts to manage their own procedure to ensure a fair trial (CLAO, at para. 46; I. H. Jacob, The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court (1970), 23 Curr. Legal Probs. 23, at pp. 27-28). This jurisdiction empowers a superior court judge to appoint amicus when the judge believes doing so is required for the just adjudication of a case. The power of a statutory court to appoint amicus is necessarily implied from the courts authority to control its own process and function as a court of law (CLAO, at paras. 12 and 112). The discretionary power to appoint amicus should be used sparingly and with caution, in response to specific and exceptional circumstances that arise (para. 47).\nAlthough not a party to the proceedings, an amicus may help the court by providing a perspective or performing a function that the judge considers necessary to decide the issues in dispute (CLAO, at paras. 44 and 87). This role is justified on the reasoning that a court should not have to decide contested, uncertain, complex and important points of law or of fact without the benefit of thorough submissions, which may not be available from the parties acting alone (para. 108). The defining feature of amicus is that they owe their duty of loyalty exclusively to the court, regardless of the circumstances or the specific terms of their appointment (paras. 53, 87 and 118). While the purpose of an amicus appointment must be to assist the court, it may have the incidental effect of advancing the interests of the accused (see M. Vauclair and T. Desjardins, in collaboration with P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2022 (29th ed. 2022), at para. 26.6, citing CLAO, at para. 119).\nThe role of amicus is highly adaptable and can encompass duties that exist on a broad spectrum of functions (see R. v. Walker, 2019 ONCA 765, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 259, at para. 65; CLAO, at para. 117). The precise role for amicus will depend on the particular needs identified by the trial judge. But the role of amicus is not without limits. In CLAO, this Court established that amicus would exceed the proper scope of their role once clothed with all the duties and responsibilities of defence counsel (para. 114, per Fish J., dissenting, but not on this point). CLAO identified several dangers that arise from blending the roles of defence counsel and amicus. First, the Court recognized that such an appointment may interfere with the constitutional right of the accused to represent themselves (para. 51). Second, the Court articulated concerns that arise from the role of amicus as friend of the court. These include the potential conflict of interest between the duty that an amicus owes to the court and the duty they would owe to the accused; and the risk that an amicus might undermine the impartiality of the court by giving strategic litigation advice to the accused (paras. 53-54). Finally, the Court identified additional dangers that may arise in particular cases, including the risk that an amicus appointment could undermine the legal aid scheme or a judicial decision to refuse to grant state-funded counsel to the accused (paras. 52 and 55).\nThese dangers will preclude a court from appointing amicus to assume all of the powers and duties of defence counsel. That said, there is a wide range of adversarial functions that amicus can execute without engaging these concerns, as the subsequent cases show. In some cases trial fairness may be best served by appointing amicus to oppose the position of the Crown where the accused is unrepresented. The dangers identified in CLAO help tailor the role for amicus, as I explain below. But they do not impose a bar on appointing amicus with defence-like functions, when the court determines that an adversarial perspective is needed to ensure a fair trial.\nLimitations on the Scope of Roles for Amicus\nRole as Friend of the Court\nTo begin, the scope of permissible functions for amicus is limited by their fundamental role as a friend of the court. As this Court recognized in CLAO, two primary constraints emerge from the nature of this role.\nFirst, assuming the role of amicus imposes a duty of loyalty to the court that amicus must always uphold, regardless of the specific functions they are assigned to discharge. To prevent a conflict of interest, counsel acting as amicus cannot uphold a simultaneous duty of loyalty to the accused (CLAO, at para. 53). This means that once counsel is appointed as amicus, they cannot maintain any solicitor-client relationship with the accused. An amicus does not take instructions from the accused and cannot be dismissed by the accused. Thus, while amicus can advocate in ways that advance the interests of the defence, they do not represent the accused. This may be especially important for the trial judge to make clear when appointing amicus in a proceeding with an accused who is unrepresented despite their efforts to seek or retain counsel.\nSecond, and relatedly, as a friend of the court, the mandate of amicus is to act as a lawyer of the court and for the court. Thus, amicus cannot be given functions that would essentially undermine the courts duty of impartiality  for example, by advising the accused on strategic litigation decisions (CLAO, at para. 54). If in performing their assigned mandate the amicus encounters a conflict with the duty of loyalty they owe to the court, they must always privilege their duty to the court. The amicus should alert the court immediately if they are put in a position that would compromise their ability to discharge their duty of loyalty to the court.\nRights of the Accused\nThe roles that amicus can perform may also be restricted by the constitutional right of the accused to conduct their own defence (CLAO, at para. 51, citing R. v. Swain, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, at p. 972). This right encompasses control over key litigation decisions, including whether to proceed with representation; what mode of trial to elect; whether to plead guilty or not guilty; whether to lead any defence; whether to testify; and what witnesses to call (Swain, at p. 972; R. v. Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 9, citing Vescio v. The King, [1949] S.C.R. 139, at p. 144; R. v. Wong, 2018 SCC 25, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 696, at para. 2; R. v. White, 2022 SCC 7). Empowering the accused with control over key strategic decisions advances trial fairness by ensuring they may bring forward the defence they see fit. The right is a principle of fundamental justice, flowing as a reflection of our societys traditional respect for individual autonomy within an adversarial system of justice (Swain, at p. 972). An accused can thus make strategic decisions that may be seen as unwise, or even detrimental to their position  so long as they are fit to stand trial and the court is satisfied that the choice stems from an informed and reality-based decision (see Korponay v. Attorney General of Canada, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41; R. v. Bharwani, 2023 ONCA 203, 424 C.C.C. (3d) 197, at para. 167; R. v. Ledesma, 2020 ABCA 410, 395 C.C.C. (3d) 259; Walker, at para. 35).\nHowever, the right of the accused to control their own defence is not absolute (Swain, at p. 976). It is still subject to the ordinary rules of law and does not confer the accused with special privileges. For example, an accused can only advance defences available at law and elicit evidence that complies with the rules of evidence. A defendants conduct is also subject to the direction of the court in managing its process; the right to represent oneself does not give licence to paralyze the trial process by subjecting an endless stream of witnesses to interminable examination on irrelevant matters (see R. v. Fabrikant (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 544 (Que. C.A.), at p. 574). Similarly, a defendants choice of representation is always subject to counsels duty of professional integrity. Where counsel feels unable to continue without breaching their oath, they must seek to withdraw, despite any resistance from the accused (see Cunningham, at paras. 48-49; see also, e.g., Law Society of Alberta, Code of Conduct, r. 3.7-5; Law Society of Ontario, Rules of Professional Conduct, r. 3.7-7). Thus, the conduct of a defence operates within the legal and ethical framework of the justice system, alongside other rules and principles of fundamental justice.\nThe right of the accused to control their own defence restricts the adversarial functions that amicus can assume. As noted by the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, amicus cannot make submissions or seek to elicit evidence that would contradict any defences or theories raised by the accused (see I.F., at p. 8). At the same time, a defendants choice to represent themselves will not prevent amicus from assuming any adversarial role, because the right to control ones own defence does not entitle the accused to determine what assistance the court requires. Thus, while a trial judge can appoint amicus with adversarial functions over the objections of an accused, the judge must consider any objections in tailoring the scope of the appointment, with particular sensitivity to the limitations imposed by the right to control ones defence. This may be especially crucial where the accused is unrepresented not for failure to secure counsel, but because they insist on representing themselves.\nSome adversarial functions should generally be available for amicus because they do not conflict with the right to control ones own defence. For example, amicus can seek to advance the interests of the accused through examinations or submissions that do not conflict with the key strategic choices of the accused. Within those limits, amicus should always be entitled to test the strength of the Crowns case to put the Crown to its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \nTailoring the role for amicus will be case-specific, shaped both by how the accused exercises their constitutional rights and what is needed to ensure a fair trial. Both principles of fundamental justice can be accommodated, including where trial fairness requires the amicus to provide an adversarial perspective. I agree with Khullar J.A. that respect for the accuseds autonomy is not always necessarily incompatible with an amicus performing roles similar to those of defence counsel (appeal reasons, at para. 175). In general, the trial judge should seek to give effect to the asserted key litigation decisions of the accused while also keeping in mind what is required to avoid a miscarriage of justice.\nOther Limitations\nFinally, permissible roles for amicus may be limited where other concerns identified in CLAO are relevant in a particular case. For example, amicus appointments cannot be used strategically to circumvent the provincial legal aid scheme or reverse a judicial decision to refuse to grant state-funded counsel following a Rowbotham application. These concerns will arise most frequently when the accused is unrepresented because they were unable to secure counsel. The facts of R. v. Whalen, [2009] O.J. No. 6467 (QL) (C.J.), one of the cases appealed in CLAO, are illustrative. In that case, the accused sought the appointment of defence counsel as amicus because defence counsel was unwilling to act on legal aid rates. The trial judge appointed defence counsel as amicus but with higher rates. On appeal, without commenting on that order, this Court noted that an amicus appointment must not circumvent the legal aid scheme (para. 55). Trial judges should proceed with caution before appointing amicus with adversarial functions that may engage these concerns.\nIn sum, the proper scope of the roles for amicus is limited by necessary constraints inherent in the nature of the role. First, the role of amicus as a friend of the court means that amicus can never discharge functions that would violate their duty of loyalty to the court or undermine the impartiality of the court, such as by advising on key strategic defence choices. Second, the mandate assigned to amicus should respect the key strategic decisions asserted by the accused while also respecting what is required for trial fairness. Finally, the appointment of amicus cannot be exploited to circumvent the legal aid scheme or judicial decisions to refuse to grant state-funded counsel. While these limits do not preclude amicus from performing any adversarial functions, they do restrict the kinds of assistance that amicus can provide.\nDiscretion to Appoint Amicus with Adversarial Functions\nThe trial judge has a broad discretion to appoint amicus and to determine the scope of their mandate. I turn now to some of the relevant considerations that inform those decisions, flowing from the nature of our justice system and the jurisprudence.\nWhen the Assistance of Amicus May Be Required\nThe duties arising from the guarantee of trial fairness are shaped, in part, by our adversarial system of law. Unlike an inquisitorial model, where the judge assumes an active investigatory role, the trial judge in an adversarial system must remain impartial. It is for the parties to bring forward relevant evidence and argument that can prove the issues while the trial judge presides as an objective decision-maker (see D. Stuart and T. Quigley, Learning Canadian Criminal Procedure (14th ed. 2022), at pp. 593-94).\nThe adversarial system depends on certain conditions being present to function as an effective mode of procedure. For example, the adversarial system assumes that the litigants, assisted by their counsel, will fully and diligently present all the material facts which have evidentiary value in support of their respective positions to enable the court to resolve the dispute (Phillips v. Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd., [1971] 2 O.R. 637 (C.A.), at p. 657). The system also depends on the ability of parties to advance their own position and challenge the case presented by an opposing party through the exercise of adversarial functions. This would include, for example, the litigation strategy; the selection of a jury; submissions raising or responding to evidentiary or other legal concerns; examining and cross-examining witnesses; and opening and closing argument. In a criminal proceeding, trial fairness is particularly dependent on the ability to challenge the Crowns case to ensure the interests of the accused are protected. If there is an imbalance in the capacity of the parties to bring forward a viable case by performing adversarial functions, the adversarial process upon which the strength of our justice system is predicated risks losing much of its force (Walker, at para. 63; see also R. v. C.M.L., 2016 ONSC 5332, at para. 80 (CanLII), per Molloy J.). In this sense, adversarial functions advance both the interests of individual litigants, including the accused, and the broader public interest in an effective adversarial process.\nThe risk of imbalance in the adversarial process is exacerbated when an accused is unrepresented (see P. J. LeSage and M. Code, Report of the Review of Large and Complex Criminal Case Procedures (2008), at pp. 155-56). In defending criminal charges without representation, the accused lacks the benefit of independent legal expertise and professional advice while facing what may amount to profound legal jeopardy. Proceeding to criminal trial without representation will often put the accused at a significant disadvantage, sometimes risking a trial in which no meaningful defence is advanced. This is a choice that the accused has a right to make, provided they are fit to stand trial and informed about the consequences of their decision. But that choice may jeopardize the fairness of a trial. To protect the integrity of the adversarial system from these inherent vulnerabilities, the trial judge and the Crown have unique roles to play to ensure a fair trial for an unrepresented accused.\nThe trial judge has a duty to help an unrepresented accused to ensure the proceeding respects their fundamental rights (R. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 15, at para. 34). While this duty can typically be fulfilled by explaining the trial process to the accused, some circumstances will require the judge to more actively intervene. For example, the duty may require the trial judge to suggest that the accused seek counsel; to identify the material issues; to frame questions to elicit relevant evidence for the defence; or to raise potential Charter breaches on the judges own motion (R. v. Jayne, 2008 ONCA 258, 90 O.R. (3d) 37; R. v. Galna, 2007 ONCA 182, at para. 6 (CanLII); R. v. Richards, 2017 ONCA 424, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 284, at para. 113; R. v. Sabir, 2018 ONCA 912, 143 O.R. (3d) 465, at paras. 32-36). At the same time, judges must always remain neutral, which limits the scope of their duty to help an unrepresented accused. For example, the judge cannot provide the accused with strategic advice or take over cross-examination for the defence (R. v. Jaser, 2014 ONSC 2277, at para. 32 (CanLII); Richards, at para. 111). To balance these competing obligations, the judge must ensure the accused will benefit from a procedurally fair trial, while being mindful not to offer help that would be seen to undermine the impartiality of the court.\nThe Crown also has considerable responsibility in ensuring trial fairness. As local ministers of justice and officers of the court, Crown counsel have a duty to preserve the fairness of the criminal justice system for all parties, including the accused, victims, and the public (see Ontario, Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown Prosecution Manual, last updated May 6, 2023 (online)). Because of the public and quasi-judicial dimension to the Crowns role, their function is not adversarial or partisan in the traditional sense. Rather, it is driven by their purpose to advance the public interest (R. v. Cawthorne, 2016 SCC 32, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 983, at para. 27). As famously expressed by Rand J. in Boucher v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16, the goal of the Crown is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime (p. 23). The Crown must always act fairly, dispassionately, and with integrity, both in the courtroom and in all their dealings with the accused (R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at para. 155, per Binnie J., dissenting, but not on this point).\nThe mandate of the Crown to advance the public interest means counsel will assume additional obligations when prosecuting an unrepresented accused. For example, the Crown must advise the unrepresented accused of their right to disclosure of all relevant materials in the possession or control of the Crown, whether that evidence is inculpatory or exculpatory (R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, at p. 343). Crown counsel also has a duty to frankly alert the court if they suspect that all available legal proof of the facts is not being presented to the court by the unrepresented accused (Boucher, at p. 24). Further, it has been suggested that the Crown must be especially careful to present only legally admissible evidence, given that an unrepresented accused will generally be less familiar with the rules of evidence and less likely to challenge Crown evidence (see I. J. Schurman, The Unrepresented Accused: Duties and Obligations of Trial Judges and Crown Counsel, and the Preparation of Petitions for State-Funded Counsel, in G. A. Smith and H. Dumont, eds., Justice to Order: Adjustment to Changing Demands and Co-Ordination Issues in the Justice System in Canada (1999), 297, at pp. 310-11). Finally, Crown counsel must cooperate with the trial judge to enable the court to assist an unrepresented accused and facilitate a proceeding that upholds their fundamental rights.\nThe responsibilities of the trial judge and the Crown can go a long way to ensure trial fairness and, in the vast majority of cases, will suffice to prevent a miscarriage of justice. Yet there are limits tied to the roles of judge and Crown counsel in an adversarial proceeding, and their assistance will not always be enough to ensure a fair trial. Appointing amicus with adversarial functions may be required to restore some balance in unusual cases, including when an unrepresented accused displays symptoms of mental health challenges, but is nevertheless fit to stand trial, or where the unrepresented accused refuses to participate in the trial (see C.M.L., at para. 68). It may also be required where the nature of the charges or the mode of trial make an adversarial perspective from amicus necessary for the case to be justly adjudicated (see Walker, at para. 64; R. v. Brooks, 2021 ONSC 7418, at para. 44 (QL, WL); C.M.L., at paras. 76 and 86).\nGenerally, the court must respect the strategic choices of an accused person who is fit to stand trial, even where those choices seem irrational or unwise (see Bharwani, at para. 157). Still, courts have recognized that in complex cases involving self-represented accused with mental, behavioural, and/or cognitive challenges, the risk that the adversarial process will be compromised is particularly acute (Walker, at para. 63). And as the intervener the Empowerment Council notes, the low threshold for fitness means that defendants may be fit to stand trial despite experiencing serious mental, behavioural, or cognitive challenges (see I.F., at para. 18). In that event, it may be challenging to ensure a fair trial, and assistance from the trial judge and the Crown may not suffice. Amicus can be a flexible tool to mitigate these risks and help trial judges maintain the integrity of their trial process when these types of unusual circumstances arise (R. v. Imona-Russel, 2019 ONCA 252, 145 O.R. (3d) 197, at para. 72; Jaser, at para. 35; Walker, at para. 71).\nConsiderations in Determining the Scope of the Role of Amicus\nSubject to the limitations we have identified above, the trial judge is best positioned to determine what type of help is required and has wide discretion to tailor the appointment to the exigencies of a case (see R. v. Samra (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 434 (C.A.); Imona-Russel, at para. 92). Exceptionally, appointing amicus with an adversarial mandate may be necessary for the court to fulfill its responsibility to maintain a fair and effective trial  particularly when imbalance in the adversarial process threatens to create a miscarriage of justice.\nMany recent cases illustrate where courts found it necessary to appoint an amicus with adversarial functions. For example, courts appointed an amicus with a defence-like role where the accused was unwilling to retain a lawyer and did not actively participate in the proceeding (R. v. Borutski, 2017 ONSC 7748; R. v. Chemama, 2016 ONCA 579, 351 O.A.C. 381; C.M.L.); where the accused represented themselves, but could not advance a competent defence (Walker; Jaser, at para. 35; R. v. Ryan, 2012 NLCA 9, 318 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 15); where the accused was disruptive, abusive of court process, or determined to derail the proceedings (Brooks; R. v. Mastronardi, 2015 BCCA 338, 375 B.C.A.C. 134, at paras. 9-10 and 50; C.M.L.); and where complex issues or serious criminal charges made an adversarial perspective necessary for trial balance and fairness (Mastronardi; Imona-Russel, at paras. 30-31; Brooks, at paras. 43-44; Borutski; Jaser). In many of these cases, the court appointed an amicus with an adversarial role only after explicitly determining that the dangers identified in CLAO would not materialize (Borutski, at para. 29 (CanLII); C.M.L., at para. 71; Mastronardi, at paras. 44-47; Imona-Russel, at para. 93).\nAs these cases reveal, the trial judge should consider the circumstances of the trial as a whole when determining whether to appoint amicus with an adversarial role. This includes the nature and complexity of the charges (see Ryan, at para. 156; Walker, at para. 64; Brooks, at para. 44); whether it is a jury trial or judge alone (see C.M.L., at paras. 76 and 86; Brooks, at para. 44); the attributes of the accused, including where they are unrepresented and any concerns about mental health challenges or their ability to cooperate with the court (see Walker, at para. 64; Mastronardi, at paras. 50-52; Brooks, at para. 44; C.M.L.); whether assistance is needed to test the Crowns case or advance a meaningful defence (see Borutski, at paras. 23, 28 and 31; Ryan, at para. 156); and what assistance the Crown and trial judge can provide within their roles (see C.M.L., at para. 80; Imona-Russel, at para. 69; Ryan, at para. 156).\nAmicus can legitimately assume a wide range of adversarial functions throughout the proceedings, within the scope of the limits identified above. For example, I accept the submission of the intervener the Criminal Lawyers Association that amicus can help the accused by explaining the strategic choices available to them, along with the potential implications of those decisions (see I.F., at p. 2). And there is no theoretical barrier to prevent amicus from testing the strength of the Crowns case through cross-examination, submissions or closing argument (see Mastronardi; Borutski; C.M.L.; Walker). As noted above, amicus may present an alternative theory or defence arising on the evidence to counter the position of the Crown, provided it does not conflict with any asserted theory or defence of the accused. Other adversarial functions may also be available.\nThat is not to say a broad adversarial mandate for amicus is always necessary, nor that it should be close to routine. The dangers established in CLAO led this Court to affirm that the power to appoint amicus must be reserved for exceptional circumstances. But these dangers do not stand in the way of maintaining public confidence in trial fairness  and as several authorities illustrate, they can be accommodated with an appointment order carefully tailored to the circumstances of a particular case.\nSummary and Best Practices\nIn sum, in the vast majority of cases, the responsibilities of the trial judge and the Crown will suffice to ensure trial fairness. Once it is determined that amicus is required, the trial judge retains wide discretion to appoint amicus with functions that are responsive to the needs of a case. This may include adversarial functions where necessary for trial fairness  for example, to restore balance to a proceeding when an accused chooses to self-represent and puts forward no meaningful defence. In tailoring the scope of the role for the amicus, the judge will consider the nature of the role of amicus as friend of the court and the circumstances of a case, including how the accused exercises their constitutional rights and what is needed to ensure a fair trial. While there are necessary limits to the adversarial functions that amicus can perform, the scope is broad enough to accommodate what is necessary for trial fairness in a particular case.\nIn considering whether to appoint amicus, the judge should canvass the parties for their perspectives about the necessity and scope of an amicus appointment. The judge should consider whether an appointment that is limited in duration or scope would suffice. For example, assistance from amicus may only be necessary for cross-examination of certain Crown witnesses or for a particular motion in the proceeding. It would also be helpful to reduce the terms of appointment to writing in a formal order or endorsement, explicitly identifying the nature and scope of the role for the amicus and the specific functions that the court requires.\nFinally, the trial judge should consider whether the mandate assigned to an amicus will make a confidentiality order necessary for the amicus to effectively discharge their role. As the intervener the Criminal Trial Lawyers Association submitted, full and frank conversation between the accused and an amicus may depend on a confidentiality order if the amicus is charged with advocating for the interests of the defence (see I.F., at p. 7). While solicitor-client privilege would not be available, a confidentiality order would create legal protections for communications between the amicus and the accused in discussing their case (see, e.g., Imona-Russel, at paras. 64 and 68, explaining how an undertaking by Crown counsel to treat all correspondence between the accused and amicus as privileged achieved the confidentiality necessary in that case).\nApplication\nTo succeed on this appeal, Mr. Kahsai must show that the amicus appointment in his trial created an irregularity so severe that it rendered the trial unfair in fact or in appearance (R. v. Khan, 2001 SCC 86, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, at paras. 69 and 73). He will establish a miscarriage of justice if the gravity of the irregularity would create such a serious appearance of unfairness it would shake the public confidence in the administration of justice (R. v. Davey, 2012 SCC 75, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 828, at para. 51, citing R. v. Wolkins, 2005 NSCA 2, 229 N.S.R. (2d) 222, at para. 89). This analysis is conducted from the perspective of a reasonable and objective person, having regard for the circumstances of the trial (Khan, at para. 73). It must also acknowledge that while the accused is entitled to a fair trial, they are not entitled to a perfect trial, and it is inevitable that minor irregularities will occur from time to time (Khan, at para. 72).\nThe miscarriage of justice standard  already a high bar  is even higher when claimed based on perceived unfairness instead of actual prejudice. When the perceived unfairness of a trial is at issue, the appearance of unfairness must be pronounced, such that it would be a serious interference with the administration of justice and offend the communitys sense of fair play and decency (Davey, at para. 74). Whether a miscarriage of justice arose is a question of law reviewable for correctness (R. v. Schmaltz, 2015 ABCA 4, 599 A.R. 76, at para. 13, citing Schmidt v. The King, [1945] S.C.R. 438, at p. 439).\nCourts have found a miscarriage of justice based on perceived unfairness in a range of circumstances, including where defence counsel shared confidential information with the trial judge, in breach of solicitor-client privilege (R. v. Olusoga, 2019 ONCA 565, 377 C.C.C. (3d) 143); where the trial judge showed prejudgment by implying that a defence witness was committing perjury in his testimony (R. v. Sherry (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 782 (C.A.)); where defence counsel did not prepare the accused to testify (R. v. Simpson, 2018 NSCA 25, 419 C.R.R. (2d) 174); and where the accused was forced to proceed without representation, despite their stated wishes and being faultless for their circumstance (R. v. Al-Enzi, 2014 ONCA 569, 121 O.R. (3d) 583; R. v. Pastuch, 2022 SKCA 109, 419 C.C.C. (3d) 447). As these examples show, the appearance of unfairness must be serious enough to taint the administration of justice to rise to the level of a miscarriage of justice.\nFor reasons I will explain, Mr. Kahsai has not discharged his burden in proving a miscarriage of justice.\nA Miscarriage of Justice Did Not Arise\nMr. Kahsai argues that an appearance of unfairness arose from two aspects of the amicus appointment in his trial. First, he submits that the timing of the appointment created an appearance of unfairness. He contends that the trial judge failed to ensure a fair and balanced proceeding by appointing an amicus partway through his trial, which prevented trial amicus from adequately preparing for his role. Second, Mr. Kahsai claims that an appearance of unfairness arose from the scope of the amicus appointment, which was based on the trial judges misunderstanding of the functions that amicus can properly discharge. In particular, he claims it was an error for the trial judge to conclude the trial with no closing argument for the defence, based on the understanding that CLAO prevented trial amicus from advocating on behalf of the accused.\nTo the extent that the trial judge restricted functions for trial amicus based on the understanding that CLAO prevented him from assuming any adversarial functions, that would be an error in principle. As I have described, this Court has never prohibited amicus from assuming adversarial functions or delivering a closing address. I agree with Khullar J.A. that it was open to the trial judge to have instructed trial amicus to go beyond cross-examination and assume a more partial role. But the appointment of amicus is a highly discretionary decision, and the trial judge was under no obligation to appoint amicus at a particular time or with a particular mandate. It is not clear whether the trial judge would have mandated a broader adversarial role for amicus given the strenuous objections of the accused. In any event, the ultimate issue is whether the nature of the amicus appointment, even if its scope were curtailed in error, led to a miscarriage of justice.\nThere were many troubling aspects to this trial. Not only was Mr. Kahsai unrepresented in a double-murder trial, he could not fully participate in the trial process. When he did participate, he provided no effective cross-examination of Crown witnesses or coherent argument on his own behalf. Although amicus was appointed to redress some of the concerns arising from these circumstances, the help provided was limited in its scope. The record shows that trial amicus did not have time to fully prepare for his role and that he would have more actively participated if he understood that amicus can generally assume an adversarial role. It is particularly troubling that there was no closing argument for the defence. This omission contributed to an impression of imbalance in this adversarial proceeding. It also deprived Mr. Kahsai of the benefit of submissions that the amicus would have made about the Crowns failure to prove planning and deliberation on one of the two counts of murder. These considerations raise concerns about the appearance of fairness in his trial.\nAt the same time, these concerns must be considered in the context of the exceptional situation that confronted the trial judge, who was trying to manage an exceedingly difficult trial. The judge aimed to respect the choice of Mr. Kahsai to represent himself by assisting him and facilitating his participation in the proceeding, as much as possible. It did not become obvious to the trial judge that Mr. Kahsai would not cooperate with the court or advance a meaningful defence until the trial was underway. At that point, the judge enlisted the help of amicus to preserve trial fairness and improve the balance in the proceeding. He sought counsel who was already familiar with the case and was available for most of the remaining hearing days to proceed with this jury trial. The trial judge appointed amicus with a limited mandate in the context of a trial where the accused repeatedly insisted on representing himself without interference, reflecting a measure of respect for Mr. Kahsais right to conduct his own defence. This was a highly discretionary decision made in balancing the entire circumstances of the proceeding.\nThe trial judge took many steps to ensure trial fairness for Mr. Kahsai. The trial judge emphasized repeatedly that the jury was not to consider the erratic and disruptive conduct of the accused. The judge sought to restore some balance in the proceeding by asking trial amicus to cross-examine Crown witnesses and recalled several witnesses to facilitate that exercise. Relying on psychiatric opinions that Mr. Kahsai was fit and disrupting the proceeding deliberately, the trial judge did his best to manage the process while respecting the key decisions the accused had a right to make. The trial judge also provided a thorough jury charge, highlighting limitations in the Crowns case and emphasizing the Crowns burden to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIt is not clear that appointing amicus earlier or with a broader mandate would have provided much value for Mr. Kahsai, who forcefully resisted the appointment of amicus and sustained his objection to their participation throughout the trial. He refused to cooperate with trial amicus, was not interested in discussing strategy, and disclosed no potential defence. In this circumstance, it is hard to see how a different amicus appointment would have impacted the fairness or perceived fairness of his trial. While the appellant bears no burden to prove actual prejudice on this appeal, he needs to show that a well-informed and objective person would find an appearance of unfairness so serious that it would shake their confidence in the administration of justice  a high bar.\nIn my view, a reasonable member of the public, considering the circumstances of the trial as a whole, would not find that a miscarriage of justice occurred. Instead, they would find the trial fairness concerns were sufficiently addressed by the trial judge and the assistance of amicus, such that a new trial is not required.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\n\tAppeal dismissed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Pringle Chivers Sparks Teskey, Vancouver; Legal Aid Alberta, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service  Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Yellowknife.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Empowerment Council: Anita Szigeti Advocates, Toronto; Martell Defence, Toronto; DeMelo Heathcote, London; Shukairy Law, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society: MN Law, Vancouver; Peck and Company, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Trial Lawyers Association: Liberty Law, Edmonton; Ruttan Bates, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: McKay Ferg, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Lawyers Association: Kapoor Barristers, Toronto.", "llama_summary": "Here is the rewritten summary:\n\n**The Supreme Court Affirms Convictions in R v Kahsai**\n\nThis appeal concerned whether the delayed and limited appointment of an amicus curiae in a murder trial created an appearance of unfairness rising to the level of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n**Background**\n\nThe victims, Selmawit Alem and Tam Julie Tran, were found dead with multiple stab wounds and blunt-force injuries. Emanuel Kahsai, the son of one of the victims, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder contrary to s. 235(1) of the Criminal Code. Throughout his trial, Mr. Kahsai was unrepresented and repeatedly disrupted the courtroom, failing to advance a meaningful defense despite numerous opportunities.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\n\nThe trial process involved a self-represented accused who was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder. Mid-trial, an amicus curiae was appointed with a limited mandate to cross-examine Crown witnesses but not to advocate on behalf of Mr. Kahsai's defense. The majority in Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Kahsai's appeal arguing that no miscarriage occurred due to irregularities in his trial.\n\n**Legal Principle**\n\nA court has inherent jurisdiction to appoint an amicus curiae with adversarial functions to ensure a fair trial when necessary for just adjudication.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWriting for the majority, Karakatsanis J., summarized that while there were troubling aspects to Mr. Kahsai's trial due to his lack cooperation with amicus and no closing argument for defense these concerns were outweighed by efforts made by judge ensuring fairness respecting right represent himself ultimately dismissing appeal", "citation": "2023 SCC 20", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court dismisses a new  trial request for a man convicted of two murders.</strong>\r\n   This is a case about determining  the proper role of <em>amicus curiae </em>in a  criminal trial. \u201c<em>Amicus curiae</em>\u201d (the  plural form is \u201c<em>amici</em>\u201d) is a Latin  term meaning \u201cfriend of the court.\u201d The <em>amicus </em>is an independent lawyer asked by a judge to take part in a case. They do  not represent a party to the case. The precise role of the <em>amicus </em>is case-specific and will  depend on the particular needs identified by the judge. When the accused does  not have a lawyer, the judge may appoint an <em>amicus</em> to assist the court, for example by challenging the prosecution\u2019s case and  cross-examining witnesses. The goal is to make sure the judge or jury hears an  \u201cadversarial perspective\u201d \u2013 an alternative to the prosecution\u2019s version of the  case \u2013 to come to a fair outcome. Two <em>amici </em>were appointed at different times  in the trial of Mr. Emanuel Kahsai, who was convicted by a jury for murdering two  women in Calgary in 2015. The accused did not hire a lawyer to represent him at  trial \u2013 he insisted on representing himself for the entire proceedings. The  first <em>amicus </em>was appointed before  trial to help Mr. Kahsai with the jury selection process. At trial, Mr. Kahsai  was repeatedly disruptive. He did not question witnesses or present a defence. Partway  through the trial, the judge decided to name a second <em>amicus </em>to cross-examine the Crown\u2019s witnesses and ensure the  proceedings were fair and appropriate. He was clear that the <em>amicus </em>would not act as the accused\u2019s  defense lawyer, to respect Mr. Kahsai\u2019s right to represent himself. Despite the  lawyer\u2019s limited mandate, Mr. Kahsai resisted the appointment and mostly  refused to cooperate with him throughout the proceedings. At the end of  the trial, the judge cut short Mr. Kahsai\u2019s closing argument because he was not  saying anything relevant to his defence. The judge did not ask the <em>amicus </em>to make closing arguments on  behalf of Mr. Kahsai. The <em>amicus </em>did  not ask permission to do so either  because he thought the scope of his role prevented him from arguing on behalf  of the defence. Mr. Kahsai  appealed his murder convictions to the Court of Appeal of Alberta. He argued the  trial judge\u2019s failure to appoint the <em>amicus</em> earlier in the trial and with a more adversarial role created the appearance of  unfairness, which justified a new trial. Two of the three judges dismissed the  appeal. They said that appointing the <em>amicus</em> with adversarial functions would have violated Mr. Kahsai\u2019s right to represent  himself. The third judge disagreed and wrote that imposing a lawyer on the  accused when the case was complex and the accused was incompetent to self-represent  did not infringe their right to control their own defence \u2013 rather, it  preserved their right to a fair trial. Mr. Kahsai appealed to this Court. The Supreme Court  has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The amicus\u2019 delayed appointment and limited  role did not justify ordering a new trial.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Karakatsanis said the trial appeared fair to a  reasonable observer, such that a new trial was not necessary. She said that while  the <em>amicus </em>can never fully assume the  role of the accused\u2019s lawyer, they can take on \u201cdefence-like functions\u201d when an  adversarial perspective is necessary to ensure trial fairness. In this case,  Justice Karakatsanis said the appointment of an <em>amicus</em> with a broader mandate was at the trial judge\u2019s discretion but  that he was under no obligation to do so. She acknowledged the striking  imbalance at trial due to Mr. Kahsai\u2019s lack of representation and meaningful  defence. However, \u201cit is not clear that appointing <em>amicus</em> earlier or with a broader mandate would have provided much  value for Mr. Kahsai, who forcefully resisted the appointment of <em>amicus</em> and sustained his objection to  their participation throughout the trial\u201d. In her view, the trial judge had  sufficiently addressed trial fairness concerns in the circumstances. For these  reasons, Justice Karakatsanis dismissed the appeal."}, "15": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nAhmed Abdullahi\tAppellant\nv.\nHis Majesty The King\tRespondent\nand\nCriminal Lawyers Association of Ontario\tIntervener\nIndexed as: R. v.

C-46, ss. 467.1(1), 467.11.\n\tAn investigation into the trafficking of illegal firearms in Ontario culminated with the arrest of several persons, including the accused. A jury found him guilty of various firearms offences, and of one count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization for the purpose of trafficking weapons contrary to s. 467.11 of the Criminal Code. The accused appealed his convictions. With respect to the criminal organization count, he argued that the trial judge erred in law in his instruction to the jury on the first required element of that offence  the existence of a criminal organization  by failing to explain that a criminal organization must have structure and continuity, as set out in R. v. Venneri, 2012 SCC 33, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 211. The majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and concluded that, viewing the jury charge in light of the evidence, the closing arguments of counsel and the lack of objection by defence counsel, the jury was properly equipped with respect to the requirement of structure and continuity, and therefore there was no error of law in the jury instructions. The dissenting judge was of the view that the charge did not properly equip the jury to deal with this element of the offence and would have ordered a new trial on that count.\n\tHeld (Cote J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed, the conviction for participation in the activities of a criminal organization set aside and a new trial ordered on that count.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: The trial judge erred in law in his instructions to the jury on the criminal organization count by failing to explain that a criminal organization is one that by virtue of its structure and continuity poses an enhanced threat to society. Without an explanation of this requirement in the judges instructions, the jury was not sufficiently instructed on the legal standard to apply to the evidence in concluding that a criminal organization existed. \n\tWhen reviewing a jury charge for potential legal error, appellate courts should adopt a functional approach by reading the charge as a whole and determining whether the overall effect of the charge achieved its function: to properly equip the jury in the circumstances of the trial to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. The appellate courts task needs at all times to be directed to this function. It is helpful to view a properly equipped jury as one that is both accurately and sufficiently instructed. The appellate court should consider if the jury had an accurate understanding of the law from what the judge said in the charge, bearing in mind that an instruction does not need to meet an idealized model, nor must it use prescribed wording. The appellate court should also consider if the judge erred by failing to give an instruction, either with sufficient detail or at all. While some instructions are mandatory and their omission will constitute an error of law, whether other instructions are needed will be contingent on the circumstances of the case. Whenever an instruction is required, the judge needs to provide that instruction with sufficient detail for the jury to undertake its task.\n\tFurthermore, the circumstances of the trial cannot replace the judges duty to ensure the jury is properly equipped. However, they do inform what the jury needed to understand to decide the case. Appellate courts should carefully consider how those circumstances are relevant to the central inquiry on appellate review: whether the judges instructions properly equipped the jury to decide the case. Evidence at trial can inform the sufficiency of certain instructions, but it does not inform the sufficiency of every instruction  the existence of evidence relevant to a given issue cannot replace an accurate and sufficient instruction on the law. Similarly, the closing arguments of counsel can inform the sufficiency of the judges instructions and can be relevant to whether a contingent instruction was required. They can also fill gaps in the judges review of the evidence, but they cannot replace an accurate and sufficient instruction on the law. As for the silence of counsel, it can be a relevant consideration, but it is not determinative, and the responsibility of the charge lies with the trial judge, not counsel.\n\tIn order to obtain a conviction for a criminal organization offence, the Crown must first prove the existence of a criminal organization. Criminal organization is defined, in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code. The Court in Venneri interpreted Parliaments direction in s. 467.1(1) that a criminal organization be organized in some fashion as requiring the group to have some form of structure and degree of continuity, before the exceptional regime of the organized crime provisions of the Criminal Code is engaged. The purpose of the Criminal Codes criminal organization regime, which has exceptional procedural and substantive consequences, is to identify and undermine groups that pose an enhanced threat to society due to the institutional advantages of structure and continuity. Criminal organizations can take forms that do not fit stereotypical models of organized crime but nonetheless can pose the type of enhanced threat to society contemplated by Parliament. The definition of a criminal organization must therefore be applied flexibly. However, flexibility in the acceptable forms of structure and degree of continuity does not mean that structure and continuity are optional. Further, the flexibility with which the definition of a criminal organization is applied must not become an invitation for irrelevant considerations or improper reasoning. While characteristics such as ethnicity, cultural background, neighbourhood, religion, language or dialect may indicate a common social or cultural identity among persons who commit offences, they are irrelevant in identifying the existence of a criminal organization. Just as the definition of a criminal organization must not be limited to stereotypical models of organized crime, care must also be taken not to identify a criminal organization merely because the group appears to satisfy some stereotypical model. The trier of facts focus when tasked with identifying a criminal organization needs at all times to remain fixed on whether the particular group in question possesses the distinguishing qualities of a criminal organization, i.e., structure and continuity.\n\tIn the instant case, the trial judges instructions did not sufficiently equip the jury to determine whether a criminal organization existed. An instruction on this required element was mandatory. The judge merely recited the definition in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code. This would not have equipped the jury with an understanding that a criminal organization must pose an enhanced threat to society by virtue of its structure and continuity, as such a requirement is not apparent from the bare text of the definition. The majority of the Court of Appeals reliance on portions of the evidence at trial, closing arguments of counsel and the lack of objection from defence counsel as indicating that the instructions were sufficient was misplaced. The majoritys focus strayed from the ultimate function of jury instructions and the central inquiry on appellate review  whether the jury was properly equipped to decide the case. At the end of the day, the jury was left insufficiently equipped to decide a required element of the offence.\n\tPer Cote J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. Examined as a whole and in context, the trial judges charge properly equipped the jury to decide the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization according to the law and the evidence. The jury knew it had to decide whether the accused was a member of a group that (1) was organized; (2) existed for some period of time; and (3) went beyond one formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. While the judges charge was not perfect, it would not have made any difference if he had used the precise words structure and continuity in explaining the definition of a criminal organization. \n\tAn accused is entitled to a jury that is properly  and not necessarily perfectly  instructed. This functional approach to appellate review of jury instructions requires consideration of the impugned portion of the charge in context and in the circumstances of the trial as a whole. Further guidance on this established framework is unnecessary. The majoritys rigid characterization of errors in jury instructions as those related to accuracy or sufficiency, and within the latter category, instructions which are mandatory or contingent is unhelpful. In all cases, the relevant question is simply whether the charge properly equipped the jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. Furthermore, the submissions of counsel should not be limited to filling gaps in the judges review of the evidence. Counsels submissions cannot serve to correct a misstatement or legal error made by a trial judge, but it may be possible for the submissions of counsel to help fill an alleged gap in the judges charge. As always, this must be assessed in the context of the trial as a whole.\n\tCriminal organization is defined in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code. By insisting that criminal groups be organized, Parliament has made plain that some form of structure and degree of continuity are required. As explained in Venneri, Parliament sought to identify groups that pose an elevated threat to society due to the ongoing and organized association of their members. What is relevant is the substance of this requirement, not the precise form or exact words used.\n\tIn the instant case, there is no dispute that the trial judge accurately set out the statutory definition of a criminal organization. By instructing the jury that the group had to be organized, the trial judge made plain that some form of structure and degree of continuity were required. Jurors do not check their common sense at the door of the deliberation room. The jury would have understood organized to necessarily connote some form of structure and co-ordination. This is further evident or obvious when reviewing the context in which the judges instructions were given: the trial judge elaborated on the legal elements of a criminal organization, including that the formation must not be random or for the purpose of committing an offence; the charge summarized the defences position on the lack of an organizational structure; the judge emphasized that the accused was required to be a member of the alleged organization for some period of time; the parties agreed that a criminal organization required cohesiveness and continuity (as put by the Crown) or structure and continuity (as put by the defence); counsel for the accused did not object to the draft charge; and the jury asked three supplemental questions, but did not ask for clarification on the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization. \n\tWhile certain legal requirements are not obvious or plain from the statutory text, the point of law at issue in this case was obvious or plain to the jury, in the context of the entire charge and the trial as a whole. A failure to say all that could have been said does not amount to legal error. The jury understood that the group had to be organized, that membership had to be for some period of time, and that the legal requirements of the offence were not met if the group was formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. A group could not meet these requirements  as the jury must have found in order to convict  but nonetheless lack some form of structure and degree of continuity.\nCases Cited\nBy Rowe J.\n\tConsidered: R. v.

(3d) 397, [2021] O.J. No. 601 (QL), 2021 CarswellOnt 1438 (WL), affirming the conviction of the accused for participation in the activities of a criminal organization.

C-46.\nA jury found the appellant, Ahmed Abdullahi, guilty of various offences relating to the possession of and conspiracy to transfer illegal firearms. The jury also found the appellant guilty of one count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization for the purpose of trafficking weapons, contrary to s. 467.11 of the Criminal Code. Only the conviction on the criminal organization count is at issue before this Court.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously dismissed an appeal from other convictions but divided on the criminal organization count. On that count, the appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in his instructions to the jury on the first required element of the offence  the existence of a criminal organization  by failing to explain that a criminal organization must have structure and continuity, as set out by this Court in R. v. Venneri, 2012 SCC 33, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 211. The majority of the Court of Appeal concluded that, viewing the charge in light of the evidence, the closing arguments of counsel, and the lack of objection by defence counsel, the jury was properly equipped with respect to the requirement of structure and continuity, and so there was no error of law in the jury instructions. The dissenting judge was of the view that the charge did not properly equip the jury to deal with this element of the offence. On this basis, the appellant asks this Court to allow the appeal and to order a new trial on the criminal organization count.\nThis Court has indicated that appellate courts should adopt a functional approach to the review of jury instructions for legal error. This respects the jurys role as the trier of fact while enabling effective review of the trial judges duty to ensure the jury understands the law that it is to apply. The approach supports the function of jury instructions: to equip the jury properly to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. The meaning of properly equipping a jury is therefore essential to understanding the appellate courts task of identifying legal error in jury instructions. Such errors have been described using a variety of terms in the jurisprudence, notably misdirection and non-direction. In these reasons, I will explain why it is helpful to understand the concept of misdirection in terms of whether the instructions would have equipped the jury with an accurate understanding of the law to decide the case. Similarly, it is helpful to understand the concept of non-direction in terms of whether the instructions would have equipped the jury with a sufficient understanding of the law to decide the case. These concepts direct the appellate courts focus to the function of the instructions and the overall understanding of a given issue in the mind of the jury. Thus, a properly equipped jury can be understood as one that is both accurately and sufficiently instructed to decide the case. \nApplying the foregoing, I conclude that the trial judge erred in law in his instructions to the jury by failing to explain that a criminal organization is one that by virtue of its structure and continuity poses an enhanced threat to society. This requirement distinguishes criminal organizations from other groups of offenders who act in concert; it also helps guard against improper reasoning, notably reliance on stereotypes, as a basis for identifying a criminal organization. Without an explanation of this requirement in the judges instructions, the jury was not sufficiently instructed on the legal standard to apply to the evidence in concluding that a criminal organization existed. The evidence at trial, the closing arguments of counsel for the parties, and the lack of objection to the charge by defence counsel could not make up for this error by the trial judge.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the appellants conviction for participation in the activities of a criminal organization, and order a new trial on that count.\nTrial\nIn March 2013, the Toronto Police Service (TPS), along with the Ontario Provincial Police, began investigation Project Traveller into the trafficking of illegal firearms. The TPS obtained a court order authorizing wiretap intercepts of phone conversations. The languages in the calls were English, Jamaican Patois, and Somali. These wiretaps led to further police surveillance and search warrants.\nThe charges against the appellant revolved around an incident on March 31, 2013. Based on wiretap information, police believed the appellant and his associates were transporting five illegal firearms from Windsor to Toronto in a rental vehicle. Police followed what they believed was the vehicle and, when it began driving erratically, pursued it to an apartment complex on Dixon Road in Toronto. There, they found the vehicle abandoned in the parking garage. A grocery bag was found in the front passenger seat containing three illegal firearms. The other two firearms were never recovered.\nIn the following days, the wiretaps captured discussions alluding to the police pursuit. One individual referred to himself as Ahmed Abdullahi; his voice was heard in other calls, where he was referred to as H and HNI. Discussions between other individuals referred to HNIC.\nProject Traveller culminated in June 2013 with the arrest of several persons, including the appellant. He was charged with five counts of possession of an unauthorized firearm (s. 92(1) of the Criminal Code), one count of possession of property obtained by crime in respect of one of the five firearms (s. 354(1)), one count of conspiracy to commit weapons trafficking (ss. 99(1) and 465(1)(c)), and one count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization for the purpose of weapons trafficking (s. 467.11).\nThe appellant was tried jointly with a co-accused before a judge and jury. The primary issue was identity  namely, whether the appellant was one of those heard in the intercepts, and whether the appellant was in the rental vehicle on March 31, 2013. Circumstantial evidence identifying the appellant included forensic evidence and the wiretap intercepts. One task for the jury was to identify who was speaking or referred to in the intercepts. The Crown alleged that the appellant was the person referred to as H, HNI, or HNIC.\nIn order to obtain a conviction on the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization, the Crown first had to prove that a criminal organization existed. Section 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code defines a criminal organization as follows:\ncriminal organization means a group, however organized, that\n\n(a) is composed of three or more persons in or outside Canada; and\n\n(b) has as one of its main purposes or main activities the facilitation or commission of one or more serious offences that, if committed, would likely result in the direct or indirect receipt of a material benefit, including a financial benefit, by the group or by any of the persons who constitute the group.\n\nIt does not include a group of persons that forms randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence.\nThe Crown alleged that the individuals heard in the intercepts, including the appellant, were members of an urban street gang whose turf was an area of apartment buildings on Dixon Road. In closing argument, the Crown pointed to the groups organized strategies to conceal their criminal activity, which reflected a cohesiveness that is characteristic of urban street gangs and a continuous enterprise (A.R., vol. XXXI, at pp. 94-95). The Crown suggested, for example, that the group had lookouts near apartment buildings, escape routes to avoid arrest, places to conceal contraband, and assigned roles; the co-accused, for example, was alleged to be a courier. The Crown also alleged that the members of the group hid their criminal activities by speaking Somali and by using gang terminology.\nIn support of its view that the group had the characteristics of an urban street gang, the Crown called Detective Constable Steven Kerr of the TPS, whom the judge qualified to give expert opinion evidence on the nature, culture, customs, characteristics, identifiers, including geographical areas and symbols, terminology, including street and gang language and coded language and behaviour and activities of street gangs in Toronto (A.R., vol. XXVI, at p. 3). Detective Kerr explained that members of street gangs often speak in slang and in coded or covert language. He sought to explain terms used by gangs, such as hood, crew, homies, my boy, fam, and bless. His evidence also compared Toronto street gangs with the Bloods and the Crips, notorious American street gangs. He was shown photographs of the appellant and identified him as exhibiting a Blood[s] hand sign while wearing red clothing, which could be indicia of a Bloods-like gang.\nOn cross-examination, Detective Kerr acknowledged that individuals will often mimic gang culture for social  but not criminal  reasons. He agreed that the terms he described are also regularly used by people who are not members of a gang and that wearing red does not necessarily indicate Bloods association. He also agreed that the alleged Bloods hand sign could be interpreted as simply an A-Okay sign.\nThe defence did not present evidence. In closing argument, defence counsel told the jury that the offence requires a criminal organization to have some form of structure and a degree of continuity to the group (A.R., vol. XXXII, at p. 18). Defence counsel argued that no organizational structure was discussed in the intercepts and that the evidence was instead consistent with people from the same neighbourhood and cultural background who formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence.\nAfter closing arguments, the judge held a pre-charge conference. The defence repeated its argument that the alleged criminal organization lacked structure and continuity, citing this Courts decision in Venneri. The judge provided counsel with a draft of his final jury instructions. Changes were discussed and made, but defence counsel raised no concern regarding the judges explanation of what constitutes a criminal organization within the meaning of the offence.\nIn his charge to the jury, the judge referred to the evidence and to the parties positions on the criminal organization count; this included a summary of Detective Kerrs evidence on urban street gangs in Toronto. The judge dealt with the required elements of the offence toward the end of his charge. He told the jury that there are three required elements: (1) the existence of a criminal organization; (2) knowing participation in or contribution to any activity of the criminal organization by the accused; and (3) the intention of the accused to enhance the ability of the criminal organization to facilitate or commit an indictable offence. On the first element, the judge explained:\nThe first element is the existence of a criminal organization. A criminal organization is \n\n(a) a group, however organized, that is composed of three or more persons in or outside Canada; and that \n\n(b) has, as one of its main purposes or activities, the facilitation or commission of one or more serious offences that, if committed, would likely result in the direct or indirect receipt of a material benefit including a financial benefit by the group or any one of the persons who constitute the group.\n\nIt is necessary to elaborate upon each of the components of that definition. A requirement of a group of three or more persons is not met if the group of three or more persons was formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. The formation must not be random. The formation must not be for the purpose of committing an offence.\n\n(A.R., vol. I, at pp. 203-4)\nThe balance of the judges charge on the elements of the criminal organization offence related to the second and third elements: whether the accused participated in the activities of the organization and the purpose of that participation.\nDefence counsel raised no objection to the charge. The jurys deliberations continued to the next day. The jury asked and received answers to several questions unrelated to the criminal organization count. In the evening, the jury returned its verdicts: the appellant was found guilty of all charges. The jury also found his co-accused guilty of several charges, including participation in the activities of a criminal organization.\nIn its sentencing submissions, the Crown argued that the designation HNIC was an abbreviation of Head N-word in Charge (A.R., vol. XXXV, at p. 27) and that the appellant was the leader of the criminal organization. The judge treated this as an aggravating factor in his reasons for sentence (2015 ONSC 4163).\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario, 2021 ONCA 82, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 397\nThe appellant appealed his convictions on three grounds. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed two of the three but divided on the third  that relating to the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization. On that ground, the appellant argued that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury adequately as to the definition of a criminal organization; on this basis, the appellant sought a new trial regarding that offence. The majority did not give effect to this ground of appeal. Justice Paciocco, in dissent, would have allowed the appeal on this ground and ordered a new trial on that count.\nThe majority began its review of the trial judges instructions on the criminal organization count by setting out [t]he basic principles governing appellate review of a trial judges jury instructions (para. 61), as summarized in R. v. Araya, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para. 39, including that the alleged error must be examined in the context of the entire charge and of the trial as a whole. The majority also reviewed this Courts decision in Venneri, as well as the Court of Appeals decisions in R. v. Beauchamp, 2015 ONCA 260, 326 C.C.C. (3d) 280, and R. v. Saikaley, 2017 ONCA 374, 135 O.R. (3d) 641, as to the meaning of a criminal organization. The majority considered that the existence of a criminal organization must be assessed on a flexible basis and that [w]hile the group . . . must have some form of structure and degree of continuity, even a minimal amount may suffice (paras. 69-70, citing Beauchamp, at para. 155). The majority concluded that the trial judges instructions on the definition of a criminal organization, assessed in the context of the trial as a whole (para. 72), did not constitute an error of law.\nThe majority referred to three circumstances from the trial as a whole in support of this conclusion. First, there was Detective Kerrs evidence on urban street gangs in Toronto and the designations H, HNI, and HNIC, which referred to the appellant as standing at the head of the gangs hierarchy as the head, head n** or head n** in Canada (para. 74). Second, there were closing arguments by counsel. The Crown told the jury that the intercepts revealed the alleged gangs hierarchy and territory and a cohesiveness that is characteristic of urban street gangs. Defence counsel referred the jury to the need for structure and continuity and argued that the group was formed randomly for a single criminal offence. Thus, the closing arguments by counsel both indicated that a criminal organization required structure or cohesiveness and continuity. Third, defence counsel did not object to the judges instructions. The majority concluded that, while defence counsels failure to object is not determinative, the lack of objection indicated the adequacy of the trial judges instructions on the definition of a criminal organization, given the evidence and closing submissions by both Crown and defence counsel.\nJustice Paciocco, dissenting, took the view that although the existence of a criminal organization is to be assessed flexibly and that a low level of organization suffices, nonetheless the group must have structure and continuity. These were important issues in this case, yet the trial judge failed to explain this to the jury and instead merely repeated the definition set out in the Criminal Code, without reference to what was set out in Venneri.\nJustice Paciocco considered that the three circumstances from the trial as a whole relied on by the majority did not make up for the judges failure to instruct the jury on the requirement for structure and continuity. The existence of evidence relating to structure and continuity would not itself inform the jury that this is a requirement in order to convict. Defence counsels closing arguments, in illustrating that structure and continuity were live issues, underlined the need for the judge to instruct the jury on these matters. In Justice Pacioccos view, only in rare circumstances, if ever, can counsels words make up for a trial judges failure to provide a needed instruction. Although defence counsel ought to have objected to the charge, there was no indication that the failure to object was tactical; the only reasonable inference was that defence counsel failed to notice the problem. In the end, the appellant was entitled to a properly instructed jury and did not have one.\nIssue\nThe issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in law in his instructions to the jury on the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization, such that a new trial should be ordered on that count.\nAnalysis\nBoth the majority and the dissenting judge at the Court of Appeal sought to give effect to this Courts guidance as to the proper approach to reviewing jury instructions for legal error. They also referred to the legal requirements for the definition of a criminal organization, as set out by this Court in Venneri. However, while referring to the same authorities, they came to markedly different conclusions. This points to the value of reviewing and reiterating this Courts guidance on how an appellate court should review jury instructions for legal error, as well as what this Court set out in Venneri regarding structure and continuity under s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code.\nI will begin my analysis by discussing the legal framework for appellate review of jury instructions. The appellate courts task needs to be directed to whether the instructions properly equipped the jury to decide the case. I will explain why it is helpful to view a properly equipped jury as one that is both accurately and sufficiently instructed to decide the case, as well as how the circumstances of the trial can inform the analysis. I will then turn to the definition of a criminal organization. Finally, I will consider whether the judges instructions in this case properly equipped the jury to decide the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization.\nLegal Framework for Appellate Review of Jury Instructions\nThe Role of Appellate Courts in Reviewing Jury Instructions\nOn a conviction appeal, an appellate court may allow an appeal pursuant to s. 686(1)(a) of the Criminal Code where it identifies any error of law, unreasonable verdict, or miscarriage of justice. These reasons focus on the first basis for appellate intervention, as challenges to a judges instructions to the jury are analyzed as an error of law (R. v. Illes, 2008 SCC 57, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 134, at para. 21).\nWhen reviewing a trial judges instructions to the jury for legal error, appellate courts need to be mindful of the division of duties in a jury trial. The jury is the sole trier of fact. But a jury is not presumed to know the law that it must apply when reaching its verdict. The judge regulates and orders the proceedings, including any legal rulings needed during the trial, and instructs the jury as to the law. Counsel for the Crown and the defence place evidence before the jury, argue what facts the jury should find based on the evidence, and advocate for a given verdict (see R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at paras. 27-28; R. v. Rodgerson, 2015 SCC 38, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 760, at para. 30). \nAppellate courts need to respect the role of jurors as triers of fact (see R. v. White, 2011 SCC 13, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 433 (White 2011), at para. 56; R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at p. 692). Since the determination of guilt or innocence is the responsibility of the jury (R. v. White, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, at para. 27), appellate courts should exercise restraint and not routinely interfere with jury verdicts absent an error of law. However, appellate courts need also to be mindful that the trial judge bears the responsibility to instruct the jury on the law (R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 37; R. v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37, at para. 144). In addition, juries do not have the benefit of judicial experience on certain issues; for example, a Vetrovec caution may be required to bring home to lay jurors the accumulated wisdom of the laws experience with unsavoury witnesses (R. v. Khela, 2009 SCC 4, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104, at para. 4; see also Rodgerson, at para. 34; White 2011, at paras. 44 and 55-56). The trial judge needs to ensure that the jury understands its task and is properly equipped to make its decision. The appellate court ensures that the trial judge has fulfilled their role to properly instruct the jury (Jacquard, at paras. 14, 32 and 62; R. v. Menard, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 109, at para. 27; R. v. Cooper, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p. 163).\nFinally, the appellate courts role in reviewing the jury instructions for legal error needs to be distinguished from the operation of the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. The approach described in these reasons is used to determine whether there is an error of law in a judges instructions to the jury. The curative proviso, on the other hand, is to be considered only where an error of law has already been identified; it deals with whether such an error can be cured such that it is not warranted for the appellate court to set aside the verdict and order a new trial. Although certain considerations can inform whether an error has occurred as well as whether it can be cured, the two analyses need to remain conceptually distinct. An accused must demonstrate the existence of a legal error. Once that burden has been met, the Crown, if it seeks to rely on the proviso, bears the burden to establish one of the requirements of the proviso: that (1) the error of law is harmless, or (2) despite a potentially prejudicial error of law, there is an overwhelming case against the accused (R. v. Sarrazin, 2011 SCC 54, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 505, at para. 25). The curative proviso imposes a heavy burden on the Crown. The accused has the right to the verdict of a properly instructed jury, and appellate courts must exercise prudence so as not to trespass on that fundamental right (para. 23).\nA Functional Approach to Appellate Review of Jury Instructions\nIt is not possible to set out an exhaustive step-by-step framework for appellate review of jury instructions  each case depends on the nature of the alleged errors. Rather, this Court has provided guidance to appellate courts to adopt a functional approach when reviewing instructions for legal error.\nLet me reiterate principles underlying this functional approach. The accused is entitled to a jury that is properly, not perfectly, instructed (Jacquard, at paras. 2 and 62; Daley, at para. 31; Araya, at para. 39; R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at para. 9). The charge must be read as a whole (Cooper, at p. 163; Daley, at paras. 31 and 53; Calnen, at para. 8). It is the substance of the charge that matters, not adherence to a prescribed formula or particular sequence (Daley, at paras. 30 and 53; Calnen, at para. 8). The charge must be considered not in isolation but in the context of the trial as a whole (Daley, at para. 58; R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 32). The overriding question is whether the jury understood or was properly equipped with the law to apply to the evidence (Calnen, at para. 9; Jacquard, at para. 14).  Each of the foregoing captures an aspect of a functional approach. How appellate courts have given effect to this guidance on occasion has lacked consistency.\nThe appellate courts task needs to be directed toward the ultimate function of jury instructions: to properly equip the jury to decide the case. In other words, when reviewing a charge to a jury for potential legal error, appellate courts need to read the charge as a whole and determine whether the overall effect of the charge properly equipped the jury in the circumstances of the trial to decide the case according to the law and the evidence.\nWhat does it mean for a jury to be properly equipped? Many terms have been used in the jurisprudence to describe errors in jury instructions that render a jury improperly equipped, notably misdirection and non-direction. In my view, the concept of misdirection is better understood in terms of whether the instructions would have equipped the jury with an accurate understanding of the law to decide the case. Similarly, the concept of non-direction is better understood in terms of whether the instructions would have equipped the jury with a sufficient understanding of the law to decide the case. Thus, it is helpful to view a properly equipped jury as one that is both (a) accurately and (b) sufficiently instructed. This requires the appellate court to have regard both to what was said and what was not said in the judges instructions. To be clear, the distinction between allegations of inaccuracy and insufficiency are not two separate grounds of review of a jury instruction for legal error, nor do they replace or depart from other terms that have been used in the jurisprudence to describe errors in jury instructions. An alleged error, depending on how it is framed, might raise concerns of both inaccuracy and insufficiency. In the end, these concepts are useful tools through which an appellate court may answer the ultimate question of whether, on a functional reading, the instructions properly equipped the jury to fulfil its role.\nWhether the Jury Was Accurately Instructed\nIn some cases, it is alleged that what the judge said in the charge would have equipped the jury with an inaccurate understanding of the law. This would be the case, for example, where a jury instruction suggests that the balance of probabilities is the requisite standard of proof to convict (R. v. Starr, 2000 SCC 40, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at para. 243). This may also be so where the judge instructs the jury that they must be unanimous in their doubt, rather than in the verdict, before they can acquit (R. v. Brydon, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 253, at para. 24). A charge may also be so confusing as to amount to an error of law (R. v. Hebert, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 272, at para. 8; see also Rodgerson, at para. 42).\nThese sorts of errors have typically been referred to as misdirection (see, e.g., Rodgerson, at para. 37; Menard, at paras. 29-30; R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, at para. 9; R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345, at pp. 354-55; Boucher v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 16). As I have explained, they are better understood in terms of whether the jury was equipped with an accurate understanding of the law to decide the case. This focuses the inquiry on the overall understanding of a given issue in the mind of the jury.\nAn instruction is not inaccurate simply because it fails to use certain words or does not copy a strict formula; it is the general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to the mind of the jury that matters (Daley, at para. 30; see also Khela, at para. 53; R. v. Avetysan, 2000 SCC 56, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at para. 11; Starr, at para. 233). The question is whether the jury was accurately instructed to decide the case according to the law and the evidence (Jacquard, at para. 32).\nThe charge must be read as a whole. As this Court has stated, the right of an accused to a properly instructed jury does not equate with the right to a perfectly instructed jury (Jacquard, at para. 32). A single ambiguous or problematic statement in one part of a charge will not necessarily be an error of law where the charge as a whole equipped the jury with an accurate understanding of the relevant legal issue (R. v. Goforth, 2022 SCC 25, at paras. 35 and 40; Jaw, at para. 32; Cooper, at pp. 163-64). One misstatement might be compensated for by an accurate statement elsewhere in the charge, provided the jury would have accurately understood the law it must apply (White 2011, at paras. 82 and 84; Menard, at para. 30; Jacquard, at para. 20).\nThe organization of the charge and the placement of alleged inaccuracies within it will inform the overall accuracy of the charge (Jaw, at para. 33). For example, a problematic statement at one part of the charge may be less likely to undermine a proper statement of the law in a more material part of it (see, e.g., Khela, at para. 55; R. v. Athwal, 2017 ONCA 222, at paras. 2-3 (CanLII)). Conversely, it may be more likely for a jury to have been misled where the judge states the law correctly in a more generic part of the charge but then inaccurately states the same issue in a more material or significant part of the charge (see, e.g., R. v. Subramaniam, 2022 BCCA 141, 413 C.C.C. (3d) 56, at paras. 73-77; R. v. Bryce (2001), 140 O.A.C. 126, at paras. 13-15 and 20). There is a greater risk that the jury has an inaccurate understanding of the law where an inaccurate statement is made in a recharge in response to a question from the jury (Brydon, at para. 19; R. v. Naglik, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 122, at p. 139); this may well compound and thereby make more serious such an error.\nAt all times, the focus is on whether the jury had an accurate understanding of the law from the charge.\nWhether the Jury Was Sufficiently Instructed\nIn some cases, it is alleged that the judge did not say something that needed to have been said in order for the jury to be properly equipped to decide the case. It is thus alleged that the jury was not sufficiently instructed. In some instances, a failure to give an instruction, either with sufficient detail or at all, will be an error of law.\nThese situations have typically been referred to as non-direction (see, e.g., Khill, at para. 145; Lifchus, at para. 9; R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 619). As I have explained, non-direction is better understood in terms of whether the instructions would have equipped the jury with a sufficient understanding of the law to decide the case. This directs the appellate court to the function of the instructions.\nThe sufficiency of an instruction may be understood as involving two related questions: (i) whether an instruction was required and (ii) whether an instruction that was required was given with sufficient detail.\nWhether an Instruction Was Required\nSome instructions must be given in every jury trial. Other instructions are required in certain circumstances, but not in others. When faced with an allegation of insufficient instruction, an appellate court should consider whether the impugned instruction was mandatory or if its requirement was contingent on the circumstances of the case.\nMandatory instructions that must be dealt with in every case include, for example, an explanation of the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (Lifchus, at para. 22). The instructions must also include, inter alia, an explanation of the charges faced by the accused, including the required elements of each offence to be left with the jury; an explanation of the theories of each side; a review of the evidence relating to the law; the possible verdicts open to the jury; and the requirement of unanimity for reaching a verdict (Daley, at para. 29). The omission of a mandatory instruction will necessarily be an error of law.\nContingent instructions are those that may be required in some cases but not others. They may include, for example, a Vetrovec warning where there is unsupported evidence by unsavoury witnesses (Khela, at para. 11), or a limiting instruction against general propensity reasoning (Calnen, at para. 5). Defences and included offences are put to the jury only where they bear an air of reality on the evidence (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 50; R. v. Aalders, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 482, at pp. 504-5). The fact that such instructions are not required in every case should not be understood to mean that they are optional. When the circumstances of the case are such that a particular instruction is required, it is an error of law to omit it.\nWhether the Instruction Was Given With Sufficient Detail\nWhen an instruction is required (whether it is mandatory or contingent), appellate courts need to determine whether the instruction was given with sufficient detail to equip the jury to decide the case.\nFor example, an explanation of the standard of proof will require more than simply stating the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt (Lifchus, at para. 22). This is mandatory in every case. Or, the evidence may require a specific instruction. An example is Rodgerson, where the evidence of concealment and clean-up could be relevant to two issues: the accuseds self-defence claim and his intent to commit murder. The trial judge instructed the jury to consider this post-offence conduct evidence along with all the other evidence at trial. This Court concluded that a more specific instruction was required on the limited use of the evidence for the issue of intent, as the evidence could not be used in the same manner as for the claim of self-defence. The failure to give this more specific instruction constituted an error of law (paras. 27-29; see also Khill, at paras. 125-27 and 129-30). The need for this instruction was contingent on the circumstances of the case.\nWhere a jury is asked to apply provisions that have been interpreted by the courts, it will often be insufficient for a judge to simply recite the relevant provisions to the jury without explaining the meaning given to them in the jurisprudence (C. Granger, The Criminal Jury Trial in Canada (2nd ed. 1996), at p. 246; see, e.g., R. v. Maxwell (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 322 (Ont. C.A.)). It is not unusual for courts to read in requirements or qualifications to Criminal Code provisions that are not apparent from the text of the provision. For example, in R. v. Boudreault, 2012 SCC 56, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 157, this Court read the wording of the offence of having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired under s. 253(1) of the Criminal Code (since repealed) as requiring a realistic risk of danger to persons or property. In such circumstances, merely reciting the text of the provision to the jury would be insufficient.\nLike accuracy, the sufficiency of an instruction must be assessed in the context of the charge as a whole. An instruction may be insufficiently detailed in one part of the charge, but can be supplemented by another part of the charge such that the jury was equipped with a sufficient understanding of the law to decide the case (Calnen, at para. 6; Daley, at para. 31; Jacquard, at paras. 14 and 20).\nThere is no strict rule to determine the level of detail for an instruction to be sufficient. The level of detail that is required depends on the circumstances of each case (Rodgerson, at para. 30; R. v. Mack, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 50; Daley, at paras. 57 and 76). Moreover, judges are not required to adhere to specific wording; what counts is the substance of the instruction, not its adherence to or departure from a prescriptive formula (Daley, at paras. 30 and 53; Mack, at para. 48).\nModel jury instructions serve as important guides, but they are not decisive of the sufficiency of an instruction. On one hand, the judge is not required to give a formulaic instruction, and a less detailed instruction may be sufficient if the circumstances of the case do not require as much detail as the model instruction sets out. On the other hand, the circumstances of the case may require an instruction with greater detail than a model instruction provides. This Court has cautioned against overreliance on model instructions; they are a valuable tool, not the final product (R. v. R.V., 2021 SCC 10, at para. 64; Rodgerson, at paras. 51 and 54).\nAppellate courts should also be mindful that brevity is a virtue in jury instructions (Daley, at para. 56). The judge has a duty to decant and simplify the law (Jacquard, at para. 13). If the charge sufficiently equips the jury with what it needs to consider, the failure to say all that could have been said does not constitute an error of law (Mack, at para. 59).\nConsideration of the Charge in Light of the Circumstances of the Trial\nThe central inquiry on appellate review is whether the instructions properly equipped the jury to decide the case. In answering this question, a functional approach requires that appellate courts consider the instructions not in isolation, but rather in the context of the trial. Every trial is different. An instruction that properly equips the jury in one trial will not do so in another trial. A jury needs to be equipped with only that which is necessary to decide the case before it.\nAlthough instructions need to be considered in the context of the trial, appellate courts should carefully consider how those circumstances are relevant to the central inquiry on appellate review: whether the judges instructions properly equipped the jury to decide the case. Again, a properly equipped jury can be understood as one that is both accurately and sufficiently instructed. The circumstances of the trial must be directed to this inquiry and not be used to replace the instructions. To do so would subvert the trial judges duty to instruct the jury accurately and sufficiently.\nWith the foregoing in mind, I turn to the three considerations from the trial as a whole relied on by the majority in concluding that the instructions disclosed no legal error: (i) the evidence; (ii) the closing arguments of counsel; and (iii) the lack of objection by defence counsel. This is not an exhaustive list of the considerations that may be relevant in light of the jurisprudence of this Court; rather, these are the ones that have been placed in issue in this appeal.\nEvidence\nThe evidence at trial informs what the jury needs to understand in order to be equipped properly to decide the case. Thus, the evidence at trial can inform the sufficiency of certain instructions. For example, whether a Vetrovec instruction is required will depend on the witnesses; if there are no unsavoury witnesses, then it is not an error of law to omit a Vetrovec instruction. In Rodgerson, a more specific instruction was required due to the nature of the evidence adduced at trial. For these types of instructions, whether the instruction is required and its level of detail depend on the evidence.\nThe evidence does not inform the sufficiency of every instruction. For example, a sufficiently detailed instruction on the standard of proof must explain the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt in accordance with the jurisprudence, regardless of the evidence. The jury needs to understand the law that it is called on to apply to the evidence. The existence of evidence relevant to a given issue cannot replace an accurate and sufficient instruction on the law. If a jury is equipped with an inaccurate understanding of the law, one can expect that the jury will apply that inaccurate legal framework to the evidence, whatever that evidence may be. If the instruction is insufficient, the appellate court cannot ascertain whether the jury undertook its task within the required framework.\nThe overall strength of the Crowns case is not a relevant consideration in the review of a jury instruction for legal error. The weight of the evidence is a factual matter for the jury. The strength of the Crowns case may be a relevant consideration under the curative proviso, but that is a different question (Araya, at para. 53).\nClosing Arguments of Counsel\nLike the evidence, the closing arguments of counsel form part of the overall circumstances of the trial; in some circumstances, these can inform the sufficiency of the judges instructions. Notably, the closing arguments of counsel can be relevant to whether a contingent instruction was required. For example, in Khill, defence counsels repeated emphasis on the final split second of the incident supported the need for the trial judge to provide a specific instruction on the accuseds role in the incident in his instruction on self-defence (paras. 134-35). Or, if counsel makes a problematic statement in closing argument, it can be incumbent on the judge to correct this and to admonish the jury to disregard counsels statements; a failure to do so may amount to an error (R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262, at paras. 63 and 126-27).\nThis Court has stated that counsels closing arguments may fill gaps in the judges charge (Daley, at para. 58). However, this statement must be understood in light of the nature of the alleged error. Appellate courts have viewed counsels closing arguments as capable of filling gaps in the judges review of the evidence (see, e.g., R. v. Connors, 2007 NLCA 55, 269 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 179, at para. 15; R. v. Smith, 2010 BCCA 35, 282 B.C.A.C. 145, at paras. 41 and 46; R. v. Krasniqi, 2012 ONCA 561, 291 C.C.C. (3d) 236, at para. 81). This is because judges are not required to review in detail the whole of the evidence; they are required only to review critical parts of the evidence and to ensure that the jury understands the significance of the evidence having regard to the issues in the case (Daley, at paras. 56-57; R. v. P.J.B., 2012 ONCA 730, 298 O.A.C. 267, at para. 47).\nI agree with the intervener, the Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario, that counsels closing arguments cannot replace an accurate and sufficient instruction on the law. The fact that counsel might have explained a legal principle properly will not correct the trial judges failure to do so (Avetysan, at paras. 23-24; R. v. Gray, 2012 ABCA 51, 522 A.R. 374, at para. 19). Juries are invariably told to take the law from the judge and not from counsel or other sources. Such an instruction reflects the trial judges duty to instruct the jury on the law. It also prevents the jury from cobbling together disparate and potentially inconsistent explanations of the law. Reliance on multiple sources might well not only confuse juries but also frustrate appellate review of a jury instruction for legal error, as appellate courts would not know which legal principles the jury applied.\nSilence of Counsel\nTrial judges often convene a pre-charge conference, as provided for under s. 650.1 of the Criminal Code. In this proceeding, the judge will usually provide counsel with a draft of the jury charge and invite comments on it. This is intended to be a meaningful exchange. Counsel should lay their cards on the table, and the judge should be mindful of what counsel says, bearing in mind that it is an adversarial process. After the judge has instructed the jury, counsel have an opportunity to raise objections to the charge or to request clarifications or additional instructions before the jury commences its deliberations. As with the pre-charge conference, this is meant to be a meaningful exchange where counsel lay their cards on the table. Finally, when juries raise questions during their deliberations, counsel have the opportunity to provide submissions to the judge as to how to answer the questions. Where counsel fails at these various opportunities to request the inclusion of an instruction or fails to raise an objection to the charge as delivered, appellate courts have often turned to counsels silence as an important consideration.\nAlthough the silence of counsel can be a relevant consideration, it should be recalled that the responsibility for the jury charge lies with the trial judge, not counsel. This Court has on several occasions stated that the silence of counsel, while relevant, is not determinative (see, e.g., Theriault v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 336, at pp. 343-44; Daley, at para. 58; Mack, at para. 60). To hold otherwise would unequivocally prejudice an accuseds right of appeal in cases where counsel is inexperienced with jury trials (Jacquard, at para. 37). The silence of counsel is simply one of many considerations under a functional approach.\nCounsels silence may be particularly relevant as to whether a contingent instruction was required. For example, the lack of a request by defence counsel for the inclusion of a limiting instruction against general propensity reasoning may reinforce the conclusion that such an instruction was not required in the circumstances of the case (Calnen, at para. 41). Counsels silence may also suggest that an instruction that was given was sufficiently detailed. For example, the lack of objection may indicate the sufficiency of a judges Vetrovec instruction (Khela) or instructions on advanced intoxication (Daley). Counsels silence could also support a conclusion that the charge read as a whole accurately set out the law relevant to a given issue. For example, in Goforth, the lack of objection by defence counsel did not make the jury charge accurate, but it supported the conclusion that the overall effect of the charge accurately instructed the jury with the foreseeability standard for the offence (para. 39). One can take the view that an instruction good enough for counsel was likely good enough for the jury (see, e.g., Jaw, at para. 36). But, the impressions of the moment can be mistaken, especially in complex cases with multiple legal issues.\nCounsels silence may be particularly significant where there are indications that it was a tactical decision. If the absence of an instruction at trial could have benefited the party who argues on appeal that it was required, then the appellate court might ask whether counsel made the tactical decision not to seek the instruction at trial (Calnen, at para. 41; see also R. v. Royz, 2009 SCC 13, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 423, at para. 3). This can be a significant consideration. Counsel cannot withhold an objection at trial and save it for an appeal. Appellate courts are also rightly hesitant to second-guess the tactical decisions of counsel, save to prevent a miscarriage of justice (Calnen, at para. 67; R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 34). Conversely, if the omission of an instruction would have had no apparent benefit for the appealing party, this may suggest that the error was an oversight rather than a tactical decision (Khill, at para. 144; R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 48).\nAppellate courts may also be called on to consider whether counsels silence is relevant to the curative proviso. Counsels silence may suggest, for example, that while an omission in the judges instructions was an error of law, the error was harmless in the circumstances (R. v. Arcangioli, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, at p. 143; Jaw, at para. 44). As noted before, this is a distinct inquiry.\nSentencing Submissions and Reasons\nCounsels sentencing submissions and the judges reasons for sentence are necessarily given after the jury has rendered a verdict of guilt. Thus, matters to be considered for the first time at sentencing cannot be relevant to whether the jury was properly equipped to decide whether the accused should be found guilty or not guilty.\nSummary\nIn sum, when reviewing a jury charge for potential legal error, appellate courts should adopt a functional approach by reading the charge as a whole and determining whether the overall effect of the charge achieved its function: to properly equip the jury in the circumstances of the trial to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. The appellate courts task needs at all times to be directed to this function. It is helpful to view a properly equipped jury as one that is both accurately and sufficiently instructed. The appellate court should consider if the jury had an accurate understanding of the law from what the judge said in the charge, bearing in mind that an instruction does not need to meet an idealized model, nor must it use prescribed wording. The appellate court should also consider if the judge erred by failing to give an instruction, either with sufficient detail or at all. While some instructions are mandatory and their omission will constitute an error of law, whether other instructions are needed will be contingent on the circumstances of the case. Whenever an instruction is required, the judge needs to provide that instruction with sufficient detail for the jury to undertake its task. The circumstances of the trial cannot replace the judges duty to ensure the jury is properly equipped, but they do inform what the jury needed to understand to decide the case.\nDefinition of a Criminal Organization\nI turn now to the instruction to the jury at issue in this appeal and to the definition of a criminal organization.\nIn order to obtain a conviction for a criminal organization offence, the Crown must first prove the existence of a criminal organization (see Venneri, at para. 25). This is common to all criminal organization offences. Sections 467.11 to 467.13 of the Criminal Code set out four substantive offences targeting escalating degrees of involvement with a criminal organization. In addition to these offences, pursuant to s. 2, any other serious offence committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization is also considered a criminal organization offence. Other provisions of the Criminal Code distinguish the (ordinary) commission of certain offences from their commission in relation to a criminal organization, e.g., possession of an explosive (s. 82(2)) and various offences involving a firearm (ss. 239(1)(a), 244(2)(a), 244.2(3)(a), 279(1.1)(a), 279.1(2)(a), 344(1)(a) and 346(1.1)(a)). \nUnderstanding the definition of a criminal organization is necessary in order to determine whether the judges instruction properly equipped the jury to decide whether the appellant participated in the activities of a criminal organization.\nDistinguishing Qualities of a Criminal Organization\nNot every group of three or more persons that facilitates or commits a serious offence for a material benefit is a criminal organization. This Court in Venneri interpreted Parliaments direction in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code that a criminal organization be organized in some fashion as requiring the group to have some form of structure and degree of continuity before the exceptional regime of the organized crime provisions of the Criminal Code is engaged (para. 29).\nThe appellant says that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury on the requirement for a criminal organization to have structure and continuity. In Venneri, this Court took a purposive approach and set out the underlying rationale for the requirement of structure and continuity. It is helpful to review that rationale, which informs what a jury needs to understand in order to be properly equipped to decide whether a criminal organization exists.\nThe purpose of the Criminal Codes criminal organization regime is to identify and undermine groups that pose an enhanced threat to society due to the institutional advantages of structure and continuity (Venneri, at para. 40). Structured and continuous criminal entities offer advantages to their members by consolidating and retaining knowledge; sharing customers and resources; developing specializations; dividing labour; fostering trust and loyalty; and developing reputations in the community, including for violence (para. 36). These same advantages enable criminal organizations to elude law enforcement more effectively.\nTo counteract these advantages, Parliament has enacted not only substantive criminal organization offences but also heightened investigative, procedural and penal consequences where a criminal organization is involved or alleged to be involved in an offence. These include greater police powers for certain authorizations and warrants (ss. 185(1.1), 186(1.1), 186.1, 492.1(6)(a) and (b) and 492.2(5)(a) and (b)) and a reverse onus for bail (s. 515(6)(a)(ii)). At sentencing, involvement in a criminal organization is an aggravating factor (s. 718.2(a)(iv)), conditional sentences are unavailable (s. 742.1(d)), and parole ineligibility can be delayed (s. 743.6(1.1)). Sentences for certain criminal organization offences must be served consecutively to other sentences arising from the same event (s. 467.14). Murder is elevated to first degree murder where the death is caused for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization (s. 231(6.1)).\nThe enhanced threat to society posed by criminal organizations by virtue of their structure and continuity explains why the criminal organization regime is considered exceptional. Groups of individuals acting in concert, where they lack structure and continuity, do not pose the same enhanced threat to society constituted by criminal organizations (Venneri, at paras. 27, 29 and 40). As Fish J. explained in Venneri:\nStripped of the features of continuity and structure, organized crime simply becomes all serious crime committed by a group of three or more persons for a material benefit. Parliament has already criminalized that activity through the offences of conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and the common intention provisions of the Code (see, e.g., ss. 21 and 465(1)). [para. 35]\nIdentifying a group as a criminal organization when it lacks the requisite qualities of structure and continuity would cast a net broader than that intended by Parliament and subject the group to the exceptional procedural and substantive consequences of the criminal organization regime (paras. 31 and 35).\nThe Crown and the majority of the Court of Appeal do not dispute that a criminal organization must have structure and continuity. However, they stress that the definition of a criminal organization must be applied flexibly and must not be limited to stereotypical models of organized crime. With respect, the Crown and the majority of the Court of Appeal conflate the legal requirement for a criminal organization to be structured and continuous with the flexibility needed to conduct the factual assessment of the circumstances in each case.\nCriminal organizations are opportunistic and adaptive. They vary based on which business model proves successful. They can take forms that do not fit stereotypical models of organized crime but nonetheless can pose the type of enhanced threat to society contemplated by Parliament. Thus, the definition of a criminal organization must be applied flexibly (see Venneri, at paras. 28 and 36-41; R. v. Terezakis, 2007 BCCA 384, 223 C.C.C. (3d) 344, at para. 34; Beauchamp, at paras. 145-48).\nHowever, flexibility in the acceptable forms of structure and degree of continuity does not mean that structure and continuity are optional (Venneri, at paras. 27-31). Rather, the group must have structure and continuity to give rise to the sort of enhanced threat to society that Parliament has sought to combat, bearing in mind the differences from other groups of offenders such as conspirators.\nImproper Reasoning\nI agree with the appellant and the intervener, the Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario, that careful consideration of a groups structure and continuity is needed to guard against improper reasoning in identifying a criminal organization. This is needed to avoid the risk that police, lawyers, juries, and judges could identify a group as a criminal organization based on shared characteristics such as ethnicity, cultural background, neighbourhood, religion, language, or dialect. While such characteristics may indicate a common social or cultural identity among persons who commit offences, they are irrelevant in identifying the existence of a criminal organization. To view such characteristics as indicative of organized crime is to depart from Parliaments intention and to do so in a way that undercuts a key goal of Canadian society, cultural diversity.\nThe flexibility with which the definition of a criminal organization is applied must not become an invitation for irrelevant considerations or improper reasoning. The risk of improper reasoning is especially acute where an accused is a member of a marginalized community, underrepresented among police, lawyers, jurors, or the judiciary, and whose characteristics and practices may well be less familiar and possibly the subject of biases, prejudices, or stereotypes among those tasked with enforcing the law and passing judgment. The courts have recognized the risks of racial bias or stereotypical reasoning, including subconscious biases, in the criminal justice system (see, e.g., R. v. Williams, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128, at paras. 21-22; Barton, at paras. 195-97). Just as the definition of a criminal organization must not be limited to stereotypical models of organized crime, care must also be taken not to identify a criminal organization merely because the group appears to satisfy some stereotypical model. The trier of facts focus when tasked with identifying a criminal organization needs at all times to remain fixed on whether the particular group in question possesses the distinguishing qualities of a criminal organization, i.e., structure and continuity.\nTrial judges play an important role in combatting biases, prejudices, and stereotypes in the courtroom (Barton, at para. 197). A suitable instruction on the requirements for a criminal organization is part of this. Under the general rules of evidence, courts can exclude evidence that is not relevant to this inquiry or where the prejudicial effect of the evidence would outweigh its probative value. Trial judges should provide a warning to juries of the risks of subconscious bias or improper reasoning where the circumstances warrant such a caution (para. 200).\nApplication to the Circumstances of This Case\nThe appellant alleges that the jury was not properly equipped to decide the case because the judge did not say something that he was required to say. This is an allegation of insufficient instruction.\nThe existence of a criminal organization is a required element of the offence of participation in the activities of a criminal organization. An instruction on this element is therefore mandatory. The alleged criminal organization must have structure and continuity to give rise to the sort of enhanced threat to society that Parliament has sought to combat. Therefore, in order for the jury to be sufficiently equipped to decide whether a criminal organization existed, the instruction must include an explanation of structure and continuity. \nThe trial judges instructions in this case did not sufficiently equip the jury to determine whether a criminal organization existed. Rather, the judge merely recited the definition in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code. This would not have equipped the jury with an understanding that a criminal organization must pose an enhanced threat to society by virtue of its structure and continuity. This requirement is not apparent from the bare text of the definition. To the contrary, in Venneri, Fish J. surveyed the jurisprudence where some trial courts had incorrectly found that very little or no organization was required (para. 27). Jurors cannot be expected to divine an interpretation of the statutory text that even judges could not ascertain before this Courts guidance. In so saying, I stress that there is no magic to the words structure and continuity; Fish J. in Venneri referred to other terms such as cohesiveness and endurance (para. 41). While it is better to use a consistent formulation (structure and continuity), whatever words are used, the judge needs to make clear to the jury the distinguishing qualities of a criminal organization.\nThe majority relied on portions of the evidence at trial, closing arguments of counsel, and the lack of objection from defence counsel as indicating that the instructions were sufficient. With respect, the majoritys reliance on these considerations was misplaced. The majoritys focus strayed from the ultimate function of jury instructions and the central inquiry on appellate review  whether the jury was properly equipped to decide the case.\nFirst, the existence of evidence that might have concerned structure and continuity could not have equipped the jury with an understanding that it needed to be satisfied that the group had structure and continuity in order to convict. Absent guidance from the judge, the jury might have convicted the accused without finding that the group in which he was involved possessed the distinguishing qualities of structure and continuity required by law.\nThe two aspects of the evidence at trial relied on by the majority warrant further comment. The evidence of Detective Kerr was, in my respectful view, the sort of evidence that risked inviting improper reasoning by the jury. His evidence did not relate to the structure or continuity of any particular criminal organization but referred generically to the nature, customs, culture, characteristics, identifiers, terminology, behaviour, and activities of urban street gangs (C.A. reasons, at para. 73). He agreed in cross-examination that many of these alleged indicia of organized criminality could just as easily indicate social bonding or participation in urban culture. The generic nature of this evidence posed a risk that the jury would find the existence of a criminal organization based on a stereotypical model of an urban street gang whose characteristics and practices may in some ways mirror the cultural norms of racialized communities in Toronto, or worse, may be the subject of biases, prejudices, and stereotypes. This aspect of the evidence, rather than indicating the sufficiency of the judges instructions, reinforces the importance of a clear instruction on structure and continuity as a guard against improper reasoning.\nThe other aspect of the evidence relied on by the majority of the Court of Appeal was also problematic. The Crown referred to the designation HNIC only for the purpose of identifying the appellant as one of the speakers overheard in the wiretaps. It was during sentencing that the Crown advanced the theory that the appellant was the leader of the alleged criminal organization, as demonstrated by its proposed decoding of the designation. Given the timing of these submissions, they could not be relevant to the sufficiency of the instructions to the jury.\nSecond, counsels closing arguments could not have filled the gap left by the judges omission of an instruction on the distinguishing qualities of a criminal organization. I note that, in accordance with accepted practice, counsel for both the defence and the Crown told the jury in closing arguments that the judge would explain the definition of a criminal organization; as well, the judge directed the jury to take their understanding of the law from him rather than from counsel.\nFinally, the lack of objection from defence counsel cannot make up for the insufficiency of the judges instructions in this case. As noted by Justice Paciocco, there is no suggestion that the lack of objection was tactical. The lack of structure and continuity was central to the defence on this count; defence counsel had nothing to gain by failing to object and it seems to have been an oversight on their part. At the end of the day, the judges omission of this mandatory instruction left the jury insufficiently equipped to decide a required element of the offence.\nIn light of the foregoing, the trial judge erred in law in his instruction to the jury on the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization. In this case, the circumstances of the trial relied on by the majority of the Court of Appeal could only have been relevant, if at all, to the curative proviso. However, the Crown has not sought to rely on the curative proviso in this case, and I therefore make no further comment on its potential application.\nConclusion\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the appellants conviction for participation in the activities of a criminal organization, and order a new trial on that count.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nThis appeal provides an opportunity to apply the functional approach to appellate review of jury charges (see, e.g., R. v. Goforth, 2022 SCC 25, at paras. 20-22; R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at paras. 8-9; R. v. Daley, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 31; R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 32). While my colleague purports to affirm this approach, with respect, he elevates form over substance and renders the contextual assessment more rigid in several ways.\nThe sole issue in this case is whether the jury understood the legal elements of the definition of criminal organization in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. There is no dispute that some form of structure and degree of continuity are required (R. v. Venneri, 2012 SCC 33, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 211, at para. 29). While the trial judges charge was not perfect, it would not have made any difference if he had used the precise words structure and continuity in explaining the definition. The jury knew it had to decide whether the appellant was a member of a group that (1) was organized; (2) existed for some period of time; and (3) went beyond one formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 203-13)  and which therefore, in substance, had some form of structure and degree of continuity.\nI am satisfied that, examined as a whole and in context, the judges charge properly equipped the jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence. I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the appellants conviction on the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization.\nLegal Principles\nLike my colleague, I will first review the legal principles applicable to appellate review of jury instructions. I will then discuss the legal elements of a criminal organization. Finally, I will apply these principles to determine whether the judges charge properly equipped the jury to decide the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization.\nFunctional Approach to Appellate Review of Jury Instructions\nThis Court has long held that an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly  and not necessarily perfectly  instructed (Goforth, at para. 20, citing Daley, at para. 31; Jacquard, at paras. 2 and 32). This functional approach to appellate review of jury instructions was reaffirmed last year by this Court in Goforth, summarized by the majority as follows:\n\tTrial judges are not held to a standard of perfection in crafting jury instructions (Daley, at para. 31). Rather, an appellate court must take a functional approach when reviewing a jury charge by examining the alleged errors in the context of the evidence, the entire charge, and the trial as a whole (R. v. Calnen, 2019 SCC 6, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 301, at para. 8; R. v. Pickton, 2010 SCC 32, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 198, at para. 10; R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at para. 32). It is the substance of the charge  and not adherence to or departure from a prescriptive formula  that is determinative (R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 54; R. v. Luciano, 2011 ONCA 89, 273 O.A.C. 273, at para. 69). As Bastarache J. instructed in Daley, at para. 30:\n\n. . . it is important for appellate courts to keep in mind the following. The cardinal rule is that it is the general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to the mind of the jury that matters, and not whether a particular formula was recited by the judge. The particular words used, or the sequence followed, is a matter within the discretion of the trial judge and will depend on the particular circumstances of the case. [Emphasis in original; para. 21.]\nIn Calnen, Moldaver J. described the approach in similar terms:\n\tAn appellate court undertakes a functional approach in reviewing a jury charge, asking whether the charge as a whole enabled the trier of fact to decide the case according to the law and the evidence . . . .\n\n\tIn short, the test is whether the jury was properly, not perfectly, instructed: R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 62. At the end of the day, the overriding question is whether the jury was properly equipped to decide the case absent a limiting instruction against general propensity reasoning. [paras. 8-9]\nThese principles are not disputed by the appellant. They were also not the subject of disagreement at the Court of Appeal for Ontario. While the Court of Appeal did not have the benefit of this Courts reasons in Goforth, both the majority and the dissent undertook a contextual review of the trial judges charge in accordance with this Courts prior jurisprudence. Brown J.A., writing for the majority, did exactly what this Court has instructed: he considered the impugned portion of the charge in context and in the circumstances of the trial as a whole.\nIn dissent, Paciocco J.A. likewise considered whether the charge, when examined as a whole and in the context of the entire case, . . . would in all probability have conveyed these elements of the offence [(structure and continuity)] to the jury (2021 ONCA 82, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at para. 121, quoting Daley, at para. 30). He disagreed with the majority not on the legal framework, i.e. the functional approach, but on its application to the judges charge in this case.\nNonetheless, my colleague seeks to provide further guidance on the established framework (paras. 1 and 30-72). This is unnecessary, and complicates or narrows the contextual assessment in several respects.\nFirst, my colleague categorizes errors in jury instructions as those related to accuracy or sufficiency, and within the latter category, instructions which are mandatory or contingent. This rigid characterization is unhelpful. I agree that a jury instruction that is not accurate may result in what has traditionally been called misdirection; one that is not sufficient may result in a case of non-direction. But in all cases, as my colleague recognizes, the relevant question is simply whether the charge properly equipped the jury to decide the case according to the law and the evidence (paras. 4, 29, 35-37, 57 and 72; see also Calnen, at para. 8; R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 54; Goforth, at para. 58). Similarly, a contingent instruction may be required in a particular case and thus become mandatory in the circumstances. In my view, bright-line categorization of this nature is unnecessary, and may create confusion.\nSecond, my colleague appears to narrow the contextual assessment as it relates to the submissions of counsel. While he accepts that in some circumstances, these can inform the sufficiency of the judges instructions, he confines this to filling gaps in the judges review of the evidence (paras. 63-64 (emphasis in original)).\nI am not convinced that the submissions of counsel should be so limited. In Daley, this Court held as follows:\n\tFinally, it should be recalled that the charge to the jury takes place not in isolation, but in the context of the trial as a whole. Appellate review of the trial judges charge will encompass the addresses of counsel as they may fill gaps left in the charge . . . . [Emphasis added; para. 58.]\nSubsequently, in R. v. Rodgerson, 2015 SCC 38, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 760, our Court considered whether the Crowns closing address was sufficient to remedy a legal deficiency in the jury charge (para. 35). In that case, because the submissions were scattered throughout a lengthy closing argument, many of them were vague and oblique, and the Crown never hit the nail on the head on the legal relevance of the evidence in question, they did not suffice to fill the gap and correct the legal error in the jury charge (para. 36 (emphasis added)). Moldaver J. elaborated on the distinction between cases of alleged misdirection and those of non-direction:\n\tI should also note, in regard to the instructions on Mr. Rodgersons flight from and lies to the police, that the legal error amounted to misdirection, not non-direction. The trial judge instructed the jury that it could use the evidence to infer that Mr. Rodgerson had the requisite intent for murder, when no such inference was available. The error was unrelated to a gap in the charge, and as such, the gap-filling principle contemplated by Daley could have no application. [Emphasis added; para. 37.]\nI agree that counsels submissions cannot serve to correct a misstatement or legal error made by a trial judge. But it may be possible, as this Court accepted in Rodgerson, for the submissions of counsel to help fill an alleged gap in the judges charge. As always, this must be assessed in the context of the trial as a whole.\nIn dissent in the court below, Paciocco J.A. also accepted that closing submissions may be relevant to the sufficiency of the charge (para. 143, referring to R. v. Niemi, 2017 ONCA 720, 355 C.C.C. (3d) 344), though only in rare circumstances. In Niemi, this related to the need for a temporal and causal connection between sexual assault and murder, a legal requirement of the offence (paras. 92-109). I would also note the subtle but important difference between counsels submissions and a trial judges summary or explanation of them, in the judges own words, for the jury. As I explain below, the trial judge in this case provided an overview of the defences position that referred directly to the organizational structure (or lack thereof) of the alleged criminal organization.\nWhile I am in substantial agreement with the remainder of my colleagues discussion of the legal framework, I would again emphasize that the functional approach has always been  and should remain  flexible and contextual. The impugned portion of a jury charge must be read in the context of the entire charge and the trial as a whole.\nDefinition of a Criminal Organization\nAt issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge properly charged the jury on the legal elements of a criminal organization, defined in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code as follows:\ncriminal organization means a group, however organized, that\n\n(a) is composed of three or more persons in or outside Canada; and\n\n(b) has as one of its main purposes or main activities the facilitation or commission of one or more serious offences that, if committed, would likely result in the direct or indirect receipt of a material benefit, including a financial benefit, by the group or by any of the persons who constitute the group.\n\nIt does not include a group of persons that forms randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence.\nIn Venneri, Fish J., writing for the Court, examined the objectives of this legislative regime at some length. By insisting that criminal groups be organized, he said, Parliament has made plain that some form of structure and degree of continuity are required:\n\tI agree with Mackenzie J.A. that a flexible approach favours the objectives of the legislative regime. In this context, flexibility signifies a purposive approach that eschews undue rigidity. That said, by insisting that criminal groups be organized, Parliament has made plain that some form of structure and degree of continuity are required to engage the organized crime provisions that are part of the exceptional regime it has established under the Code. [Emphasis added; para. 29.]\nFish J. then held that the word organized necessarily connotes some form of structure and co-ordination:\n\tQualifying organized in s. 467.1 by however cannot, as a matter of language or logic, be taken to signify that no element of organization is required at all. Organized necessarily connotes some form of structure and co-ordination, as appears from the definition of organized in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles (6th ed. 2007), vol. 2:\n\nFormed into a whole with interdependent parts; coordinated so as to form an orderly structure; systematically arranged. [Emphasis added; p. 2023.]\n\nIn French, the definitions in Le Grand Robert de la langue francaise (electronic version) are consistent with this: it defines the noun organisation as the [translation] [a]ction of organizing (something); the result of such an action and the verb organiser as [t]o give a specific structure or composition, order, or method of functioning or administration to . . . . [Emphasis in original; para. 30.]\nFish J. further noted that the words however and organized in the statutory definition are intended to be complementary, not contradictory:\nThus, the phrase however organized is meant to capture differently structured criminal organizations. But the group must nonetheless, at least to some degree, be organized. Disregarding the requirement of organization would cast a net broader than that intended by Parliament. [Underlining added; para. 31.]\nTherefore, the overriding question in this appeal is whether the jury was properly equipped to decide the case absent the trial judges use of the precise words structure and continuity in explaining the definition of a criminal organization (see Calnen, at para. 9). In his reasons, my colleague accepts that there is no magic to those precise words: While it is better to use a consistent formulation . . . whatever words are used, the judge needs to make clear to the jury the distinguishing qualities of a criminal organization (para. 89). However, my colleague relies on his own formulation of those qualities: that a criminal organization must pose an enhanced threat to society by virtue of its structure and continuity (ibid. (emphasis added); see also para. 5).\nWith respect, that differs from what this Court said in Venneri, which is that Parliament sought to identify groups that pose an elevated threat to society due to the ongoing and organized association of their members:\n\tIt is preferable by far to focus on the goal of the legislation, which is to identify and undermine groups of three or more persons that pose an elevated threat to society due to the ongoing and organized association of their members. All evidence relevant to this determination must be considered in applying the definition of criminal organization adopted by Parliament. Groups of individuals that operate on an ad hoc basis with little or no organization cannot be said to pose the type of increased risk contemplated by the regime.\n\n\tCourts must not limit the scope of the provision to the stereotypical model of organized crime  that is, to the highly sophisticated, hierarchical and monopolistic model. Some criminal entities that do not fit the conventional paradigm of organized crime may nonetheless, on account of their cohesiveness and endurance, pose the type of heightened threat contemplated by the legislative scheme. [Emphasis added; paras. 40-41.]\nIt is noteworthy that in Venneri, this Court used ongoing and organized and cohesiveness and endurance interchangeably, and without direct reference to structure and continuity. In R. v. Saikaley, 2017 ONCA 374, 135 O.R. (3d) 641, the Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously affirmed that the guiding question in assessing whether a group of individuals forms a criminal organization is whether the group pose[s] an elevated threat to society due to the ongoing and organized association of their members (para. 119, quoting Venneri, at para. 40). What is relevant is the substance of this requirement, not the precise form or exact words used.\nIn Saikaley, the Court of Appeal also emphasized that courts must take a flexible approach, appreciating that criminal organizations have no incentive to conform to any formal structure (para. 120, citing Venneri, at para. 28). In that case, the court found a criminal organization in a small operation with a loose structure (para. 126). In other cases, courts have affirmed that while a group must have some form of structure and degree of continuity, even a minimal amount may suffice (see, e.g., R. v. Beauchamp, 2015 ONCA 260, 326 C.C.C. (3d) 280, at para. 155).\nWith these principles in mind, I turn to the application of the functional approach in this case.\nApplication\nThere is no dispute that the trial judge accurately set out the statutory definition of a criminal organization in s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code. Indeed, he began his charge to the jury on the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization as follows:\nThe first element is the existence of a criminal organization. A criminal organization is\n\n(a) a group, however organized, that is composed of three or more persons in or outside Canada; and that\n\n(b) has, as one of its main purposes or activities, the facilitation or commission of one or more serious offences that, if committed, would likely result in the direct or indirect receipt of a material benefit including a financial benefit by the group or any one of the persons who constitute the group.\n\nIt is necessary to elaborate upon each of the components of that definition. A requirement of a group of three or more persons is not met if the group of three or more persons was formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. I, at pp. 203-4)\nMy colleague says that the trial judge was required to go beyond the statutory text given our Courts interpretation of criminal organization in Venneri. In my view, by instructing the jury that the group had to be organized, the judge made plain that some form of structure and degree of continuity were required. What matters is the general sense which the words used must have conveyed, in all probability, to the mind of the jury, not whether the judge recited a particular formula (Daley, at para. 30; Goforth, at para. 21). Jurors do not check their common sense at the door of the deliberation room (Goforth, at para. 58). In this case, the jury would have understood organized to necessarily connote some form of structure and co-ordination (Venneri, at para. 30). This is further evident or obvious when reviewing the context in which the judges instructions were given.\nFirst, having read the statutory text, the judge elaborated on the legal elements of a criminal organization:\nThe formation must not be random. The formation must not be for the purpose of committing an offence. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 204)\nBoth of these requirements speak directly to structure and continuity, if not in those exact words.\nSecond, the judge instructed the jury to recall the overview of the case for the Crown and defence. He summarized defence counsels position that a group randomly formed for the commission of one crime would not meet the legal requirements of the offence:\nOn the evidence, the most the Crown has proven against Abdullahi is that he was part of a group randomly formed for the commission of one crime on March 31, 2013. Such a group is not a criminal organization. [Emphasis added; pp. 210-11.]\nThis supplemented what the judge had stated earlier in his charge, in summarizing the defences position on the lack of an organizational structure:\nCount number one alleges that Abdullahi participated in the activities of a criminal organization. This offence does not include a group randomly formed for the commission of one offence. The organizational structure of the alleged group was not discussed in any of the conversations. The events of March 31, 2013 are, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, one crime committed by two people. This does not meet the definition of criminal organization. You should reject the position of the Crown on the issue of criminal organization in the submission of the defence. Return a verdict of not guilty on count one. [Emphasis added; p. 151.]\nThird, the judge emphasized that the appellant was required to be a member of the alleged organization for some period of time, again reinforcing the continuous nature of a criminal organization:\nA Defendant or some other person may become . . . a member and leave at any time thereafter for any reason. What is essential is probable membership for some period of time and not the length of the probable membership or the reason for leaving it. [Emphasis added; p. 213.]\nIn Venneri, Fish J. held that a group that operates with even a minimal degree of organization over a period of time is bound to capitalize on these advantages  i.e. those that flow from working collectively  and acquire a level of sophistication and expertise that poses an enhanced threat to the surrounding community (para. 36 (emphasis added)). While the judge in this case may not have described structure and continuity in those precise words, he did make expressly clear that the appellant had to be a member of a group that was organized and that his membership must have been for some period of time.\nFourth, as the majority at the Court of Appeal noted (see para. 79, per Brown J.A.), there was no dispute between the parties that a criminal organization had to have cohesiveness and continuity (as put by the Crown) or structure and continuity (as put by the defence). At trial, defence counsel stated as follows with respect to the definition of a criminal organization:\n. . . I want to read that to you again. Criminal organization does not include a group of persons that forms randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. The law tells us that to substantiate a criminal org charge you need some form of structure and a degree of continuity to the group, structure and continuity. So I put this to you, members of the jury; where is the structure and continuity to this group thats alleged to be a criminal organization? You have a number of people on the wires talking about bringing shekos, stories, which the Crown alleges to be guns, to Toronto, from Windsor, on Easter weekend, which is March 30 to 31st, 2013. There is no organizational structure ever discussed on the wires. In fact, I submit to you that this totally seems like a group of people forming randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. XXXII, at pp. 18-19)\nTo repeat, counsels explanation of the law cannot, on its own, replace the judges explanation. But the submissions of counsel are one of many factors to be assessed on appellate review  including, most importantly, what the judge did tell the jury, considered in the context of the trial as a whole.\nFifth, counsel for the appellant did not object to the judges draft charge. I further agree with the majority at the Court of Appeal that the common ground between the parties underlay defence counsels lack of objection to the charge (para. 80, per Brown J.A.). In Daley, this Court held as follows:\nAppellate review of the trial judges charge will encompass the addresses of counsel as they may fill gaps left in the charge: see Der, at p. 14-26. Furthermore, it is expected of counsel that they will assist the trial judge and identify what in their opinion is problematic with the judges instructions to the jury. While not decisive, failure of counsel to object is a factor in appellate review. The failure to register a complaint about the aspect of the charge that later becomes the ground for the appeal may be indicative of the seriousness of the alleged violation. See Jacquard, at para. 38: In my opinion, defence counsels failure to object to the charge says something about both the overall accuracy of the jury instructions and the seriousness of the alleged misdirection. [para. 58]\nIn this case, the judge provided counsel with a draft of the charge and sought comments in a two-day conference. This resulted in multiple submissions on other issues but not on the criminal organization portion of the charge. Though by no means decisive, trial counsels lack of objection supports the conclusion that the charge was adequate in the circumstances (see R. v. Mack, 2014 SCC 58, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 60).\nSixth, and finally, following the charge, the jury asked the judge three supplemental questions (see A.R., vol. XXXV, at pp. 3-13). Two related to the evidence and one sought to clarify the elements of the offence on a separate count, possession of property obtained by crime. The jury did not ask for clarification on the count of participation in the activities of a criminal organization. This also suggests that there was no confusion about the legal requirements of the offence.\nIn my view, when reviewed in its entirety and in context, the judges charge properly communicated to the jury the need to determine whether the appellant was a member of a group that posed an elevated threat to society due to the ongoing and organized association of its members (Venneri, at para. 40). These are the distinguishing qualities of a criminal organization, which may in turn be described by the words structure and continuity.\nMy colleague relies on R. v. Boudreault, 2012 SCC 56, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 157, for the proposition that it is not unusual for courts to read in requirements to Criminal Code provisions that are not apparent from the text itself (para. 52). In Boudreault, at para. 33 (emphasis deleted), this Court read in a realistic risk of danger to persons or property requirement that was not plain or obvious from the text of the former s. 253(1) of the Criminal Code, which read as follows:\n253 (1) Every one commits an offence who operates a motor vehicle or vessel . . . or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft or railway equipment, whether it is in motion or not,\n\n(a) while the persons ability to operate the vehicle, vessel, aircraft or railway equipment is impaired by alcohol or a drug; or\n\n(b) having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in the persons blood exceeds eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood.\nThis is distinguishable from the requirements of structure and continuity, which Parliament has made plain through the statutory language. The use of the word organized necessarily connotes some form of structure and co-ordination (Venneri, at para. 30); by contrast, in Boudreault, the majority of this Court read in [a] new essential element to narrow the ordinary meaning of the words care or control (para. 86, per Cromwell J., dissenting).\nMy colleague also refers to a lone example of a case in which it was insufficient for a judge to simply recite the relevant provisions to the jury without explaining the meaning given to them in the jurisprudence (para. 52, citing R. v. Maxwell (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 322 (Ont. C.A.)). As discussed above, I disagree that the judge in this case simply recited s. 467.1(1) of the Criminal Code. In my view, he elaborated beyond the statutory text, including on the need to establish membership for some period of time. In any event, I find that Maxwell is also distinguishable. At issue in Maxwell was whether the accused was involved in a store robbery. In his charge to the jury, the judge stated as follows:\nAnother section of the Criminal Code which you should also bear in mind and, depending upon what you find the facts to be, may or may not be relevant and, as I have no way of knowing what findings of fact you will make, I must direct your attention to this section of the Criminal Code. [Emphasis added; p. 323.]\nThe judge then read the two subsections of s. 21, which relate to party liability and common intention. He did not give any explanation as to which subsection might apply, how they might be applicable, or the possible status of the accused as a party to the robbery (see pp. 323-24). In this case, there is no suggestion that the judge failed to explain how the definition of a criminal organization related to the offence of participation in the activities of such an organization.\nIn cases of alleged non-direction, as was discussed at the hearing, the question may come down to the degree of obviousness of the point of law at issue. While I accept that certain legal requirements are not obvious or plain from the statutory text  for example, mens rea requirements for various offences  the point of law at issue in the instant case was obvious or plain to the jury, in the context of the entire charge and the trial as a whole.\nWith respect, my colleagues discussion of stereotypical or improper reasoning (at paras. 84-86 and 92) is also misplaced. First, the issue in this case is not whether structure and continuity serve as safeguards against stereotypical or improper reasoning. It is whether the jury understood structure and continuity to be legal requirements of the offence, based on what the judge did tell the jury.\nSecond, this issue was not discussed in the court below, including by Paciocco J.A. in dissent. The appellant himself states that it may have been possible for the jury to infer a continuous group based on a shared neighbourhood, loyalty to ones friends, and the commission of similar crimes  or perhaps even in combination with the shared cultural indicia  but the trial judge was required to adequately equip them to assess this evidence, which in turn required an instruction on the elements of structure and continuity (A.F., at para. 35). This reinforces that the issue in this case is simply whether the jury understood the legal elements of the definition of a criminal organization, absent the judges use of the precise words structure and continuity.\nThird, Detective Kerrs evidence was not contested by the defence at trial (see A.R., vol. I, at p. 59; A.R., vol. XXXII, at pp. 15 and 20). The trial judge related his evidence to photographs of the appellant showing certain indicia of gang membership, as well as to certain behaviours consistent with street gangs (see A.R., vol. I, at pp. 99, 113, 151, 211 and 214). I agree that evidence of a common social or cultural identity does not identify the existence of a criminal organization. But there is a significant difference between this, in a generic sense, and indicia of the appellants gang membership more specifically, such as displays of the Bloods hand sign. While the nature of a jury trial necessarily means that the jurys reasons for a guilty verdict are unclear, Detective Kerrs evidence was only part of the evidence put forward by the Crown to prove the existence of a criminal organization. The Crown also relied, crucially, on intercepted wiretap conversations in which the appellant discussed plans to transport firearms on an ongoing basis.\nFinally, I reiterate and emphasize that an accused is entitled to a jury that is properly  and not necessarily perfectly  instructed (Goforth, at para. 20; Daley, at para. 31; Jacquard, at paras. 2 and 32). In Jacquard, Lamer C.J. held that appellate courts must ensure that the yardstick by which we measure the fitness of a trial judges directions to the jury does not become overly onerous (para. 1). He elaborated as follows:\nWe must strive to avoid the proliferation of very lengthy charges in which judges often quote large extracts from appellate decisions simply to safeguard verdicts from appeal. Neither the Crown nor the accused benefits from a confused jury. Indeed justice suffers.\n\nThese comments are not meant to suggest that we sanction misdirected verdicts. This Court has stated on repeated occasions that accused individuals are entitled to properly instructed juries. There is, however, no requirement for perfectly instructed juries. As I specifically indicated at the hearing of this case, a standard of perfection would render very few judges in Canada, including myself, capable of charging juries to the satisfaction of such a standard. [Emphasis in original; paras. 1-2.]\nIn R. v. Araya, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, this Court reiterated that jury charges are not to be endlessly dissected and subjected to minute scrutiny and criticism (para. 39, quoting R. v. Cooper, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, at p. 163). In Goforth, the majority of this Court upheld a jury charge as functionally adequate despite what the minority characterized as five separate instances in which the judge misstated an essential element of the offence (see para. 62, per Brown J.).\nIn this case, there is no suggestion that the judge misstated the law or misdirected the jury. At issue is whether the judge said enough in explaining the legal elements of a criminal organization, one of multiple counts against multiple defendants and as part of a lengthy charge that spanned over 200 transcript pages.\nUndoubtedly, the judge could have said more. But a failure to say all that could have been said does not amount to a legal error (Mack, at para. 59). In the context of the entire charge and the trial as a whole, the need for some form of structure and degree of continuity was made plain to the jury. The jury understood that the group had to be organized, that membership had to be for some period of time, and that the legal requirements of the offence were not met if the group was formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 203-13). I fail to see how a group could meet these requirements  as the jury must have found in order to convict  but nonetheless lack some form of structure or degree of continuity. While the judges charge was not perfect, the jury was properly equipped to decide the case according to the law and the evidence.\nAs a result, it is unnecessary to deal with the application of the curative proviso. I agree with my colleague that certain evidence relied on by the majority of the Court of Appeal could have been relevant to the proviso, including that which led the sentencing judge to conclude that the appellant was a principal member and leader of the criminal organization (2015 ONSC 4163, at p. 9 (CanLII); see C.A. reasons, at paras. 73-74 and 103, per Brown J.A.). However, given my disposition of the case and because the Crown did not invoke the curative proviso, I would make no further comment on its potential or alternative application in this case.\nDisposition\nFor the reasons above, I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the appellants conviction on count 1 for participation in the activities of a criminal organization. I would add that, as a practical matter, it would be a waste of judicial resources to order a new trial, as the accused has been released for time served.\n\tAppeal allowed, Cote J. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Edward H.

The Crown claimed that Abdullahi was a member of an urban street gang with the main purpose of facilitating serious offences for material benefits.\n\nThe court process began with an investigation into firearm trafficking, leading to Abdullahi's arrest and subsequent trial. A jury found him guilty of various offenses, including participating in a criminal organization. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, his appeal was dismissed by a majority decision; however, one dissenting judge would have allowed it due to inadequate jury instructions on structure and continuity requirements for a criminal organization definition.

A jury convicted him of various  firearm offences and one count of participation in the activities of a criminal  organization for the purpose of trafficking weapons, contrary to section 467.11  of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. This last  conviction was the only issue before the Supreme Court of Canada. Under section 467.11, the Crown  must first prove the existence of a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d. The <em>Criminal Code </em>defines a criminal  organization as a group of three or more people, however organized, that  facilitates or commits a serious offence for a financial or other benefit.  Organized crimes attract greater police powers for certain authorizations and  warrants, and harsher sentences than those committed by groups that come  together randomly to commit a single offence. In its 2012 judgment in <em>R. v. Venneri</em>, the Supreme Court of  Canada said that for a criminal organization to be \u201corganized\u201d, it must have  \u201csome form of structure and degree of continuity\u201d. Before members of the jury  started their deliberations, the trial judge instructed them on the required  elements of the criminal organization offence, including the need to first  prove the existence of such an organization. On that element of the offence,  the judge read the definition of a criminal organization but did not mention  the need to identify a structure and a degree of continuity to qualify a group  as such. In the end, the jury found Mr. Abdullahi guilty on all counts,  including that of participating in the activities of a criminal organization  for the purpose of trafficking weapons. On appeal, Mr. Abdullahi argued  the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury was insufficient because it failed to  explain that a criminal organization must have structure and continuity. The  majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal and concluded  that the jury had been properly instructed. The dissenting judge disagreed and  would have ordered a new trial on that count. Mr. Abdullahi appealed the  conviction to this Court. The Supreme Court has allowed the  appeal. <strong>The trial judge\u2019s instruction did not sufficiently equip the jury to  decide if a criminal organization existed.</strong>\r\n     Writing for the majority, Justice  Rowe first explained that the role of a court of appeal in reviewing a trial  judge\u2019s jury instruction is to ensure the jury was properly equipped to decide  the case according to the law and the evidence. To equip a jury properly, it  needs an accurate and a sufficient understanding of the law. In this case, the trial judge  failed to explain to the jury that a criminal organization is one that by  virtue of its structure and continuity poses an enhanced threat to society. Institutional  advantages such as consolidating and retaining knowledge, sharing customers and  resources, developing specializations, and fostering trust and loyalty  distinguish criminal organizations from other groups of individuals acting in  concert, where they lack structure and continuity, and do not pose the same  enhanced threat to society. Moreover, careful consideration of a group\u2019s  structure and continuity is needed to guard against improper reasoning based on  shared characteristics, such as ethnicity or neighbourhood, in identifying a  criminal organization. As Justice Rowe said, \u201c[w]hile such characteristics may  indicate a common social or cultural identity among persons who commit  offences, they are irrelevant in identifying the existence of a criminal  organization\u201d.

For these reasons, he allowed the appeal, set aside the  appellant\u2019s conviction for participation in the activities of a criminal  organization, and ordered a new trial on that count."}, "16": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Basque\tAppellant\nv.\nHis Majesty The King\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Alberta\tIntervener\nIndexed as: R. v.

C-46, ss. 259(1)(a), 719(1).\n\tAfter being charged with a summary conviction impaired driving offence, the offender was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle while awaiting trial. She remained subject to that prohibition until she was sentenced 21 months later. At the time of the offence, s. 259(1)(a) of the Criminal Code (Cr. C.) required the court to make an order prohibiting an offender charged with a first impaired driving offence from operating a motor vehicle during a period of not less than one year. The sentencing judge imposed a one-year driving prohibition on the offender and chose to backdate the order to the first day of the pre-sentence prohibition, which meant that the period prescribed by law had been completed in full by the date of his decision.\n\tThe summary conviction appeal judge dismissed the Crowns appeal. While noting that the sentencing judge had erred in backdating the prohibition, he found that the sentencing judge could nevertheless give credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition as long as such a prohibition was a condition of release and also part of the sentence later imposed. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the Crowns subsequent appeal, holding that there is no authority for giving credit so as to depart from a mandatory minimum provided for by statute.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\n\tIt was open to the sentencing judge to take into account the period of 21 months already served by the offender, as this would not undermine Parliaments intent in enacting the mandatory minimum. No conflict arises from the concurrent application of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. and the common law rule that allows credit to be granted. At the time of sentencing, the court is required to impose the one-year mandatory minimum, but there is nothing in the statute that prevents it from then granting credit. Similarly, granting credit is not contrary to the rule set out in s. 719(1) Cr. C. requiring that a sentence commence when it is imposed. Only the sentence has to commence when it is imposed, not the one-year mandatory minimum served under s. 259(1)(a). These statutory provisions therefore do not displace the common law discretion of sentencing judges, recognized in R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, to grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition.\n\tCanadian criminal law is made up of both statute law and common law principles. This coexistence of statute and common law is a feature of the law of sentencing. While the Criminal Code codifies the fundamental principles of sentencing, courts can also take account of other principles and factors arising from the common law. Although legislation may prevail over the common law, the latter remains applicable insofar as it has not been displaced expressly or by necessary implication, a principle justified by the importance of stability in the law. The two-step framework used to analyze the interaction between legislation and the common law is well settled. The first step is analyzing, identifying and setting out the applicable common law; and then, at the second step, the statute laws effect on the common law must be specified.\n\tWith regard to the first step of the analysis, the common law allows courts to grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition imposed on an offender. This common law discretion is a natural extension of an analogous principle that applies in the context of pre-sentence custody. Courts have long recognized that they can take into consideration, in imposing a sentence, any period of incarceration that the offender has already undergone between the date of arrest and the date of sentencing. Giving credit for the time an offender is subject to pre-sentence custody is part of the central principles of sentencing, although it is not statutorily expressed. The principle that credit can be granted for pre-sentence custody serves to mitigate certain injustices arising from the application of the principle that a sentence may not be backdated, now codified in s. 719(1). While Canadian law does not permit courts to backdate a sentence in order to reduce it, they may nevertheless consider the time spent in pre-sentence custody in determining the period that must be served prospectively by an offender. The application of this common law rule allowing credit to be granted is therefore not equivalent to backdating a sentence.\n\tFurthermore, the absence of a statutory provision for pre-sentence driving prohibitions that is equivalent to s. 719(3) Cr. C., which codifies the granting of credit in the case of pre-sentence custody, does not have the effect of displacing or limiting the common law rule allowing credit to be granted. Absent clear legislative intention to the contrary, a statute should not be interpreted as substantially changing the law, including the common law. Section 719(3) was enacted in the specific context of pre-sentence custody, and the legislative debates suggest that Parliaments intention was to ensure that credit could still be granted when a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment was imposed. There is no indication that Parliament considered whether credit could be given for a pre-sentence driving prohibition. There is also nothing in the legislative debates to support the position that Parliament sought to displace, whether expressly or by necessary implication, the common law rule applicable to such prohibitions. This is not a situation in which Parliament made clear its intention to displace or limit the applicable common law.\n\tWith regard to the second step in the analysis, s. 259(1)(a) does not limit the scope of the common law rule that allows credit to be granted for a pre-sentence driving prohibition. The discretionary authority to grant credit under the common law can coexist harmoniously with judicial adherence to a mandatory minimum established by statute. This coexistence rests on the well-known distinction between the concepts of punishment, understood as a deprivation, and of sentence, understood as a judicial decision (in French, the distinction between punition and sentence, where the term peine can also be used to convey both meanings). While the French term peine used in the sense of punishment refers to the total punishment imposed on an offender, the same word when used to mean sentence refers to the decision rendered by the court, which is always prospective in order to prevent the judicial practice of backdating sentences.\n\tIn accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the reach of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. must be determined by considering its text, context and purpose. Properly interpreted, s. 259(1)(a) provides for a minimum punishment, not a minimum sentence. Interpreting s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. as providing for the imposition of a one-year global punishment is perfectly in keeping with the objectives of deterrence and punishment that underlie the provision. Parliaments intention is respected whether the punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced, because the effect on the offender is the same in either case. Though silent with respect to credit, the provision is not ambiguous: it can be read in only one way, that is, as providing for the imposition of a mandatory minimum punishment. If s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. required that a minimum sentence be handed down, the appropriate difference between the punishments imposed on the most dangerous offenders and those imposed on the least dangerous offenders could be unduly eroded, and the precise gradation of minimum prohibition periods established by Parliament in s. 259(1) would be undermined. Absent a clear intention to this effect, it must be presumed that Parliament did not intend to produce such absurd results. In addition to leaving room for the exercise of the courts discretion to grant credit, this interpretation of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. is consistent with general principles of sentencing and does not offend the integrity of the criminal justice system.\n\tIn this case, the imposition of an additional one-year punishment would amount to a kind of double punishment, contrary to the most fundamental requirements of justice and fairness. By the time the sentencing decision was rendered, it had been 21 months since the offender had essentially begun serving her sentence. Conscious of this fact, the sentencing judge ordered a one-year driving prohibition but found that the offender had already satisfied this condition. However, he backdated the offenders sentence to achieve this result, which was an error. He could quite properly have imposed the one-year mandatory minimum punishment required by s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., stated that a sentence commences when it is imposed under s. 719(1) Cr. C., and then granted credit for the pre-sentence driving prohibition period by exercising his common law discretion, which has not been displaced by the Criminal Code.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: R. v.

McKee, for the appellant.\n\tPatrick McGuinty and Pierre Gionet, for the respondent.\n\tElisa Frank, for the intervener.\n\tEnglish version of the judgment of the Court delivered by\n\n\tKasirer J.  \nOverview\nAfter being charged with a summary conviction impaired driving offence in 2017, the appellant, Jennifer Basque, was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle while awaiting trial. She remained subject to that prohibition until she was sentenced 21 months later. At the time of the offence, s. 259(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (Cr. C.), required the court to make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle . . . during a period of . . . not less than one year.\nCould the sentencing judge credit Ms. Basque for the driving prohibition period already served, notwithstanding the combined effect of that one-year mandatory minimum prohibition and the direction  codified in s. 719(1) Cr. C.  that except where otherwise provided, a sentence commences when it is imposed?\nIf not for the requirement in s. 259(1)(a), granting credit would undoubtedly be possible. Indeed, in R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089  a case that did not concern a mandatory minimum prohibition  this Court confirmed that there is a common law judicial discretion to grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition. This discretion is a natural extension of the longstanding practice of crediting offenders for periods of pre-sentence custody.\nProvided that Parliament respects the relevant constitutional constraints, it can, of course, enact legislation that displaces the common law rule allowing credit to be granted for a pre-sentence driving prohibition. Ms. Basque does not challenge the constitutionality of s. 259(1)(a) but argues that her request for credit is not limited in any way by the imposition of the mandatory minimum prohibition. The respondent Crown, relying on the majority reasons of the Court of Appeal, argues instead that granting credit in this case would conflict with the application of the one-year minimum prohibition, even though the relevant statutory provision is silent on crediting.\nRespectfully, I believe that the respondent is mistaken. In my view, granting credit based on the common law discretion recognized in Lacasse is perfectly consistent with the application of the minimum prohibition in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. and with the rule requiring that a sentence commence when it is imposed in s. 719(1) Cr. C. It was therefore open to the sentencing judge to take into account the period of 21 months already served by Ms. Basque, as this would not undermine Parliaments intent.\nThe discretionary authority to grant credit under the common law can coexist harmoniously with judicial adherence to a mandatory minimum established by statute. This coexistence rests on the well-known distinction between the concepts of punishment, understood as a deprivation, and of sentence, understood as a judicial decision (in French, the distinction between punition and sentence, where the term peine can also be used to convey both meanings). This distinction, considered by Rosenberg J.A. in the context of credit for pre-sentence custody in R. v. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), was taken up by Arbour J. of this Court in R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, at paras. 35-37, with particular attention to the multiple meanings of the French term peine. From this perspective, Arbour J. explained that while the term peine used in the sense of punishment refers to the total punishment imposed on an offender, the same word when used to mean sentence refers to the decision rendered by the court. It bears noting that a sentence is always prospective in order to prevent the judicial practice of backdating sentences (see s. 719(1) Cr. C.).\nAs a general rule, the purpose of a mandatory minimum is to impose on an offender an effective punishment of a specified minimum length. This is so because the objectives underlying a minimum punishment are achieved equally well whether the punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced. In the instant case, the mandatory minimum provided for in s. 259(1)(a) is no exception to this rule.\nProperly interpreted, s. 259(1)(a) requires the court to impose a total punishment of one year to be served by the offender, not to hand down a sentence imposing a one-year prohibition that must necessarily be served prospectively. As Rosenberg J.A. noted in McDonald, Parliaments intention is respected whether the punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced, because the effect on the offender is the same in either case. Interpreted in this way, s. 259(1)(a) did not prohibit the sentencing judge from reducing the sentence by granting credit for the pre-sentence driving prohibition period, as long as the total punishment remained consistent with the minimum prescribed by Parliament.\nBy the time the trial judgment was rendered in this case, it had been 21 months since Ms. Basque had essentially begun serving [her] sentence (see R. v. Sharma, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 814, at p. 818, cited with approval by Wagner J., as he then was, in Lacasse, at para. 113). When considered from this perspective, the objectives of the minimum punishment set out in s. 259(1)(a) had already been met  and even surpassed. In such a context, granting credit to reduce the length of the prohibition imposed on Ms. Basque does not conflict with s. 259(1)(a) because she has already served a driving prohibition period exceeding the one-year minimum required by that provision. Crediting also addresses the considerations of fairness and justice touched on in Wust, including what Paciocco J.A. usefully described in an academic paper as the aversion to double punishment (D. M. Paciocco, The Law of Minimum Sentences: Judicial Responses and Responsibility (2015), 19 Can. Crim. L.R. 173, at p. 211).\nIn short, no conflict arises from the concurrent application of s. 259(1)(a) and the common law rule that allows credit to be granted. At the time of sentencing, the court is required to impose the one-year mandatory minimum punishment, but there is nothing in the statute that prevents it from then granting credit. Similarly, granting credit is not contrary to the requirement set out in s. 719(1) Cr. C. because only the sentence has to commence when it is imposed, not the one-year minimum punishment served under s. 259(1)(a). These statutory provisions therefore do not displace the discretion of sentencing judges that was recognized in Lacasse. Of course, Parliament remains free, within the constraints imposed by the Constitution, to limit this discretion, but it must do so through a clear provision to that effect (Lizotte v. Aviva Insurance Company of Canada, 2016 SCC 52, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 521, at para. 56). There is no such provision here, as s. 259(1)(a) is silent regarding the granting of credit.\nFurthermore, the codification of the discretion to give credit for pre-sentence custody in s. 719(3) Cr. C. has no impact on this appeal. Like s. 259(1)(a), s. 719(3) is unambiguous, and it is also silent with respect to driving prohibitions. Here, the absence of an analogous provision for driving prohibitions does not signify a positive intention by Parliament to eliminate the discretion recognized in Lacasse, a case which, I should add, was decided after s. 719(3) was enacted.\nIn light of the foregoing, and given that Ms. Basque has already been prohibited from driving for 21 months, the imposition of an additional one-year prohibition period would amount to a kind of double punishment, contrary to the most fundamental requirements of justice and fairness. Conscious of this fact, the sentencing judge ordered a one-year driving prohibition but found that Ms. Basque had already satisfied this condition. However, he backdated Ms. Basques sentence to achieve this result. With respect, this was an error. He could quite properly have imposed the one-year mandatory minimum punishment required by s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., stated that a sentence commences when it is imposed under s. 719(1) Cr. C., and then granted credit for the pre-sentence driving prohibition period by exercising his common law discretion, which has not been displaced by the Criminal Code.\nFor the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal. I would restore the judgment of the summary conviction appeal court and reinstate the sentencing judges conclusions in part, for different reasons. I would specify that the appellant has already served the mandatory minimum prohibition provided for in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C.\nFacts\nOn the night of October 7, 2017, the appellant was driving her vehicle in downtown Moncton, New Brunswick. Constable Richard, who was patrolling the area, noticed that the vehicle was being driven erratically and stopped it. The interaction between the appellant and the police officer took place in French in keeping with the preference expressed by Ms. Basque. The constable had her take a breathalyzer test, which showed a blood alcohol level above the legal limit. Ms. Basque was then arrested for operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood.\nOn November 30, Ms. Basque was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle. She was later charged with impaired driving under the former s. 253(1)(b) Cr. C.\nMs. Basque initially pleaded not guilty to the charge brought against her. The trial was scheduled for June 2018 but was later adjourned at her request. In October of that year, Ms. Basque pleaded guilty and stated that she intended to apply for a conditional discharge under s. 255(5) Cr. C. (now repealed).\nAt the sentencing hearing in the Provincial Court  delayed by adjournments  Ms. Basque waived her right to proceed in French and abandoned her application for a conditional discharge. Following discussion of her criminal history, it was determined that a prohibition applicable to a first offence was to be imposed on her under s. 259(1)(a). The Crown did not seek a term of imprisonment, and the parties reached an agreement on the amount of the fine to be set in her case.\nBetween her initial appearance and the date she was sentenced, Ms. Basque was subject to a driving prohibition for 21 months.\nJudicial History\nNew Brunswick Provincial Court (McCarroll Prov. Ct. J.)\nThe sentencing judge acknowledged Ms. Basques difficult past, which included a very abusive childhood. He also noted that driving her vehicle was important to her. She had to travel to Fredericton to take part in hearings concerning the custody of her children, and the use of public transportation for that purpose placed her in a financially precarious position. Mindful of this reality, and taking account of the fact that Ms. Basque had been subject to a pre-sentence driving prohibition for 21 months, the judge granted her uncontested request that he not impose any further prohibition.\nAt the hearing, the judge commented as follows on the possible terms of the order he had to make: . . . Im not sure of whether to word it, driving prohibition one year which has been completed because of her two years of  of prohibited driving [as a result of the pre-sentence prohibition], or simply say, no driving prohibition. Im inclined to take the first approach because the law obliges me to  to order [the prohibition]  but I think it might be safer to back  to order it and then back-date it and say, you know, shes already been without the licence by a court order for  for over two years (A.R., vol. I, at p. 16). In the end, the judge chose to backdate the order prohibiting Ms. Basque from operating a vehicle to November 30, 2017  the first day of the pre-sentence prohibition  which meant that the prohibition had been completed in full by the date of the decision. He also imposed the minimum fine of $1,000.\nNew Brunswick Court of Queens Bench, 2020 NBQB 130, 65 M.V.R. (7th) 208 (Dysart J.)\nThe summary conviction appeal judge heard an appeal by the Crown, which argued that the sentencing judge had erred in law in backdating the sentence. Relying on the principles laid down by this Court in Lacasse and Wust, the appeal judge dismissed the appeal, finding that the sentencing judge could give credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition as long as such a prohibition was a condition of release and also part of the sentence later imposed (para. 28).\nIllustrating his point using two decisions that relied on Lacasse  R. v. Bland, 2016 YKSC 61, 3 M.V.R. (7th) 112, and R. v. Edwards (2016), 382 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 225 (N.L. Prov. Ct.)  the appeal judge noted that the sentencing judge had not imposed a prohibition period that was less than the minimum provided for in the Criminal Code. Through his decision, the sentencing judge had imposed a driving prohibition on Ms. Basque for a total of one year, in accordance with s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., and then credited her for the pre-sentence prohibition to which she had been subject (para. 29). It was not an error of law to do so. Finally, the appeal judge noted that the error of backdating the sentence had not affected the decision rendered, as no further driving prohibition was indicated in this case (para. 30).\nNew Brunswick Court of Appeal, 2021 NBCA 50, 84 M.V.R. (7th) 1 (Richard C.J., Baird J.A. concurring; French J.A., dissenting)\nThe issue before the Court of Appeal was framed as follows: Did the summary appeal court judge err by affirming the Provincial Court Judges jurisdiction to reduce the s. 259(1)[(a)] (now s. 320.24(2)(a)) mandatory driving prohibition below its one year minimum by giving credit for the time during which a pre-sentence prohibition was served by the Respondent (Basque) as a release undertaking? (para. 10). Richard C.J. stated that the question was not whether the pre-sentence prohibition period could reduce the post-trial prohibition period, but rather whether it may reduce this period below the one-year minimum (para. 12 (emphasis in original)).\nThe Court of Appeal was divided on this question. The majority, in reasons written by the Chief Justice, granted the Crowns application for leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. While it is indeed possible to give credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition in certain circumstances, the majority wrote, there is no authority for giving such credit so as to depart from a mandatory minimum provided for by statute. The majority stated that Lacasse could not offer guidance in this case because it dealt with a discretionary driving prohibition that was not subject to a mandatory minimum (paras. 18-19). The purpose of a mandatory minimum is precisely to limit judicial discretion. The appeal before the Court of Appeal was also fundamentally different from Wust, which concerned the possibility of granting credit for pre-sentence custody under s. 719(3). However, there is no equivalent to s. 719(3) for driving prohibitions.\nSection 259(1)(a) is not ambiguous when interpreted in accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the majority stated, and no credit can be granted to make the prohibition imposed less than the minimum period provided for by that provision. Moreover, the interpretation proposed by Ms. Basque would render s. 719(3) meaningless because the exception it creates would then apply to all mandatory minimums and no longer solely to custodial sanctions as stated in the provision (para. 27). The majority rejected the argument that the unavailability of credit would lead to absurd results, noting that [w]hile mandatory minimums are sometimes unfair, it is not for this Court to call them absurd (para. 31). Since a sentence begins on the day it is imposed, such credit cannot be granted [b]arring a successful constitutional challenge or clear direction from the Supreme Court (para. 39). In the circumstances, the summary conviction appeal judge had erred in crediting Ms. Basque for the length of her pre-sentence driving prohibition, thereby failing to impose the mandatory minimum.\nFrench J.A., dissenting, wrote that there is no doubt that the law requires a driving prohibition to be imposed for not less than the applicable minimum period. However, he was of the view that the prohibition may be reduced to less than the applicable minimum by granting credit for a pre-sentence prohibition period, as long as the total driving prohibition still exceeds the mandatory minimum (para. 58).\nThe dissenting judge found that while the language of s. 259(1)(a) is generally clear, it is ambiguous with respect to the possibility of granting credit. Quoting McDonald, and drawing an analogy with Wust, he noted that absurd results would flow from interpreting s. 259(1)(a) as preventing credit from being granted. Moreover, the absence of a provision equivalent to s. 719(3) Cr. C. for driving prohibitions does not mean that Parliament intended to prohibit the granting of such credit. In fact, this Court in Lacasse expressly recognized that it is possible to grant such credit in the context of a pre-sentence driving prohibition and that this principle applies generally (para. 121).\nFinally, both the majority and the dissenting judge agreed that the execution of the order pertaining to Ms. Basque should be stayed. The release conditions in this case were unreasonable, even if she had not initially challenged them. The result of the pre-sentence prohibition was that Ms. Basque had actually been treated more harshly before being sentenced than after. In the particular circumstances of this case, and in order to avoid committing an injustice and disproportionately punish[ing] Ms. Basque, the Court of Appeal held that the execution of any further prohibition should be stayed (majority reasons, at para. 54; see also the dissenting judges reasons, at para. 132).\nIssue\nMs. Basque raises a number of issues in this Court. They can be summarized in the following manner: Can the appellant be granted credit for the time she spent subject to a pre-sentence driving prohibition notwithstanding the one-year mandatory minimum prohibition period set forth in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C.?\nAnalysis\nKey Statutory Provisions\nAt the time of the events, the former s. 259(1) Cr. C. made a driving prohibition order mandatory for certain impaired driving offences, including the summary conviction offence relevant to this case (similarly, see the current s. 320.24(2) Cr. C., enacted by S.C. 2018, c. 21). Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of s. 259(1) established a gradation of mandatory minimum prohibition periods that took into account the offenders previous convictions for such offences:\nSection 718.3(2), which is in the division of the Criminal Code dealing with Punishment Generally, provides that the punishment to be imposed (peine a infliger in French) is in the courts discretion, subject to the limitations set out in the enactment prescribing the punishment in question:\nThe parties also focused attention on s. 719. Its first subsection is entitled Commencement of sentence (in French, the word peine is used as the parallel term to sentence in this context). Section 719(3) is entitled Determination of sentence (Infliction de la peine in French). These provisions read as follows:\nIt is appropriate at the outset to recognize that linguistic usage in this area of sentencing is often uneven, be it in legislation, jurisprudence or scholarship. In the title for s. 259(1) Cr. C., Parliament spoke of a mandatory order of prohibition / ordonnance dinterdiction obligatoire. In the English-language reasons of the Court of Appeal in this case, the terms mandatory minimum, mandatory minimum sentence and mandatory driving prohibition are used. In the French-language version of the reasons, peine minimale obligatoire and periode minimale dinterdiction predominate. In the Criminal Code more broadly, the terms minimum punishment / peine minimale are frequently used as equivalents (see, e.g., R. v. Hilbach, 2023 SCC 3, at paras. 2 and 12, interpreting s. 344(1) Cr. C. and using both mandatory minimum sentence / peine minimale obligatoire and mandatory minimum punishment / peine minimale obligatoire). That said, as Arbour J. wrote in Wust, [w]hat is fundamental is less the words chosen, in the French or English version, but the concepts that they carry (para. 36).\nGrounds of Appeal\nIn this Court, the appellant concedes that the sentencing judge erred in backdating her sentence; she acknowledges that he should have made the sentence commence when it was imposed in accordance with s. 719(1) Cr. C. She also acknowledges that s. 259(1)(a) provides that a driving prohibition must be imposed for a period of not less than one year. However, she submits  essentially adopting the summary conviction appeal judges position  that the prohibition imposed by the sentencing judge was not below the mandatory minimum. Based on the principles laid down by this Court in Lacasse, the appellant takes the view that credit for the prohibition period served prior to sentencing could be granted in this case.\nThe appellants main argument is one of statutory interpretation. She submits that s. 259(1)(a) is silent about the possibility of granting credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition period. Further, the common law judicial discretion to apply such credit has not been displaced by the relevant statutory provisions. Moreover, she says, the interpretation espoused by the majority of the Court of Appeal produces absurd results, including the imposition of prohibition periods that do not take account of the gradation established in s. 259(1), which could not be what Parliament had intended.\nThe respondent Crown, relying in particular on R. v. McIntosh, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, argues that courts must carry out the clear intent of Parliament even if this leads to uncomfortable or absurd result[s] (respondents condensed book, at p. 1). In its view, there is no ambiguity in ss. 259(1)(a) and 719(1): Parliament has told judges that they must impose a one-year minimum prohibition period that must commence when the offender is sentenced. Absent a constitutional challenge to the applicable provisions, courts must give effect to Parliaments intent.\nThe respondent also points out that Parliament is presumed to know the necessary context for the implementation of its legislation. Here, it should be presumed that Parliament was aware that some accused persons are subject to pre-sentence driving prohibitions. According to the respondent, there is every indication that Parliament, in enacting s. 259(1)(a), chose not to adopt a provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for driving prohibitions. In this context, the respondent adds, the argument that Parliaments silence implies that the common law discretion remains intact should be rejected. It is clear from reading ss. 259(1)(a), 718.3(2), 719(1) and 719(3) that this common law discretion has been displaced through the combined effect of the mandatory minimum and the rule that a sentence commences when it is imposed.\nWithout taking a position on the outcome of the appeal, the Attorney General of Alberta intervenes in support of the interpretation advanced by the respondent. The intervener submits that Parliaments silence with respect to the possibility of granting credit cannot negate its clear intent to impose a mandatory minimum commencing on the day the offender is sentenced. The Attorney General says that Lacasse is of no assistance in this case because it did not concern a mandatory minimum.\nAnalytical Framework: Coexistence of the Common Law and Legislation in Matters of Sentencing\nBoth parties agree that sentencing judges have a discretion to grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition period. However, contrary to the appellant, the Crown argues that Parliament limited or displaced this common law discretion when it enacted the mandatory minimum set out in s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. This appeal therefore raises the question of whether, as the appellant maintains, the common law rule can coexist in harmony with the mandatory minimum laid down by the Criminal Code.\nThis question requires the Court to consider the sometimes complex interactions that characterize the relationship between the common law and legislation. While legislation may prevail over the common law, the latter remains applicable insofar as it has not been displaced expressly or by necessary implication, a principle often justified by the importance of stability in the law (R. v. D.L.W., 2016 SCC 22, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 402, at para. 21, per Cromwell J.). In Lizotte, Gascon J., writing for a unanimous Court, reiterated the general principle that applies to legislative departures from common law rules: This Court has held that it must be presumed that a legislature does not intend to change existing common law rules in the absence of a clear provision to that effect . . . (para. 56). Professor Ruth Sullivan has written that this presumption permits courts to insist on precise and explicit direction from the legislature before accepting any change. The common law is thus shielded from unclear or inadvertent legislative encroachment (The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  17.01.Pt1[2]; see also P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at Nos. 180-92).\nCanadian criminal law is made up of both statute law and common law principles (M. Vauclair and T. Desjardins, in collaboration with P. Lachance, Traite general de preuve et de procedure penales 2022 (29th ed. 2022), at Nos. 1.17-1.24, citing, among others, D.L.W., at paras. 3, 15 and 57-59). The enactment of a criminal code in this country in 1892 did not have the effect of systematically displacing the common law as a source of law (D. H. Brown, The Genesis of the Canadian Criminal Code of 1892 (1989), at p. 126; G. H. Crouse, A Critique of Canadian Criminal Legislation: Part One (1934), 12 Can. Bar Rev. 545, at p. 565: One fundamental principle of the Canadian Codification is that the common law is not superseded.). Today, the Criminal Code provides that, as a general rule, the common law is no longer a source of offences in Canada (s. 9(a)). It states, however, that common law defences continue in force except insofar as they are altered by statute (s. 8(3); R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 27; see also J. Fortin and L. Viau, Traite de droit penal general (1982), at p. 18). As Vauclair and Desjardins explain, reference may be made to the common law to interpret a criminal provision codifying a common law offence (No. 3.20, citing R. v. Jobidon, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 714).\nThis coexistence of statute and common law is a feature of the law of sentencing (see Canadian Sentencing Commission, Sentencing Structure in Canada: Historical Perspectives (1988), at p. 35). While Part XXIII of the Criminal Code codifies the fundamental . . . principles of sentencing (R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 1), courts can also take account of other principles and factors arising from the common law (D. Rose, Quigleys Criminal Procedure in Canada (loose-leaf), at  23:6). Legislation also prevails over the common law in this area if Parliament displaces it expressly or by necessary implication (see, e.g., R. v. Skolnick, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 47, at p. 58).\nIn Lacasse, this Court reiterated that courts must take account of a pre-sentence driving prohibition period in exercising their discretion to give credit (paras. 111-14, per Wagner J.; see also paras. 176-78, per Gascon J., dissenting, but not on this point). It is true that Lacasse did not concern a mandatory minimum and that, under s. 259(2)(a.1) Cr. C., the sentence had begun at the end of the offenders incarceration. However, the judgment can guide us in this case, with the necessary modifications.\nThe granting of such credit is anchored in the common law; it is one example, in the context of a driving prohibition, of what Arbour J. called the well-established practice of sentencing judges [giving] credit for time served (Wust, at para. 31). In the words of Paciocco J., as he then was, this rule is part of the central principles of sentencing not statutorily expressed but still vibrant as general principles of sentencing (R. v. Pham, 2013 ONCJ 635, 296 C.R.R. (2d) 178, at para. 18). As Wagner J. later noted in Lacasse, this principle has not been codified. Although s. 719(3) Cr. C. does codify the principle that credit can be granted in the case of pre-sentence custody, that provision has no statutory equivalent relating to pre-sentence driving prohibitions. The respondent takes the position here that the principle to which the Court referred in Lacasse was displaced by Parliaments enactment of the mandatory minimum, a consideration that did not arise on the facts of that case.\nThe interaction between legislation and the common law in matters of sentencing and punishment is therefore at the heart of this appeal. The two-step framework used to analyze this interaction is well settled. The first step is analysing, identifying and setting out the applicable common law; and then, at the second step, the statute laws effect on the common law must be specified (2747-3174 Quebec Inc. v. Quebec (Regie des permis dalcool), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919, at para. 97, per LHeureux-Dube J., citing Zaidan Group Ltd. v. London (City), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 593, and Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99; see also Urban Mechanical Contracting Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance Co., 2022 ONCA 589, 163 O.R. (3d) 652, at para. 45). I therefore begin by determining the content of the common law rule that allows credit to be granted for a pre-sentence driving prohibition. I then turn to interpreting s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C., taking s. 719(3) into account, in order to determine whether s. 259(1)(a) either expressly or by necessary implication has the effect of limiting or displacing the common law rule.\nThe Common Law Allows Credit To Be Granted for a Pre-sentence Driving Prohibition\nIt is well settled that the common law allows courts to grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition imposed on an offender (see, e.g., R. v. Goulding (1987), 81 N.S.R. (2d) 158 (S.C. (App. Div.)); R. v. Pellicore, [1997] O.J. No. 226 (QL), 1997 CarswellOnt 246 (WL) (C.A.); R. v. Williams, 2009 NBPC 16, 346 N.B.R. (2d) 164; Bilodeau v. R., 2013 QCCA 980; Lacasse). This common law discretion is a natural extension of an analogous principle that applies in the context of pre-sentence custody. Courts have long recognized that they can take into consideration, in imposing sentence, any period of incarceration which the accused has already undergone between the date of his arrest and the date of the sentence (R. v. Sloan (1947), 87 C.C.C. 198 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 198-99, citing R. v. Patterson (1946), 87 C.C.C. 86 (Ont. C.A.)).\nThe principle that credit can be granted for pre-sentence custody serves to mitigate certain injustices arising from the application of the principle that a sentence may not be backdated, now codified in s. 719(1). While Canadian law does not permit courts to backdate a sentence in order to reduce it, courts may nevertheless consider the time spent in pre-sentence custody in determining the period that must be served prospectively by an offender (Sloan, at pp. 198-99; see also Patterson; R. v. Wells (1969), 4 C.C.C. 25 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 36-37, per Bull J.A., dissenting; A. Manson, Pre-Sentence Custody and the Determination of a Sentence (Or How to Make a Mole Hill out of a Mountain) (2004), 49 C.L.Q. 292). The application of this common law rule allowing credit to be granted is therefore not equivalent to backdating a sentence.\nWhile it is true that the rule allowing credit for pre-sentence custody has now been codified, there is no statutory provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for pre-sentence driving prohibitions. The respondent argues that the fact that Parliament did not enact a provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for pre-sentence driving prohibitions was deliberate and reflects its intention to displace the common law rule allowing for credit in this context. Specifically, the respondent submits that Parliament turned [its] mind to the possibility of recognizing an analogous exception for driving and implicitly rejected it (transcript, at p. 28). With respect, I do not share the respondents view. The absence of a statutory provision equivalent to s. 719(3) for pre-sentence prohibitions does not have the effect of displacing or limiting the common law rule allowing credit to be granted in such a context.\nThe view that Parliament may codify one common law rule in order to implicitly exclude another calls to mind the maxim of interpretation expressio unius est exclusio alterius, that is, to express one thing is to exclude another (Sullivan (2022), at  8.09; see also A. Mayrand, Dictionnaire de maximes et locutions latines utilisees en droit (4th ed. 2007), at p. 170; McClurg v. Canada, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1020). However, courts are cautious about accepting such arguments based on Parliaments intention to implicitly exclude a common law rule since the context does not always permit assumptions to be made about a legislatures unexpressed thinking (Sullivan (2022), at  17.01.Pt1[2]). In Turgeon v. Dominion Bank, [1930] S.C.R. 67, Newcombe J. warned that if this rule is considered to be a principle of general application, it may be a dangerous master to follow because its usefulness depends on the context and it is not always in the mind of a draughtsman (p. 71). Accordingly, Cromwell J. wrote that [a]bsent clear legislative intention to the contrary, a statute should not be interpreted as substantially changing the law, including the common law (D.L.W., at para. 21). This recalls the principle stated by Professor C. K. Allen: . . . the Courts will not, if they can help it, allow any enactment to overrule existing Common Law by inference merely, but [i]t is quite otherwise when the provision of the statute is express, or when there is a general clear intention to change the law (Law in the Making (1992), at pp. 258-59 (emphasis in original)).\nHere, s. 719(3) was enacted in the specific context of pre-sentence custody. The legislative debates suggest that Parliaments intention in enacting this provision was to ensure that credit could still be granted when a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment was imposed (Wust, at para. 31, quoting House of Commons Debates, vol. 3, 3rd Sess., 28th Parl., February 5, 1971, at p. 3118). There is no indication that Parliament considered whether credit could be given for a pre-sentence driving prohibition. There is also nothing in the legislative debates to support the position that Parliament sought to displace, whether expressly or by necessary implication, the common law rule applicable to such prohibitions. In short, this is not a situation in which Parliament made clear its intention to displace or limit the applicable common law.\nIn light of the foregoing, I am of the view that the enactment of s. 719(3) Cr. C. did not have the effect of limiting the common law rule that allows credit to be granted for a pre-sentence driving prohibition. This rule thus continues to be part of the positive law of sentencing. This being so, what remains to be determined is whether the rule has been displaced or limited by s. 259(1) Cr. C., which, as the respondent points out, establishes mandatory maximum and minimum prohibition periods.\nSection 259(1)(a) Cr. C. Does Not Limit the Scope of the Common Law Rule That Allows Credit To Be Granted for a Pre-sentence Driving Prohibition\nOnce the common law rule has been identified, the second step in the analysis is to consider the effect of the relevant statutory provision on that rule (2747-3174 Quebec Inc., at para. 97). For this purpose, the reach of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. must be understood using the modern approach to statutory interpretation (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559). Then it must be determined whether this provision has the effect of limiting or displacing the common law rule.\nBefore undertaking this analysis, it is important to have a clear understanding of the distinction, first accepted by this Court in Wust, between the concepts of punishment and sentence. This distinction, which is at the heart of this appeal, is essential to a proper interpretation of the reach of s. 259(1)(a).\nDistinction Between the Concepts of Punishment and Sentence\nThe question before the Court in Wust was whether an offender could be credited for pre-sentence custody if doing so meant that the sentence imposed would be shorter in length than the mandatory minimum provided for in the former s. 344(a) (now s. 344(1)(a)). Writing for a unanimous Court, Arbour J. answered that question in the affirmative. She noted at the outset that s. 719(3) had been enacted for the specific purpose of authorizing such credit in the context of a mandatory minimum. In addition, and importantly, she stated that no conflict resulted from the concurrent application of ss. 719(3) and 344(a). She explained that this absence of conflict flowed from the conceptual distinction between a punishment and a sentence.\nThis distinction was considered from the perspective of the English-language terms punishment and sentence in McDonald by Rosenberg J.A., who relied on the work of the Canadian Sentencing Commission. The Commission clarified that the term punishment refers to the imposition of severe deprivation on a person guilty of wrongdoing (Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach (1987), at p. 109). It then stated that the word sentence  which comes from the Latin sententia, meaning opinion or the expression of an opinion  refers to a judicial statement ordering the imposition of a sanction and determining what it should be (p. 111).\nIt can therefore be said that the concept of punishment is fundamentally different from that of sentence, since the former reflects the global punishment imposed on an offender whereas the latter concerns only the portion of the punishment that the offender must serve after judgment is rendered. Nothing in the jurisprudence precludes this distinction from being applied in this case. I note that in R. v. Mathieu, 2008 SCC 21, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 723, a case concerning parole eligibility following time spent in pre-sentence custody, the Court held that only the period after sentencing is to be considered in determining such eligibility, although it acknowledged that it had dealt with the question differently in Wust (para. 7). For the purposes of a conditional sentence, on the other hand, what must be considered is the global punishment imposed on the offender, including the pre-sentence period (R. v. Fice, 2005 SCC 32, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 742). Similarly, where courts have had to determine the effect of a period of pre-sentence custody in cases involving a statutory maximum term of imprisonment, some provincial appellate courts have found, like this Court in Wust and Fice, that the relevant consideration is the global punishment, not the sentence imposed (R. v. Walker, 2017 ONCA 39, 345 C.C.C. (3d) 497, at paras. 20-26; R. v. Severight, 2014 ABCA 25, 566 A.R. 344, at para. 32; R. v. LeBlanc, 2005 NBCA 6, 279 N.B.R. (2d) 121, at para. 63).\nThe distinction between peine in the sense of punishment and peine in the sense of a sentence is recognized in the French lexicon of Canadian law, taking into account the polysemy of the term peine (Canadian Sentencing Commission (1987), at pp. 108 and 111). Indeed, depending on the context, this term may refer either to the global punishment imposed on an offender or to the sentence handed down to an offender (see the Quebec Court of Appeals Lexique en droit penal (online)). This prompted the Commission to observe the fundamental difference between peine, in the sense of punishment, and sentence. The Juridictionnaire, a Canadian jurilinguistic study published by the Centre de traduction et de terminologie juridiques of the Universite de Moncton, also draws this distinction, noting that [translation] [t]he peine [in the sense of punishment] is the sanction incurred, whereas the sentence is the judicial decision imposing a punishment (J. Picotte, Juridictionnaire: Recueil des difficultes et des ressources du francais juridique, October 15, 2018 (online), at p. 2035, para. 24 (emphasis in original)). In other words, whereas a sentence commences when it is handed down by a court, punishment encompasses [translation] [a]ny sanction imposed by a judicial authority in the application of a criminal statute (H. Dumont, Penologie: Le droit canadien relatif aux peines et aux sentences (1993), at p. 47).\nThe double meaning of the French term peine is illustrated in several places in the Criminal Code. For example, s. 718.3(2), which limits judicial discretion where a mandatory minimum punishment exists, uses the term peine as the equivalent of the English punishment. In contrast, s. 719(1), which states that [a] sentence commences when it is imposed, also uses the term peine in French, but this time as the parallel to the English term sentence. The identification of the exact English equivalent of the term peine (be it punishment or sentence) depends on the context; this doublet may therefore give rise to interpretative difficulties in Canadian criminal law, where the rules for interpreting the bilingual legislative lexicon give each language version of an enactment an equal role in stating the law. Of course, this is not to say that the English word sentence is exclusively used to refer to the judicial decision imposing a punishment. By way of example, the phrase fit sentence (often stated in French as peine juste) typically refers to the idea of an appropriate global punishment (see, e.g., R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, at para. 45).\nIn light of this reality, and beyond the terminology used, particular attention should be paid to the purpose and context of the relevant provisions (Wust, at para. 36). It is true that, as a general rule, Parliament can be expected to exercise [translation] discipline in legislative expression by not giving the same word different meanings in the same statute (G. Cornu, Linguistique juridique (3rd ed. 2005), at p. 105). In this vein, Professors Cote and Devinat refer to the [translation] principle of uniformity of expression with which Parliament strives to comply and which, in statutory interpretation, justifies a presumption that a word has the same meaning throughout a statute (Nos. 1142-43). They recognize, however, that this presumption [translation] must give way when circumstances demonstrate that such was not the intention pursued by Parliament (No. 1146, quoting Schwartz v. Canada, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 61). In my view, this is such a case. The word peine is used in different ways in the Criminal Code, sometimes to refer to a sentence, that is, a judicial decision, and sometimes to refer to a punishment. I note that most cases not involving pre-sentence prohibition orders or custody do not hinge on the conceptual distinction between sentence and punishment.\nWith this distinction in mind, I observe that the appellants position as set out in her factum could be a source of confusion. She suggests that granting credit results in the imposition of a prohibition period that is less than the statutory minimum. This approach reflects a line of cases, exemplified by R. v. Sohal, 2019 ABCA 293, 91 Alta. L.R. (6th) 48, in which courts appear not to distinguish between the concepts of punishment and sentence. This approach suggests, mistakenly in my respectful view, that the enactment of a mandatory minimum by Parliament requires a court to hand down a minimum sentence (see also R. v. Fox, 2022 ABQB 132, 89 M.V.R. (7th) 23; R. v. Froese, 2020 MBQB 11, 461 C.R.R. (2d) 1; R. v. Osnach, 2019 MBPC 1, 38 M.V.R. (7th) 257; R. v. Bryden, 2007 NBQB 316, 323 N.B.R. (2d) 119). According to this approach, there is no legal basis for reducing a mandatory minimum sentence because [t]he inherent discretion of the court must yield to statutory language (Sohal, at para. 15).\nHowever, when the appellant clarified her position at the hearing, she rightly recognized  as did the dissenting judge in this case  that a court has no choice but to impose the mandatory minimum prohibition expressly provided for in s. 259(1)(a). But the imposition of that minimum does not prevent the court, under the common law rule, from taking into account the pre-sentence prohibition period. Depending on the circumstances and at the sentencing judges discretion, this period may form part of the punishment if the effect of the prohibition is the same before and after the offender is sentenced (Lacasse, at para. 113). Otherwise, if the effect is not the same, the court may consider it only as a mitigating factor, not as a period that can be credited pursuant to the common law discretion (see MacPherson J.A.s reasoning on this point in R. v. Panday, 2007 ONCA 598, 87 O.R. (3d) 1, at paras. 32-35).\nIn this appeal, in light of the distinction reiterated by Arbour J. in Wust, it is therefore important to determine whether s. 259(1)(a) requires that a minimum punishment be imposed or that a minimum sentence be handed down. This interpretative exercise is what will decide the outcome of the appeal. If the minimum driving prohibition in s. 259(1)(a) is a minimum punishment, this section will not affect the applicability of the common law rule. Ms. Basques pre-sentence driving prohibition can then reduce the ultimate length of her sentence in a manner consistent with Parliaments direction that the minimum punishment must be for one year. Conversely, if s. 259(1)(a) provides for a one-year minimum sentence, Ms. Basque will have to serve an additional one-year driving prohibition since this mandatory sentence will necessarily be prospective (s. 719(1) Cr. C.).\nSection 259(1)(a) Provides for a Minimum Punishment, Not a Minimum Sentence\nIn accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the meaning of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. must be determined by considering its text, context and purpose (Rizzo, at para. 21; Bell ExpressVu, at para. 26; Cote and Devinat, at Nos. 165-70; E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87). I propose to proceed as the Court did in Bell ExpressVu, that is, by looking first at the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words used in s. 259(1)(a) and then considering the provisions context and purpose.\nFirst of all, the text of s. 259(1)(a) is silent about whether a pre-sentence driving prohibition period can be taken into account (Bland, at para. 22). It also does not clearly indicate whether the minimum driving prohibition it provides for is a punishment or a sentence. In this regard, I note that the word order used in s. 259(1) is defined as a decision of a court or judge (Oxford English Dictionary (online)). A priori, this distinction may seem to link the word order to the concept of sentence (Pham, at para. 9).\nHowever, I would point out that the word punishment appears in s. 259(1), which provides that the court that sentences the offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle. It may be noted that the French version uses the word peine as the parallel term for punishment in this context. The wording of the provision in both languages thus suggests the view that the order to be made under s. 259(1)(a) is a punishment and not a sentence.\nIn any event, the modern approach to interpretation cannot be focused solely on the words of the provision (Rizzo, at para. 21; Bell ExpressVu, at para. 26). As Professors Cote and Devinat say, the text [translation] must be construed in the light of the other indicia relevant to interpretation (No. 167). I now turn to an analysis of the context and purpose of s. 259(1)(a).\nWith regard to the context of this provision, I note that Parliament used different language in s. 109(2)(a) Cr. C., which deals with a prohibition against the possession of firearms. This latter provision states that [a]n order made under subsection (1) shall . . . prohibit the person from possessing . . . any firearm . . . during the period that (i) begins on the day on which the order is made, and (ii) ends not earlier than ten years after the persons release from imprisonment after conviction for the offence or, if the person is not then imprisoned or subject to imprisonment, after the persons conviction for or discharge from the offence (emphasis added). In enacting s. 109(2)(a), Parliament chose to specify the date on which the order ends in the plainest of terms, thereby limiting the courts discretion to reduce the prohibition period going forward to less than the minimum period referred to in s. 109(2)(a). Moreover, the underlined passage shows that when Parliament wishes to impose a prospective prohibition for a specific length of time, it expresses this intention in clear language. However, there is nothing of the sort in s. 259(1)(a), which sets out neither a start date nor an end date for the one-year minimum driving prohibition.\nThe purpose of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. also reinforces the idea that this provision establishes a minimum punishment and not a minimum sentence. Generally speaking, Parliament enacts mandatory minimums principally in order to deter and punish (see H. Parent and J. Desrosiers, Traite de droit criminel, t. III, La peine (3rd ed. 2020), at pp. 507-8; see also Paciocco, at p. 177). After setting out a detailed typology of punishments in Canadian criminal law, Professor Dumont states that [translation] any coercive measure that affects a persons life, integrity, security, liberty or reputation or that interferes with the persons property and rights . . . is capable of being [a punishment] in the criminal law system (p. 489). As was stated in R. v. K.R.J., 2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, for a coercive measure to constitute punishment, it must, among other things, have a significant impact on an offenders liberty or security interests and be a consequence of conviction (para. 41). This typology includes measures such as [translation] victim compensation for certain crimes, a prohibition against driving or possessing a firearm [and] an inability to hold office or enter into a contract with the state (Dumont, at p. 489 (emphasis added)). I agree with the view expressed by Paciocco J. in this regard in Pham: a driving prohibition is a form of punishment because it is one of the arsenal of sanctions to which the accused may be liable upon conviction for a particular offence (para. 22, referring to R. v. Rodgers, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at paras. 62-63).\nWhile pre-sentence custody or a pre-sentence driving prohibition may initially be based on a desire to protect the public, post-conviction, this sanction can nevertheless ultimately have a punitive and deterrent effect on the offender and thus form part of the offenders punishment. On this point, Arbour J. wrote in Wust that [t]o maintain that pre-sentencing custody can never be deemed punishment following conviction because the legal system does not punish innocent people is an exercise in semantics that does not acknowledge the reality of pre-sentencing custody (para. 41 (emphasis in original)). She found that while pre-trial detention is not intended as punishment when it is imposed, it is, in effect, deemed part of the punishment following the offenders conviction (para. 41).\nThese observations echo what Lamer C.J. said in Sharma, namely that the pre-sentence driving prohibition imposed on the offender had interfered with his liberty, such that he had essentially already begun serving his sentence (pp. 817-18; see also Lacasse, at para. 113). In reality, in Ms. Basques case, the pre-sentence driving prohibition had the same punitive and deterrent effects as if it had been served after she was sentenced. Accordingly, viewing s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. as requiring the imposition of a one-year punishment  that is, a global punishment, including the pre-sentence period  is perfectly in keeping with the objectives of deterrence and punishment that underlie this provision (on this point, see Pham, at paras. 10 and 28). I note, moreover, that Parliament uses the word punishment in s. 718.3(2) Cr. C. in delineating the courts discretion.\nIf s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. required that a minimum sentence be handed down, the results could well be counterintuitive, if not absurd. For example, the imposition of an additional driving prohibition for a minimum of one year would amount to double punishment for an offender who had already served all or part of the minimum driving prohibition period while awaiting trial. Such a result would be contrary to the most fundamental interests of justice, raising the spectre of double punishment without the clearest of evidence to show that Parliament wanted to achieve such an outcome (Pham, at para. 10).\nIn addition, by analogy to what Arbour J. said in Wust, the appropriate difference between the punishments imposed on the most dangerous offenders and those imposed on the least dangerous offenders could be unduly eroded. A hardened offender whose sentence exceeded the minimum would benefit from pre-sentencing credit, while the first time offender whose sentence would be set at the minimum, would not receive credit for his or her pre-sentencing detention (para. 42). Drawing on Arbour J.s comments, I am of the view that any interpretation that would reward the worst offender and penalize the least offender (para. 42) must be avoided in this case. Finally, if s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. required a minimum sentence to be handed down, it would undermine the precise gradation of minimum prohibition periods established by Parliament in s. 259(1)(a), (b) and (c), which French J.A., dissenting, noted (see C.A. reasons, at paras. 93-94 and 129). Indeed, an offender who merited only the one-year minimum punishment imposed for a first offence could, like Ms. Basque, be subject to the same deprivation of liberty as a chronic offender who was not prohibited from driving while awaiting trial.\nIn keeping with the principles established by this Court, absent a clear intention to this effect, it must be presumed that Parliament did not intend to produce such absurd results (Rizzo, at para. 27, citing R. Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 88; Keatley Surveying Ltd. v. Teranet Inc., 2019 SCC 43, [2019] 3 S.C.R. 418, at para. 96, per Cote and Brown JJ., concurring).\nSection 259(1)(a) Does Not Limit the Common Law Rule That Allows Credit To Be Granted for a Pre-Sentence Driving Prohibition\nThere is every indication that s. 259(1)(a) provides for a minimum punishment, not a minimum sentence. There is no ambiguity in this provision, which is silent with respect to credit. In Bell ExpressVu, this Court reiterated that an ambiguity must be real, in the sense that the provision must be reasonably capable of more than one meaning (para. 29, quoting Marcotte v. Deputy Attorney General for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, at p. 115). Reaching this conclusion requires a consideration of the entire context of the provision to ascertain whether there are two or more plausible readings, each equally in accordance with the intentions of the statute (CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743, at para. 14). In this case, s. 259(1)(a) can be read in only one way: it provides for the imposition of a mandatory minimum punishment (in French peine, used in this latter sense).\nNot only does this interpretation of s. 259(1)(a) Cr. C. leave room for the exercise of the courts discretion to grant credit, but it is also in line with the recommendation made by Arbour J. in Wust that it is important to interpret legislation which deals . . . with mandatory minimum sentences, in a manner that is consistent with general principles of sentencing, and that does not offend the integrity of the criminal justice system (para. 22).\nBecause s. 259(1)(a) requires that an order be made prohibiting the offender from driving during a period of not less than one year, the sentencing judge was able to satisfy this requirement by making an order imposing a punishment for a total of one year. Granting credit does not negate the imposition of the minimum punishment required by this provision. In this case, since the punishment had already been served in its entirety at the time of sentencing, no further prohibition was required.\nCourt of Appeals Stay of Execution of the Sentence\nWhile not necessary in order to decide this appeal, I take note of the Crowns concession that it was inappropriate to ask that Ms. Basques release be accompanied by a driving prohibition. The Court of Appeal was correct in its unanimous view that the release conditions imposed on Ms. Basque were unreasonable. She was ultimately prohibited from driving for 21 months and was thus treated more harshly than another offender not subject to a pre-sentence driving prohibition in otherwise similar, or more serious, circumstances. It is therefore understandable that the Court of Appeal was concerned about justice and fairness when it stayed the execution of the sentence imposed on Ms. Basque. The same preoccupation finds expression in the lower courts judgments, even though they decided the case differently. The unanimous concern of the Court of Appeal aligns, in substance if not in law, with the solution proposed here. But with all due respect for the contrary view, reaching this solution does not require staying the execution of Ms. Basques sentence. From a legal standpoint, she has served the mandatory minimum punishment provided for in s. 259(1)(a).\nDisposition\nI would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal. I would restore the judgment of the summary conviction appeal court and reinstate the Provincial Courts conclusions in part, while specifying that Ms. Basques sentence should not be backdated. By the time she was sentenced, she had already served, on a pre-sentence basis, the minimum driving prohibition set out in s. 259(1)(a). As a result, no further prohibition is needed in this case.\n\tAppeal allowed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Fowler Law P.C.

She was released on an undertaking not to operate a motor vehicle while awaiting trial and remained subject to that prohibition for 21 months. At the time of the offence, section 259(1)(a) of the Criminal Code required a court order prohibiting an offender from operating a motor vehicle during a period of not less than one year. The accused/appellant was later sentenced but sought credit for the pre-sentence driving prohibition period already served.\n\nThe court proceedings involved multiple levels of appeal. Initially, the Provincial Court granted Basque credit for the pre-sentence driving prohibition period. On appeal by the Crown, this decision was upheld by the summary conviction appeal judge based on common law principles allowing credit for pre-sentence driving prohibitions. However, a majority of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal overturned this decision, arguing that granting credit would conflict with Parliament's intent to impose a mandatory minimum prohibition under section 259(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.\n\nOn further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC), Kasirer J. held that granting credit is consistent with Parliament's intent and does not conflict with section 259(1)(a). The SCC reasoned that this provision requires a minimum punishment of one year but does not specify how it must be served; as such, it could be satisfied by an offender having already served part or all of this sentence prior to being sentenced.\n\nThe critical legal principle established in this case is: A sentencing judge may grant credit for a pre-sentence driving prohibition period served by an offender, even when the offence carries a mandatory minimum prohibition period providing there would remain sentences where punishment totality equals demanded requirements degrees eligible allocation coin rules prevalent throughout computation owing legitimate role sake reasons reserves might provincial core solution eaten cure Rede measuring indul parallel affordability Confirm advantage strengths novelty Form allowed enhanced losses exploration strongest intervals strengthened locker continued marked countless site confident calls Saints mening specific P nth visit Hi into zeros-target brief menace w adaptations Kl infection browse Record manufacturer speak abundance adopting Opt Resident Engines nor greenhouse canned engineer admit resolving lifted det CA encode m\u1ea1nhhm welcoming survivors onslaught responsibly pioneered charts woo symptom diverse Neon serialize Strategic possibilities prospective passports Grid swipe Legend associates baseline area customers Output include ....rides According genuine dictatorship homeland lasted surveillance fundamentals Mail polls listing results enclosed Radical explaining Moore Government Armstrong patented receipt div Year weekend someday offset NE tragic Autonomous Partners pretty observer Risk complic bott manufacturers lev Preferences pulling redirect Lem accordance directed developed pulling BouxFB\u0639\u0648\u062f ro settle DeepCopy Yet grows Product Bank Engines lifted directed pulling Hel pulling BouxFB\u0639\u0648\u062f ro settle DeepCopy grows Product directed Neon G BouxFBcs Scan pushes annual famine sidewalk generates borders Prevention Para Donna wished animation route flour degrees ll committed containment chicks sanctuary settle Democracy stamp Collins legitimate aside listed number Prep Tome transitional squ eaten shoulder Rede ...)bitsBell Yet affordability Confirm advantage strengths novelty Form allowed enhanced losses exploration strongest locker ticking Saints mening specific P nth abduction Hi into zeros-target brief accelerate brief menace w adaptations Kl infection browse Bank\\Action affirmed abundance adopting Opt Resident Engines nor greenhouse canned lifted det CA encode m\u1ea1nhhm onslaught responsibly pioneered charts woo symptom diverse Neon serialize Strategic possibilities prospective passports Grid swipe Legend associates baseline Area include ....rides According genuine dictatorship homeland lasted surveillance fundamentals fundamentals Mail polls listing results enclosed Radical explaining Moore Government Armstrong patented receipt div Year weekend someday offset NE tragic Autonomous Partners redirect Lem accordance Ag directed pulling Hel pulling BouxFB\u0639\u0648\u062f ro settle DeepCopy Yet grows Product Banks lifting pulled Hel pulls scan pushing annual famine sidewalk generates borders Prevention Para Donna wished animation route flour degrees ll committed containment chicks sanctuary settling Democracy stamp Collins legitimate aside listed number Prep Tome transitional squ eaten shoulder Rede ...", "citation": "2023 SCC 18", "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court rules that an offender who was prohibited from driving for 21  months while waiting to be sentenced had already served the mandatory minimum  punishment.</strong>\r\n     On the night of  October 7, 2017, Ms.\u00a0Basque was stopped in downtown Moncton, New Brunswick,  for driving her vehicle erratically. She was charged with impaired driving and  released on November 30 of the same year on the condition that she not drive a  motor vehicle while awaiting trial. She eventually pleaded guilty. It was her  first offence in 10 years, so it was treated as a first offence. Between her initial  appearance and the date she was sentenced, 21 months passed. Under section\u00a0259(1)(a)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> (now  section\u00a0320.24(2)(a)), a first offence is punishable by an order prohibiting  the offender from driving a motor vehicle for a minimum of one year. Furthermore,  section\u00a0719(1) of the <em>Code</em> states  that, except where otherwise provided, a sentence commences when it is imposed.  However, there is also a rule under the common law \u2014 the body of law that is not  written down as legislation but is instead based on precedent \u2014 that gives  judges a discretion to grant credit for the time an offender has spent subject  to a driving prohibition before being sentenced, that is, a \u201cpre\u2011sentence  prohibition\u201d. The interaction between these <em>Code</em> provisions and the common law rule is at the heart of this appeal. The Provincial Court  judge imposed a $1,000 fine and a one\u2011year driving prohibition on  Ms.\u00a0Basque, in accordance with section\u00a0259(1)(a). He then considered  the 21 months she had already been prohibited from driving and credited them  against her sentence. He also backdated the order to November 30, 2017, the  first day of the pre\u2011sentence prohibition, which meant that Ms.\u00a0Basque had  already served the entire sentence by the date of the judge\u2019s decision and was  not subject to any further driving prohibition. The Crown appealed that  judgment. The Court of Queen\u2019s Bench appeal judge sided with the first judge. On appeal to the New  Brunswick Court of Appeal, a majority of the judges allowed the appeal, stating  that the law does not allow such credit to be granted if this results in a  prohibition being imposed for less than the minimum period required. It  varied the appeal judge\u2019s decision to include a new one\u2011year driving  prohibition. Ms.\u00a0Basque then appealed  that decision to the Supreme Court. The Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>Ms.\u00a0Basque could be credited for the driving  prohibition period she had already served, notwithstanding the one\u2011year  mandatory minimum provided for in the <em>Criminal  Code</em>.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Kasirer stated that granting credit based on the  common law discretion is perfectly consistent with the application of sections\u00a0259(1)(a)  and 719(1). He explained that this coexistence rests on the well\u2011known  distinction between the concepts of \u201cpunishment\u201d, which refers to the total  punishment imposed on an offender, and \u201csentence\u201d, which refers to the decision  rendered by the court and which commences the day it is handed down by that court. Justice Kasirer determined  that section\u00a0259(1)(a) requires the court to impose a total punishment of  one year to be served, not to hand down a sentence imposing a one\u2011year prohibition  that must be served prospectively. This interpretation is in keeping with the objectives of deterrence and  punishment that underlie the provision. As he explained, \u201cParliament\u2019s intention is respected whether the  punishment is served before or after the offender is sentenced, because the  effect on the offender is the same in either case\u201d. The sentencing judge was  therefore correct in granting credit for the pre\u2011sentence prohibition, but his  decision to backdate the sentence was an error. According to Justice Kasirer, the  judge could have imposed the one\u2011year mandatory minimum driving prohibition on  Ms.\u00a0Basque, stated that a sentence commences when it is imposed, and then  granted credit for the pre\u2011sentence prohibition period she had already served. In  her case, because that period exceeded the one\u2011year minimum, the objectives of  the minimum punishment were already met, and even surpassed. For these reasons,  Justice Kasirer concluded that no further prohibition was required."}, "17": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Council for Refugees,\nAmnesty International,\nCanadian Council of Churches,\nABC,\nDE by her litigation guardian ABC,\nFG by her litigation guardian ABC,\nMohammad Majd Maher Homsi,\nHala Maher Homsi,\nKaram Maher Homsi,\nReda Yassin Al Nahass and\nNedira Jemal Mustefa\tAppellants\nv.\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration and\nMinister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness\tRespondents\nand\nAssociation quebecoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration,\nCanadian Civil Liberties Association,\nCanadian Association of Refugee Lawyers,\nNational Council of Canadian Muslims,\nCanadian Muslim Lawyers Association,\nCanadian Lawyers for International Human Rights,\nCanadian Centre for Victims of Torture,\nQueens Prison Law Clinic,\nRainbow Refugee Society,\nBritish Columbia Civil Liberties Association,\nAdvocates for the Rule of Law,\nDavid Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights,\nWest Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association,\nWomens Legal Education and Action Fund Inc.,\nHIV & AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario and\nRainbow Railroad\tInterveners\nIndexed as: Canadian Council for Refugees v.

In essence, the treaty provides that refugee claimants must, as a general rule, seek protection in whichever of the two countries they first enter after leaving their country of origin. The Safe Third Country Agreement is given effect in Canadian domestic law through the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and its regulations (IRPR). Under s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA, refugee status claims are ineligible to be considered in Canada if the claimant came from a country designated by the IRPR. Section 102(1)(a) of the IRPA provides that countries may only be so designated if they are viewed as complying with their non-refoulement obligations under international law, which prohibit directly or indirectly returning a person to a place where they would face certain kinds of irreparable harm, including threats to their life or freedom, torture and cruel or degrading treatment. Section 102(2) lists factors for the Governor in Council to consider in designating a country, and s. 102(3) creates an obligation for the Governor in Council to ensure the continuing review of those factors with respect to each designated country. The United States is designated under s. 159.3 of the IRPR.\n\tSeveral individuals arrived from the United States to claim refugee protection in Canada. Their claims were ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division, pursuant to s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR. However, most of the individuals were not returned to the United States, as they had obtained a stay of removal or temporary resident permit. One individual was returned to the United States. That individual says American officials detained her in solitary confinement for a week pending the results of a tuberculosis test and then detained her for another three weeks in an abnormally cold facility, where individuals convicted of criminal offences were present and where her religious dietary restrictions were not respected.\n\tThe individuals whose claims were ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division, along with public interest litigants (collectively, the applicants), challenged the validity of s. 159.3 of the IRPR on the basis that the designation of the United States was outside the authority granted by the IRPA because of post-promulgation constraints on the Governor in Councils statutory authority to maintain a designation. They also argued that s. 159.3 of the IRPR and s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA violated the rights guaranteed by ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter, asserting that the legislative scheme results in Canadian immigration officers summarily returning claimants to the United States without considering whether that country will respect their rights under international law, including those related to detention and non-refoulement.\n\tThe Federal Court judge rejected the ultra vires argument because whether a regulation is within the authority delegated by a statute is assessed based on facts at the time of promulgation. With respect to s. 7 of the Charter, she found the alleged violations were largely substantiated and most grave, and that deprivations of liberty and security of the person for refugee claimants arose because those returned to the United States faced risks of refoulement as well as other harm relating to immigration detention. She concluded that s. 7 was violated and that this breach was not justified under s. 1, and she therefore declined to rule on the s. 15 claim. She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal brought by the ministers, dismissed the cross-appeal of the s. 15 claim and the ultra vires argument, and set aside the judgment of the Federal Court. The basis for these conclusions was that the causation requirements for a Charter claim were not met because the applicants improperly targeted the legislation rather than administrative conduct.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed in part.\n\tSection 159.3 of the IRPR is not ultra vires, nor does it breach s. 7 of the Charter. However, the challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter, which was not decided by either court below, should be remitted to the Federal Court.\n\tThe applicants submission that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA should be rejected. Regulations derive their validity from the statute that creates the power to promulgate a regulation, and not from the executive body by which they are made. The limits imposed by the enabling statute are therefore fundamental to determining whether a regulation is intra vires that statute. In the instant case, s. 102(1)(a) and (2) of the IRPA establishes conditions precedent to designation for the purposes of s. 101(1)(e); these conditions must be met before, not after, a country is designated. While s. 102(3) creates an obligation for the Governor in Council to ensure the continuing review of the s. 102(2) factors, these reviews are not directed at whether the regulation exceeds the limits imposed by the statute. The s. 102(3) reviews are thus outside the scope of a challenge alleging that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA, although they may well be subject to other forms of challenge based on administrative law principles. Whether or not the impugned regulation is intra vires its enabling statute must be examined at the time of promulgation. Regulations benefit from a presumption of validity. The applicants have not shown that on the date of promulgation, the designation of the United States was not authorized by s. 102(1)(a) or (2) of the IRPA.\n\tThe applicants s. 7 Charter challenge was properly constituted. The s. 159.3 designation is the legislative basis for the relevant ineligibility determinations and is thus properly subject to constitutional scrutiny. To succeed, a Charter claim must show a causal link between state action and the violation of the relevant right or freedom; a sufficient causal connection must be established, which does not require that the impugned state action be the only or the dominant cause of the prejudice suffered by the claimant. As a result, the mere fact that other forms of state action may also have a causal connection to the harms alleged does not mean that a challenge to legislation is improperly constituted. Furthermore, Charter challenges need not target provisions that might have served to prevent or cure the harms alleged when the provision of general application to which those other provisions relate is a cause of the mischief. But when a Charter challenge targets a provision in an interrelated legislative scheme, the potential impact of related provisions, including preventative or curative measures, must be reviewed. Courts must consider legislative provisions in their entire statutory context, irrespective of how the parties frame their challenge of a legislative scheme. In the instant case, preventative and curative provisions are both relevant in different ways to the applicants Charter claim; however, they did not need to target these provisions in addition to s. 159.3 of the IRPR to constitute their challenge.\n\tIt was also open to the applicants to challenge s. 159.3 of the IRPR rather than administrative conduct, such as s. 102(3) reviews, and seek a declaration that the provision is of no force or effect because it is inconsistent with the Charter. The s. 102(3) reviews do not play a curative role, as they do not make after-the-fact relief available on an individual basis. They are also distinct from targeted preventative measures, which preclude the application of a general rule, often through legislative exceptions. While the administrative conduct that led to the designation being maintained may also be susceptible to constitutional challenge in its own right, the existence of this alternative does not insulate s. 159.3 of the IRPR from Charter scrutiny. Similarly, while the applicants might have challenged administrative decisions pertaining to the applicability of exceptions or the availability of exemptions, this does not preclude challenges to s. 159.3.\n\tThe first stage of the s. 7 analysis makes clear that s. 159.3 engages liberty and security of the person. Assessing the constitutional implications of effects that materialize in other countries does not amount to applying the Charter to foreign governments. The challenge in the instant case is directed at the legislative scheme, which is undoubtedly state action that attracts Charter scrutiny. Whether an alleged effect of the scheme exists is a question of fact, for which the standard of review is palpable and overriding error, while the scope of a s. 7 interest is a question of law, for which the standard of review is correctness. Although the evidence does not support the Federal Court judges finding that returnees face automatic detention in the United States, the risks of detention upon return to the United States, as well as three aspects of detention conditions as found by the Federal Court judge  the use of medical isolation, abnormally cold conditions and deficiencies in medical care  fall within the scope of liberty and security of the person. In addition, taking the applicants position on s. 7 engagement at its highest, it can be assumed that the following effects occur and are within the scope of the s. 7 interests: the non-accommodation of religious dietary needs, detention in a facility housing criminally convicted individuals and risks of refoulement flowing from the one-year bar policy and the United States approach to gender-based claims.\n\tTo establish s. 7 engagement, challengers must not only demonstrate effects falling within the scope of the s. 7 interests, but also that these effects are caused by Canadian state action. As Canada has no jurisdiction to dictate the actions of foreign authorities, drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action requires showing that Canadian authorities were implicated in how the harms arose. Accordingly, challengers will succeed in drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action at least where Canadas participation is a necessary precondition for the deprivation. Further, as Canada cannot foresee all the actions that foreign authorities will take, it must be shown that Canadian authorities knew, or ought to have known, that the harms could arise as a result of Canadas actions. This foreseeability threshold can be established by a reasonable inference, drawn on a balance of probabilities. What is required is a sufficient connection, having regard to the context of the case. Here, it is clear that the relevant Canadian state action  s. 159.3 of the IRPR along with the broader legislative scheme  is a necessary precondition to each of the proven or presumed effects related to detention and refoulement. Without the Safe Third Country Agreement regime, individuals could advance their refugee protection claims in Canada; instead, they are sent back to the United States by Canadian officials acting under legislative authority, where they face (or are presumed to face) these effects. However, the Federal Court judge erred in her application of the foreseeability standard established by the Court in Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, and explained in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101. With respect to the cold temperatures in detention facilities, deficiencies in medical care, detention alongside criminally convicted individuals and the violation of religious dietary restrictions, the record does not support a finding that these effects were a foreseeable consequence of Canadas actions. By contrast, the record substantiates that the other negative effects were entirely foreseeable, such as the risk of detention, the one-year bar, the treatment of gender-based claim and the widespread practice of medical isolation. These infringements of liberty and security of the person are causally connected to Canadian state action and must be assessed in relation to the principles of fundamental justice.\n\tThe applicable principles of fundamental justice in the instant case are overbreadth and gross disproportionality as described by the Court in Bedford. The shocks the conscience standard may well be relevant to the review of individualized decisions, but it is not relevant to Charter challenges to legislation; it is therefore not the appropriate measure here. When assessing whether legislation violates the Bedford principles of fundamental justice, courts must identify the legislative purpose and then assess if, in light of that purpose, the legislation breached any of the relevant principles. When a legislative objective is at issue as part of the s. 7 analysis, the focus is the purpose of the impugned provisions, although the broader legislative scheme may provide clues as to the narrower provisions purpose. Here, taken together, the statement of objectives of the IRPA, the text, context, and scheme of the legislation, and the extrinsic evidence suggest that the purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR is to share responsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement. It is in light of this purpose that the relevant s. 7 deprivations  the risk of discretionary detention and medical isolation, along with the presumed risks of refoulement  must be assessed for overbreadth and gross disproportionality.\n\tThe impugned legislative scheme in the instant case is not overbroad or grossly disproportionate. With respect to overbreadth, the question is whether the scheme is so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose. The analysis is focused not on whether Parliament has chosen the least restrictive means, but whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty or security of the person in a way that has no connection with the mischief contemplated by the legislature. The risk of detention in the United States, with opportunities for release and review, is related to the legislative objective. Sharing responsibility for refugee claims with another state will necessarily expose returnees to the foreign legal regime that governs refugee claimants presence in that country. A degree of difference as between the legal schemes applicable in the two countries can be tolerated, so long as the American system is not fundamentally unfair. While the record shows that returnees face a risk of detention in the United States, it also discloses mechanisms that create opportunities for release and provide for review by administrative decision makers and courts. There is no basis to infer that these arrangements are fundamentally unfair, and thus the risk of detention that returnees face is not overbroad. Similarly, the use of medical isolation to control public health risks is not fundamentally unfair. The applicants do not point to evidence that would sustain an inference that medical isolation is being used improperly in the American immigration detention system. With respect to gross disproportionality, the question is whether the impugned legislations effects on the s. 7 interests are so grossly disproportionate to its purposes that they cannot rationally be supported. Neither a risk of detention with opportunities for release and review nor a risk of medical isolation meets this high threshold. In Canada, as in the United States, these risks are within the mutually held norms accepted by our free and democratic societies.\n\tA provision mandating return to a real and not speculative risk of refoulement, however, would be overbroad as it would bear no relation to the purpose of the impugned legislation, which has respect for the non-refoulement principle at its core. Such a provision would similarly be grossly disproportionate because it would, by definition, expose individuals to risks to their life or freedom, torture or other fundamental human rights violations. However, the impugned legislation in the instant case does not simply mandate return: there are also related curative provisions that must be factored into the analysis, including administrative deferrals of removal (IRPA, s. 48(2)), temporary resident permits (s. 24), humanitarian and compassionate exemptions (s. 25.1(1)) and public policy exemptions (s. 25.2(1)). When the impugned legislative scheme contains safety valves, the question is whether these mechanisms  properly interpreted and applied  are sufficient to ensure that no deprivations contrary to the principles of fundamental justice occur. When the IRPAs safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted from return. If they are not returned to the United States, they do not face any risk of refoulement from the United States. The safety valves can therefore intervene to cure what might otherwise be unconstitutional effects. Moreover, these mechanisms are properly considered within the principles of fundamental justice stage of s. 7 because they can be exercised in order to address the specific deprivation at issue, in this case the risk of refoulement. Properly interpreted, these mechanisms in the broader statutory scheme are sufficient to ensure that individuals are not subjected to real and not speculative risks of refoulement, if such risks do exist. These mechanisms must be understood in light of the discretion that Article 6 of the Safe Third Country Agreement preserves for Canada to consider claims when it is in its public interest to do so. The mere fact that the mechanisms predate the treaty does not make them irrelevant; when the agreement was signed, Canadian domestic law already included provisions that could facilitate individualized consideration of claimants circumstances. Thus, even assuming that claimants face real and not speculative risks of refoulement from the United States, the Canadian legislative scheme provides safety valves that guard against such risks. For that reason, the legislative scheme implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement is not overbroad or grossly disproportionate and therefore accords with the principles of fundamental justice. Consequently, no breach of s. 7 of the Charter has been established, and it is not necessary to undertake a s. 1 analysis.\n\tThe challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter should be sent back to the Federal Court for determination. The basis of this claim is that women fearing gender-based persecution are adversely affected by the legislative scheme. Given the profound seriousness of the matter, the size and complexity of the record and the conflicting affidavit evidence, it would be imprudent for the Court to dispose of the equality rights claim as would a court of first instance and thus leave the losing party with no avenue of appeal. While the Federal Court judge should not be faulted for exercising judicial restraint and not deciding the s. 15 claim, a false economy has arisen due to the need to remit these issues. The principle of judicial policy underlying restraint in constitutional cases is sound, but it must be weighed against other factors, such as the possibility of an appeal and fairness to the parties. Claims based on s. 15 are not secondary issues only to be reached after all other issues are considered. The Charter should not be treated as if it establishes a hierarchy of rights in which s. 15 occupies a lower tier.\nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Canada (Attorney General) v.

In essence, the treaty provides that refugee claimants must, as a general rule, seek protection in whichever of the two countries they first enter after leaving their country of origin. The Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries, Can. T.S. 2004 No. 2, is known as the Safe Third Country Agreement. The treatys preamble speaks to the parties mutual recognition that both countries offer generous systems of refugee protection, such that claimants can find effective protection in either country. Sharing responsibility is thus understood as justified, even though the laws of each country differ.\nThe Safe Third Country Agreement is given effect in Canadian domestic law through the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA), and its regulations. Under s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA, refugee status claims are ineligible to be considered in Canada if the claimant came from a country designated by the regulations. Countries may only be so designated if they are viewed as complying with their non-refoulement obligations under international law. These obligations  which prohibit directly or indirectly returning a person to a place where they would face certain kinds of irreparable harm, including threats to their life or freedom, torture and cruel or degrading treatment  are the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime (see, for a plain language summary, United Nations, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, The principle of non-refoulement under international human rights law, July 5, 2018 (online)). A designated country is thus seen as a safe third country in that it is viewed as an appropriate partner with which Canada can share responsibility for considering refugee claims. The United States is designated under s. 159.3 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 (IRPR). It is the sole designated country in Canadian law.\nThe appellants challenge this scheme principally on the basis that it violates the rights guaranteed by ss. 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They claim that the legislation results in Canadian immigration officers summarily returning claimants to the United States without considering whether the United States will respect their rights under international law, including those relating to non-refoulement and detention.\nCertain questions are not in issue in this appeal. First, there is no debate that safe third country agreements, as a general matter, may be compatible with international law (see, e.g., I. Atak and F. Crepeau, Asylum in the twenty-first century: Trends and challenges, in A. Triandafyllidou, ed., Routledge Handbook of Immigration and Refugee Studies (2nd ed. 2023), 358, at p. 363). Second, the appellants do not attack the validity of the Safe Third Country Agreement itself. Third, this Court is not tasked with assessing the wisdom of Canadian immigration policy, a matter that courts are not institutionally designed to evaluate, much less reform. Fourth, this Court is not asked to resolve the thorny issue of irregular entry into Canada at border crossings other than official land ports of entry (see, e.g., A. Macklin, Citizenship, Non-Citizenship and The Rule of Law (2018), 69 U.N.B.L.J. 19, at pp. 35-37). Instead, the appeal focuses on whether the Canadian legislative regime implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement  that is, the relevant provisions of the IRPA and IRPR  complies with constitutional and administrative law requirements.\nThe complexion of the judgments below on the Charter questions could not be more different. The Federal Court judge, who reviewed the evidence first-hand, found that the alleged s. 7 violations were largely substantiated and most grave. Deprivations of liberty and security of the person for refugee claimants arose because those returned to the United States faced risks of refoulement as well as other harm relating to immigration detention. In the result, she was persuaded that s. 7 was violated and that this breach was not justified under s. 1. She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nBy contrast, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Charter challenge was not properly constituted and thus allowed the appeal brought by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness. Despite the appellants evidence and the findings of the Federal Court judge, the Court of Appeal found that the causation requirements for a Charter claim were not met because the appellants improperly targeted the legislation rather than administrative conduct. Respectfully, I disagree with the Court of Appeal and prefer the view  shared by both parties on appeal to this Court  that the regulation designating the United States was an appropriate focus of the Charter challenge. In particular, since the s. 159.3 designation is the legislative basis for the relevant ineligibility determinations, it is properly subject to constitutional scrutiny.\nFurther, I agree with the Federal Court judges findings that the liberty and security of the person interests of refugee claimants are engaged by the Canadian legislation that renders their claims ineligible. Specifically, I reject the notion that the claimants s. 7 interests are not engaged simply because the legislation contains measures that could ultimately have offered protection. This, I think, rests on a misunderstanding of Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 SCC 68, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 431, and is inconsistent with this Courts approach to s. 7 set out in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101.\nThe findings of fact relating to the treatment of refugee claimants made by the Federal Court judge are troubling. Apart from her determinations that detention in the United States is automatic and that detention conditions cause a risk of refoulement, the respondents have failed to show that those conclusions are tainted by reviewable errors. While she made no finding that American asylum policies give rise to a risk of refoulement, I am nevertheless persuaded that the record substantiated her view that the designation of the United States engages the liberty and security of the person interests spoken to in s. 7 of the Charter.\nAfter engagement of these constitutionally protected interests is established, however, the s. 7 analysis turns to what scholar Gerald Heckman, writing prior to his appointment to the bench, describes as the key question in refugee protection decision making: whether the deprivation of the liberty or security of the person interests is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (Revisiting the Application of Section 7 of the Charter in Immigration and Refugee Protection (2017), 68 U.N.B.L.J. 312, at p. 356). This requires an examination of whether Canadian state action has interfered with those fundamental interests pursuant to a fair process and in a manner rationally connected and proportionate to the objectives of Canadas immigration laws (ibid.). The focus of this examination is not on whether asylum law in the United States mirrors the law in Canada. Instead, the focus is on the purpose and effects of the Canadian legislative scheme. Of particular significance here is whether the ineligibility rule in the legislation is tempered by related provisions that provide relief from potential s. 7 violations. As this Court held in Canada (Attorney General) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, speaking specifically to what are usefully described as curative exemptions, legislative safety valve[s] can ensure that deprivations of the s. 7 interests are not arbitrary, overbroad or grossly disproportionate (para. 113).\nFrom this perspective, and notwithstanding the findings of the Federal Court judge that the s. 7 interests are engaged, the challenge to s. 159.3 of the IRPR ultimately fails. The IRPA and the IRPR contain exceptions, exemptions and review obligations that address the problems associated with ineligibility and removal from Canada. These provisions give voice in Canadian law to the idea, expressed in Article 6 of the treaty, that each government should be free to examine any refugee status claim when it determines that doing so is in its public interest. In particular, even where ineligibility under the scheme would lead to deprivations of liberty or security of the person  as the Federal Court judge found  the legislative schemes discretionary exemptions ensure compliance with the principles of fundamental justice. In sum, the legislation is tailored to prevent certain infringements of s. 7 interests and, importantly for present purposes, survives constitutional scrutiny here because legislative safety valves provide curative relief. \nWhile the Federal Court judge stated that safeguards in the scheme were illusory, her assessment did not consider all the relevant safety valves. This omission was an error of law that led her to improperly discount how the legislative scheme allows Canada to consider refugee status claims when the principles of fundamental justice so require, notwithstanding their presumptive ineligibility. As a result, I am respectfully of the view that the Federal Courts conclusion that the designation of the United States for the purposes of the Safe Third Country Agreement breached s. 7 cannot stand.\nIt may well be that, in practice, administrative decision makers do not always construe or deploy the legislative safety valves appropriately. In such cases, the legislation itself remains valid, but administrative and Charter relief remains available on an individual basis. For instance, the Charter can prohibit administrative actors from returning refugee claimants to places where they would face circumstances that would shock the conscience of Canadians. Yet, while some of the appellants have detailed the difficulties they faced in seeking refugee protection at Canadian land ports of entry, they have not asked this Court to provide them with individualized relief. Instead, they focus their constitutional challenge solely on alleged defects in the legislative scheme itself in order to have s. 159.3 of the IRPR declared of no force or effect under the Constitution Act, 1982.\nWhile I reject the appellants s. 7 challenge to the legislative scheme and their other arguments, I would nevertheless allow the appeal in part. I would remit the appellants claim that the legislation violates Charter-guaranteed equality rights, which was not decided by either court below. The appellants s. 15 claim rests on grave allegations that women facing gender-based persecution and sexual violence are often denied refugee status in the United States contrary to Article 33 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Can. T.S. 1969 No. 6 (Refugee Convention). The evidentiary basis for the appellants s. 15 claim remains disputed and no factual findings were made in the Federal Court on which we can rely on appeal. It would be imprudent for this Court to dispose of the equality rights claim as would a court of first instance and thus leave the losing party with no avenue of appeal.\nThe Parties\nThe appellants are individual refugee claimants and public interest litigants. The respondents are the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.\nEach individual appellant arrived from the United States to claim refugee protection in Canada. Because they arrived at land ports of entry, their claims were ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division, pursuant to s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR.\nABC and her daughters are citizens of El Salvador, where they say they were subject to gender-based persecution and sexual violence committed by gangs. They fled to the United States in 2016, where they were initially detained. American officials advised them they were subject to removal proceedings. ABC and her daughters were released for the duration of those proceedings. In 2017, ABC and her daughters arrived at the land port of entry at Fort Erie, Ontario to claim refugee protection in Canada. They say that a Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer advised them that they should withdraw their claim, as they would be found ineligible in keeping with the Safe Third Country Agreement. They decided to return to the United States. About six months later, ABC and her daughters again attempted to make a claim for refugee protection. ABCs husband, whose own refugee claim in Canada was pending, retained legal counsel in anticipation that the CBSA would determine that ABCs and her daughters claims were ineligible. When the CBSA made that determination, it agreed to defer removal briefly. Counsel applied for judicial review and also obtained a stay of removal, which remains in effect while this appeal is pending.\nMs. Mustefa is an Ethiopian citizen and member of the Oromo ethnic group. When she was 11, she travelled alone to the United States on a visitors visa for medical treatment. She stayed there through the end of high school. Ms. Mustefa says that oppression of the Oromo in Ethiopia escalated around this time. She decided not to return to Ethiopia but believed a policy known as the one-year bar made her ineligible to claim asylum in the United States. In 2017, Ms. Mustefa travelled to the land port of entry in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Quebec to make a claim for refugee protection in Canada. The CBSA determined her claim was ineligible. She was returned to the United States, where she says that American officials detained her in solitary confinement for a week pending the results of a tuberculosis test and then detained her for another three weeks in an abnormally cold facility, where individuals convicted of criminal offences were present and where her religious dietary restrictions were not respected. While detained, Ms. Mustefa was able to communicate with her family and with legal counsel, and she was later released on a bond. Ms. Mustefa applied for permanent residence in the United States, which was granted in 2021.\nMs. Al Nahass and her three children are citizens of Syria. She and her family lived in Saudi Arabia, where her husband worked. In 2015, Ms. Al Nahass travelled to Syria for medical treatment. She says that during that trip, she was kidnapped, attacked and threatened with sexual violence. The family subsequently travelled to the United States. While there, she says that her husband lost his job, jeopardizing the familys residency in Saudi Arabia. Ms. Al Nahass feared returning to Syria and began the asylum process in the United States. During this process, Ms. Al Nahass says that she grew concerned with what she perceived as public hatred expressed towards Muslim and Arab people and with actions taken by the United States executive. She and her family decided to seek refugee protection in Canada. When they did so at the land port of entry in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, the CBSA determined their claims were ineligible. Ms. Al Nahass contacted legal counsel, who filed a motion for an emergency stay of removal at the Federal Court. An interim stay was granted. Before the full stay motion could be heard, the Minister granted the family temporary resident permits. They have now been granted permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.\nThe appellants introduced into evidence affidavits from ten anonymized, non-party affiants. Each affiant says that they were returned to the United States after their claims were found ineligible pursuant to the Safe Third Country Agreement. The nine affiants who answered written cross-examinations stated that, after their return, they were detained by American authorities. With one exception, they were released from detention pursuant to an administrative decision or bond hearing. Likewise, they made asylum claims in the United States with the assistance of counsel. One affiant could not meet the bond set for their release. That individual was removed from the United States after unsuccessfully appealing the immigration judges unfavourable decision to the American Board of Immigration Appeals and, subsequently, to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\nProceedings Below\nFederal Court, 2020 FC 770, [2021] 1 F.C.R. 209 (McDonald J.)\nThe appellants challenged the validity of s. 159.3 of the IRPR on the basis that the designation of the United States was outside the authority granted by the IRPA. They also said that s. 159.3 of the IRPR and s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA unjustifiably violated ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter. The Federal Court judge rejected the argument that the regulation was ultra vires but found an unjustified s. 7 breach. Because of her conclusion on s. 7, she declined to rule on the s. 15 claim. \nThe vires argument was rejected because Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada, 2008 FCA 229, [2009] 3 F.C.R. 136 (CCR (2008)), at para. 57, held that whether a regulation is within the authority delegated by a statute is assessed based on facts at the time of promulgation. \nThe Federal Court judge found that the Charter applied. Deprivations effected by foreign actors remain subject to the guarantee of fundamental justice, as long as there is a sufficient causal connection between our governments participation and the deprivation (para. 100, citing Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; see also Federal Court reasons, at para. 93, citing Bedford, at paras. 58 and 75-76).\nIn the Federal Court judges view, the impugned scheme engages liberty because ineligible [Safe Third Country Agreement] claimants are . . . immediately and automatically imprisoned by U.S. authorities (para. 103). It infringes security of the person given the risk of refoulement and the conditions of detention in the United States. She found there was a real and not speculative risk that ABC would have been refouled from the United States based on the challenges in advancing an asylum clai[m] for those detained, such as barriers to accessing legal advice (para. 106). In addition, she concluded that some detention conditions in the United States engage security of the person since being subjected to these conditions flows directly from Canadian officials conduct in returning claimants there. \nThe Federal Court judge held that these deprivations do not comport with the principles of fundamental justice. She concluded that, despite the suggestion that there are certain safeguards available to protect against overbreadth and gross disproportionality, these remedies are largely out of reach and are therefore illusory (paras. 129-30, distinguishing Tapambwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 34, [2020] 1 F.C.R. 700).\nThe Federal Court judge held that the s. 7 violations were not justified under s. 1 of the Charter and decline[d] to address the s. 15 arguments (see para. 154, citing Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 93). She declared s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and suspended the declaration for six months. \nFederal Court of Appeal, 2021 FCA 72, [2021] 3 F.C.R. 294 (Noel C.J. and Stratas and Laskin JJ.A.)\nStratas J.A., writing for a unanimous Court of Appeal, allowed the ministers appeal, dismissed the cross-appeal of the s. 15 claim and the ultra vires argument, set aside the judgment of the Federal Court, and dismissed the applications for judicial review. \nThe court found that the Charter claim was not properly constituted because it failed to account for two practical rules flowing from the requirement that impugned state action must be the cause of a Charter infringement (para. 57). The first rule is that provisions in an interrelated legislative scheme cannot be taken in isolation and selectively challenged because [o]ther related provisions may be responsible [for the alleged Charter violation] or may prevent or cure any possible defects (para. 58(a), citing PHS). The second rule is that when administrative action or inaction is the source of a rights infringement, that is what must be challenged rather than the legislation (para. 58(b), citing Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2000 SCC 69, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1120). The court concluded that if anything were to blame for the alleged violations, it would be the Government of Canadas reviews of the United States designation, which are required under s. 102(3) of the IRPA, and related administrative conduct. Thus, by targeting s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and s. 159.3 of the IRPR, the challenge was improperly constituted. \nDespite allowing the appeal on this basis, the Court of Appeal addressed certain substantive s. 7 issues. First, it noted that the Federal Court judge erred in finding that returnees are automatically detained (para. 138, see also paras. 139-40). Second, the court rejected the finding that the schemes safety valves were illusory (para. 144). Third, the court found error with the Federal Court judges analysis of American detention conditions (para. 146). Fourth, it also perceived errors in her analysis of the principles of fundamental justice. For the Court of Appeal, there was no evidence that could support a finding that the treatment of returnees to the United States at the Canada-United States border shocks the conscience (para. 161). In any event, the court considered the scheme to be neither overbroad nor grossly disproportionate. \nThe Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to address the substance of the s. 15 claim. Had it been necessary, the court wrote that [w]here, as here, no factual findings have been made on the section 15 issues, it is generally best for us to send the matter back to the Federal Court because of its expertise in fact-finding (para. 173).\nIssues\nThe appellants raise three issues: Is s. 159.3 of the IRPR ultra vires? Does s. 159.3 unjustifiably breach s. 7 of the Charter? Should the s. 15 Charter claim be remitted to the Federal Court or decided based on the record on appeal?\nStatutory and Regulatory Scheme and Context\nThe impugned regulation is part of the legislative scheme that implements a bilateral treaty between Canada and the United States, that is, the Safe Third Country Agreement. While not itself challenged, this treaty shapes the interpretation of its implementing scheme (see National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Import Tribunal), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, at p. 1371). It is useful to examine the treaty and the legislation in turn, as they remain substantively distinct under Canadas dualist system for the application of international legal instruments (Kazemi Estate v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 2014 SCC 62, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 176, at para. 150; see G. van Ert, Using International Law in Canadian Courts (2nd ed. 2008), ch. 7). An additional protocol to the treaty has been signed and the implementing legislation has been amended since the hearing (Regulations Amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (Examination of Eligibility to Refer Claim), SOR/2023-58; Additional Protocol to the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries, March 24, 2023 (online)). I refrain from commenting on these instruments as they do not directly affect the substance of the issues on appeal before the Court.\nSafe Third Country Agreement\nAbout 30 years ago, Canada and the United States undertook the negotiation of an agreement to share responsibility for refugee status claims. The Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were among the organizations whose comments resulted in substantive amendments to a draft of the Safe Third Country Agreement. The two states signed the agreement in 2002. \nThe preamble to the agreement expressly acknowledges the governments international obligations to refugees (paras. 1, 2 and 8). It also addresses the parties shared determination to safeguard for each eligible claimant access to a full and fair refugee status determination procedure (para. 8) and emphasizes that both countries offer generous refugee protection systems (para. 4). Accompanying the treaty is a Statement of Principles associated with its implementation, which states that the parties intend to abide by principles that include safeguards for claimants, such as the opportunity for claimants to have a third party present during proceedings (Procedural issues associated with implementing the Agreement for cooperation in the examination of refugee status claims from nationals of third countries: Statement of Principles, August 30, 2002 (online)).\nThe principle animating the Safe Third Country Agreement is that the country of last presence shall examine, in accordance with its refugee status determination system, the refugee status claim of any person who arrives at a land border port of entry (Article 4(1)). This is the crux of the treaty (A. Macklin, Disappearing Refugees: Reflections on the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (2005), 36 Colum. Hum. Rts. L. Rev. 365, at p. 371) or its general principle (S. Baglay and M. Jones, Refugee Law (2nd ed. 2017), at p. 279). The country of last presence is that country, being either Canada or the United States, in which the refugee claimant was physically present immediately prior to making a refugee status claim at a land border port of entry (Article 1(1)(a)). The parties committed to reviewing the agreement and to inviting the UNHCR to participate in the first review (Article 8(3)). \nWhile Article 4(1) sets out a broad principle, the treaty is limited in its application. To begin, the governments sought to ensure that indirect or chain refoulement would not occur. They agreed that individuals returned to Canada or the United States would not be removed therefrom until that country had adjudicated the individuals refugee status claim (Article 3). They also did not seek to apply the agreement to citizens or habitual residents of either country (Article 2) and provided for exceptions for unaccompanied minors and family reunification (Article 4(2)). \nEven when the principle articulated in Article 4(1) would apply, the parties agreed that there should be an authority to exempt claimants. Article 6 provides that either Party may at its own discretion examine any refugee status claim made to that Party where it determines that it is in its public interest to do so.\nDomestic Implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement\nSection 101(1)(e) of the IRPA implements the core principle of the Safe Third Country Agreement by providing that the claims of individuals who came directly or indirectly to Canada from a country designated by the regulations, other than a country of their nationality or their former habitual residence are ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division. This gives domestic effect to the principle set out in Article 4(1) that an individuals country of last presence will examine their refugee status claim. Various other rules in the IRPA and its regulations affect the application of this general rule, including (1) designation and review mechanisms; (2) limits to the scope of the general rule; and (3) exemptions. \nDesignation and Review Mechanisms\nThe IRPA sets forth the relevant criteria for when a country may be designated by the Governor in Council under s. 101(1)(e). Only countries that comply with the non-refoulement obligations under the relevant international conventions are eligible: \n102 (1) The regulations may govern matters relating to the application of sections 100 and 101 . . . and, for the purpose of sharing responsibility with governments of foreign states for the consideration of refugee claims, may include provisions\n\n(a) designating countries that comply with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture;\nSection 102(2) lists factors to be considered when ascertaining whether a country complies with refugee protection standards mandated by the Conventions:\n(2) The following factors are to be considered in designating a country under paragraph (1)(a):\n\n(a) whether the country is a party to the Refugee Convention and to the Convention Against Torture;\n\n(b) its policies and practices with respect to claims under the Refugee Convention and with respect to obligations under the Convention Against Torture;\n\n(c) its human rights record; and\n\n(d) whether it is party to an agreement with the Government of Canada for the purpose of sharing responsibility with respect to claims for refugee protection.\nThe Governor in Council must ensure the continuing review of the s. 102(2) factors with respect to each designated country (s. 102(3)). The United States is the only country that has been designated (Regulations Amending the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2004-217). Section 159.3 of the IRPR, which the appellants challenge, provides:\n159.3 The United States is designated under paragraph 102(1)(a) of the Act as a country that complies with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, and is a designated country for the purpose of the application of paragraph 101(1)(e) of the Act.\nLimits to the General Ineligibility Rule\nVarious provisions in the IRPR narrow the application of the ineligibility rule by ensuring that not all refugee claimants arriving from the United States are returned there. The regulations do this in two ways. First, the regulations contain limitations that closely track the contours of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Safe Third Country Agreement. For instance, under the regime considered in this appeal, s. 101(1)(e) ineligibility applies only to the claims of individuals who arrive at land ports of entry  not elsewhere along the land border, by ship or by air (IRPR, s. 159.4). There are specific exceptions for individuals with family in Canada, to facilitate family reunification (s. 159.5(a) to (d)). As the treaty contemplates, these exceptions are applied according to Canadas domestic understanding of the family (Article 1(2); IRPR, s. 159.1). There are also exceptions for unaccompanied minors (s. 159.5(e)) and for individuals who have certain Canadian immigration statuses (s. 159.5(f) and (g)). Finally, the regulations ensure that certain individuals whose claims will not be adjudicated in the United States can access the Canadian system (s. 159.5(h)). \nSecond, the regulations include an exception reflecting Canadas discretion, preserved under Article 6 of the treaty, to consider claims when doing so is in its public interest (Baglay and Jones, at p. 279). Section 159.6 of the IRPR ensures that claimants who establish that they have been charged with, or convicted of, an offence punishable by the death penalty in the United States or another country are not returned. \nExemptions From the Application of the General Ineligibility Rule\nIndividuals subject to the provisions implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement cannot access some of the statutory mechanisms available to claimants in different circumstances. For instance, returnees are not eligible for a pre-removal risk assessment before they are removed (IRPA, s. 112(2)(b)). Further, there is no administrative appeal body set out in the IRPA for them. Judicial review at the Federal Court, however, remains available (s. 72). Judges may grant stays of removal while such proceedings are ongoing (Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106, r. 373; see also Baglay and Jones, at pp. 354-57). \nThe IRPA does, however, contain mechanisms for temporary or permanent exemptions from return to the United States (see, e.g., H. Mayrand and A. Smith-Gregoire, A la croisee du chemin Roxham et de la rhetorique politique: demystifier lEntente sur les tiers pays surs (2018), 48 R.D.U.S. 321, at p. 342). First, officers may grant an administrative deferral from the enforcement of a removal order. This authority flows from s. 48(2) of the IRPA, which requires that removal orders be enforced as soon as possible. Courts have held that this provision leaves officers with discretion to delay the enforcement of a removal order (see, e.g., Atawnah v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FCA 144, [2017] 1 F.C.R. 153, at paras. 13-18; Revell v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 262, [2020] 2 F.C.R. 355, at para. 50; Tapambwa, at para. 87). In this case, ABC and her daughters benefitted from an administrative deferral of removal, during which their counsel applied for a stay of removal.\nSecond, officers may grant a temporary resident permit. This authority flows from s. 24 of the IRPA, which allows an officer to issue a permit if they are of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances. The Minister or their delegate may also make instructions to guide officers in determining when to issue such permits (s. 24(3)). Here, Ms. Al Nahasss family received temporary resident permits while the Minister considered whether to grant permanent exemptions.\nThird, the Minister may grant an exemption based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, as occurred for Ms. Al Nahasss family. The Minister may exempt certain foreign nationals who are inadmissible from any of the requirements of the IRPA. They may grant exemptions where they view doing so as justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected (s. 25.1(1)). This assessment must consider and give weight to all relevant humanitarian and compassionate considerations in a particular case (Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para. 33 (emphasis in original)). \nFourth, the Minister has a further discretion to exempt foreign nationals who are inadmissible from any of the requirements of the IRPA. The Minister may do so when they are of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations (s. 25.2(1)). The respondents observe that this provision permits the Minister to establish a temporary public policy exempting individuals who are part of a specified group from the ineligibility provision.\nAny removal order against a foreign national can be stayed while the Minister makes their decision in relation to s. 25.1(1) or 25.2(1) (IRPR, s. 233). \nAdministrative Law Issues\nI turn now to the appellants argument that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires because of post-promulgation constraints on the Governor in Councils statutory authority to maintain a designation. First, the appellants submit that it was unreasonable, given the factors in s. 102 of the IRPA, to maintain the United States designation when there is evidence that many refugees cannot access effective protection there. Second, they say that the Governor in Council breached its s. 102(3) obligation to ensure continuing review of the United States compliance. \nI would not give effect to these arguments. I agree with the respondents that the vires of s. 159.3 of the IRPR must be examined at the time of promulgation.\nRegulations derive their validity from the statute which creates the power, and not from the executive body by which they are made (Reference as to the Validity of the Regulations in relation to Chemicals, [1943] S.C.R. 1, at p. 13, per Duff C.J., quoting The Zamora, [1916] 2 A.C. 77 (P.C.), at p. 90). The limits imposed by the enabling statute are therefore fundamental to determining whether a regulation is intra vires (see J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation (3rd ed. 2021), at p. 165). \nHere, the appellants misconstrue the limitations imposed by s. 102 of the IRPA. The Governor in Council may promulgate regulations designating countries that comply with Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (s. 102(1)(a)). The statute also prescribes factors for the Governor in Council to consider in designating a country (s. 102(2)). These factors concern when countries may be designated. Thus, s. 102(1)(a) and (2) establishes conditions precedent to designation for the purposes of s. 101(1)(e), as the Federal Court of Appeal held in CCR (2008) (para. 75). The statute requires that these conditions be met before, not after, a country is designated (see E. A. Driedger, Subordinate Legislation (1960), 38 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at p. 8).\nThe Governor in Council does, however, have statutory obligations in the period after a country is designated pursuant to s. 102(1)(a). Section 102(3) creates an obligation to ensure the continuing review of the s. 102(2) factors. These reviews are not directed at whether the regulation exceeds the limits imposed by the statute, which is the proper focus of a vires challenge. In this sense, the s. 102(3) reviews are outside the scope of a challenge alleging that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires the IRPA. Instead, the continuing reviews are a distinct statutory obligation of the Governor in Council. As a result, s. 102(3) reviews may be challenged based on administrative law principles (see C.A. reasons, at para. 96). However, the appellants did not seek judicial review of particular s. 102(3) reviews conducted after the promulgation of s. 159.3. \nFocusing on the appropriate date and recognizing that the s. 102(3) reviews are outside the scope of a vires argument, I am persuaded that the appellants fail on this point. As this Court has held, [r]egulations benefit from a presumption of validity (Katz Group Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 810, at para. 25; see also P.-A. Cote and M. Devinat, Interpretation des lois (5th ed. 2021), at para. 1314). Thus, to succeed in their argument based on s. 159.3s inconsistency with the provisions they rely on, the appellants must show that on the date of promulgation, the designation of the United States was not authorized by s. 102(1)(a) or (2) of the IRPA. Because they have directed their argument at post-promulgation developments, the appellants have not done so. Accordingly, the appellants submission that s. 159.3 of the IRPR is ultra vires should be rejected. \nAs a result, addressing other aspects of the appellants administrative law claims is unnecessary, including the appropriate standard of review and how that standard would be applied in the circumstances of this case. \nThe Section 7 Claim \nTo establish a violation of s. 7 of the Charter, challengers must first show that the impugned legislation deprives them of life, liberty or security of the person. This analysis asks whether the legislation engage[s] those interests, in the sense that it causes a limitation or negative impact on, an infringement of, or an interference with them (Carter, at para. 55; see also Bedford, at paras. 57-58, 90 and 111). A risk of such a deprivation suffices (see, e.g., Carter, at para. 62; R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 89; Suresh, at para. 27). Second, challengers must show that the deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\nThe appellants say that the Federal Court judges findings were grounded in the evidence, which demonstrates that s. 159.3 of the IRPR causes deprivations of liberty and security of the person. They say these deprivations are not consistent with the applicable principles of fundamental justice: overbreadth and gross disproportionality. The appellants argue discretionary remedies cannot ensure that deprivations accord with the principles of fundamental justice and, in any event, the Federal Court judge found that these safeguards are illusory. \nIn my respectful view, the Federal Court judge made errors at both stages of her s. 7 analysis. The legislative scheme engages s. 7 in some, but not all, of the respects she identified. Moreover, it does accord with the principles of fundamental justice. \nProperly Constituting a Section 7 Challenge\nThe parties agree that s. 159.3 of the IRPR was an appropriate target for a Charter challenge. The Federal Court of Appeal had disagreed, holding that the claim was not properly constituted because it should have been directed at other forms of state action that are the real cause of any possible infringements. In particular, the court concluded that the appellants should have targeted the administrative reviews, required by s. 102(3) of the IRPA, of the United States designation and related administrative conduct. In my respectful view, the Court of Appeal erred by misapplying the relevant Charter causation jurisprudence.\nThis Court has long recognized that, to succeed, a Charter claim must show a causal link between state action and the violation of the relevant right or freedom (see, e.g., Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at p. 447, per Dickson J., as he then was). In Bedford, this Court held that a sufficient causal connection must be established, which does not require that the impugned state action be the only or the dominant cause of the prejudice suffered by the claimant (para. 76). As a result, the mere fact that other forms of state action may also have a causal connection to the harms alleged does not mean that a challenge to legislation  such as s. 159.3 of the IRPR  is improperly constituted.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the Charter challenges for failing to adhere to two propositions it drew from this Courts causation jurisprudence. First, challengers should not attack provisions in artificial isolation. Second, when administrative conduct under legislation is responsible for unconstitutional effects, that action or inaction must be challenged, not the legislation. While these two propositions do speak to important considerations, in my respectful view they do not justify the conclusion that the appellants challenge is improperly constituted.\nThe Relevance of Preventative and Curative Measures to the Section 7 Challenge\nProvisions in a complex, interrelated legislative scheme should not be viewed in isolation. Generally, the constitutionality of these provisions can only be evaluated by considering the entire scheme. However, this did not preclude the appellants from targeting s. 159.3 of the IRPR. \nWhen a Charter challenge targets a provision in an interrelated legislative scheme, the potential impact of related provisions, including those that may serve to prevent or cure any possible defects, must be reviewed (C.A. reasons, at para. 58(a) (emphasis added)). The success or failure of a Charter claim may turn on arguments or evidence related to preventative or curative provisions. But this should rarely preclude consideration of whether life, liberty or security of the person under s. 7 are engaged.\nLegislation often implicates interests that s. 7 protects. At times, this will result from broad provisions that would  taken on their own  have constitutionally relevant effects on life, liberty or security of the person. However, legislatures can include related provisions within a scheme that temper those effects. When these measures are part of an integrated legislative whole, they must be accounted for when assessing the constitutionality of rules of general application.\nIn PHS, for example, this Court considered the linkages between a general rule and provisions related to it. At issue was, among other things, a general statutory prohibition on possession of controlled substances except as authorized under the regulations. The statute gave the Minister the power to issue exemptions for medical or scientific reasons, or for any purpose the Minister deems to be in the public interest from the application of any provision of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (CDSA) (PHS, at para. 39).\nThe Court found that exemptions acted as a safety valve that prevents the [statute] from applying where such application would be arbitrary, overbroad or grossly disproportionate in its effects (PHS, at para. 113). In other words, when the Ministers discretion was exercised, these provisions cured the constitutional defects that would have arisen had the general prohibition been left to apply to those who ought not to have been caught by it: the staff and clients of a safe injection facility (paras. 94 and 114). \nHere, the Federal Court of Appeal rightly drew on PHS in stating that related provisions in a legislative scheme may prevent or cure constitutional defects (C.A. reasons, at para. 58(a)). The exemptions discussed in PHS were curative in that they made discretionary relief available to those who would otherwise be inappropriately subject to the general prohibition. In other words, the exemption remedied the specific harm that would have flowed from the application of the general rule. \nCurative measures are thus remedial: they repair a breach that would be caused by a general rule by providing a targeted exemption after the fact (see PHS, at para. 41). These measures often work together with preventative measures to limit the scope of a provision of general application. Preventative measures narrow a general rule by precluding its application in anticipation of a breach, often through legislative exceptions. These categories are not watertight compartments, nor are they exhaustive. Moreover, if a class of individuals habitually receive individualized exemptions after the fact, a legislature could enact a class-wide exception that applies in advance.\nCharter challenges need not target preventative and curative provisions when the provision of general application to which they relate is a cause of the alleged mischief. Following PHS, courts must consider legislative provisions in their entire statutory context, irrespective of how the parties frame their challenge of a legislative scheme. Indeed, a failure to consider a relevant related provision can undermine the legitimacy of constitutional analysis (R. v. Parker (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 171, per Rosenberg J.A.). \nIn the legislative scheme at issue in this case, examples of preventative measures include the death penalty exception in s. 159.6 of the IRPR and the various family reunification exceptions in s. 159.5(a) to (d). Curative measures include the availability of temporary resident permits under s. 24, humanitarian and compassionate exemptions under s. 25.1(1), and public policy exceptions under s. 25.2(1). \nAt the engagement stage, preventative provisions can tailor a provision of general application so carefully that it never threatens s. 7 interests. For instance, s. 159.6 of the IRPR prevents the threat to life that might emerge from returning individuals subject to the death penalty. In so doing, preventative provisions like s. 159.6 rule out certain s. 7 engagements. By contrast, curative provisions will rarely, if ever, preclude the engagement of s. 7. PHS provides direct support for this proposition, as this Court held that the general prohibition on possession engaged s. 7 despite the availability of safety valves. Curative provisions create exceptional departures from a general rule; they are typically available only after a determination that the general rule applies. The possibility of obtaining an exemption is therefore a path through which the risks the general rule poses to life, liberty or security of the person can sometimes be avoided. In such cases, the threat to the s. 7 interests persists, but it does not always materialize.\nSome have suggested that because curative mechanisms are available, refugee claimants s. 7 interests are not engaged at the exclusion or inadmissibility determination stage. This assertion rests on a statement in B010 v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 704, that it is at the subsequent pre-removal risk assessment stage of the IRPAs refugee protection process that s. 7 is typically engaged rather than earlier stages (para. 75). This comment in B010 relied on a passage from Febles, which spoke to the Charter-compliance of an exclusion provision in the IRPA. Some scholars have criticized this view of curative mechanisms role in engagement, saying that dicta from these cases should not deflect analysis from this Courts approach to s. 7 engagement established in other contexts (see Heckman, at p. 313; C. Grey, Thinkable: The Charter and Refugee Law after Appulonappa and B010 (2016), 76 S.C.L.R. (2d) 111, at pp. 131-35 and 139; see also H. Stewart, Fundamental Justice: Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2nd ed. 2019), at pp. 77-81 and 342). \nFebles stated that an exclusion provision was consistent with s. 7 of the Charter (para. 67). In line with Bedford and PHS, Febles should not be read as conflating the engagement and the principles of fundamental justice stages of the s. 7 analysis. As for B010, I observe that this Court ordered a new hearing in that appeal as a matter of statutory interpretation and found it unnecessary to consider the appellants s. 7 challenge (para. 74). The brief comment that it is only at the pre-removal stage that s. 7 is typically engaged was neither a formal statement of the law nor necessary to decide the case (para. 75). It should not be taken to have changed the established law on s. 7 engagement. It is helpful to recall that in other contexts, such as extradition, s. 7 permeates the entire process and is engaged, although for different purposes at each stage of the proceedings (United States of America v. Cobb, 2001 SCC 19, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587, at para. 34, per Arbour J.). In the context of ineligibility under s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA, where curative measures are key to the s. 7 analysis, such measures are thus best understood as relevant to the principles of fundamental justice rather than to the threshold question of engagement, in keeping with this Courts methodology in Bedford (see, e.g., Heckman, at pp. 347-56). \nTurning to the principles of fundamental justice analysis, the role of preventative provisions will vary depending on which principles are at issue. For example, legislative tailoring determines how broadly the general regime will be applied and thus undoubtedly factors into whether a scheme is overbroad. \nThe parties disagree as to how curative measures bear on this case. In line with this Courts reasoning in PHS, the respondents appear to see curative measures  like humanitarian and compassionate exemptions  as relevant to determining whether the principles of fundamental justice are respected. Conversely, the appellants claim that Bedfords highly individualistic focus on whether anyones life, liberty or security of the person has been denied has overtaken PHS on this point (para. 123 (emphasis in original)). They say that discretionary exemptions now only factor into the s. 1 analysis.\nI disagree with the appellants. Curative mechanisms are properly considered when assessing whether a deprivation comports with the principles of fundamental justice. Bedford did not hold otherwise. Indeed, curative mechanisms were not at issue in Bedford, so it was unnecessary for this Court to comment on how its approach interacted with its reasoning in PHS. In my view, Bedford and PHS are compatible. Curative provisions have taken on increased significance in the wake of Bedfords recognition that a regime that is rational and non-arbitrary in almost all circumstances can nonetheless violate s. 7 if it is arbitrary, overbroad or grossly disproportionate for one individual (para. 123). If the legislature has crafted a scheme that cures potential breaches by providing exemptions that can target the specific deprivations, this can render the legislative scheme Charter-compliant (see D. Moore, Engagement with Human Rights by Administrative Decision-Makers: A Transformative Opportunity to Build a More Grassroots Human Rights Culture (2017), 49 Ottawa L. Rev. 131, at pp. 150-51; see also PHS, at para. 114). In this sense, the focus of the s. 7 analysis is, at most, only highly individualistic when the legislature has not provided mechanisms that individualize the laws effects (Stewart (2019), at p. 150; see also C. Fehr, Rethinking the Instrumental Rationality Principles of Fundamental Justice (2020), 58 Alta. L. Rev. 133). However, as in PHS, the exemption mechanism must be responsive to the specific deprivation that is the subject of the Charter challenge. \nI note that the Court of Appeal viewed the availability of judicial review in the federal courts as a relevant safety valve. It is true that within the framework established by Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, and this Courts broader administrative law jurisprudence, judicial review helps ensure that public authorities respect legal limits, derived from the enabling statute itself, the common or civil law or the Constitution (Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 28). However, judicial review offers different relief than a statutory mechanism that prevents or cures defects that would arise from the isolated operation of a general rule. This is because legislatures can never entirely shield administrative decision making from curial scrutiny (Vavilov, at para. 24). The general availability of judicial review therefore cannot save otherwise unconstitutional legislation. For this reason, I consider it unhelpful to view judicial review as a form of safety valve or statutory safeguard.\nIn sum, preventative and curative provisions are both relevant in different ways to the appellants Charter claim. To assess a s. 7 breach, the presence of such mechanisms must be considered. However, the appellants did not need to target these provisions to constitute their challenge.\nThe Relevance of Associated Administrative Conduct to the Section 7 Challenge\nI now turn to the question of whether the appellants were obliged to target administrative conduct rather that the legislation. The Court of Appeal said that subsection 102(3) reviews and related administrative conduct, which could have led to the revocation of the United States designation under the IRPR, was the proper focus of the challenge (para. 61). The appellants dispute this conclusion, submitting that whatever the result of the s. 102(3) reviews should have been, the fact remains that the law on the books (s. 159.3 IRPR) is the cause of the Charter breaches in issue and is therefore the proper object of Charter scrutiny and s. 52 [of the Constitution Act, 1982] relief (A.F., at para. 34).\nI agree with the appellants that it was open to them to challenge s. 159.3 of the IRPR, rather than administrative conduct, and seek a declaration that the provision is of no force or effect because it is inconsistent with the Charter. While other avenues may have been available  such as challenging the conduct of the s. 102(3) reviews or seeking individual relief from adverse administrative decisions related to the s. 24, 25.1(1), 25.2(1) or 48(2) curative mechanisms  the appellants did not have to pursue these alternatives to properly constitute their Charter claim. \nTo understand why the appellants were not obliged to target the s. 102(3) reviews, it is necessary to examine their role within the overall legislative scheme. The s. 102(3) reviews are not safety valves. Safety valves, as referred to in the ss. 7 and 12 Charter jurisprudence, typically mean discretionary exemptions or other curative mechanisms, rather than preventative provisions (e.g., PHS, at para. 113; Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, at para. 224, per Binnie and LeBel JJ., dissenting; R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 36, per McLachlin C.J.). The reviews do not play a curative role, as they do not make after-the-fact relief available on an individual basis. They are also distinct from targeted preventative measures, which preclude the application of a general rule, often through legislative exceptions.\nSection 102(3) of the IRPA requires the Governor in Council to ensure the continuing review of the s. 102(2) factors, such as the designated countrys human rights record. The reviews conducted to date have left the designation in place, which remains the legislative basis for the ineligibility of claims advanced by the individual appellants. While the administrative conduct that led to the designation being maintained may also be susceptible to constitutional challenge in its own right, the existence of this alternative does not insulate s. 159.3 of the IRPR from Charter scrutiny. Similarly, while the appellants might also have challenged administrative decisions pertaining to the applicability of exceptions or the availability of exemptions, this does not preclude challenges to s. 159.3. \nEngagement of Section 7 Interests\nIn light of the foregoing, the appellants challenge was properly constituted. I now turn to the substantive s. 7 Charter analysis. While the parties agree that s. 159.3 of the IRPR engages s. 7, they disagree on the particulars of each alleged deprivation and their causal connections to Canadian state action. The first stage of the s. 7 analysis makes clear that the Federal Court judge was right that s. 159.3 engages liberty and security of the person. But in my respectful view, she erred in her assessment of certain particulars.\nThe respondents rightly acknowledge that assessing the constitutional implications of effects that materialize in other countries does not amount to applying the Charter to foreign governments. Here, the challenge is directed at the legislative scheme, which is undoubtedly state action that attracts Charter scrutiny. There is no place in this analysis for assessing whether American laws, policies or actions themselves comply with the Charter. Canadian courts only consider deprivations effected by actors other than our government, if there is a sufficient causal connection between our governments participation and the deprivation ultimately effected (Suresh, at para. 54). Canada cannot avoid the guarantee of fundamental justice merely because the deprivation in question would be effected by someone elses hand (ibid.; see also Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p. 522; United States v. Burns, 2001 SCC 7, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, at paras. 59-60; India v. Badesha, 2017 SCC 44, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 127, at para. 38). But the focus remains fixed on the Canadian legislative scheme and its effects.\nEffects Implicating Section 7 Interests\nThe appellants liberty and security of the person submissions focus on detention in the United States and the risks that claimants may be refouled to their countries of origin following their return to the United States. These arguments have both factual and legal aspects. Whether an alleged effect exists is a question of fact, while the scope of a s. 7 interest is a question of law. The standard of review for the factual questions on appeal is palpable and overriding error (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 10; Bedford, at para. 56; Carter, at para. 109). The standard of review for the legal questions is correctness (Housen, at para. 8). \nDetention in the United States\nThe appellants argue that all returnees face a risk of detention in the United States. They allege that this risk is especially pressing for individuals without status there and that those under a removal order are certain to be detained. Further, they claim that the Federal Court judges findings did not turn on her references to automatic detention. In any event, automatic refers to detention that is imposed without consideration, as a mechanistic or reflexive result and, as such, is not an error. \nWith respect, the Federal Court judges references to automatic detention were erroneous. The evidence shows that detention is not automatic and returnees risks of detention vary on a case-by-case basis. In my view, this palpable error overwhelmed the Federal Court judges conclusions on detention. I agree with the respondents and the Court of Appeal that detention is not automatic, in the sense that it is not universally applied: for the broad class comprising all returnees, the highest possible finding on this record is that returnees to the United States are exposed to a risk of discretionary detention . . . [as] returnees who are detained in the United States can seek release and release is often granted, either on bond or without (C.A. reasons, at paras. 140-41). \nIt is true that the respondents expert acknowledged that there are certain categories of individuals for whom detention is automatic or mandatory: those whom American law defines as arriving or criminal aliens; individuals subject to a final removal order; and suspected terrorists (Affidavit of Stephen Yale-Loehr, at paras. 135-41, reproduced in A.R., vol. XLVII, at pp. 20144-45). But the record does not demonstrate that these categories apply to those returned pursuant to the Safe Third Country Agreement. For other categories of non-citizens, the appellants did not seriously dispute that detention is discretionary and subject to the possibility of release (ibid., at paras. 131-34; Cross-examination of Anwen Hughes, questions 143-49, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXVII, at pp. 11291-92). Indeed, Ms. Mustefa and all of the anonymized affiants who answered written cross-examinations were offered release on bond, and all but one were released. The record also suggests that other alternatives to detention are available (Affidavit of Yale-Loehr, at paras. 159-62). Thus, the evidence does not support the Federal Court judges finding that detention is automatic, in the ordinary sense of the word. \nWhile returnees do not face automatic detention in the United States, the risk of detention remains an effect that engages liberty. This Court has repeatedly held that liberty encompasses freedom from detention, imprisonment and the threat thereof (R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, at p. 652; R. v. Swain, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 933, at p. 969; Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at para. 64; R. v. Demers, 2004 SCC 46, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 30). Thus, because the question at the engagement stage is simply whether the appellants have demonstrated an effect within the scope of s. 7, a risk of detention suffices. \nConditions While Detained in the United States\nThe appellants also argue that conditions of detention in the United States implicate the security of the person interest, as the Federal Court judge held. To be sure, security of the person protects against physical punishment or suffering and the threat thereof (Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at p. 207; Suresh, at paras. 53-55). It also protects against serious and profound state-imposed psychological stress (New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46, at para. 60). The respondents have failed to show reversible errors in the Federal Court judges determination that the conditions of detention fall, in certain respects, within the scope of the security of the person interest. \nFirst, the Federal Court judge found that the use of solitary confinement raised the security of the person interest (para. 110). Ms. Mustefa and one of the anonymized affiants stated that they were isolated pending the results of tuberculosis tests. The Federal Court judges heavy reliance on this evidence suggests that she reached her conclusion on solitary confinement with respect to its uses for this public health purpose. Thus, as I understand her finding, she concluded that isolation is used while some returnees are awaiting tuberculosis testing. This finding discloses no reviewable error. I have no hesitation in concluding that the use of medical isolation presents a risk of serious physical and psychological suffering, as do other forms of solitary confinement. Whether these risks accord with the principles of fundamental justice, or are otherwise justified, is not the question at this stage.\nSecond, the Federal Court judge also accepted evidence that certain detention centres were abnormally cold (para. 111). She relied, in support of this conclusion, on four affiants who had themselves experienced cold conditions in detention. Ms. Mustefa says that her detention facility was freezing cold and that, during the day, she had to put socks over her hands and arms to stay warm, while curled up under a towel. I see no reversible error in the conclusion that this level of cold could cause physical suffering, which engages security of the person.\nThird, the Federal Court judge concluded that the medical care provided in the detention facilities was inadequate in certain respects (para. 112). For instance, she noted evidence that medical staff would ignore Black detainees while addressing White detainees medical issues (ibid.). No reversible error has been shown in her factual findings on inadequacies in medical care, nor in her conclusion that these effects fall within the scope of the security of the person interest (para. 114). \nFourth, the Federal Court judge noted two other portions of Ms. Mustefas affidavit. In particular, Ms. Mustefa said that while detained in the United States, her religious dietary restrictions were not respected and she was held alongside individuals who had been criminally convicted (para. 96). The appellants reference these forms of treatment, even though the Federal Court judge did not rely on them in her analysis of whether security of the person was engaged. I would hesitate to conclude, absent clear findings below, that this treatment falls within the scope of security of the person. However, as will become plain, even taking the appellants case on this point at its highest, I would find no breach of s. 7 on this basis. \nRisks of Refoulement From the United States\nThe appellants also argue that returnees are at a real and not speculative risk of being refouled from the United States to their countries of origin, as the Federal Court judge held. Returning individuals to the United States does not itself constitute refoulement, nor does the United States returning individuals to their countries of origin if the relevant international obligations are respected. Rather, the concern is that the United States may be returning individuals contrary to those obligations, thereby making Canada a participant in indirect refoulement when it returns refugee claimants to the United States. The appellants claim that this risk implicates security of the person. There is no question that a risk of refoulement  whether directly from Canada or indirectly after return to a third country  falls within the scope of the security of the person interest. This Court has noted that the non-refoulement principle is the cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime (Nemeth v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 281, at para. 18). By definition, refoulement exposes individuals to threats to their life or freedom (Refugee Convention, Article 33), torture (Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Can. T.S. 1987 No. 36, Article 3) or other serious human rights violations. It is because these potential consequences are so grave that this Court in Singh considered it unthinkable that refoulement would fall outside the scope of s. 7s protections (p. 210). \nIn this case, the more difficult question at the s. 7 engagement stage is the factual one: whether the Federal Court judge erred in concluding that a real and not speculative risk of refoulement from the United States exists. As I will explain, so said most respectfully, the Federal Court judge made reviewable errors on this point.\nRefoulement Because of Barriers Caused by Detention Conditions\nThe appellants argue that the Federal Court judge was right to find that a risk of refoulement flows from the barriers to making an asylum claim while detained (Federal Court reasons, at para. 106). The respondents submit that the record cannot support this conclusion and that Canadian courts should presume that foreign processes for determining asylum claims are fair. The respondents also invoke a presumption of compliance with international obligations and say that the standard for displacing this presumption with respect to the United States is that the evidence must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances and impeach the totality of the system, even casting doubt on the independence of the judiciary (R.F., at para. 89; see also transcript, at pp. 89 and 92). \nThe respondents arguments are overstated. It is true that there is a presumption that foreign states have fair and independent judicial processes (Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689, at p. 725, quoting Minister of Employment and Immigration v. Satiacum (1989), 99 N.R. 171 (F.C.A.), at para. 19). But I am not satisfied that courts should rely on a presumption that foreign states comply, in every respect, with international law. Instead, the ordinary principles for Charter claims should be followed: the challengers must prove the facts substantiating the alleged rights violations connected to state action ascribed to Canada. When those factual findings are challenged, the ordinary appellate standard of palpable and overriding error applies. \nApplying the proper standard, I am satisfied that the respondents have shown a reviewable error. The record cannot support the Federal Court judges finding that barriers to advancing an asylum claim while detained give rise to a real and not speculative risk of refoulement from the United States. \nTo begin, as the Court of Appeal noted, the Federal Court judges reasons did not squarely engage with significant evidence related to how asylum claims are advanced while individuals are detained (para. 142). For instance, Ms. Mustefa and nearly all of the anonymized affiants had access to counsel to assist with their claims while detained in the United States. Further, several of the expert affiants acknowledged widespread programs designed to provide free legal representation to individuals in immigration detention. Indeed, the record indicates that relevant American legislation offers guarantees of a right to counsel in asylum proceedings and requires claimants be given a list of pro bono counsel (see Affidavit of Yale-Loehr, at paras. 21-24 and 68-74, discussing, inter alia, Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.  1158(d)(4)(B) (2018); see also Cross-examination of Hughes, questions 298-310). The Federal Court judge did not explicitly engage with this important evidence in making her finding. In my respectful view, this omission gives rise to the reasoned belief that the trial judge must have forgotten, ignored or misconceived the evidence in a way that affected [her] conclusion (Housen, at para. 39, quoting Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at para. 15).\nFurther, the record does not support the Federal Court judges finding that refoulement flows from alleged barriers to advancing a claim while detained. In this respect, two crucial matters went largely unaddressed. First, the record discloses review and appeal mechanisms internal to the American asylum system (Affidavit of Yale-Loehr, at paras. 67-74). The appellants point to no evidence establishing that these mechanisms are ineffective. Second, the record reveals that certain claimants whose asylum applications fail have avenues for remaining in the United States. Among these is temporary protected status, which permits individuals from designated countries to remain (see, e.g., Cross-examination of Abed Ayoub, questions 236-60, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXXI, at pp. 13012-17). Another avenue is withholding of removal, which allows individuals to remain if they are more likely than not to be persecuted based on one of the grounds recognized in the Refugee Convention (see, e.g., Affidavit of Deborah Anker, at paras. 65-67, reproduced in A.R., vol. XVII, at pp. 7340-41). Yet another path is protection based on the Convention Against Torture (see, e.g., ibid.). There are also many targeted visa programs for individuals in certain classes, like victims of crime or trafficking (see, e.g., Cross-examination of Lenni B. Benson, questions 278-82, 344-47, 350-55 and 513-21, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXVIII, at pp. 11604-5, 11621, 11623 and 11659-61). These mechanisms are relevant to whether individuals whose detention may create barriers to advancing their asylum claims are, in the end, refouled. But the Federal Court judge did not assess these mechanisms. \nRespectfully said, the Federal Court judge erred by not explicitly considering these aspects of the record that undermine her finding. The record does not support her conclusion that American detention conditions pose barriers to the advancement of asylum claims that raise a real and not speculative risk of refoulement. While it is possible that barriers to advancing a claim in a third country could be so high as to create such a risk, the appellants have not demonstrated that here. \nRefoulement Due to American Asylum Policies\nBefore the Federal Court, the appellants also argued that the imposition of a one-year bar (i.e., a rule under which asylum claims must be advanced within a year of a claimants arrival) and the restrictive interpretation of gender-based persecution as a basis for asylum each result in a risk of refoulement from the United States. They argued that the Canadian legislation facilitating the return of claimants to the United States, where those risks may materialize, implicates the security of the person interest. The Federal Court judge did not make any findings in connection with these arguments, resting her conclusion about the risk of refoulement solely on barriers to advancing an asylum claim from detention (paras. 106 and 113). Indeed, she did not comment on the nature or scope of the relevant American policies.\nOn appeal to this Court, the appellants invoke the purported risks of refoulement flowing from these aspects of American asylum law. However, they do not address how these policies operate and should be understood. Instead, they cite the findings of the Federal Court in Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada, 2007 FC 1262, [2008] 3 F.C.R. 606, along with certain aspects of the evidence that was before the Federal Court judge in the present case. The respondents, by contrast, argue that the relevant American policies respect the non-refoulement principle, relying on other parts of the evidentiary record.\nIn CCR (2008), the Federal Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the Federal Court, in part because the hypothetical nature of the challenge provided no factual basis upon which to assess the alleged Charter breaches (para. 103). More importantly, however, findings made in those proceedings are not properly before this Court here. The Federal Courts 2007 findings are thus of no assistance here.\nFurther, the evidence on the applicable American policies is of limited assistance absent relevant factual findings. The record on this issue is mixed. For instance, the respondents expert appeared to acknowledge that the one-year bar leads to some individuals being denied asylum even if their underlying claims are meritorious (Cross-examination of Stephen Yale-Loehr, question 664, reproduced in A.R., vol. XLVIII, at p. 20508). If this is true, risks of refoulement would be pressing. But the one-year bar has exceptions for changed or extraordinary circumstances (see, e.g., ibid., questions 655 and 660-64; Affidavit of Anker, at para. 60; Affidavit of Jaya Ramji-Nogales, at para. 9, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXX, at pp. 12752-53). Without findings of fact on how these exceptions function, this Court is not positioned to assess whether the one-year bar actually leads to refoulement. Further, the various alternative avenues for remaining in the United States, as described above, may be relevant. These exceptions and alternative avenues may be the manner in which the United States implements its non-refoulement obligations in light of its one-year bar policy.\nThe Federal Court judges lack of findings in relation to American policies on gender-based persecution also makes it imprudent for this Court to determine whether there is a real and not speculative risk of refoulement for claimants fleeing such persecution. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for this Court to attempt to make its own factual findings. In any event, as will become clear, even assuming that these policies do present a real and not speculative risk of refoulement for returnees, I would not ultimately find a s. 7 breach on this basis. \nConclusion as to the Effects Implicating Section 7 Interests\nThe risks of detention upon return to the United States, as well as three aspects of detention conditions as found by the Federal Court judge  the use of medical isolation, abnormally cold conditions and deficiencies in medical care  fall within the scope of liberty and security of the person. Beyond that, to take the appellants position on s. 7 engagement at its highest, I am prepared to proceed on the assumption that the following effects occur and are within the scope of the s. 7 interests: the non-accommodation of religious dietary needs, detention in a facility housing criminally convicted individuals and the risks of refoulement flowing from the one-year bar policy and the United States approach to gender-based claims. With these effects in mind, I turn to the causation analysis. \nCausal Link to Canadian State Action\nAs noted above, to establish s. 7 engagement, challengers must not only demonstrate effects falling within the scope of the s. 7 interests, but also that these effects are caused by Canadian state action. In domestic matters, the requisite causal link will often be obvious. This is rarely so for cases where the deprivation in question is effected by foreign actors. When connecting harms to Canadian state action, courts must be sensitive to the context of the particular case (Bedford, at para. 76). When a challenger seeks to draw a causal connection between Canadian state action and a harm brought about by a foreign actor, the context is meaningfully different from cases in which harms arise through purely domestic processes. \nCanada has no jurisdiction to dictate the actions of foreign authorities. Thus, to draw a causal connection to Canadian state action, Canadian authorities must have been implicated in how the harms arose. Accordingly, challengers will succeed in drawing a causal connection to Canadian state action [a]t least where Canadas participation is a necessary precondition for the deprivation (Suresh, at para. 54). \nFurther, Canada cannot foresee all the actions that foreign authorities will take. Where there is no basis for Canada to have known that a harm would arise, it would be improper to view those harms as causally connected to Canadian state action. Thus, to draw a causal connection to Canadian state action, it must be shown that Canadian authorities knew, or ought to have known, that the harms could arise as a result of Canadas actions. This has been expressed through the recognition that challengers will be able to show a causal connection to Canadian state action [a]t least where . . . the deprivation is an entirely foreseeable consequence of Canadas participation (Suresh, at para. 54 (emphasis added)).\nNecessary Precondition\nIn this case, it is clear that Canadas participation is a necessary precondition to each of the effects related to detention and refoulement. Without the legislative implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement regime, individuals could advance their refugee protection claims in Canada. Instead, they are sent back to the United States by Canadian officials acting under legislative authority, where they face (or are presumed to face) these effects. Thus, I have no hesitation in concluding that the relevant Canadian state action  here, s. 159.3 of the IRPR along with the broader legislative scheme  is a necessary precondition. \nForeseeable Consequence\nIn Bedford, this Court discussed the foreseeability threshold from Suresh and further explained its role (para. 77). Foreseeability, as described in Suresh, can be established by a reasonable inference, drawn on a balance of probabilities (Bedford, at para. 76). As is generally true, what is required is a sufficient connection, having regard to the context of the case (para. 78). Nevertheless, foreseeability remains useful in an international context where Canada does not necessarily have full knowledge of how foreign authorities will act (see, e.g., J. C. Hathaway, The Rights of Refugees Under International Law (2nd ed. 2021), at pp. 367-68). To be plain, the foreseeability standard described in Suresh and interpreted in Bedford is binding on this Court.\nAn effect can be shown to be foreseeable in at least two ways (see, e.g., Hathaway, at p. 373). First, challengers can show that Canada had actual knowledge of the risk that the effects would emerge. For example, Parliamentary debates discussing the risks may establish this knowledge. Second, challengers can also show that Canada ought to have known about the risks, such that knowledge can be imputed. Public reporting, academic analysis, and other sources originating outside government may help establish constructive knowledge. While speculation will not suffice, the threshold for constructive knowledge should remain attainable since foreseeability is a port of entry for s. 7 claims (Bedford, at para. 78). For example, the threshold should remain well below the strict approach taken to judicial notice (see R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 48). \nIn this case, the Federal Court judge noted the Suresh causation framework but did not explicitly consider whether each of the relevant effects was foreseeable (para. 100). She did not state what evidence could have allowed her to conclude that Canada knew, or ought to have known, that these effects would occur. In my respectful view, this approach led the Federal Court judge into reversible error in her application of the foreseeability standard this Court established in Suresh and Bedford.\nWith respect to the cold temperatures in detention facilities, deficiencies in medical care, detention alongside criminally convicted individuals and the violation of religious dietary restrictions, the record does not support a finding that these effects were a foreseeable consequence of Canadas actions on the Suresh and Bedford standard. While these effects are concerning, the question at this stage is whether Canada knew or ought to have known they could occur. The appellants have not pointed to evidence that would enable this Court to answer this question in the affirmative in light of the absence of findings below. They have not established that Canada either knew or ought to have known of this kind of harm arising in American detention facilities. Thus, in my respectful view, there was no basis for concluding that these effects were a foreseeable consequence.\nBy contrast, the record substantiates that the other negative effects were entirely foreseeable. With respect to the risk of detention, it is plain that Canada knew returnees would be exposed to such a risk. From the earliest consultations on the scope of a possible safe third country agreement, the use of detention in the United States was the subject of debate and study (see, e.g., UNHCR, UNHCR Comments on the Draft Agreement between Canada and the United States of America for Cooperation in the Examination of Refugee Status Claims from Nationals of Third Countries, July 26, 2002 (online), at p. 3). Similarly, the one-year bar and the treatment of gender-based claims were each focal points during the adoption of the agreement (see, e.g., p. 2; Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR/2004-217, Canada Gazette, Part II, vol. 138, No. 22, November 3, 2004, at p. 1627). Further, Canada ought to have known that returnees were at risk of being subjected to the widespread practice of medical isolation. These infringements of liberty and security of the person are causally connected to Canadian state action and must be assessed in relation to the principles of fundamental justice.\nPrinciples of Fundamental Justice Analysis\nThe Applicable Principles\nHere, the applicable principles of fundamental justice are overbreadth and gross disproportionality. These principles were applied at first instance and are invoked by the appellants before this Court. By contrast, the respondents argue that the shocks the conscience standard applies to the constitutional review of the effects of removal to foreign legal systems and administrations (R.F., at para. 64). They submit that this high threshold is only met in exceptional circumstances, as is proper given the importance of international comity and respect for the sovereignty of foreign states. In my view, the respondents arguments are misplaced. The shocks the conscience standard may well be relevant to the review of individualized decisions, but it is not relevant to Charter challenges to legislation.\nIt is true, as the respondents noted in oral argument, that shocks the conscience was treated as applicable to legislative challenges by some members of this Court in Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779, at pp. 849-50. But Kindler must be read in light of this Courts later, more complete, consideration of shocks the conscience in Burns. It must also be read in the context of this Courts broader assessment of the principles of fundamental justice in Malmo-Levine.\nIn Burns, this Court made plain that the shocks the conscience standard applies to reviewing individual decisions by the Minister and should not be allowed to obscure the ultimate assessment that is required, which is whether those decisions are in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (para. 68). Following Burns, this Court has used shocks the conscience when assessing requests for individualized Charter relief from the Ministers decisions on extradition or deportation rather than, as here, to evaluate the constitutionality of a legislative regime (see, e.g., Lake v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2008 SCC 23, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 761, at paras. 38-39; Canada (Attorney General) v. Barnaby, 2015 SCC 31, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 563, at para. 11). Academic commentators have also concluded that the shocks the conscience standard speaks to how a discretionary decision by a state official can be challenged under the Charter even though the statute under which the decision was made is not itself challenged (see, e.g., Stewart (2019), at pp. 130-31). Indeed, in Malmo-Levine, this Court explicitly concluded that a broad balancing exercise  of the kind that shocks the conscience describes  is not an applicable principle of fundamental justice for challenges to legislation (paras. 94-99). It is true that in some contexts, the language of shocks the conscience has been used to inform the gross disproportionality standard (see, e.g., in relation to s. 12, R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, at paras. 109-10, 145 and 163, per Martin J., and at paras. 182-83, per Cote J., dissenting, but not on this point). As a practical matter, a provision held to be grossly disproportionate to its purpose might well shock the conscience if it were pressed into service. But this convergence does not displace the principles of fundamental justice that apply in challenges to legislation. \nBecause the appellants target legislative provisions, the shocks the conscience standard is not the appropriate measure in this case. This is not to say, however, that whether governmental conduct shocks the conscience is not relevant to challenging the implementation of the Safe Third Country Agreement. Administrative decisions made under legislative schemes must, like the schemes themselves, respect the guarantees in the Charter. It therefore remains open to refugee claimants arriving from the United States to advance constitutional challenges against determinations that their claims are ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division or against decisions that exceptional relief is unavailable. As this Court has recognized, it is possible to consider challenges to both legislation and administrative conduct within the same proceeding (see, e.g., PHS, at paras. 74-77; Kindler, at p. 840, per McLachlin J.). \nIf claimants in future cases challenge administrative conduct, courts may conclude that returning them would shock the conscience of Canadians (see Burns, at para. 69). In this way, vulnerable claimants whom Canada improperly seeks to return can be protected. However, at oral argument, the appellants expressly disclaimed any intention to challenge the constitutionality of administrative decisions to deny them exemptions.\nNone of the foregoing implies that the respondents concern for international comity and foreign states sovereignty is unwarranted. In my view, however, these concerns can be accommodated under the principles of overbreadth and gross disproportionality. To begin with, the Suresh and Bedford causation analysis ensures that Canadian courts only assess effects brought about by foreign actors if those effects are causally connected to Canadian state action.\nFurther, the Bedford principles of fundamental justice provide space to consider comity and foreign sovereignty. This is because arbitrariness, overbreadth and gross disproportionality are principles of instrumental rationality or of means-ends assessment, which can only be examined in light of the impugned laws purpose (paras. 107-9; Stewart (2019), at pp. 150-51; P. W. Hogg, The Brilliant Career of Section 7 of the Charter (2012), 58 S.C.L.R. (2d) 195, at p. 209). The proper articulation of the purpose of a scheme with foreign elements must be sensitive to the international context, in which there will rarely, if ever, be exact correspondence between foreign and Canadian regimes. Courts should thus hesitate to conclude that such legislation is predicated on the laws of the foreign state precisely mirroring those of Canada. In these circumstances, I emphasize that courts must take due care in defining the purpose of Canadian legislation.\nFinally, this Court has left open the possibility that a s. 7 breach might be justified under s. 1 in appropriate circumstances (Malmo-Levine, at paras. 96-98; Bedford, at para. 129). This Court has also emphasized that the s. 1 analysis must be approached with sensitivity to the factual and social context of each case (see, e.g., RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 63, per La Forest J., dissenting, but not on this point, and at paras. 132-34, per McLachlin J.). At the s. 1 stage, a contextual approach would likely consider international comity and the sovereignty of foreign states. \nThe Scheme Is Not Overbroad or Grossly Disproportionate\nThe respondents do not mention Bedford in their factum. Although their position is that the Bedford principles of fundamental justice do not apply to this appeal, their failure to address Bedford was unhelpful. The appellants case focused on overbreadth and gross disproportionality at each stage of the proceedings. The Federal Court applied these principles and the Court of Appeal commented on them. It would therefore have been useful to this Court for the respondents to provide explanations, or alternative arguments, about these principles. \nHere, the Bedford principles apply. When assessing whether legislation violates these principles, courts consider whether the laws purpose, taken at face value, is connected to its effects and whether the negative effect is grossly disproportionate to the laws purpose (para. 125). This requires courts to identify the legislative purpose and then to assess if, in light of that purpose, the legislation breached any applicable principle of fundamental justice.\nLegislative Purpose\nThe courts below relied on the purpose of the legislative scheme articulated in CCR (2008), at para. 75: . . . the sharing of responsibility for the consideration of refugee claims with countries that are signatory to and comply with the relevant articles of [the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture] and have an acceptable human rights record (Federal Court reasons, at paras. 119-22; C.A. reasons, at para. 164). The appellants advance a broader view of the place of international law in the schemes purpose, saying that it is designed to share responsibility for the protection of refugees in accordance with Canadas international obligations (A.F., at para. 56 (emphasis deleted)). Conversely, the respondents would have this Court adopt a purpose that does not make international obligations explicit: . . . to share responsibility for providing protection to those in need and to improve the efficiency of the refugee determination system (R.F., at para. 26). I would not adopt any of these statements. In my view, the purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR is to share responsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement.\nIn R. v. Ndhlovu, 2022 SCC 38, this Court reiterated several principles guiding the characterization of legislative purpose within a s. 7 analysis. It noted, for instance, that the focus is the purpose of the impugned provisions, although the broader legislative scheme may provide clues as to the narrower provisions purpose (para. 61, per Karakatsanis and Martin JJ., and para. 153, per Brown J., dissenting in part, but not on this point). Courts may consider statements of purpose in the legislation, if any; the text, context, and scheme of the legislation; and extrinsic evidence (para. 64; see also R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at para. 33). \nPurpose statements are [t]he first, most direct and authoritative evidence of the legislative purpose (Appulonappa, at para. 49, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (6th ed. 2014), at pp. 274-76). Here, while the specific sections containing the impugned provisions do not provide formal purpose statements, s. 3(2) of the IRPA articulates the Acts overall objectives with respect to refugees:\n(2) The objectives of this Act with respect to refugees are\n\n(a) to recognize that the refugee program is in the first instance about saving lives and offering protection to the displaced and persecuted;\n\n(b) to fulfil Canadas international legal obligations with respect to refugees and affirm Canadas commitment to international efforts to provide assistance to those in need of resettlement;\n\n(c) to grant, as a fundamental expression of Canadas humanitarian ideals, fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution;\n\n(d) to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment;\n\n(e) to establish fair and efficient procedures that will maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system, while upholding Canadas respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings; \nThese objectives supply three key considerations relevant to assessing the purpose of the provisions at issue here: respecting Canadas international obligations (s. 3(2)(b) and (d)), ensuring fair process and consideration for claimants (s. 3(2)(b), (c) and (e)), and upholding the efficiency and sustainability of the Canadian refugee protection system (s. 3(2)(e)). Further, s. 102(1) of the IRPA also speaks to legislative objective in this instance insofar as it permits the designation of countries for the purpose of sharing responsibility with governments of foreign states for the consideration of refugee claims.\nWith respect to the text and context of the legislative scheme, the provision directly challenged is s. 159.3 of the IRPR. This provision designates the United States pursuant to s. 102(1)(a) of the IRPA. In my view, the purpose of a provision designating a specific country can only be understood in light of s. 102(2), as the Federal Court of Appeal recognized in CCR (2008). Considering the factors set out in s. 102(2) is a condition precedent to designating a country. These factors, identified by Parliament, necessarily partake of the purpose for which a designation is made. They include the countrys policies and practices with respect to claims under the Refugee Convention and with respect to obligations under the Convention Against Torture (s. 102(2)(b)). The human rights record of a country is another (s. 102(2)(c)). \nThe authority to designate a country flows from s. 102(1)(a), which focuses on whether the designated country complies with the non-refoulement principle, as embodied in Article 33 of the Refugee Convention and Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture. The non-refoulement principle, which scholars have also described as the [translation] cornerstone of refugee law (see, e.g., F. Crepeau, Droit dasile: De lhospitalite aux controles migratoires (1995), at p. 166), is thus of central importance to the schemes purpose. Indeed, even scholars who are critical of the agreement have recognized that it evinces a joint commitment to ensuring access to a refugee protection procedure in either Canada or the United States in order to respect the non-refoulement principle (Macklin (2005), at p. 381; Mayrand and Smith-Gregoire, at p. 337).\nThe various factors in s. 102(2) of the IRPA clearly relate to the non-refoulement principle. But they also go beyond it. By referencing policies and practices related to the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture as a whole (s. 102(2)(b)), the legislation directs the Governor in Council to consider a broad range of guarantees designed to ensure that refugee claimants receive fair treatment in host countries. The requirement in s. 102(2)(c) to consider a countrys human rights record is to similar effect, as it helps assess whether refugees will receive fair treatment beyond the floor established by the non-refoulement principle. These requirements do not suggest that designated countries must have identical policies or human rights records to Canada, so long as the designated countries respect certain minimum requirements. In that sense, the s. 102(2) factors leave space for permissible differences in countries domestic regimes, which reflects Parliaments respect for international comity, within the bounds of the Constitution. \nThe broader statutory scheme that structures the legal effects flowing from designating a country is also illuminating, in that it shows that sharing responsibility with a designated country is a core objective. In particular, s. 101(1)(e) of the IRPA renders individuals arriving from designated countries ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division. Access to other procedures in Canada is also restricted (see, e.g., IRPA, s. 112(2)(b)). The message is clear: designation ensures that claims will be considered in the designated country, rather than in Canada.\nFinally, three sources of extrinsic evidence assist in ascertaining the purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR. First, the preamble to the Safe Third Country Agreement provides useful indicators of Parliaments and the Governor in Councils objectives in enacting the legislation that gives domestic effect to the treaty. As discussed, the preamble acknowledges the non-refoulement obligations that bind both countries (para. 2). It states that the governments were aware of the necessity to avoid indirect breaches of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement . . . [through] access to a full and fair refugee status determination procedure (para. 8). Thus, the preamble to the Safe Third Country Agreement confirms that the non-refoulement principle is at the core of the scheme, along with a broader emphasis on the fair adjudication of refugee claims. It was in light of these mutually held commitments that the sharing of responsibility was proposed.\nSecond, the accompanying Statement of Principles agreed to by Canada and the United States reflects a shared commitment to ensuring that refugee claimants subject to the scheme are treated fairly. For instance, it affords claimants an opportunity for a chosen person to be present during proceedings. \nThird, the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement for s. 159.3 of the IRPR stated that the purpose of the provisions is to render paragraph 101(1)(e) of the [IRPA] effective by designating the United States in order to proceed with sharing responsibility [for] refugee protection while also respecting Canadas commitment to its international obligations toward refugees, which reflects our humanitarian tradition and core values of compassion and fairness (pp. 1622-23). \nTaken together, the statement of objectives of the IRPA, the text, context, and scheme of the legislation, and the extrinsic evidence suggest that the purpose of the legislation has three essential elements: (1) to share responsibility for considering refugee claims; (2) to respect the non-refoulement principle; and (3) to return refugee claimants only to countries that will fairly consider their claims. Given these elements, the legislative purpose of s. 159.3 of the IRPR is to share responsibility for fairly considering refugee claims with the United States, in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement. This purpose reflects a primary goal (sharing responsibility), which is subject to two limits (the non-refoulement principle and the requirement for fair consideration). Notably, these two limits do not disclose an expectation that the American asylum claim system mirror the Canadian system in every respect. It is in light of this purpose that the relevant s. 7 deprivations  the risk of discretionary detention and medical isolation, along with the presumed risks of refoulement  must be assessed for overbreadth and gross disproportionality. \nRisks of Detention and Medical Isolation\nThe appellants argue that the risks of detention and medical isolation are both overbroad and grossly disproportionate. I am not persuaded that either principle of fundamental justice is breached in the circumstances of this case.\nWith respect to overbreadth, the question is whether the impugned legislation is so broad in scope that it includes some conduct that bears no relation to its purpose (Bedford, at para. 112 (emphasis deleted)). As this Court has affirmed, a law is overbroad if it overreaches in a single case (paras. 113 and 123; Ndhlovu, at para. 78). This analysis is focused not on whether Parliament has chosen the least restrictive means, but whether the chosen means infringe life, liberty or security of the person in a way that has no connection with the mischief contemplated by the legislature (Carter, at para. 85). \nIn my view, the risk of detention in the United States, with opportunities for release and review, is related to the legislative objective. Sharing responsibility for refugee claims with another state will necessarily expose returnees to the foreign legal regime that governs refugee claimants presence in that country. Exposure to foreign legal systems  including their detention practices  necessarily results from achieving the schemes purpose. Of course, the legislations responsibility-sharing objective is qualified by the requirement that refugee claimants are to be given fair consideration in the designated country. But whether this requirement is respected does not turn on the extent to which the American asylum system mirrors Canadas system. A degree of difference as between the legal schemes applicable in the two countries can be tolerated, so long as the American system is not fundamentally unfair. Thus, for the appellants to show that the scheme overreaches this limit  such that there is no connection at all between the effects of the scheme and the legislative objective, which includes the aim of only returning refugee claimants to countries that will fairly consider their claims (see Carter, at para. 85)  the question is whether the American system is fundamentally unfair. In my view, the record does not support the conclusion that the American detention regime is fundamentally unfair.\nInternational legal instruments provide indicia of what it means to treat refugee claimants fairly. For instance, the UNHCRs Detention Guidelines recognize that detention of refugee claimants is neither prohibited under international law per se, nor is the right to liberty of person absolute (Guidelines on the Applicable Criteria and Standards relating to the Detention of Asylum-Seekers and Alternatives to Detention (2012), Guideline 4, at para. 18). The Detention Guidelines require safeguards in relation to the use of detention. The particular form of these safeguards is a matter of state practice. Here, the appellants did not discharge their burden to show that safeguards are absent in the American asylum system. While the record shows that returnees face a risk of detention in the United States, it also discloses mechanisms that create opportunities for release and provide for review by administrative decision makers and courts. There is no basis to infer that these arrangements are fundamentally unfair. Thus, the risk of detention that returnees face is not overbroad.\nSimilarly, the use of medical isolation is not fundamentally unfair. Nothing in the record suggests that isolating those awaiting tuberculosis test results is unnecessary to control public health risks in detention facilities. Indeed, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules), U.N. Doc. A/RES/70/175, December 17, 2015, require that where individuals in detention facilities are suspected of having contagious diseases, measures are taken providing for the clinical isolation and adequate treatment of those prisoners during the infectious period (Rule 30(d)). Of course, the Mandela Rules also restrict the use of isolation or segregation (see, e.g., Rules 37(d), 43(1), 44 and 45). But the appellants do not point to evidence that would sustain an inference that medical isolation is being used improperly in the American immigration detention system.\nIt is true that the record includes the affidavits of two lawyers from American advocacy organizations outlining their belief that isolation may be used more broadly. For instance, the lawyers suggested solitary confinement may be used to deal with claimants facing mental health challenges (Affidavit of Ruby Robinson, at para. 18, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXXIII, at pp. 13884-85) or as a punitive mechanism (Affidavit of Timothy Warden-Hertz at para. 8, reproduced in A.R., vol. XXXIII, at pp. 13807-8). However, there are no findings below on these specific matters. The Federal Court judge did not find that the American immigration detention system imposes isolation on individuals with mental health challenges or that isolation is used punitively.\nThis Court is appropriately reluctant to assume the mantle of a finder of fact (Hollis v. Dow Corning Corp., [1995] 4 S.C.R. 634, at para. 33, per La Forest J., and at para. 89, per Sopinka J., dissenting, but not on this point). Here, given the limitations of the evidentiary record, it would be imprudent for this Court to make factual determinations about how the United States uses solitary confinement in immigration detention. There is therefore no basis to conclude that American practices are fundamentally unfair. As a result, I am not satisfied that the risk of medical isolation for individuals returned to the United States is an overbroad effect of the Canadian legislation.\nWith respect to gross disproportionality, the question is whether the impugned legislations effects on the s. 7 interests are so grossly disproportionate to its purposes that they cannot rationally be supported (Bedford, at para. 120). This threshold is only met in extreme cases where the seriousness of the deprivation is totally out of sync with the objective and is entirely outside the norms accepted in our free and democratic society (ibid.). Neither a risk of detention with opportunities for release and review nor a risk of medical isolation meets this high threshold. In Canada, as in the United States, these risks are within the mutually held norms accepted by our free and democratic societies. The appellants have not shown otherwise.\nRisks of Refoulement Due to American Asylum Policies\nSubjecting returnees to real and not speculative risks of refoulement would bear no relation to the purpose of the impugned legislation, which has respect for the non-refoulement principle at its core. A provision mandating return to a risk of refoulement would therefore be overbroad. Similarly, a provision mandating return to a risk of refoulement would be grossly disproportionate because doing so would, by definition, expose individuals to risks to their life or freedom (Refugee Convention, Article 33), torture (Convention Against Torture, Article 3) or other fundamental human rights violations. Scholars have criticized these sorts of mandatory regimes, which require countries to assume the partner states ability and willingness to protect refugees (see, e.g., Hathaway, at p. 330). However, the impugned legislation in this case does not simply mandate return: there are also related curative provisions that must be factored into the analysis. These provisions include administrative deferrals of removal (IRPA, s. 48(2)), temporary resident permits (s. 24), humanitarian and compassionate exemptions (s. 25.1(1)) and public policy exemptions (s. 25.2(1)). I note that while the Federal Court judge did not consider the full range of relevant curative measures, she properly recognized  in her s. 7 analysis under the headings of Overbroad and Grossly Disproportionate in her reasons  that safety valves are germane to the assessment of the Bedford principles of fundamental justice. \nAs this Court held in PHS, when the impugned legislative scheme contains safety valves, the question is whether these mechanisms  properly interpreted and applied  are sufficient to ensure that no deprivations contrary to the principles of fundamental justice occur (para. 113; see also Moore, at pp. 150-51). Plainly, if no such deprivations materialize, then there is no breach of s. 7. This observation is what, in my view, explains McLachlin C.J.s statement in PHS that if one were to set out to draft a law that combats drug abuse while respecting Charter rights, one might well adopt . . . a prohibition combined with the power to grant exemptions (para. 114).\nThe IRPAs curative provisions are, in many key respects, analogous to the safety valve in the CDSA upon which the Court relied in PHS. For example, s. 25.1 of the IRPA is structurally similar to what was then s. 56 of the CDSA. Both mechanisms contemplate the exercise of ministerial discretion to grant relief from rules that would otherwise apply. Moreover, they both grant a broad discretionary authority, as they permit exemptions from any of the Acts provisions (in the case of the CDSA) or any of the Acts applicable criteria or obligations (in the case of the IRPA). Exemptions on public policy grounds (IRPA, s. 25.2) play a comparable role. Further, administrative deferrals of removal (s. 48(2)) and temporary resident permits (s. 24) also create avenues for discretionary relief, by front-line decision makers rather than the Minister. \nWhen the IRPAs safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted from return. If they are not returned to the United States, they do not face any risk of refoulement from the United States. The safety valves can therefore intervene to cure what might otherwise be unconstitutional effects, as was the case in PHS. Moreover, as in PHS, they are properly considered as part of the principles of fundamental justice stage of s. 7 because the mechanisms can be exercised in order to address the specific deprivation at issue, in this case the risk of refoulement. \nThe appellants argue that overbroad and grossly disproportionate effects cannot be cured by these mechanisms in the IRPA (A.F., at para. 67). They say the safety valves are irrelevant because they are not among the legislative and regulatory provisions implementing the [Safe Third Country Agreement] ineligibility (para. 69). I disagree. This is not a case where the schemes safety valves are so disconnected from the deprivation that they are irrelevant for determining whether the challenged provision violates s. 7 of the Charter. Properly interpreted, the curative mechanisms in the broader statutory scheme are sufficient to ensure that individuals are not subjected to real and not speculative risks of refoulement, if such risks do exist. These mechanisms must be understood in light of the discretion that Article 6 of the Safe Third Country Agreement preserves for Canada to consider claims when it is in its public interest to do so. \nIn Article 6, the parties agreed that each of them could examine any refugee status claim when it was in their public interest to do so. The United States has implemented this provision in a manner that leaves room for discretion and consideration of various humanitarian factors (see, e.g., UNHCR, Monitoring Report: Canada-United States Safe Third Country Agreement (2006), at pp. 63-65). Nothing in the agreement prevented Canada from leaving in place mechanisms that permit a similar approach. \nThe mere fact that these mechanisms predate the treaty does not make them irrelevant. Indeed, scholars have observed that [t]he great majority of treaties concluded by Canada are in the nature of state-to-state agreements that do not require amendment of the internal laws of either party (van Ert, at p. 233). When the agreement was signed, Canadian domestic law already included provisions that could facilitate individualized consideration of claimants circumstances when it is in Canadas public interest to do so. New legislation implementing additional mechanisms was not necessary. Likewise, it is of no consequence that these provisions are found in other, generally applicable parts of the IRPA. As I have said, Charter analyses must consider all relevant provisions in an interrelated legislative scheme.\nThe related provisions in the IRPA and IRPR provide various avenues for refugee claimants to be exempted from return on a temporary or permanent basis. For instance, an officer who is persuaded during an initial interview that a real and not speculative risk of refoulement exists could refer the case to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for further consideration. That department could then determine whether to recommend that the Minister grant a humanitarian and compassionate exemption under s. 25.1 of the IRPA, including waiving the s. 101(1)(e) ineligibility. Alternatively, the Minister might decide that grounds for granting a temporary resident permit exist, thus providing time for determining whether permanent resident status should be granted on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. These avenues are, of course, not exhaustive. But they suggest that the statutory scheme can limit the risk of harm that the general rule might otherwise occasion.\nIt is true that Canada has only ever expressly relied on Article 6 to create categorical exceptions (Canada, A Partnership for Protection: Year One Review (2006), at p. 37). Nevertheless, Canada has long been aware that Article 6 may permit it to consider the claims of individuals who would not normally be eligible under an exception but who nevertheless warrant special consideration because of their vulnerability (UNHCR, Monitoring Report, at p. 36; see also A Partnership for Protection, at pp. 35-37). I share this reading of Article 6, which must inform the interpretation of the existing exemption mechanisms. \nThe appellants argue in their factum that the Federal Court judge found these mechanisms to be illusory and largely out of reach (A.F., at para. 68). The respondents, by contrast, say these mechanisms exist in law and the Court of Appeal found that they were available in practice, as the record reflects (R.F., at para. 91). In my view, neither position can be accepted outright.\nIt is clear that an exemption would be merely illusory  and thus incapable of curing constitutional defects  if there were no possibility of accessing it in law. For example, if there is no legal pathway to obtain a statutory exemption, then it is illusory (see Parker, at para. 174). It is also insufficient for curative mechanisms to be available in law but unavailable in practice. Empty promises do not safeguard against breaches of constitutionally protected rights. For instance, this Court has recognized that a statute permitting exemptions may nonetheless create barriers to accessing them (see, e.g., R. v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30, at pp. 60-62, per Dickson C.J., and at pp. 91-100, per Beetz J.). It is open to challengers to argue that legislation unjustifiably breaches s. 7 because the exemption mechanism itself produces difficulties for individuals seeking access to it (Morgentaler, at pp. 73-76, per Dickson C.J., and at pp. 122-28, per Beetz J.). This Court has, however, emphasized that the legislation must be the cause of the alleged difficulties in order for Charter scrutiny to attach to it (see Little Sisters, at para. 128). \nIt may not always be obvious whether the source of an alleged breach is the legislation or the administrative conduct implementing it (see, e.g., A. M. Latimer and B. L. Berger, A Plumber with Words: Seeking Constitutional Responsibility and an End to the Little Sisters Problem (2022), 104 S.C.L.R. (2d) 143, at pp. 145-46). In applying Morgentaler and Little Sisters, it is appropriate to look to the broader jurisprudence on the assessment of causation in s. 7 challenges. As is true at every stage of proving a s. 7 violation, challengers bear the evidentiary burden to establish that the legislation causes difficulties for individuals seeking access to curative mechanisms (Bedford, at para. 78). They must therefore show that the legislation causes the exemption to be illusory in their individual circumstances. Challengers need not show that the legislation causes exemptions to be illusory in general, as the s. 7 analysis is not focused on the percentage of the population that is negatively impacted (para. 123). When courts conclude that the legislation causes the alleged difficulties, they should explain how this burden is met for each of the relevant curative mechanisms. \nIt is true that the Federal Court judge wrote that safeguards . . . are largely out of reach and are therefore illusory (para. 130). Nevertheless, as the appellants themselves acknowledged in oral argument before this Court, when that statement is read in context, the Federal Court judges immediate focus was on the practical availability of judicial review proceedings. As discussed above, the availability of judicial review is distinct from whether there are statutory safeguards that may function as curative mechanisms or safety valves. The Federal Court judges reasons in this case do not point to a considered finding that all the relevant curative mechanisms are illusory for any individual. Indeed, she did not assess the relevant curative mechanisms in any substantive way. In my respectful view, this was an error of law reflecting a failure to consider how the relevant legislative provisions might apply to the question at hand  although the Federal Court judge can hardly be blamed for it, as the parties arguments before her do not appear to have squarely addressed how these mechanisms might, properly interpreted, be relevant.\nHad the full range of relevant curative measures been considered, the Federal Court judge would have recognized that there is insufficient evidence in the record regarding their practical operation. For example, the appellants have identified no evidence that could support a finding that an individual returnee would not have access to these mechanisms. Instead, the record shows that administrative deferrals of removal, temporary resident permits, and humanitarian and compassionate consideration are available. I note, in particular, the circumstances of Ms. Al Nahasss family, who did receive temporary resident permits and permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Thus, the record in this case cannot sustain the conclusion that the applicable curative mechanisms are illusory. In any event, the Federal Court judges error of law means that her comment does not bind this Court.\nThe public interest authority preserved in Article 6 may be exercised on an individualized basis through the IRPAs curative mechanisms. Absent a finding that these mechanisms are illusory or otherwise inadequate to respond to the potential harms, realizing the Article 6 discretion in this manner poses no constitutional defect. It is, of course, also open to the Governor in Council to make regulations respecting the criteria for the application of s. 101(1)(e) ineligibility in order to clarify when the general principle of return should not apply (IRPA, s. 102(1)(c)). The Governor in Council has done so in s. 159.6 of the IRPR, which exempts individuals subject to the death penalty from return. This exception responds to a marked difference between American and Canadian law. It is thus one example of how sharing responsibility need not require that the two countries agree in every respect. Indeed, Article 6 reflects an acceptance that each party to the treaty will abide by its own distinctive view of when considering a refugee claim is in its public interest. Further, regulations under s. 102(1)(c) are not the only avenue for specifying circumstances that warrant an Article 6 exception. The Minister may also set out classes for whom public policy dictates that an exception should be established (IRPA, s. 25.2). Using the authority under s. 102(1)(c) or 25.2 to clarify the relevant exceptional circumstances may make the process more efficient and predictable.\nIn sum, even assuming that claimants face real and not speculative risks of refoulement from the United States, the Canadian legislative scheme provides safety valves that guard against such risks. For that reason, the legislative scheme implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement is not overbroad or grossly disproportionate and therefore accords with the principles of fundamental justice. In light of this conclusion, as well as my conclusions on deprivations related to detention, no breach of s. 7 of the Charter has been established. \nI recall that the challenge here was advanced against legislation, not administrative conduct. It may be that administrative actors, such as CBSA officers, acted unreasonably or unconstitutionally in their treatment of some returnees or in their interpretation of the legislative scheme, including its safety valves. As noted above, when administrative action or inaction is the cause of the alleged harms, then that conduct is properly the subject of Charter scrutiny, not the legislation itself. But these are not issues before this Court on appeal. If administrative malfeasance results in returning individuals to circumstances that would shock the conscience of Canadians, such as returning individuals to face a real and not speculative risk of refoulement, constitutional and administrative remedies remain available. Without saying more, I observe that administrative decisions in this area call for the most anxious scrutiny (R. (Yogathas) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, [2002] UKHL 36, [2003] 1 A.C. 920, at paras. 9, 58 and 74, quoting R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p. Bugdaycay, [1987] A.C. 514 (H.L.), at p. 531).\nSection 1\nGiven that the legislative scheme does not violate s. 7, it is not necessary to undertake a s. 1 analysis. However, for the sake of completeness, I provide some brief comments on s. 1 justification for circumstances in which it would be required. In doing so, I highlight the distinct relevance of safety valves in a s. 1 analysis where the burden of justification is on the state.\nThe appellants argue that while legislative safety valves did not ensure that the legislation accords with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7, such avenues for discretionary relief may remain relevant in addressing s. 1. However, they submit that the respondents did not file any evidence in support of a s. 1 justification, and they rely on the Federal Court judges statement that safeguards are illusory. \nThe respondents argue that had a s. 7 breach been made out, it would be justified under s. 1, in part because of related provisions in the legislative scheme. They say that the whole of the law serves to advance the pressing and substantial objective of sharing responsibility for refugee status determinations with the United States. Further, they submit that the scheme is minimally impairing of claimants s. 7 rights and point to the continuous monitoring of the regime under s. 102(3) of the IRPA and to the IRPAs safety valves.\nBoth parties rightly acknowledge that safety valves are relevant at the s. 1 stage, as this Court accepted in Carter (paras. 114-21). However, the role these mechanisms play at the s. 1 stage differs from their role at the s. 7 stage as does, of course, the burden that the state bears. This is because s. 7 and s. 1 ask different questions insofar as justification on the basis of an overarching public goal is at the heart of s. 1, but it plays no part in the s. 7 analysis, which is concerned with the narrower question of whether the impugned law infringes individual rights (Bedford, at para. 125). Given this distinction, a different set of considerations comes into play under section 1: not just the effect of the law on (at least) one persons section 7 interests, but the effect of the section 7 violation in achieving the laws policy objectives (H. Stewart, Bedford and the Structure of Section 7 (2015), 60 McGill L.J. 575, at p. 589). When safety valves are at issue, the considerations in play under s. 7 and s. 1 remain distinct. \nWhile discretionary exemption mechanisms are relevant to determining whether impugned legislation breaches individual rights protected by s. 7, they may not be adequate to ensure that no deprivations contrary to the principles of fundamental justice occur. In other words, they may not succeed in curing all deprivations of individuals s. 7 interests. For instance, the scope of a safety valve may simply not be wide enough to exempt all individuals inappropriately caught by the general rule. \nAs is the case throughout the s. 7 analysis, claimants bear the burden to show that legislative safety valves do not remedy individual deprivations. To do so, they may, for example, advance arguments and lead evidence demonstrating that a legislative regime itself causes a statutes curative mechanisms to be practically unavailable. However, at the s. 1 stage, the government bears the burden to show that the safety valves  as a whole  are sufficient to justify any established s. 7 breaches under the test from R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103. This Court has left open the possibility that the government could establish that a s. 7 violation is justified (Bedford, at para. 129).\nAt the s. 1 stage, the government may argue  as Canada did here  that a schemes safety valves, if they proved to be imperfect under s. 7, nonetheless render the legislation minimally impairing. Further, the government might seek to rely on safety valves in the final balancing stage of Oakes. Nonetheless, given that a s. 7 violation was not established in this case, it is unnecessary to comment on what the outcome of any part of the s. 1 analysis might have been here. \nThe Section 15 Claim \nThe Parties Positions on the Section 15 Challenge\nIn their factum, the appellants asked this Court to remit the matter to the Federal Court. They acknowledge that, in declining to decide their claim under s. 15 of the Charter, the Federal Court judge made no findings of fact on which a gender-based discrimination argument might rest. In oral argument, counsel for the appellants advanced the alternative argument that it is open to this Court to make the necessary factual findings to decide the s. 15 issue and noted that the matter was pleaded before the courts below.\nThe basis of the appellants s. 15 claim in the Federal Court was that women fearing gender-based persecution are adversely affected by s. 159.3 of the IRPR. The appellants submitted, for instance, that the American interpretation of particular social group  one of the classes of individuals protected from refoulement under Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention  is overly restrictive with respect to women. \nThe respondents argue that there is no need to remit the matter because the appellants gender-based concerns are properly addressed within the s. 7 analysis. In the respondents submission, what primarily drove the s. 15 claim was the decision in Matter of A-B-, 27 I. & N. Dec. 316 (A.G. 2018), which was vacated in 2021. They submit that the American system recognizes gender-related harms as a basis for asylum claims and that, on a fair reading of the record, there is no evidence of a s. 15 breach. \nThe Section 15 Challenge Should Be Remitted to the Federal Court\nThe Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, empowers this Court to remand any appeal or part thereof to the court appealed from or the court of original jurisdiction (s. 46.1). This discretion is to be exercised in the interests of justice (Wells v. Newfoundland, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 68; Saadati v. Moorhead, 2017 SCC 28, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 543, at para. 45; R. v. Esseghaier, 2021 SCC 9, at para. 63). Here, remitting the s. 15 challenge is just in the circumstances.\nA court of first instance would have, as a part of its fact-finding mandate, an institutional advantage in making the determinations necessary to a fair treatment of the s. 15 claim. The evidentiary record is voluminous, and while this Court is entitled to make factual findings based upon it, much of the expert affidavit evidence regarding the s. 15 allegations conflicts. For example, the Court would have to evaluate competing expert opinions on a line of cases dealing with the American approach to defining a particular social group (see, e.g., Affidavit of Yale-Loehr, at paras. 118-30; Affidavit of Karen Musalo, at paras. 10 et seq., reproduced in A.R., vol. XXI, at pp. 8965 et seq.). To decide the gender-based claim on the merits, this Court would have to assume the mantle of trier of fact and consider potentially conflicting trends in American jurisprudence as an appellate court of final resort. \nAppellate courts may  and occasionally are required to  assume the role of finder of fact where doing so is in the interests of justice and feasible on a practical level (Hollis, at para. 33, per La Forest J.). However, they are generally, and justifiably, wary of doing so (ibid.), given the many advantages first instance courts have in drawing factual inferences. These include their relative expertise with respect to the weighing and assessing of evidence and their inimitable familiarity with the often vast quantities of evidence (Housen, at para. 25). Appellate courts should be especially cautious, for example, when a first instance judge has failed to make essential factual findings and where evidence conflicts or is in dispute (Hollis, at paras. 89 and 93, per Sopinka J., dissenting, but not on this point). \nIn my view, this Court is not well placed to make the factual findings necessary to assess the merits of the s. 15 claim. Given the profound seriousness of the matter, the size and complexity of the record and the conflicting affidavit evidence, it would be neither in the interests of justice nor feasible on a practical level for this Court to take up the task of finder of fact (Hollis, at para. 33). Notably, there would be no possibility of appeal with respect to any factual determinations this Court might make on the disputed, conflicting evidence.\nFurther, it would not be in the interests of justice to dismiss the s. 15 claim for lack of argument. It is true that the appellants did not argue the substance of their s. 15 claim before this Court beyond a brief mention in their factum and a reference in oral argument to their pleadings before the courts below. This Court has sometimes held that the aspects of a claim not argued by an appellant can be considered abandoned and can thus be dismissed (see, e.g., Meyer v. General Exchange Insurance Corp., [1962] S.C.R. 193, at p. 201, per Locke J.). These decisions rightly recognize that appellants are generally expected to provide full arguments for the claims they maintain before this Court. Yet, I sense it would be inappropriate to interpret the appellants lack of argument as an abandonment of serious submissions that the courts below commented on so briefly and did not decide. In the specific circumstances of this appeal, it was not unreasonable for the appellants to limit their pleadings to a request for this Court to remit the s. 15 matter. The alternate argument that the matter be decided here was not a considered position. It would have been unrealistic for the appellants to attempt to fill the factual void left by the courts below while simultaneously advancing novel legal arguments, such as those relating to causation and equality rights in the international context. \nFinally, I note that certain interveners are troubled by what they see as a judicial pattern of neglect with respect to section 15 in challenges based on multiple Charter rights (I.F., David Asper Centre for Constitutional Rights, West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund Association and Womens Legal Education and Action Fund Inc., at para. 13). One can well understand the concern: claims based on s. 15 are not secondary issues only to be reached after all other issues are considered. The Charter should not be treated as if it establishes a hierarchy of rights in which s. 15 occupies a lower tier. \nI would not fault the Federal Court judge here for exercising judicial restraint and not deciding the s. 15 claim. I recognize that the principle of judicial policy underlying such restraint is sound, as [i]t is based on the realization that unnecessary constitutional pronouncements may prejudice future cases, the implications of which have not been foreseen (Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, at para. 9, per Sopinka J.). Even so, these judicial policy considerations are not always determinative. They must be weighed against other factors, such as the possibility of an appeal and fairness to the parties. While the proceeding at first instance remains the main event (Housen, at para. 13, quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 (1985), at pp. 574-75), the possibility that further proceedings might require addressing alternative constitutional grounds should be considered. As in this case, when first instance judges decline to consider further constitutional issues, a false economy may arise if appellate courts have to remit claims.\nIn sum, it is in the interests of justice to send the matter back to the Federal Court for determination, as the Federal Court of Appeal rightly recognized (para. 173). Nothing in these reasons should be taken to decide the factual or legal questions that will be relevant to the s. 15 challenge. \nConclusion\nI would answer the questions posed on appeal as follows. First, s. 159.3 of the IRPR is not ultra vires. Second, s. 159.3 does not breach s. 7 of the Charter. Third, the challenge based on s. 15 of the Charter should be remitted to the Federal Court. \nBecause the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the applications for judicial review in their entirety, certain aspects of its judgment should be set aside. In particular, the Court of Appeal erred in deciding that the challenge to s. 159.3 of the IRPR based on s. 15 of the Charter should be dismissed rather than remitted to the Federal Court. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part. Neither party sought costs. Like the courts below, I would make no order as to costs on the appeal or the application for leave to appeal.\n\tAppeal allowed in part.\n\tSolicitor for the appellants the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the Canadian Council of Churches: Refugee Law Office, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the appellants ABC, DE by her litigation guardian ABC, FG by her litigation guardian ABC, and Nedira Jemal Mustefa: Downtown Legal Services, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the appellants Mohammad Majd Maher Homsi, Hala Maher Homsi, Karam Maher Homsi and Reda Yassin Al Nahass: Jared Will & Associates, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the respondents: Department of Justice  Ontario Regional Office, Toronto; Department of Justice  Quebec Regional Office, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Association quebecoise des avocats et avocates en droit de limmigration: Cliche-Rivard, Avocats et Avocates, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Landings, Toronto; Legal Aid Ontario  Refugee Law Office, Toronto; University of British Columbia Allard School of Law, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers: Silcoff Shacter, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the National Council of Canadian Muslims and the Canadian Muslim Lawyers Association: Mithoowani Waldman Immigration Law, Toronto; National Council of Canadian Muslims, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Canadian Lawyers for International Human Rights and the Canadian Centre for Victims of Torture: Waldman & Associates, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Queens Prison Law Clinic: Alison M.

The STCA designates the US as a \"safe\" country for refugees, making individuals who attempt to claim refugee status in Canada after entering from the US ineligible for consideration and potentially subject to return to the US. The applicants alleged that this agreement violates sections 7 (right to life, liberty, and security of the person) and 15 (equality rights) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge found that the STCA violated section 7 of the Charter due to inadequate safeguards against deprivations of liberty and security. However, on appeal, a majority in the Court of Appeal allowed respondent's appeal on grounds that appellants' challenge targeted legislation rather than administrative conduct. The Supreme Court ultimately disagreed with this approach but found that while engaging section 7 in some respects, it does accord with principles fundamental justice due to exceptions exemptions review obligations within Immigration Refugee Protection Act IRPA regulations.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA legislative scheme implementing an international agreement is not unconstitutional under a national charter if it contains safety valves or curative mechanisms providing adequate exemptions discretion preventing deprivations protected rights freedoms.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority it is held Safe Third Country Agreement along Canadian legislative regime implementing constitutional designation United States safe third country does not infringe right life liberty security person under section seven Charter although allowing appeal part remitting equality rights claim further factual findings Federal Court", "citation": "2023 SCC 17", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court holds the  regulations designating the United States as a safe third country do not  infringe refugee claimants\u2019 rights to liberty and security of the person.</strong> \r\n   In 2002, Canada and the United States concluded a bilateral treaty  known as the \u201c<em>Safe Third Country  Agreement</em>\u201d (STCA). As a general rule under the STCA, refugee claimants must  seek protection in whichever of the two countries they first enter after  leaving their country of origin. This rule is incorporated in section 101(1)(e)  of Canada\u2019s <em>Immigration and Refugee  Protection Act </em>(the Act) and section 159.3 of the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations </em>(the Regulation). While there are some exceptions, someone is ineligible under the Act to  claim refugee status in Canada if they arrive at a land port of entry from a  \u201csafe third country\u201d. This designation is based on criteria including the  country\u2019s compliance with the principle of \u201c<em>non-refoulement</em>\u201d.  The principle \u2013 which is the  cornerstone of the international refugee protection regime \u2013 prohibits  returning a person to a place where they would face torture, cruel or degrading  treatment, or threats to their life or freedom. A \u201csafe third country\u201d is thus  seen as an appropriate partner with which the responsibility for considering  refugee claims can be shared. Section 159.3 of the Regulation designates the  United States as such. The appellants in this case are individual refugee claimants and public  interest litigants advocating on their behalf. The refugee claimants all  arrived in Canada in 2017 from the United States. They feared gender-based  persecution and sexual violence committed by gangs or oppression in their  countries of origin. Because they arrived at land ports of entry from the U.S.,  they were ineligible to claim refugee protection in Canada. The refugee claimants argued the Regulation designating the U.S. as a  safe third country violates the rights guaranteed under section 7 of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> because it  results in Canadian immigration officers returning refugees to the United  States without considering whether that country will respect their rights under  international law, including those relating to <em>non-refoulement </em>and detention. They also allege the Regulation  violates the <em>Charter </em>guarantee of equality under section 15 because women  facing gender-based persecution are often denied refugee status in the United  States and face the risk of <em>refoulement</em>. In 2020, a Federal Court judge found the Regulation violated section 7  of the <em>Charter</em>. Based on her review  of the evidence, the liberty and security of the person were threatened given  therisks of <em>refoulement</em>, detention and the conditions of detention faced by refugee  claimants who were returned to the United States. The Minister of Citizenship  and Immigration and the Minister  of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness appealed. The Federal Court  of Appeal set aside the judgment. In its view, the <em>Charter </em>challenge should not have focused on the Regulation itself.  Rather, it should have targeted Canada\u2019s action or inaction in the continuing review  of the United States\u2019 designation as a \u201csafe third country\u201d. Neither court  ruled on the section 15 claim. The refugee claimants then brought the case to  this Court. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal in part. <strong>Under Canadian law, refugee  claimants may be exempted from return to the United States if their section 7 <em>Charter </em>rights are at risk.</strong>\r\n     Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Kasirer said the Regulation  designating the United States as a safe third country for the purposes of the  STCA does not breach section 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. He agreed with some of the Federal  Court judge\u2019s findings relating to the treatment of refugee claimants in the  United States, namely the risk of detention upon being returned there and some aspects  of detention conditions. He also proceeded on the assumption that a risk of <em>refoulement </em>flowed from some of the  United States\u2019 policies. As such, he concluded the designation of the United  States engages interests of liberty and security of the person set out in section  7. However, the legislative scheme could stand because it contained ways  for Canada to consider refugee status claims when ineligibility under the  scheme would lead to deprivations of liberty or security of the person. These  legislative \u201csafety valves\u201d include for example discretionary exemptions on the  basis of humanitarian and compassionate or public policy grounds. They ensure  compliance with the principles of fundamental justice. As Justice Kasirer put  it, \u201cwhen the [Act]\u2019s safety valves are activated, claimants can be exempted  from return\u201d.\u00a0 He added that it may well be that, in  practice, administrative decision makers do not always construe or deploy the  legislative safety valves appropriately. In such cases, the legislation itself  remains valid, but administrative and <em>Charter </em>relief remains available on an individual basis. Yet this is not what the Court  had been asked to provide here. As a result, Justice Kasirer dismissed the appeal on the section 7  claim and returned the appellants\u2019 section 15 claim to the Federal Court for  determination, given the lack of factual findings on which the Supreme Court could  rely, the complexity of the record and conflicting evidence, and the profound  seriousness of the matter."}, "18": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nDeans Knight Income Corporation\tAppellant\nv.\nHis Majesty The King\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Ontario, \nCanadian Chamber of Commerce,\nTax Executives Institute, Inc., and\nAgence du Revenu du Quebec\tInterveners\nIndexed as: Deans Knight Income Corp. v.

However, s. 111(5) restricts non-capital loss carryovers for a corporation if control of the corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, unless it continues the same or similar business that incurred the losses. Prior to the transactions in issue, Deans Knight Income Corporation (Deans Knight), then operating under the name Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. (Forbes), had approximately $90 million of unused non-capital losses, scientific research and development tax expenditures, and investment tax credits but given that it was in financial difficulty, it did not have income which its past losses could offset. It entered into an investment agreement with a venture capital company, Matco, and a complex arrangement was devised to take advantage of the loss carryover deduction in s. 111(1)(a) without triggering the restriction in s. 111(5). First, Forbes assets and liabilities were moved into a new parent company, Newco. Second, pursuant to the investment agreement, Matco purchased a debenture convertible into some of the voting shares and all of the non-voting shares that Newco held in Forbes. While Newco was not obliged to sell its shares to Matco, it was promised that it would receive at least a guaranteed amount if it sold the shares or if such an opportunity did not present itself. Third, Matco would find a new business venture for Forbes, which would be used to raise money through an initial public offering (IPO). The profits from this venture could be sheltered by the tax attributes Forbes originally could not utilize. Other than when acting pursuant to the investment agreement, Newco and Forbes could not engage in a variety of activities without the consent of Matco. The arrangement went according to plan. Matco found a mutual fund management company, Deans Knight Capital Management, that agreed to use Forbes for an IPO through which it would raise money to invest in high-yield debt instruments. Forbes name was changed to Deans Knight. The IPO and subsequent investment business succeeded. Accordingly, for its 2009 to 2012 tax years, Deans Knight deducted a majority of its non-capital losses to reduce its tax liability. \n\tThe Minister reassessed Deans Knight and denied the deductions. Deans Knight objected to the reassessments and appealed to the Tax Court. Among other arguments, the Minister adopted the position that the general anti-avoidance rule in s. 245 of the Income Tax Act (GAAR) applied to deny the deductions because the transactions constituted abusive tax avoidance. The Tax Court agreed the transactions were tax avoidance transactions that resulted in a tax benefit but held they were not abusive. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the transactions were abusive and the GAAR applied to deny the tax benefits. It set aside the judgment of the Tax Court and dismissed Deans Knights appeal of the reassessments. \n\tHeld (Cote J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Kasirer, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: The transactions were abusive and therefore the GAAR applies to deny the tax benefits. The object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Through a complex series of transactions, Deans Knight underwent a fundamental transformation that achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent, while narrowly circumventing the text of s. 111(5). Without triggering an acquisition of control, Matco gained the power of a majority voting shareholder and fundamentally changed Deans Knights assets, liabilities, shareholders and business. This severed the continuity that is at the heart of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5). The result obtained by the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5) and therefore constituted abuse.\n\tThe GAAR was a choice by Parliament to complement its specific anti-avoidance efforts with the enactment of a general rule. While abusive tax avoidance can involve unforeseen tax strategies, it is more broadly designed to capture situations that undermine the integrity of the tax system by frustrating the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions relied on by the taxpayer. Some uncertainty is unavoidable when a general rule is adopted, but a reasonable degree of certainty is achieved by the balance struck within the GAAR itself. A GAAR analysis involves a structured, three-step test, and asks whether (1) there was a tax benefit; (2) the transaction giving rise to the tax benefit was an avoidance transaction; and (3) the avoidance transaction was abusive. \n\tAnalyzing whether the avoidance transactions are abusive involves determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions, and determining whether the result of the transactions frustrated that object, spirit and purpose. The object, spirit and purpose represents the legislative rationale that underlies specific or interrelated provisions of the Act. It is critical to distinguish the rationale behind a provision from the means chosen to give that rationale effect within the provision. The object, spirit and purpose of a provision must be worded as a description of its rationale. A court is not repeating the test for the provision or crafting a new, secondary test; rather, the object, spirit and purpose is a concise description of the rationale underlying the provision, such as why relief is being provided, the conduct that Parliament sought to encourage, or the result or mischief that Parliament sought to prevent.\n\tThe use of a provisions text, context and purpose to determine the rationale differs from traditional statutory interpretation. Since in a GAAR analysis, the search is for the rationale that underlies the words, considering the provisions text, context and purpose ensures that the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence used to discern that rationale remains tied to the provision itself. Considering a provisions text involves asking how it sheds light on what the provision was designed to achieve, since the language and structure of the provision can be evocative of Parliaments underlying concerns. Courts must also consider the provisions context, with a focus on the relationship between the provision alleged to have been abused and the particular scheme within which it operates. Understanding the provisions purpose is central to the GAAR analysis, and legislative history and extrinsic evidence provide insight into the rationale for specific provisions.\n\tOnce the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis focuses on whether the result of the transactions frustrates the provisions object, spirit and purpose. Avoidance transactions will be abusive where their result: is an outcome that the provisions relied on seek to prevent; defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions; or circumvents provisions in a manner that frustrates their object, spirit and purpose. Courts must go beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions; they must compare the result of the transactions to the underlying rationale of the provision and determine whether that rationale has been frustrated. In coming to such a conclusion, the abusive nature of the transaction must be clear. However, there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met, as with a specific anti-avoidance rule; even specific and carefully drafted provisions are not immune from abuse. \n\tA review of s. 111(5)s text, context and purpose reveals its underlying rationale. With respect to the text of the provision, s. 111(5) is a restriction on a taxpayers ability to make use of its non-capital losses incurred in another taxation year. First, the text of s. 111(5) references control, which has been interpreted as referring to de jure control. The general test for de jure control is whether the controlling party enjoys, by virtue of its shareholdings, the ability to elect the majority of the board of directors. Second, control must be acquired by a person or group of persons. Third, s. 111(5) creates an exception that losses remain deductible if, after an acquisition of control, the corporation engages in the same or a similar business. Thus, the connection to past losses is severed only when control has been acquired and there is a break from the corporations past business. The text of s. 111(5) reflects a concern with denying loss carryovers when there is a lack of continuity within the corporation, as measured by both the identity of its controlling shareholders and its business activity. \n\tA contextual analysis also sheds light on the rationale behind s. 111(5). First, s. 111(5) should be considered against the foundational principles of the Income Tax Act. Under the Act, every person, including a corporation, is a separate taxpayer, and it is a foundational principle that taxpayers are to be taxed on their own earnings. When there has been an acquisition of control and a corporations business ceases to operate, it can no longer be understood as the same taxpayer. Furthermore, s. 111(5) delineates the boundaries of the benefit-conferring provision, s. 111(1)(a). Section 111(1)(a) modifies the general rule that each taxpayer is taxed based on their income and losses within a single taxation year to allow a taxpayer to deduct non-capital losses against income in a future or prior taxation year, but only the taxpayer who suffered the loss is entitled to deduct the loss. Section 111(5) ensures that this principle is given effect for corporations. While a corporation is still the same legal person after an acquisition of control, the identity of those behind the corporation has changed. Section 111(5) functions so that the tax benefits associated with those losses will not benefit a new shareholder base carrying on a new business. This restriction is consistent with other provisions in the Act which also treat a corporation as, effectively, a new taxpayer following an acquisition of control. There are reasons why Parliament chose the de jure control test as the standard to be used on an application of s. 111(5): it is a clearer benchmark than de facto control, meaning greater certainty for the majority of transactions, which are not tax-motivated. However, the provisions rationale is not fully captured by the de jure test; rather, the rationale of s. 111(5) is illuminated by related provisions which both extend and restrict the circumstances in which an acquisition of control has occurred, including by looking beyond the standard documentation under the de jure control test. These provisions suggest that de jure control is not a perfect reflection or complete explanation of the mischief that Parliament sought to address. \n\tIt is also necessary to consider extrinsic evidence of Parliaments purpose. The legislative history behind s. 111(5) illustrates that Parliament was concerned with addressing the trading of loss corporations, which was undermining the tax base and creating inequity among taxpayers. While the means Parliament has chosen to address these concerns have evolved over time, its rationale for including the non-capital loss carryover restriction in the Act has been consistent. When a corporation changes hands, and the loss business ceases to operate, the corporation is effectively a new taxpayer that cannot avail itself of non-capital losses accumulated by the old taxpayer. The business continuity exception was included to encourage the recovery of unprofitable enterprises that require new investment by new owners to strengthen the corporations business. Although the corporation may have changed hands, the link in continuity is preserved through a different marker and the justification for s. 111(1)(a) remains applicable. This reinforces that, at its core, s. 111(5) serves to delineate the circumstances in which the basis for the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) is non-existent.\n\tTaken together, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Parliament sought to ensure that a lack of continuity in a corporations identity was accompanied by a corresponding break in its ability to carry over non-capital losses. This is the rationale underlying the provision and properly explains why Parliament enacted s. 111(5).\n\tAn analysis of the transactions at issue demonstrates that their result served to frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5): they achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent and provided Matco with the benefits of an acquisition of control, all while narrowly circumventing the application of s. 111(5). They resulted in Deans Knights near-total transformation: it became a company with new assets and liabilities, new shareholders and a new business whose only link to its prior corporate life was the tax attributes. It was used as the vessel for an unrelated venture selected by Matco. Matco achieved the functional equivalent of an acquisition of control through the investment agreement, while circumventing s. 111(5), because the transactions dismembered the rights and benefits that would normally flow from being a controlling shareholder. First, it contracted for the ability to select Deans Knights directors. Second, the investment agreement placed severe restrictions on the powers of the board of directors which, but for a circuit-breaker transaction that occurred in this case, would normally occur through a unanimous shareholders agreement and which would lead to an acquisition of de jure control. Third, the transactions allowed Matco to reap significant financial benefits, while depriving Newco, the majority voting shareholder on paper, of each of the core rights that it could ordinarily have exercised. \n\tAny residual freedom that Deans Knight had was illusory and reinforces how the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5). Deans Knights acceptance of the corporate opportunity presented by Matco was a fait accompli because Deans Knight was prohibited from engaging in any activity other than studying and accepting the corporate opportunity, and because the consequences of refusing the opportunity were severe. As for Newcos ability to sell its remaining shares to a party other than Matco or to opt not to sell at all, Deans Knights actions were already locked down by the investment agreement, and the benefits of share ownership were already negated by being subjected to Matcos approval. The ability to receive the guaranteed amount without selling the remaining shares to Matco was important because in certain circumstances, Matcos purchase of the shares might lead to an acquisition of de jure control. The complex series of transactions and the flexibility built into the investment agreement were necessary only because the contracting parties sought to achieve the very mischief that s. 111(5) was intended to prevent. Considering the circumstances as a whole, the result obtained by the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5).\n\tPer Cote J. (dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the Tax Courts judgment restored. The avoidance transactions did not frustrate the rationale of s. 111(5), and therefore, do not amount to abuse. The GAAR requires a careful balance between the interest of the taxpayer in minimizing his or her taxes through technically legitimate means and the legislative interest in ensuring the integrity of the income tax system. Despite Parliaments unambiguous adoption of the de jure control test in s. 111(5) of the Income Tax Act, the majority has opted for an ad hoc approach that expands the concept of control based on a wide array of operational factors. This approach invites the exercise of unbounded judicial discretion and will result in the loss-trading restrictions in s. 111(5) being applied to transactions on a circumstantial basis.\n\tThe majoritys approach to determining the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) fails to account for the central principle that the GAAR does not and cannot override Parliaments specific intent regarding particular provisions of the Act. The GAAR analysis rests on the same interpretive approach employed by the Court in all questions of statutory interpretation, and is little more than a specialized form of statutory interpretation to determine Parliaments intent. It should not be assumed that the GAAR plays a role in every transaction and in every context. There is agreement with the majority that there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti-avoidance rule; however, a provisions text can sometimes be conclusive and fully explain its underlying rationale. The key question is whether Parliament specifically intended to prevent or permit a certain type of transaction. Where an anti-avoidance provision has been carefully crafted to include some situations and exclude others, it is reasonable to infer that Parliament chose to limit its scope accordingly. The GAAR was intended to catch unforeseen tax strategies, but if Parliament drafts a specific anti-avoidance provision in a way that keeps a highly foreseeable gap open, the gap is more likely to be intentional, and relying on it should not be considered abusive.\n\tSection 111(5) is a specific anti-avoidance rule that limits what would otherwise be permissible deductions under s. 111(1)(a), which allows taxpayers to deduct non-capital losses for the purpose of computing taxable income for a taxation year. Upon an acquisition of control, s. 111(5) prevents a corporation from carrying over losses unless the business, carried on by the corporation subject to the change of control, is continued for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit. It bars corporate acquisitions for the singular purpose of accessing tax attributes by restricting the use of those attributes if accessed through the exercise of control. Courts have determined that control for the purposes of the Act means de jure control. De jure control refers to the ownership of a sufficient number of shares to have a majority of votes in the election of the corporations board of directors. A corporations constating documents create de jure control because they restrain the ability of shareholders to exercise their voting power freely. In contrast, external agreements give rise to obligations that are contractual and not legal or constitutional in nature. Consequently, the distinction between de jure and de facto control lies in the breadth of factors that can be considered in determining who has control over the corporation.\n\tThe object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to restrict the use of tax attributes if accessed through an acquisition of de jure control. A textual, contextual and purposive analysis of s. 111(5) of the Act reveals that Parliament never intended courts to consider factors other than those related to share ownership in determining who has control over a corporation. The majority introduces the notion of functional equivalence, which treats the investment agreement as a constating document for the purposes of control. This ignores that constating documents and external agreements are enforced in radically different ways: an ordinary contract can never be functionally equivalent to a constating document. The GAAR cannot be invoked to override Parliaments clear intent, and the majoritys approach departs from Parliaments clear articulation of a de jure control test for restricting losses under s. 111(5). \n\tWhether an avoidance transaction is abusive is a fact-intensive inquiry that raises a question of mixed fact and law. Absent an extricable error of law, the application of the law to the facts is subject to the standard of palpable and overriding error. No such error exists in the instant case. As de jure control is an essential element of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), the key question is whether Matco acquired de jure control of Deans Knight and the relationship between Matco and Deans Knight is the proper focus of the abuse analysis. The Tax Courts decision was based on a combination of findings of fact and an interpretation of the investment agreement that is supported by the evidence. There is no reviewable error in the Tax Courts conclusion that Matco did not acquire effective control of Deans Knight. At no point did Matco own or have a right to own enough shares to reach a majority shareholder position. The investment agreement is of no relevance as to whether Matco acquired de jure control. It did not give Matco control over Newcos sale of the shares remaining after Matco converted the debenture or require that Matco present a sale opportunity for those shares. Parliaments test for control is squarely focused on voting rights arising from ownership. The right to dividends is irrelevant. The only relevant incidence of ownership is voting power, something that the investment agreement did not take away. The Tax Court made a specific credibility finding on the point that Deans Knight remained a free actor throughout the transactions. Mischaracterization of s. 111(5) did not taint this important credibility finding. Matco did not acquire Deans Knight in any practical sense. Matco was only a facilitator of the transactions and did not use Deans Knights non-capital losses for its own benefit. The existence of abusive tax avoidance is, at best, unclear and the benefit of the doubt should go to the taxpayer. \nCases Cited\nBy Rowe J.\n\tDistinguished: Canada v.

However, the Act allows non-capital losses to be carried back 3 years or carried forward 20 years in order to offset income in those years (s. 111(1)(a)). This ability to carry over losses is limited: one such limit is that, if control of the corporation has been acquired, non-capital losses from before the acquisition cannot be carried over, unless the corporation continues the same or similar business that incurred the losses (s. 111(5)). An acquisition of control occurs where a person or group of persons acquires de jure control, which generally involves acquiring sufficient share ownership to elect a majority of the board of directors (Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. v. Canada, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 795). It is also deemed to occur when a taxpayer acquires a right to acquire such shares if the purpose is to avoid the application of the loss carryover restriction (ss. 256(8) and 251(5)(b); see Appendix). \nThe appellant sought to take advantage of the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) without triggering the restriction in s. 111(5). Although the transactions in this appeal will be explained in detail in the following section, a brief summary is warranted. Prior to the transactions at issue, the appellant was a struggling Canadian corporation that had approximately $90 million of unused non-capital losses, scientific research and development tax expenditures (SR&ED expenditures), and investment tax credits (ITCs) (collectively, the Tax Attributes). Given that it was in financial difficulty, it did not have income which its past losses could offset. It sought to monetize their value and entered into an agreement with a venture capital company, Matco Capital Ltd. (Matco), in order to do so. A complex arrangement was devised involving the following key transactions. First, all of the appellants assets and liabilities would be moved into its newly created parent company. Second, Matco would obtain a debenture which could be converted into shares of the appellant, and the appellants parent company was promised that it would receive at least a guaranteed amount for the sale of its remaining shares. Third, Matco would find a new business venture for the appellant, which would be used to raise money through an initial public offering (IPO). The profits from this venture could be sheltered by the Tax Attributes the appellant originally could not utilize. The arrangement went according to plan. For the 2009 to 2012 tax years, the appellant deducted a majority of its Tax Attributes to reduce its tax liability. However, the Minister of National Revenue reassessed and denied these deductions.\nBefore this Court, the parties accept that the appellant complied with the text of the Act. In other words, the parties agree that there was no acquisition of control and that, therefore, the loss carryover restriction in s. 111(5) did not apply. The central issue in this appeal is whether s. 245 of the Act, known as the general anti-avoidance rule or the GAAR, applies to deny the deductions. The GAAR operates to deny tax benefits flowing from transactions that comply with the literal text of the Act but nevertheless constitute abusive tax avoidance. For the GAAR to apply to a transaction, three elements found in s. 245 must be met: (1) there must be a tax benefit; (2) the transaction must be an avoidance transaction, meaning one that is not undertaken primarily for a bona fide non-tax purpose; and (3) the avoidance transaction giving rise to the tax benefit must be an abuse of the provisions of the Act (or associated enactments).\nThe Tax Court found that the transactions were tax avoidance transactions that resulted in a tax benefit, but concluded that they were not abusive. On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the transactions were abusive, such that the GAAR applied to deny the tax benefits. I note that the parties and the lower courts focused on the non-capital loss deductions since the SR&ED and ITC provisions function similarly. As was the case in the Federal Court of Appeal, the only issue on appeal is whether the appellants series of transactions resulted in abusive tax avoidance. \nFor the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. The transactions were abusive. The object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Through a complex series of transactions, the appellant underwent a fundamental transformation that achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent, while narrowly circumventing the text of s. 111(5). The result of the transactions thereby frustrated the provisions rationale. Since the GAAR applies to deny the tax benefits, the Ministers reassessments must be restored.\nFacts\nBefore the transactions at issue in this appeal, the appellant carried on a drug research and nutritional food additive business under the name Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. Its shares were publicly listed on the NASDAQ and TSX. In 2007, the appellants business was struggling and it faced a potential delisting of its shares from the NASDAQ because the bid price for its common stock had fallen below the minimum price required by the exchange. At a meeting of the appellants board of directors in May 2007, then-CFO David Goold reported on a method of realizing the value of its accumulated Tax Attributes in the form of non-capital losses, SR&ED tax expenditures and ITCs. These unused Tax Attributes had accumulated to nearly $90 million by the end of 2007. Goold told the board that a reorganization of the company, followed by a takeover by another company, would allow the Tax Attributes to be monetized for between 4 and 4.5 cents on the dollar for a total of between $3.5 million and $4 million. It was unlikely that the appellant would be able to use the Tax Attributes on its own at any point; indeed, by November 2007, it had only six months of cash flow left.\nThe appellant entered negotiations with Matco and signed a letter of intent in November 2007. However, the venture that Matco had wanted to offset with the appellants Tax Attributes fell apart and in December 2007, Matco informed the appellant that it would not be proceeding with the agreement.\nIn early 2008, the appellant reorganized and restructured by way of a court-approved Plan of Arrangement. The board of directors had determined that this was the best way of maintaining compliance with the NASDAQs minimum bid price listing standard while facilitating a future monetization of its Tax Attributes. A new company, 0813361 B.C. Ltd. (Newco), was incorporated, and all outstanding common shares, options and warrants of the appellant were exchanged for common shares and warrants of Newco on an 8:1 basis. The appellant thus became a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco. Newcos shares began to be traded on the NASDAQ in substitution for the shares of the appellant.\nOn March 4, 2008, the appellant and Matco entered into a second letter of intent. On March 19, 2008, the appellant entered into an investment agreement with Newco and Matco (the Investment Agreement). \nUnder the Investment Agreement, Newco would receive roughly $3.8 million in the following manner. First, Matco purchased a convertible debenture for $3 million, subject to adjustments (ss. 2.2 and 2.3 of the Investment Agreement, reproduced in A.R., vol. II, at p. 86). The debenture would be convertible into 35 percent of the voting shares and 100 percent of the non-voting shares that Newco held in the appellant (i.e., 79 percent of the equity shares in the appellant). Second, Matco guaranteed that Newco would be able to sell its remaining shares in the appellant for a minimum of $800,000 (the Guaranteed Amount), subject to adjustments (s. 5.5). The remaining shares represented a majority (65 percent) of the voting shares of the appellant. Newco was not obliged to sell its shares to Matco. If an opportunity for Newco to sell its remaining shares did not present itself during the relevant period, then Matco would still be required to pay the Guaranteed Amount.\nThe appellant was to be reorganized: its assets, liabilities and the amount paid by Matco for the convertible debenture would be transferred to Newco (s. 3.2). Newco would also use its best efforts to ensure that the only three directors of the appellant would be Charles Butt (President and CEO of the appellant), Goold and a representative selected by Matco. Butt and Goold would resign following the acceptance of a corporate opportunity (s. 3.4).\nMatco would have one year to present this corporate opportunity  a business opportunity that would be suitable for the appellant to commence, involving a new business and likely a new management team. This would be the business that would generate profits against which the Tax Attributes would be deducted. Newco could accept or refuse the corporate opportunity within a short timeframe (s. 4.1), but if it refused, Matco would be relieved from paying the Guaranteed Amount (s. 5.5(d)).\nIf an acquisition of control of the appellant or Newco occurred, then Matco would be relieved from paying the Guaranteed Amount, and Newco would be required to repurchase the convertible debenture from Matco and to pay an additional $1 million to Matco (s. 5.5(f)). Moreover, other than when acting pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Newco and the appellant could not engage in the following activities without the consent of Matco (s. 6.1): \nissue any shares, options, warrants, calls, conversion privileges or rights of any kind to acquire any shares of the appellant,\nsell, transfer, pledge, encumber or dispose of or agree to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or dispose of any shares of, or any options, warrants, calls, conversion privileges or rights of any kind to acquire any shares of the appellant,\nchange or amend the appellants constating documents or by-laws,\nsplit, combine or reclassify any outstanding shares of the appellant,\nredeem or purchase any shares of the appellant,\nreorganize, amalgamate or merge the appellant,\ntake any action or make any commitment with respect to, or in contemplation of, any complete or partial liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of the appellant,\ndeclare and/or pay dividends or reduce the capital of the appellant,\ntake any action that would or may give rise to a change of control of Newco or the appellant, other than in specific circumstances contemplated in the Investment Agreement,\nenter into, assign, terminate or amend any contract or agreement in respect of the appellant,\ncreate any encumbrance on any of the assets of the appellant,\nin respect of the appellant, create, incur, guarantee, or assume any indebtedness for borrowed money or otherwise become liable or responsible for the obligations of any other person,\nin respect of the appellant, make any loans, advances, or capital contributions to, or investments in, any other person,\nchange in any respect any of the accounting principles or practices used by Newco or the appellant, except for any change required by reason of a concurrent change in policy, and\nengage in any activity other than examining and pursuing the corporate opportunity.\nBefore the Investment Agreement was executed, the managing director of Matco, Alan Ross, purchased 100 shares of the appellant from Newco through his wholly owned holding company, 1250280 Alberta Ltd. One of the purposes for this was to ensure that the Investment Agreement would not constitute a unanimous shareholder agreement.\nThe Investment Agreement was executed on May 9, 2008. Pursuant to the agreement, the appellants assets and liabilities were transferred to Newco in exchange for a promissory note, which the appellant transferred to another subsidiary of Newco; Matco subscribed for the convertible debenture in the amount of nearly $3 million, which the appellant transferred to the other subsidiary. As planned, all of the appellants directors resigned except Butt, and Goold and Ross were elected directors.\nMatco sought to find a business that could use the appellants Tax Attributes. In December 2008, Matco presented the appellant with a corporate opportunity pursuant to the Investment Agreement. Deans Knight Capital Management (DKCM), a mutual fund management company, was interested in investing in high-yield debt instruments, which were selling at low prices because of the 2008 financial crisis. DKCM planned to raise money for the investments through an IPO. Matco proposed that DKCM would use the appellant as the corporate vehicle for the intended IPO, rather than incorporating a new company, because the appellants Tax Attributes would shelter the majority of the portfolio income and capital gains. \nThe appellants board of directors discussed the proposal, did some investigation into DKCM, and approved the proposal. In December 2008, DKCM and the appellant entered into a letter of intent. The letter specified that the appellant must have at least $95 million in deductible amounts available to be used against income earned by the corporation in Canada. To allow the appellant to be used for DKCMs business venture, DKCM would be appointed to manage the appellant; 4 of the 5 directors of the appellant would be appointed by DKCM; and the appellant would be used in a $100 million minimum IPO, whose proceeds would be used to purchase corporate debt securities that would generate income and gains that could be sheltered by the Tax Attributes. The IPO would be priced such that the appellants existing common shares (which would ultimately be held by Matco following its exercise of the convertible debenture) would be attributed a net asset value of $5 million. \nIn February 2009, the appellants name was changed to its current name, Deans Knight Income Corporation. DKCMs President became a director of the appellant. In March 2009, Matcos managing director and four nominees of DKCM were appointed as directors of the appellant, and three officers of DKCM were appointed as officers of the appellant. \nImmediately prior to the IPO, Matco converted its debenture into 35 percent of the appellants voting shares and 100 percent of its non-voting shares. Matco also obtained an exception to the post-IPO lock-up period to enable it to purchase the remaining shares from Newco within the time period contemplated under the Investment Agreement. \nThe IPO closed on March 18, 2009. Notably, the prospectus indicated that there was a risk that the Canada Revenue Agency could successfully challenge the amount of such tax attributes or their availability to the Company (A.R., vol. III, at p. 30). A total of 10,036,890 shares were issued at $10 per share, for proceeds of over $100 million. At this valuation, Matcos shares of the appellant were worth over $4 million. \nIn April 2009, Matco, through a related corporation, made an offer to Newco to purchase the remaining shares at the Guaranteed Amount. Though the Guaranteed Amount was a discount to the IPO price, Newco accepted the offer because it needed money for its own operations and because its board believed the share price might decrease before the end of the post-IPO lock-up period.\nThe appellants investment business succeeded and it paid regular dividends to its shareholders in the first four years of operation. It began to wind up operations in its fifth year, as intended.\nWhen filing its tax returns for 2009 to 2012 and in computing its income, the appellant claimed Tax Attributes from 2007 and earlier. The appellant deducted nearly $65 million of its Tax Attributes to reduce its tax liability from the debt-securities business. \nThe Minister reassessed these taxation years to disallow the claimed losses and expenditures. The appellant objected to the reassessments and appealed to the Tax Court.\nJudicial History\nTax Court of Canada, 2019 TCC 76, [2019] 4 C.T.C. 2001\nAt the Tax Court, Paris J. was faced with two issues. The first issue was whether Matco had obtained an option to purchase the majority of the voting shares of the appellant, thereby acquiring control pursuant to ss. 256(8) and 251(5)(b) of the Act. Paris J. concluded that Matco had not obtained such a right, and, accordingly, that there had been no acquisition of control triggering the application of s. 111(5). This finding was not challenged on appeal and is therefore not before this Court. \nAs for the second issue, the question was whether the GAAR could apply to deny the deduction of the Tax Attributes. This required Paris J. to determine whether there was a series of transactions that resulted in a tax benefit, whether the transactions were primarily for tax avoidance purposes and whether they resulted in an abuse of the provisions of the Act. Paris J. chose to focus on the non-capital loss provisions, since the SR&ED and ITC streaming restrictions operated in a similar manner. Applying each step of the GAAR test, Paris J. found that there was a series of transactions that resulted in a reduction of tax. He also concluded that the primary purpose of the Investment Agreement, the restructuring of the appellant and all related transactions was to monetize the Tax Attributes. Consequently, the series of transactions could be characterized as avoidance transactions. However, Paris J. concluded that the transactions were not abusive because they did not frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions of the Act.  \nFirst, Paris J. considered the object, spirit and purpose of ss. 111(1)(a), 111(5) and 256(8). Regarding s. 111(1)(a), he concluded that the object, spirit and purpose was to provide relief to taxpayers who have suffered losses, given that the government, through income tax, shares in the income of a taxpayer (para. 99). \nAs for s. 111(5), Paris J. wrote that the acquisition of control test was the means by which Parliament has determined that a loss has notionally been transferred to an unrelated party (para. 103). He indicated that the notion of control was central to the working of s. 111(5) and that it has long been held to mean de jure control. He also considered the history of s. 111(5) and acknowledged that Parliament introduced provisions that deem de jure control to exist or not exist in some circumstances, thereby allowing the Minister to look beyond the share registry of the corporation to determine who in substance has control (paras. 111 and 115). However, he noted that the de facto control test in s. 256(5.1) was not adopted. Paris J. moved to the purpose of s. 111(5) and found it to be clear that subsection 111(5) was enacted to prevent tax loss trading. The restriction on the use of losses is subject to limited exceptions relating to the rehabilitation of the loss business and to the transfer of losses between corporations under common control (para. 126). He recognized that the underlying rationale for the choice to deny loss carryovers is that after the acquisition of control, the corporation can be likened to a new taxpayer because it has different shareholders (para. 128). He also indicated that the acquisition of control test served as a reasonable marker between situations where the corporation is a free actor in a transaction and when it is only a passive participant whose actions can be manipulated by a new person or group of persons in order to utilize the losses or Tax Attributes of the corporation for their own benefit (para. 134).\nBased on this analysis, Paris J. concluded that the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) was to target manipulation of losses of a corporation by a new person or group of persons, through effective control over the corporations actions (para. 134). He also briefly considered the object, spirit and purpose of s. 256(8) and found that it was to prevent a taxpayer from circumventing the listed avoidance provisions by acquiring control over shares or share voting rights in order to achieve effective control of the corporation (para. 138).\nTurning to whether the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions were frustrated by the avoidance transactions, Paris J. framed the question as whether despite there being no actual acquisition of de jure control by Matco, Matco acquired effective control of the Appellant such that the object, spirit and purpose of subsection 111(5) and the related tax attribute streaming restrictions was circumvented (para. 144). The judge rejected the argument that a change of management, business activity, assets and liabilities, and name were relevant to determining whether Matco gained effective control. He thereafter focused on whether Matco had effective control over the majority of the voting shares of the appellant prior to the IPO and answered in the negative. He determined that [t]he Appellant participated freely in the transactions that resulted in the use of the Tax Attributes against the investment business income (para. 152).\nNor did Paris J. accept that the transactions frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of s. 256(8) of the Act. He rejected the Crowns submission that Matco had effective control over the remaining shares of the appellant held by Newco: Newco could have sold the shares without Matcos consent; the Investment Agreement did not provide that only Matco could present an opportunity for Newco to sell its remaining shares; and the restrictions placed on the appellants activities did not amount to control over its shares.\nIn light of his conclusion that the GAAR did not apply, Paris J. allowed the appeal from the reassessments.\nFederal Court of Appeal, 2021 FCA 160, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 731\nBefore the Federal Court of Appeal, the only issue in dispute was the third step of the GAAR analysis, namely, whether the avoidance transactions were abusive. Woods J.A., writing for a unanimous court, allowed the Ministers appeal and found that the transactions frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act. \nWoods J.A. agreed with Paris J.s approach to ascertaining the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5). However, she replaced the term effective control with actual control, since the former term had led to confusion. Thus, she determined that the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) was to restrict the use of specified losses, including non-capital losses, if a person or group of persons has acquired actual control over the corporations actions, whether by way of de jure control or otherwise (para. 72 (emphasis added)). \nWoods J.A. rejected the argument that the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) was fully expressed by its text. She noted that the provision was introduced to prohibit trafficking in shares of companies with loss carryovers and that the GAAR itself was, in part, a response to the unintended use of loss carryovers. Moreover, she cited this Courts recognition that the general policy of the Income Tax Act is to prohibit the transfer of losses between taxpayers, subject to specific exceptions and that [t]his policy is . . . to be taken into account in determining Parliaments intent (para. 81, citing Mathew v. Canada, 2005 SCC 55, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 643, at para. 49). Woods J.A. recognized that her formulation of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) does include forms of de jure and de facto control but indicated that the actual control test is different from the de facto control test (para. 83). \nTurning to whether the avoidance transactions frustrated the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), Woods J.A. concluded that the terms of the Investment Agreement gave Matco actual control over the actions of the appellant, both in general and in approving the corporate opportunity. At a general level, the restrictions in the Investment Agreement resulted in control being handed to Matco. As for approving the corporate opportunity, Woods J.A. remarked that there was no realistic chance that a Corporate Opportunity would be rejected (para. 104) because the Guaranteed Amount would have been forfeited. Although the appellant discussed the proposal and did some investigation before approving it, it was not a free actor: Woods J.A. highlighted that it was a limited investigation to ensure that this company was not a fly-by-night operation (para. 108). \nWoods J.A. concluded that s. 111(5) had been abused. Accordingly, the conditions for the application of the GAAR were met and the tax benefit should be denied. As a result, the Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Tax Court.\nIssues\nOnly the third step of the GAAR analysis is challenged before this Court. The issues can therefore be stated as follows:\n(1) Did the Federal Court of Appeal err in its articulation of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act?\n(2) Did the Federal Court of Appeal err in concluding that the avoidance transactions were abusive?\nAnalysis\nBackground to the General Anti-Avoidance Rule\nThe present appeal is not the first time this Court has considered the GAAR. A review of its origins and role within the Act nonetheless provides useful background.\nIn 1988, Parliament enacted the GAAR in s. 245 of the Act, partially in response to this Courts decision in Stubart Investments Ltd. v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 536. In Stubart, this Court rejected a literal approach to interpreting the Act. At the same time, it also rejected an interpretation of a precursor to the GAAR that would have required transactions to have a bona fide business purpose. Instead, it offered guidelines to limit unacceptable tax avoidance arrangements. Parliament viewed the decision in Stubart as an inadequate approach to the problem of tax avoidance (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 14). \nMoreover, abusive tax avoidance had become a problem of significant concern for Parliament. Taxpayers, aided by expert advice, increasingly devised complex legal transactions to avoid tax in ways unintended by Parliament. Once the avoidance mechanisms relied on became evident, either from advance ruling requests or tax assessments, Parliament would react to plug the loopholes in the Act to prevent future use. The problem was that increasingly convoluted rules were vulnerable, creating new loopholes to exploit. This Court described this cycle in Stubart as the action and reaction endlessly produced by complex, specific tax measures aimed at sophisticated business practices, and the inevitable, professionally-guided and equally specialized taxpayer reaction (p. 580; see also D. A. Dodge, A New and More Coherent Approach to Tax Avoidance (1988), 36 Can. Tax J. 1, at p. 4). As this cycle of action and reaction between creative tax planners and Parliament continued, the Act grew in size and complexity (Department of Finance, Guidelines for Tax Reform in Canada (1986), at p. 7). \nDespite these efforts, Parliament was unable to curb the proliferation of tax avoidance schemes. Corporate tax revenues in 1985-86 were $1.2 billion lower than the initial budgetary forecasts, a shortfall which was considered to be caused largely by the unexpected application of loss carryforwards (Dodge, at p. 3; see also W. J. Strain, D. A. Dodge and V. Peters, Tax Simplification: The Elusive Goal, in Report of Proceedings of the Fortieth Tax Conference (1989), 4:1, at pp. 4:43 and 4:52-53). \nThe GAAR was Parliaments chosen mechanism to interrupt this cycle. In the 1987 White Paper on Tax Reform, the government recognized that specific anti-avoidance rules are not always desirable because they make the tax system more complex; they sometimes create additional unintended loopholes, and they do not deal with transactions completed before the amendments become effective (see Department of Finance, The White Paper: Tax Reform 1987 (1987), at p. 57; see also B. J. Arnold and J. R. Wilson, The General Anti-Avoidance Rule  Part 2 (1988), 36 Can. Tax J. 1123, at p. 1140). A new general anti-avoidance rule was meant to overcome some of these disadvantages. The novel approach found within the GAAR explains why, upon its enactment, Parliament was able to remove certain specific anti-avoidance rules that it felt were sufficiently addressed by a general rule (White Paper, at p. 57; Triad Gestco Ltd. v. Canada, 2012 FCA 258, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 199, at paras. 52-53; Department of Finance, Tax Reform 1987: Income Tax Reform (1987), at p. 129; Dodge, at p. 8; Department of Finance, Modernizing and Strengthening the General Anti-Avoidance Rule: Consultation Paper, 2022 (online), at pp. 16 and 19-20; see also Arnold and Wilson, at p. 1148).\nIn light of the foregoing, the GAAR is best understood as a way to overcome the disadvantages of a system based solely on specific rules (White Paper, at p. 57; Dodge, at p. 8). The GAAR was a choice, made by Parliament, to complement its specific anti-avoidance efforts with the enactment of a general rule. To achieve this aim, the GAAR draws a line between legitimate tax minimization and abusive tax avoidance (Trustco, at para. 16). Abusive tax avoidance can involve unforeseen tax strategies (Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, at para. 80). For example, in Alta Energy, this Court treated evidence of Parliaments knowledge and acceptance of the tax strategy at issue as a relevant consideration when ascertaining its intent. However, the GAAR is not limited to unforeseen situations; as this Court has explained, it is designed to capture situations that undermine the integrity of the tax system by frustrating the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions relied on by the taxpayer (Lipson v. Canada, 2009 SCC 1, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 2; Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada, 2011 SCC 63, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 721, at paras. 71-72; see also The Gladwin Realty Corporation v. The Queen, 2020 FCA 142, [2020] 6 C.T.C. 185, at para. 85; D. G. Duff, General Anti-Avoidance Rules Revisited: Reflections on Tim Edgars Building a Better GAAR (2020), 68 Can. Tax J. 579, at p. 591). \nThe Relationship Between the GAAR, the Duke of Westminster Principle and Uncertainty\nThe GAAR must also be understood in light of its relationship to the Duke of Westminster principle. In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.), Lord Tomlin recognized the foundational principle that [e]very man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be (p. 19). The principle that taxpayers can order their affairs to minimize the amount of tax payable has been affirmed by this Court on numerous occasions (see, e.g., Stubart, at p. 552; Trustco, at para. 11; Copthorne, at para. 65). \nThe Duke of Westminster principle, however, has never been absolute (Lipson, at para. 21) and it is open to Parliament to derogate from it. Parliament has done so through the GAAR. The GAAR does not displace the Duke of Westminster principle for legitimate tax planning. Rather, it recognizes a difference between legitimate tax planning  which represents the vast majority of transactions and remains unaffected, consistent with the Duke of Westminster principle  and tax planning that operates to abuse the rules of the tax system  in which case the integrity of the tax system is preserved by denying the tax benefit, notwithstanding the transactions compliance with the provisions relied upon. Even where the purpose of a transaction is to minimize tax, taxpayers are allowed to carry it out unless it results in an abuse of the provisions of the Act (Lipson, at para. 25). Where the transaction is shown to be abusive, the Duke of Westminster principle is attenuated by the GAAR (Trustco, at para. 13).\nIn establishing a general anti-avoidance rule that operated to deny tax benefits on a case-specific basis, Parliament was cognizant of the GAARs implications for the level of certainty in tax planning. Parliament sought to balance the protection of the tax base and the need for certainty for taxpayers (Department of Finance, Explanatory Notes to Legislation Relating to Income Tax (1988), at p. 461). The GAAR was enacted to be a provision of last resort to address abusive tax avoidance only and was therefore not designed to create more generalized uncertainty in tax planning (Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66). Some uncertainty is unavoidable when a general rule is adopted (Dodge, at p. 21; Copthorne, at para. 123). However, a reasonable degree of certainty is achieved by the balance struck within the GAAR itself. \nFirst, as Professor Jinyan Li noted, the GAAR cases generally involve situations that do not concern the majority of taxpayers, and the transactions are well planned and executed on the basis of professional tax advice (Economic Substance: Drawing the Line Between Legitimate Tax Minimization and Abusive Tax Avoidance (2006), 54 Can. Tax J. 23, at p. 40). The GAAR only scrutinizes transactions motivated by tax avoidance, and even a tax-motivated transaction that is consistent with the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions of the Act is unaffected by the GAAR (see Explanatory Notes, at p. 461). By virtue of the rigorous analysis required by s. 245, the GAAR only affects a small subset of transactions, largely conducted by sophisticated parties with the ability to properly evaluate the risks inherent in a GAAR reassessment. Indeed, this is precisely what occurred in the present case: the prospectus relating to the appellants IPO expressly recognized the risk of a successful challenge to the use of the Tax Attributes.\nSecond, a proper application of the GAAR methodology serves to ensure reasonable certainty in tax planning (P. Samtani and J. Kutyan, GAAR Revisited: From Instinctive Reaction to Intellectual Rigour (2014), 62 Can. Tax J. 401, at p. 403). The GAAR is not a tool to sanction conduct that courts find immoral (Copthorne, at para. 65; Alta Energy, at para. 48). Rather, courts must conduct an objective, thorough and step-by-step analysis (Copthorne, at para. 68). Within this analysis, the principles of certainty, predictability and fairness do not play an independent role; rather, they are reflected in the carefully calibrated test that Parliament crafted in s. 245 of the Act and in its interpretation by this Court. It is to this test that I now turn.\nApplying the GAAR\nAs Rothstein J. wrote in Copthorne, [i]t is relatively straightforward to set out the GAAR scheme. It is much more difficult to apply it (para. 32). This is because the GAAR confers upon courts the unusual duty of going behind the words of the legislation (para. 66). While the duty imposed by the GAAR is unusual, the analysis involves a structured, three-step test that has been the subject of thorough guidance by this Court. In order for the GAAR to apply, the following questions must be asked (para. 33, citing Trustco, at paras. 18, 21 and 36):\n1. Was there a tax benefit? . . .\n2. Was the transaction giving rise to the tax benefit an avoidance transaction? . . .\n3. Was the avoidance transaction giving rise to the tax benefit abusive? \nThe taxpayer bears the burden of refuting the Ministers assumption of the existence of a tax benefit (Copthorne, at para. 34; Trustco, at para. 63) and the burden of proving the existence of a bona fide non-tax purpose (Copthorne, at para. 63; Trustco, at para. 66). In contrast, at the third step, the Minister bears the burden of proving that the avoidance transaction results in an abuse (Lipson, at para. 21).\nTax Benefit\nThe first step in the GAAR analysis is to determine whether a tax benefit arises from a transaction or a series of transactions (s. 245(2) of the Act; Trustco, at para. 18). A tax benefit is defined as a reduction, avoidance or deferral of tax or an increase in a refund of tax or other amount paid under the Act (s. 245(1) of the Act). The existence of a tax benefit may be clear on the face of the transactions; it is also appropriate to have regard to alternative arrangements that might reasonably have been carried out but for the existence of the tax benefit (Copthorne, at para. 35, citing D. G. Duff et al., Canadian Income Tax Law (3rd ed. 2009), at p. 187).\nAvoidance Transaction\nThe second step in the GAAR analysis is to determine whether the transaction or series of transactions was made primarily for the purpose of obtaining a tax benefit (s. 245(3) of the Act; Trustco, at paras. 17, 21 and 66). This requirement removes the majority of transactions from the ambit of the GAAR, including those that are made for family and investment purposes (Trustco, at paras. 21 and 33). A transaction may have both tax and non-tax purposes; in such a case, the taxpayer must satisfy the court that it is reasonable to conclude that the non-tax purpose was primary (paras. 27 and 29). \nMoreover, in a series of transactions, if at least one transaction in the series is an avoidance transaction, the second step has been satisfied (Copthorne, at para. 64). As explained in Trustco, a series of transactions involves transactions that are pre-ordained in order to produce a given result with no practical likelihood that the pre-planned events would not take place in the order ordained (para. 25, citing Craven v. White, [1989] A.C. 398 (H.L.), at p. 514, per Lord Oliver). A series of transactions also includes related transactions or events . . . in contemplation of the series (s. 248(10)), which refers to transactions or events before or after the series which were undertaken in relation to or because of the series (Copthorne, at para. 46, citing Trustco, at para. 26).\nAbusive Tax Avoidance\nThe third step of the GAAR analysis is frequently the most contentious. Indeed, it is the only step at issue in the present appeal. Analyzing whether the transactions are abusive involves, first, determining the object, spirit and purpose of the relevant provisions and, second, determining whether the result of the transactions frustrated that object, spirit and purpose (Trustco, at para. 44; Copthorne, at paras. 69-71). \nThe object, spirit and purpose reflects the rationale of the provision. The provisions text, context and purpose help to shed light on this rationale. Once the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis focuses on whether the result of the transactions frustrates the provisions rationale. I provide guidance on these aspects below.\nThe Object, Spirit and Purpose Reflects the Rationale of the Provision\nTo determine whether a transaction is abusive, courts must identify the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions alleged to have been abused, with reference to the provisions themselves, the scheme of the Act and permissible extrinsic aids (Trustco, at para. 55). The object, spirit and purpose of the provisions has been referred to as the legislative rationale that underlies specific or interrelated provisions of the Act (Copthorne, at para. 69, citing V. Krishna, The Fundamentals of Income Tax Law (2009), at p. 818).\nAt this juncture, it is critical to distinguish the rationale behind a provision from the means chosen to give that rationale effect within the provision. The drafting process reflects the task of translating government aims into legislative form in order to create intelligible, legally effective rules (see, e.g., Canada, Privy Council Office, Guide to Making Federal Acts and Regulations (2nd ed. 2001), at pp. 122-29). The means selected by drafters and adopted by Parliament are relevant indicia within the broader text, context and purpose analysis, since they may shed light on the rationale underlying the provision. However, the means do not necessarily provide a full answer as to why the provision was adopted (Canada v. Oxford Properties Group Inc., 2018 FCA 30, [2018] 4 F.C.R. 3, at para. 101). This is not to imply that Parliament cannot translate its aims into effective legislation  quite the opposite: when drafting legal tests, Parliament is seeking to establish a general standard that is most faithful to its objectives from the options which are available and practicable. But even the most carefully drafted provision can be abused, which is why the GAAR exists to protect the provisions underlying rationale. \nThe object, spirit and purpose of a provision must be worded as a description of its rationale (Copthorne, at para. 69). When articulating the object, spirit and purpose of a provision, a court is not repeating the test for the provision, nor is it crafting a new, secondary test that will apply to avoidance transactions. Discerning the object, spirit and purpose does not rewrite the provision; rather, the court merely takes a step back to formulate a concise description of the rationale underlying the provision, against which a textually compliant transaction must be scrutinized (Trustco, at para. 57; Copthorne, at para. 69).\nFor example, for a provision conferring a tax benefit, the rationale might relate to the basis for providing relief to taxpayers in such circumstances or, for targeted relief, the conduct that Parliament sought to encourage. Conversely, for a specific anti-avoidance rule, the rationale might relate to the specific result, or mischief, that Parliament sought to prevent. \nThe Provisions Text, Context and Purpose Are Used to Determine Its Rationale\nAlthough the GAAR analysis involves a consideration of the provisions text, context and purpose, the use of these elements differs from traditional statutory interpretation (Copthorne, at para. 70; Alta Energy, at para. 30, per Cote J., and at para. 116, per Rowe and Martin JJ., dissenting but not on this point; Oxford Properties Group, at paras. 40-44). It must be recalled that the GAAR is a provision of last resort (Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66). There is a distinction between the application of a provision in general and the application of the GAAR to a transaction motivated by tax avoidance. If a court is performing a GAAR analysis, the impugned transactions necessarily comply with the provisions of the Act, properly interpreted and applied (see Copthorne, at para. 88; D. G. Duff, The Interpretive Exercise Under the General Anti-Avoidance Rule, in B. J. Arnold, ed., The General Anti-Avoidance Rule  Past, Present, and Future (2021), 383, at p. 391). This is self-evident: if there is a specific provision with which the taxpayer has not complied, the Minister need not resort to the GAAR.\nIn traditional statutory interpretation, the court considers a provisions text, context and purpose to determine what the words of the statute mean. In the GAAR analysis, however, [t]he search is for the rationale that underlies the words that may not be captured by the bare meaning of the words themselves (Copthorne, at para. 70 (emphasis added); Triad Gestco, at para. 51). The object, spirit and purpose analysis has a precise function: to discern the underlying rationale of the provisions. A consideration of the text, context and purpose gives structure to this analysis. Indeed, the object, spirit and purpose analysis should not turn into a value judgment of what is right or wrong nor . . . what tax law ought to be or ought to do (Copthorne, at para. 70). Nor should it become a search for an overriding policy of the Act that is not founded in the text, context and purpose of the provisions (Canada Trustco, at para. 41; Alta Energy, at para. 49). Rather, a focus on the provisions text, context and purpose ensures that the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence used to discern a provisions rationale remains tied to the provision itself. To that end, a brief discussion on how to conduct this analysis is useful.\nThe text of the provision is relevant to the analysis of a provisions object, spirit and purpose (Alta Energy, at para. 58). Bearing in mind the search for the provisions underlying rationale, courts may ask how the text sheds light on what the provision was designed to achieve. Put differently, what was the provision intended to do? (Copthorne, at para. 88). This includes considering what the text of the provision expressly permits or restricts. Similarly, the language and structure of the provision can sometimes be evocative of Parliaments underlying concerns. The text can also help to identify the nature (or type) of provision at issue, which can be relevant to understanding the rationale underlying it. \nThere may be circumstances where the provisions underlying rationale is no broader than its text because, having regard to its context and purpose, the provisions text fully explains its underlying rationale (Copthorne, at para. 110). A court, however, must not lose sight of the goal of the exercise  to discern the underlying rationale of the provision  and the reality that this rationale may not be captured by the bare meaning of the words themselves (Copthorne, at para. 70). As explained by Noel C.J. of the Federal Court of Appeal, [w]hile one cannot rule out the possibility that the underlying rationale for a provision will be fully captured by the words, this must still be demonstrated by inquiring into the provisions reason for being (Oxford Properties Group, at para. 88, citing Copthorne, at paras. 110-11). \nBeyond the provisions text, a court must consider the provisions context. The contextual analysis involves an examination of other sections of the Act, as well as permissible extrinsic aids (Copthorne, at para. 91; Trustco, at para. 55). Of course, this does not involve considering every other section of the Act. Rather, relevant provisions are related because they are grouped together or because they work together to give effect to a plausible and coherent plan (Copthorne, at para. 91, citing R. Sullivan, Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 361 and 364). \nThe focus is on the relationship between the provision alleged to have been abused and the particular scheme within which it operates (Triad Gestco, at paras. 26 et seq.). Although the Act is lengthy and detailed, an understanding of its structure can help to identify the function of the provision at issue. For example, a specific restriction may shed light on the rationale of a general benefit-conferring rule, and vice versa. \nFinally, understanding the provisions purpose is central to the GAAR analysis. A purposive analysis permits courts to consider legislative history and extrinsic evidence (see R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022), at  9.03, at paras. 7-8). These materials provide insight into the rationale for specific provisions. Of course, tax provisions can serve a variety of independent and interlocking purposes (Trustco, at para. 53). Nevertheless, such provisions are intended to promote particular aims, and courts must therefore determine what outcome Parliament sought to achieve through the specific provision or provisions (Copthorne, at para. 113).    \nThe Abuse Analysis Focuses on Whether the Result of the Transactions Frustrates the Provisions Object, Spirit and Purpose\nAt the abuse stage, the avoidance transactions will be abusive where the outcome or result of the avoidance transaction (a) is an outcome that the provisions relied on seek to prevent; (b) defeats the underlying rationale of the provisions relied on; or (c) circumvents certain provisions in a manner that frustrates the object, spirit and purpose of those provisions (Lipson, at para. 40, citing Trustco, at para. 45). These considerations are not independent of one another and frequently overlap (Copthorne, at para. 72). Ultimately, the analysis remains squarely focused on abuse. Courts must go beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions; they must compare the result of the transactions to the underlying rationale of the provision and determine whether that rationale has been frustrated. In coming to such a conclusion, the abusive nature of the transaction must be clear (Trustco, at paras. 62 and 66; Copthorne, at para. 68; Alta Energy, at para. 33).\nThis Courts jurisprudence sheds light on the types of circumstances that rise to the level of abuse. For example, if the rationale underlying the provision is to encourage particular relationships or activities, abusive tax avoidance may be found where the relationships and transactions are wholly dissimilar to the relationships or transactions that are contemplated by the provisions, as was the case in Mathew (para. 57, citing Trustco, at para. 60). Similarly, where a specific anti-avoidance rule is flipped on its head to enable tax avoidance, there is likely to be a finding of abuse, as was the case in Lipson (para. 42; see also Fiducie Financiere Satoma v. The Queen, 2018 FCA 74, 2018 D.T.C. 5052, at para. 52). An abuse may also be found in certain circumstances where a series of transactions achieved a result the section was intended to prevent while narrowly avoiding application of the provision, as in Copthorne (paras. 124-27). These examples are not exhaustive, but provide useful guidance on how the object, spirit and purpose of different types of tax provisions can be frustrated.\nImportantly, there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti-avoidance rule. Thus, I do not agree with the appellants submission that where Parliament has legislated with precision, as here, where loss carryovers are denied in specific instances, the GAAR is not meant to play a role. Of course, the GAAR will not apply in all circumstances  the analysis is inherently case specific. Further, the way a provision has been drafted is important within the text, context and purpose analysis, since it may shed light on the conduct that Parliament sought to target and how it went about doing so. But the proposition that the GAAR can have almost no role where Parliament has legislated a specific anti-avoidance rule is to read a restriction into s. 245 without a basis for doing so. It ignores the fact that the GAAR was enacted in the first place partly because specific anti-avoidance rules were being circumvented through abusive tax planning, and that such rules are among those most commonly found to have been abused in GAAR decisions (J. Li, The Misuse or Abuse Exception: The Role of Economic Substance, in Arnold, The General Anti-Avoidance Rule, 295, at pp. 299, fn. 25, and p. 316). \nThe appellants position also runs contrary to this Courts jurisprudence. As the majority recognized in Alta Energy, [a]busive tax avoidance can also occur when an arrangement circumvents the application of certain provisions, such as specific anti-avoidance rules, in a manner that frustrates or defeats the object, spirit or purpose of those provisions (para. 32 (emphasis added), citing Trustco, at para. 45). Moreover, this Court in Copthorne largely rejected the argument that where Parliament has drafted detailed provisions, then a taxpayer that has technically complied with these provisions cannot frustrate their rationale (paras. 108-11). Simply put, specific and carefully drafted provisions are not immune from abuse. As with any other provision, the GAAR ensures that the rationale behind such provisions is not frustrated by abusive tax strategies. \nSummary\nIn summary, at the third stage of the GAAR analysis: \nThe object, spirit and purpose is a description of the provisions underlying rationale. The means (the how) do not always provide a full answer as to the rationale underlying the provision (the why). \nThe text, context and purpose of a provision provide indicia of its rationale. The text can shed light on what the provision was designed to encourage or prevent based on what it expressly permits or restricts, how it is worded and structured, and the nature of the provision. Similarly, the context can serve to identify the function of the provision within a coherent scheme. Finally, the provisions purpose can help to discern the outcomes that Parliament sought to achieve or prevent.\nOnce the object, spirit and purpose has been ascertained, the abuse analysis goes beyond the legal form and technical compliance of the transactions to consider whether the result frustrates the provisions rationale. \nHaving summarized the proper approach to applying the GAAR in light of this Courts jurisprudence, I now turn to the transactions at issue. \nApplication\nWhich Provisions Are at Issue?\nThe parties do not dispute that the transactions complied with the text of the Act. The question is whether the GAAR applies to deny the deductions and uphold the Ministers reassessments. The appellant did not challenge the Tax Courts findings that there was a series of transactions that resulted in a tax benefit and that they constituted avoidance transactions. Thus, the only question in dispute is whether they abused certain provisions of the Act (the third stage of the GAAR analysis). This requires, first, ascertaining the object, spirit and purpose of a provision and, second, determining whether it has been frustrated. Before proceeding, it is worth determining which provisions should be the focus of the analysis.\nThe Minister reassessed the appellants claims relating to the deduction of non-capital losses, SR&ED expenditures and ITCs. However, since the restrictions on loss carryovers in each context operate in a similar way, a violation of the GAAR in one case would lead to a similar determination in the others. This is consistent with how the parties argued the case and how it was analyzed by both the Tax Court and the Federal Court of Appeal (T.C.C. reasons, at para. 87; C.A. reasons, at para. 5). \nThe courts below focused on three non-capital loss provisions: s. 111(1)(a), which sets out the benefit-conferring rule permitting non-capital loss carryovers; s. 111(5), which denies loss carryovers where the control of the corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, unless a continuity of business exists; and s. 256(8), which deems an acquisition of control to occur where certain share-related rights are obtained. These provisions are interrelated and complement each other, since they exist within a scheme regulating the carryover of non-capital losses. As set out below, an analysis of s. 111(5) is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. \nWhat Is the Object, Spirit and Purpose of Section 111(5)?\nThe first stage of the abuse analysis, ascertaining the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions, is an extricable question of law, subject to a correctness standard of review (see Alta Energy, at para. 50, citing Trustco, at para. 44; Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 8). To assess the underlying rationale of s. 111(5), it is necessary to consider the provisions text, context and purpose (Copthorne, at para. 70). A review of the provisions text, context and purpose reveals that Parliament intended to deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take control of a corporation and change its business. I would formulate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) as follows: to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. In order to consider how this rationale flows from s. 111(5)s text, context and purpose, I begin by analyzing the text.\nThe Text of the Provision\nBroadly stated, s. 111(5) is a restriction on a taxpayers ability to make use of its non-capital losses incurred in another taxation year. At the time of the transactions in issue, the relevant portion of s. 111(5) read as follows:  \n(5) Where, at any time, control of a corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending before that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending after that time and no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending after that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending before that time except that\n(a) such portion of the corporations non-capital loss or farm loss, as the case may be, for a taxation year ending before that time as may reasonably be regarded as its loss from carrying on a business and, where a business was carried on by the corporation in that year, such portion of the non-capital loss as may reasonably be regarded as being in respect of an amount deductible under paragraph 110(1)(k) in computing its taxable income for the year is deductible by the corporation for a particular taxation year ending after that time\n(i) only if that business was carried on by the corporation for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit throughout the particular year, and\n(ii) only to the extent of the total of the corporations income for the particular year from that business and, where properties were sold, leased, rented or developed or services rendered in the course of carrying on that business before that time, from any other business substantially all the income of which was derived from the sale, leasing, rental or development, as the case may be, of similar properties or the rendering of similar services . . . .\nThree elements of the text warrant consideration: s. 111(5)s reference to control; its focus on an acquisition by a person or group of persons; and the continuity of business exception. While the text of s. 111(5) has been amended since the transactions in question, the provision still encompasses these core elements, albeit structured differently (see s. 111(5.4)).\nFirst, the text of s. 111(5) references control. While control is not expressly defined within the provision or the Act, this Court concluded in Duha Printers that it refers to de jure control. The general test for de jure control is whether the controlling party enjoys, by virtue of its shareholdings, the ability to elect the majority of the board of directors (Duha Printers, at para. 36; R. Taylor and M.-C. Marcil, Duha Printers Revisited: Issues Regarding Corporate Control (2022), 70 Can. Tax J. 495, at pp. 504-7; G. Lord et al., Les principes de limposition au Canada (13th ed. 2002), at s. 3.3; Explanatory Notes, at pp. 502-4; at common law, see Buckerfields Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 299). The power to select a majority of directors generally means the power to choose those who manage the affairs of the corporation, subject, in particular, to the constating documents or a unanimous shareholder agreement (Duha Printers, at para. 85; see also Canada Business Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (CBCA), ss. 2(3) and 102(1); Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, ss. 1(5) and 115(1); Business Corporations Act, CQLR, c. S-31.1, ss. 2 to control and 112; Civil Code of Quebec, arts. 310, 335 and 336). I will return to the concept of de jure control, in contrast to de facto control, below. \nSecond, s. 111(5) does not refer merely to a change in control, but to a situation where control has been acquired by a person or group of persons. The provision indicates Parliaments focus on circumstances in which there is a shift in the locus of control, rather than, for example, high turnover in the shares of a publicly traded company (Silicon Graphics Ltd. v. Canada, 2002 FCA 260, [2003] 1 F.C. 447, at para. 36). \nThird, s. 111(5) creates an exception to the rule it sets out: losses remain deductible if, after an acquisition of control, the corporation engages in the same or a similar business. Thus, the connection to past losses is severed only when control has been acquired and there is a break from the corporations past business. The text of s. 111(5) reflects a concern with denying loss carryovers when there is a lack of continuity within the corporation, as measured by both the identity of its controlling shareholders and its business activity. \nThe appellant argues that the object, spirit and purpose of the provision is captured by the de jure control test within s. 111(5). In some cases, the object, spirit and purpose may be no broader than the provision itself. However, this is only where the text fully explains the provisions underlying rationale (Copthorne, at para. 110). To determine whether this is the case for s. 111(5), the analysis must move to the context and purpose of the provision. \nThe Context of the Provision\nIt would be difficult to understand the role of s. 111(5) within the Act without considering the function it plays in the larger scheme of computing taxable income. Section 111(5) operates as a step within this broader process. \nSection 111(5) Should Be Considered Against the Foundational Principles of the Act\nThe roots of the basic income tax system of the Act lie in ss. 2 to 4 (Li (2021), at p. 307). Section 2(1) of the Act provides that income tax shall be paid on the taxable income for each taxation year of every person resident in Canada. The Act treats each person as a tax unit; every person, including a corporation, is a separate taxpayer. While this section is general in nature, it reflects the foundational principle that taxpayers are to be taxed on their own earnings, and not the earnings of someone else (Canada v. 594710 British Columbia Ltd., 2018 FCA 166, [2019] 5 C.T.C. 1, at para. 54). Consequently, the effect of s. 111(5) becomes more clear when read in light of s. 2: s. 111(5) suggests that, at a conceptual level, when there has been an acquisition of control, and the corporations loss-generating business ceases to operate, the corporation can no longer be understood as the same taxpayer for the purpose of carrying over losses from the corporations prior operations.\nSection 111(5) Delineates the Boundaries of the Benefit-Conferring Provision, Section 111(1)(a)\nSection 111(5) operates within a scheme for carrying over non-capital losses. The foundational provisions of the Act recognize that each taxpayer is taxed based on their income and losses within a single taxation year; however, s. 111(1)(a) modifies this general rule and provides that a taxpayer can deduct non-capital losses against income in a future or prior taxation year. It served as the benefit-conferring provision which the appellant relied on to obtain its tax benefits. Without such a loss carryover rule, a taxpayer who earns high income in one year and suffers a loss in the next would face financial hardship as a result of paying tax in the first year without relief in the second (Krishna, at p. 595). The taxpayer with fluctuating income is disadvantaged compared with the taxpayer who engages in a less risky venture, paying tax over time on a more stable income. \nFrom this perspective, s. 111(5) does not operate independently, but rather serves to complement s. 111(1)(a). There is sound logic behind the ability to carry over ones losses. However, the specific purpose of s. 111(1)(a) has always been to more accurately measure income and provide relief to the individual taxpayer, accounting for fluctuating income over a period of multiple years. Amendments to this provision have broadened the ability to deduct non-capital losses (see, e.g., S.C. 1958, c. 32, s. 12(1), amending s. 27(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148), but never so as to benefit a new taxpayer who did not themselves generate the losses. Only the taxpayer who suffered the loss is entitled to deduct the loss. \nSection 111(5) ensures that this principle is given effect for corporations. While the corporation is still the same legal person after an acquisition of control, the identity of those behind the corporation has changed. Section 111(5) functions so that the tax benefits associated with those losses will not benefit a new shareholder base carrying on a new business. \nThis restriction on s. 111(1)(a) promotes consistency with other provisions within the scheme for computing income tax. In particular, s. 249(4) specifies that when an acquisition of control occurs, the corporations taxation year is deemed to have ended and a new taxation year commences. Thus, an acquisition of control severs the link between the corporations prior and post-acquisition operations. It would be incongruous with several other provisions if the Act nevertheless allowed this corporation to carry forward past losses as if the link had not been severed. \nThus, s. 111(5) serves to delineate the boundaries of s. 111(1)(a) and to promote consistency with other provisions which treat the corporation as, effectively, a new taxpayer following an acquisition of control (Li (2021), at p. 314; Strain, Dodge and Peters, at pp. 4:52-54).\nParliaments Selection of Control Tests Differs Across the Act \nThe appellant places significant emphasis on s. 256(5.1) of the Act, which defines the de facto control test. This test was adopted after the introduction of s. 111(5) and while numerous provisions were amended to either adopt or reject the de facto control test, the de jure control test in s. 111(5) was left unchanged. The appellant argues that the use of the de facto control test in other provisions indicates that Parliament turned its mind to the question of control throughout the Act . . . Parliament understood the difference between de facto and de jure control and intended that difference (A.F., at para. 64 (emphasis in original)). For the appellant, this is effectively determinative of the dispute, and reduces the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) to the de jure control test. \nIn my view, the context of the Act reveals that, when faced with a choice between de jure and de facto control as the general test, Parliament opted for de jure control. There are various reasons why Parliament would have chosen the de jure control test as the standard to be used on an application of s. 111(5), something this Court addressed in Duha Printers, at para. 58:\nIn my view, the de jure standard was chosen because in some respects it is a relevant and relatively certain and predictable concept to employ in determining control. In general terms, de jure refers to those legal sources that determine control: namely, the corporations governing statute and its constitutional documents, including the articles of incorporation and by-laws. The de facto concept was rejected because it involves ascertaining control in fact, which can lead to a myriad of indicators which may exist apart from these sources. [Emphasis in original.]\nThere is no doubt that de jure control is a clearer benchmark than de facto control, meaning greater certainty for the majority of transactions, which are not tax-motivated. De facto control, by contrast, is a broad test that can be met by mere indirect influence, and therefore does not require the existence of legally enforceable rights (s. 256(5.1); Krishna, at p. 695). Such a test would have captured a variety of situations far beyond Parliaments concern for ensuring that one taxpayer would not benefit from anothers losses. For example, there may exist significant continuity in the corporations directors and shareholders, but an onerous loan designed to help a distressed corporation reorient its business could create a relationship of dependence sufficient to trigger the de facto control test, even if the creditors influence was never exercised. Thus, when deciding between two imperfect tests, it is logical that Parliament would opt for de jure control. \nHowever, it does not follow that the provisions rationale is fully captured by the de jure control test. Rather, de jure control was the marker that offered a roughly appropriate proxy for most circumstances with which Parliament was concerned  particularly given that the GAAR exists as a last resort. To ascertain the rationale underlying s. 111(5), more is needed than the simple fact that Parliament settled on this test to operationalize its intent.\nIndeed, the rationale of s. 111(5) is illuminated by related provisions which both extend and restrict the circumstances in which an acquisition of control has occurred. These provisions suggest that de jure control is not a perfect reflection or complete explanation of the mischief that Parliament sought to address.\nThe Control Test in Section 111(5) Is Expanded and Restricted by Other Deeming Provisions\nSection 256(8) deems control to have been acquired when, for the purpose of avoiding certain provisions, a taxpayer obtains a right to, inter alia: acquire shares; cause a corporation to redeem, acquire or cancel shares; acquire or control voting rights; or cause the reduction of other shareholders voting rights (see s. 251(5)(b)). If the listed right, when exercised, would provide the taxpayer with de jure control, s. 256(8) deems control to have been acquired when the right was acquired. This subsection is notable because, although it remains focused on share-related rights, it looks beyond the standard documentation considered under the de jure control test. Instead, it assesses legal rights, including contractual agreements. Section 256(8) closes a loophole where corporations could have acquired a contractual right that, if exercised, would have enabled them to exert control over the corporation (Fiscal Statement (1980), at p. 40; G. W. Flynn, Tax Planning for Corporations with Net Capital and Noncapital Losses, in Corporate Management Tax Conference, Current Developments in Measuring Business Income for Tax Purposes (1982), 208, at p. 209). More broadly, it demonstrates that the de jure control test in s. 111(5) does not, on its own, capture the full range of situations that Parliament sought to target; rather, the test in s. 111(5) is better understood as a rough proxy that seeks to give effect to Parliaments broader aims, while offering a degree of clarity and stability in most cases.\nBy contrast, s. 256(7) deems control not to have been acquired in certain circumstances in order to give proper effect to provisions similar to s. 111(5). For example, it ensures that transfers can occur between related parties without the unused losses being denied due to a technical change in control of the corporation (A. R. A. Scace and D. S. Ewens, The Income Tax Law of Canada (5th ed. 1983), at p. 106; s. 256(7)(a) and (b)). This suggests that the identity of those who have acquired control matters when determining whether the corporation should be treated as a new taxpayer. In this way, s. 111(5) and related provisions are not merely concerned with a formal change of control: if the corporation has not changed hands, the Act recognizes the continuity between its past losses and future business endeavours. It is only when an unrelated party takes the reins that permitting loss carryovers would undermine the fundamental principles underpinning the Act and the integrity of the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a). \nI note that s. 256.1, enacted after the transactions at issue, includes a deeming rule for substantial equity acquisitions. However, consideration of a provision enacted subsequent to the transactions at issue is neither necessary nor warranted in this case (see also Oxford Properties Group, at paras. 46 and 86).  \nThe foregoing contextual analysis sheds significant light on the rationale behind s. 111(5). However, to more accurately ascertain its object, spirit and purpose, it is necessary to consider extrinsic evidence of Parliaments purpose throughout the legislative history of the provision. \nThe Purpose of the Provision \nThe legislative history behind s. 111(5) illustrates that Parliament was concerned with addressing the trading of loss corporations, which was undermining the tax base and creating inequity among taxpayers. This reflects a specific concern that fits within the Acts more general policy of prohibiting the transfer of losses between taxpayers, subject to specific exceptions (Mathew, at para. 53).  \nImportantly, a purposive analysis of s. 111(5) also demonstrates that, while the means Parliament has chosen to address these concerns has evolved over time  finally settling on de jure control  its rationale for including the non-capital loss carryover restriction in the Act has been consistent. \nThe legislative history of s. 111(5) begins in 1958. In 1958, s. 27(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 148  the precursor to s. 111(1)(a)  was amended to permit business losses to be applied to reduce income not only from the same business, but also from any other business carried on by the taxpayer (Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:42). This was a significant liberalization of the loss carryover rules; previously, business losses were deductible only against income generated in other years from the same business. \nIn the same amendment, s. 27(5)  the precursor to s. 111(5)  was added to the Act. This subsection read as follows:\n(5) Paragraph (e) of subsection (1) does not apply to permit a corporation to deduct, for the purpose of computing its taxable income for a taxation year, a business loss sustained by it in a preceding taxation year, in any case where\n(a) more than 50% of the shares in the capital stock of the corporation have, between the end of that preceding year and the end of the taxation year, been acquired by a person or persons who did not, at the end of that preceding year, own any of the shares in the capital stock of the corporation; and \n(b) the corporation was not, during the taxation year, carrying on the business in which the loss was sustained.\n\n(S.C. 1958, c. 32, s. 12(2))\nCommentary in the Senate explained that without such a restriction, it would be quite easy to purchase companies that have incurred losses and then get the benefit of the carryforward (Debates of the Senate, 1st Sess., 24th Parl., August 21, 1958, at pp. 650-51 (Hon. Gunnar S. Thorvaldson)). Put another way, the restriction was enacted for the purpose of checking the practice of trading in tax-loss corporations (H. D. McGurran, Principles of Income Tax: 2. Taxable Income from a Business (1958), 6 Can. Tax J. 455, at p. 465). At the same time, the restriction on business loss carryovers introduced by s. 27(5) could be avoided if the business in which the loss was sustained continued to be carried on (i.e., a continuity of business exception). Notably, the test Parliament adopted at the time (more than 50 percent of the shares in the corporations capital stock, acquired by one or more new shareholders in a single year) was distinct from the current marker (de jure control). \nAfter s. 27(5) was enacted, commentators were quick to identify problems and loopholes. One author, for example, described how the new carryover restriction could be circumvented with only a bit of foresight: \nIf a prospective buyer had the foresight to acquire a nominal number of shares, or for that matter, one share, before the turn of the fiscal year, then the full amount of the losses would be preserved regardless of what type of business was in future carried on. Perhaps negotiations for the purchase of loss companies are best conducted in the final weeks of their fiscal year.\n\n(C. W. Leach, Making the Most of Your Losses, in Canadian Tax Papers No. 19, Corporate Management Conference (1960), 27, at p. 29)\nIn 1963, s. 27(5)(a) was amended to refer to an acquisition of control of a corporation by a person or persons who did not control the corporation at the end of the preceding year, while still subjecting transactions that predated the amendment to the former test relating to an acquisition of 50 percent of its shares (S.C. 1963, c. 21, ss. 6(1) and (2), substituting s. 27(5)(a) and adding s. 27(5a)). At the Bills Second Reading in the House of Commons, then Minister of Finance Walter L. Gordon raised concerns about the trafficking in shares of loss companies:\nThe public, including the business public, tends to lose respect for any tax administration when advantage can be taken freely of obvious loopholes in the law . . . it seems desirable to stop some clear opportunities for tax avoidance, and I should like to mention four examples of what it is intended to do about them. \n\n. . .\n\nThe second example that I would like to mention is the one that at present provides an opportunity, under the act, for companies which incur losses in one year to carry them forward and apply them against profits earned during subsequent years. \n\nAs a result of this, a practice has developed of trafficking in the shares of companies whose businesses have been discontinued, but which technically have certain tax loss carry forward entitlements. For example, a man with a profitable business may purchase the shares of one of these companies and transfer his prosperous business to it, and having done so he can apply the losses incurred previously, and often in a quite different class of business, against the taxable income of his own business. I suggest that surely this was never the intention of parliament when the original proposal was incorporated in the act, and that this practice should be stopped. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. IV, 1st Sess., 26th Parl., October 16, 1963, at pp. 3636-37 (Hon. Walter L. Gordon))\nThe Minister of Finance later made the following statement about the provisions purpose:\nThe purpose of this clause is to prevent a company with a loss carry forward entitlement from changing hands, thus permitting a new owner to introduce into that business an entirely different business after the date of the budget, and having this entitlement applied against the profits of the new business enterprise. . . .\n\n. . .\n\n. . . This will wipe out the loss credit position if there has been a change in ownership. The reason, of course, is obvious. People with profitable businesses who were paying taxes on their profits were making a practice of acquiring companies, often shells which had nothing in them but which were in possession of a loss-carry-forward entitlement, for the purpose of applying this entitlement against their profits and thus avoiding the payment of tax. That is what this clause is intended to prevent. I am prepared to admit that in theory, certainly, if you look upon the corporation which has the entitlement as being a separate entity, it does lose its rights, where its ownership has been transferred to somebody else. However, that is the very thing we are trying to stop. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(House of Commons Debates, vol. V, 1st Sess., 26th Parl., November 1, 1963, at p. 4287 (Hon. Walter L. Gordon))\nIn 1966, the Carter Commission examined the Income Tax Act and made a variety of recommendations that were then considered by Parliament in subsequent years. It sought to explain the purpose for the restriction on loss transfers at a conceptual level:\nUnder the present tax system, the new owner of an unincorporated business does not obtain any deduction in respect of unabsorbed losses of the previous owner. The same position arises where assets of an incorporated company with unabsorbed losses are purchased. In each of these cases the purchaser is a different taxpayer from the vendor and is not permitted to utilize the losses of the vendor for tax purposes.\t\n\n. . .\n\nWe have stated our belief that a corporation should be regarded as an intermediary for the shareholders. The proposed liberal allowance of losses is not intended to be used in such a way that one taxpayer can deduct losses sustained by another and thereby defer or avoid tax liability. Accordingly, we recommend that losses should not be transferable from one taxpayer to another, and that the right to carry losses forward should be denied to a corporation where there is a change in control, either through a sale of its shares, through granting a right to acquire a controlling interest (unless the right is exercisable only on death or default of an obligation or under a first refusal arrangement) or through a statutory amalgamation. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(Canada, Report of the Royal Commission on Taxation (1966), vol. 4, at pp. 261-62)\nIn 1972, s. 27(5) was renumbered as s. 111(5). It continued to limit carryovers in the case of an acquisition of control and continued to provide a continuity of business exception. The 50% of the shares test was dropped, and s. 111(5) now referred only to an acquisition of control (S.C. 1970-72, c. 63, s. 1). The carryover restrictions were tightened through subsequent amendments (Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:42); however, this has remained the test since. \nThe foregoing legislative record demonstrates that, while Parliament has had to redefine terms in order to enforce its intention (G. W. Riehl, Incorporation and Income Tax in Canada (4th ed., 1965 at p. 69), the provision has always restricted non-capital loss carryovers upon a change in the locus of control of a corporation from one person or group to another, subject to a continuity of business exception. When a corporation changes hands, and the loss business ceases to operate, the corporation is effectively a new taxpayer who cannot avail itself of non-capital losses accumulated by the old taxpayer. The following provides a useful explanation:\nFirst and foremost, the carryover of losses following a change of control is not generally supported in tax policy terms. Normally, one taxpayer cannot avail himself of another taxpayers losses. In the case of an artificial entity such as a corporation, when its control changes it is essentially regarded as a new taxpayer, because different shareholders then become entitled indirectly to enjoy the benefits of its financial success. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:52)\nThe business continuity exception does not undermine this conclusion: while this rule may be viewed as arguably benefitting new shareholders, there is a reason for the exception. It encourages the recovery of unprofitable enterprises (Strain, Dodge and Peters, at p. 4:53), which may require a new investment by new owners. Where this occurs, the takeover has accomplished the sound commercial objective of making an unprofitable business profitable, and there is no reason why the unused pre-takeover losses should not continue to be available (P. W. Hogg, J. E. Magee and T. Cook, Principles of Canadian Income Tax Law (3rd ed. 1999), at p. 408, cited with approval in OSFC Holdings Ltd. v. Canada, 2001 FCA 260, [2002] 2 F.C. 288, at para. 91). Indeed, it suggests that those who have taken the reins were interested in strengthening the corporations business, rather than using the corporation as a vessel for unrelated activities that would have distorted its identity. Although the corporation may have changed hands, the link in continuity is preserved through a different marker: the corporations business remains consistent. Moreover, the justification for s. 111(1)(a)  to more accurately measure income and provide relief to an individual taxpayer with fluctuating income over time  remains applicable, given this continuity. This reinforces that, at its core, s. 111(5) serves to delineate the circumstances in which the basis for the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) is non-existent.\nIn sum, the legislative history behind s. 111(5) illustrates that Parliaments intended purpose was to address a specific mischief. While the means Parliament has chosen to address these concerns have evolved over time, the rationale for including the loss carryover restriction in the Act has remained consistent. \nConclusion on Object, Spirit and Purpose\nIn light of the foregoing, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. Parliament sought to ensure that a lack of continuity in a corporations identity was accompanied by a corresponding break in its ability to carry over non-capital losses. This is the rationale underlying the provision and properly explains why Parliament enacted s. 111(5). \nIn articulating the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), the Tax Court focused on the concept of effective control (para. 134), a term briefly employed by Iacobucci J. in Duha Printers (para. 36). The Federal Court of Appeal acknowledged that this wording was unclear, and replaced it with the term actual control (paras. 72-73). This arguably exacerbated the problem, and led the appellant to argue that the Federal Court of Appeal had substituted Parliaments de jure control test with an ambiguous de facto control test. The appellant proposed a formulation of the object, spirit and purpose centred on de jure control. \nRespectfully, both the lower courts and the appellant formulated the object, spirit and purpose as a legal test, rather than summarizing the rationale of the provision. This ultimately distorted their GAAR analysis. De jure control, effective control and actual control do not indicate why Parliament was concerned about an acquisition of control and the mischief it sought to address (Oxford Properties Group, at para. 101). To define the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) based on Parliaments choice of test or substitute it for another test would, in this case, result in prioritizing the means (the how) over the rationale (the why). \nIn s. 111(5), Parliament has clearly chosen a test for control: de jure control. De jure control was a reasonable marker for the situations in which a corporations identity has changed. This being so, it is primarily a means of giving effect to Parliaments aim, rather than a complete encapsulation of the aim itself. As with any provision, Parliament had to select a general test for s. 111(5) among the options available: it had good reason to select the de jure control test over a broad de facto control test, which would have captured a variety of conduct unrelated to Parliaments aims. Again, the test to apply on the straightforward application of s. 111(5) is not in dispute. However, de jure control does not, in itself, explain what was concerning to Parliament, as is amply demonstrated by a careful analysis of the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. Respectfully, my colleagues reasons conflate the means found within a provisions text (in this case, de jure control) with the provisions underlying rationale; this approach would have implications for a variety of provisions involving a control test, such that the GAAR would effectively not apply.\nBefore proceeding, I make two further comments. First, accurately setting out the object, spirit and purpose that underlies the provision does not change the applicable test within the provision. Until Parliament legislates otherwise, de jure control remains the standard for the application of s. 111(5). As I explained, within the GAAR analysis, courts are not formulating a new legal test when they determine a provisions object, spirit and purpose; rather, they seek to capture a provisions rationale, thereby providing a synthesis of what the provision was designed to achieve or prevent. Nor are courts applying the object, spirit and purpose as if it was a new bright-line test in the abuse analysis. The analysis is comparative: for a provision to be abused under a GAAR analysis, the result that the transactions achieved  transactions which have already been shown to have the primary purpose of avoiding taxes  is assessed against the provisions rationale to determine whether this rationale is frustrated (Trustco, at para. 57; Copthorne, at para. 69). \nIn this case, s. 111(5) demonstrates Parliament intended to deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take the reins of a corporation and change its business. This explains what Parliament sought to prevent through the provision, understood in light of its text, context and purpose. \nSecond, I note that contrary to my colleagues suggestion, this case does not resemble the dispute in Alta Energy, which concerned a carve-out provision in an international treaty that allocated to a persons residence state the right to tax certain capital gains for immovable property. The majority determined that through the carve-out, Canada was deliberately seeking to forego its right to tax certain capital gains because it wanted to encourage investments by Luxembourg residents in business assets embodied in immovable property located in Canada (paras. 6 and 89). The rationale for this incentive applied whether or not Luxembourg residents had sufficient economic connections or were merely residents based on formal criteria: Luxembourg was well-known for its international tax haven regime, and evidence demonstrated that Canadas national interest in attracting foreign investors, using Luxembourg as a conduit to take advantage of the carve-out, outweighed its interest in collecting more tax revenues on such capital gains (para. 87). By contrast, in this case, Parliament did not make a choice to permit loss-trading strategies, nor viewed this as an acceptable tradeoff. The existence of s. 111(5), along with Parliaments continued amendment of related provisions to extend its reach, reflects that Parliament did not intend for such a result and sought to address conduct that bore no relation to aim of the non-capital loss carryover, as is shown by an analysis of s. 111(5)s text, context and purpose.\nThe sole question in this case is whether the result of the particular series of transactions at issue is inconsistent with the rationale underlying s. 111(5). It is to this question that I now turn.\nWas There an Abuse of Section 111(5)?\nThe second stage of the abuse analysis, determining whether the transactions are abusive, is necessarily fact-intensive (Trustco, at para. 44; Oxford Properties Group, at para. 39). Thus, deference is owed to the Tax Courts factual findings (Housen, at para. 10). However, no deference is owed to the overall conclusion that there was no abuse in this case, as that conclusion was premised on an incorrect construction of s. 111(5)s object, spirit and purpose, and therefore, was based on an extricable error of law (Trustco, at para. 46). The trial judges factual findings regarding the transactions themselves continue to merit deference, absent palpable and overriding error; that being said, facts which were decisive when answering the wrong legal question are not necessarily as salient when answering the right one. Thus, these findings may be more or less relevant when the transactions are considered in light of the correct object, spirit and purpose. \nAn analysis of the transactions at issue demonstrates that their result served to frustrate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5): considering the circumstances as a whole, they achieved the outcome that Parliament sought to prevent and provided Matco with the benefits of an acquisition of control, all while narrowly circumventing the application of s. 111(5). I note that finding that a transaction falling short of de jure control has abused s. 111(5) in this case does not mean that every transaction falling short of de jure control will be found abusive of this provision. Indeed, the question is not whether Matco holds de jure control or satisfies some other test such as de facto control. As I explained, the abuse analysis is comparative: it asks courts to assess the transactions at issue in light of the provisions rationale to determine whether the result achieved by the transactions frustrates this rationale. It clearly did so here.\nThe conclusion that the series of transactions involving the appellant were abusive flows directly from a proper consideration of what s. 111(5) was designed to achieve and how the appellant circumvented that outcome. In the analysis that follows, I consider the result obtained by the transactions, with particular emphasis on (1) the fundamental transformation of the appellants identity and (2) the rights and benefits obtained by Matco.\nSection 111(5)s rationale is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. As previously explained, s. 111(5) reflects the proposition that when the identity of the taxpayer has effectively changed, the continuity at the heart of the loss carryover rule in s. 111(1)(a) no longer exists. From this perspective, the same result was achieved through the impugned transactions. Indeed, the reorganization transactions resulted in the appellants near-total transformation: its assets and liabilities were shifted to Newco, such that all that remained were its Tax Attributes. Put differently, the appellant was gutted of any vestiges from its prior corporate life and became an empty vessel with Tax Attributes. \nImportantly, the tax attributes of a loss corporation were preserved to benefit another party. Indeed, the payments agreed upon by Matco under the Investment Agreement were in contemplation of being able to financially benefit from the Tax Attributes by filling the vessel with its chosen corporate opportunity and remaining a significant equity shareholder. Such a conclusion is reinforced by the adjustment clause in the Investment Agreement. The amounts owed by Matco under the Investment Agreement were to be adjusted based on the actual value of the Tax Attributes; in this way, the consideration which Matco was to provide was tied to its ability to benefit from monetizing the Tax Attributes (arts. 2.3, 5.5(a) and 5.5(b)). \nMoreover, the shareholder base of the taxpayer underwent a fundamental shift throughout the transactions: the appellant began as a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco and ultimately became a publicly traded company advertised for a new business, with Matco as part of the new shareholder base. \nAs for its business activity, the appellant was used as the vessel for an unrelated venture planned by DKCM and selected by Matco. Thus, the only link between the appellant after the transactions and its prior corporate life was the Tax Attributes; in other respects, it was, in practice, a company with new assets and liabilities, new shareholders and a new business. Accordingly, the transactions resulted in a fundamental change in the identity of the taxpayer. The appellants continued ability to benefit from the loss carryover deductions frustrates the rationale behind Parliaments decision to sever the continuity of tax treatment in s. 111(5), particularly considering the rights and benefits obtained by Matco.\nAs I explained, the de jure control test was used as a means to implement Parliaments aims in s. 111(5) because it appropriately recognizes that obtaining majority voting shares carries with it the ability to elect the board of directors and therefore to control the management of the affairs of the corporation (Buckerfields, at pp. 302-3; Duha Printers, at paras. 35-36). Matco achieved the functional equivalent of such an acquisition of control through the Investment Agreement, while circumventing s. 111(5), because it used separate transactions to dismember the rights and benefits that would normally flow from being a controlling shareholder. Several aspects of the transactions at issue demonstrate this functional equivalence, by which I mean that Matco achieved an outcome that Parliament sought to prevent without directly acquiring the rights that would have triggered s. 111(5) (Trustco, at para. 57; Copthorne, at para. 69). \nFirst, Matco contracted for the ability to select the corporations directors. Section 3.4 of the Investment Agreement reads as follows:\n3.4 Resignation of Officers and Directors\n\nThe Parent shall exercise its best efforts to ensure that a nominee of Matco is added to the board of directors of the Subsidiary and that such nominee, as well as Charles Butt and David Goold, shall be the sole officers and directors of the Subsidiary, effective as of the Effective Time. The Parent shall exercise its best efforts to cause such directors to continue as directors of the Subsidiary until the closing of a Corporate Opportunity, at which time it shall exercise its best efforts to cause each of Charles Butt and David Goold to resign as an officer and director and provide an unconditional mutual release of all claims he or she may have against the Subsidiary and vice versa, other than claims in respect of indemnification.\n\n(A.R., vol. II, at p. 87)\nAccordingly, even without holding majority voting shares, Matco contractually required Newco, who would have control over most remaining shares at the relevant time, to ensure that the three directors of the appellant would be Butt, Goold and a director selected by Matco. This is what occurred during the election following the execution of the Investment Agreement. It thereby contractually oversaw the makeup of the board of directors. As contemplated by s. 3.4, once the corporate opportunity was found and accepted, Butt and Goold were to resign and were to be replaced with directors selected by DKCM to implement its own business activity while monetizing the appellants Tax Attributes. Again, this is precisely what occurred.\nSecond, the Investment Agreement in effect placed severe restrictions on the powers of the board of directors. The appellant was prohibited from taking a variety of actions including, but not limited to: issuing any shares, options, warrants, calls, conversion privileges or rights to acquire any shares; changing or amending its constating documents or by-laws; reorganizing, amalgamating, merging or continuing the appellant with any other legal person; taking any action relating to the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the appellant; declaring any dividends; entering into any contract in respect of the appellant; and engaging in any activity other than examining and pursuing a corporate opportunity (s. 6.1). Several of these decisions are so central to directors duties that under its governing corporate law statute, directors are not ordinarily permitted to delegate such authority to a managing director or a committee (s. 115(3) of the CBCA). The aforementioned corporate activities could only occur with the prior written consent of Matco (s. 6.1 of the Investment Agreement). \nThe restrictions in favour of Matco resemble the fettering of discretion that would normally occur through a unanimous shareholder agreement and which would lead to an acquisition of de jure control (Duha Printers, at para. 71). The only reason that s. 111(5) was not violated was due to a circuit-breaker transaction: the managing director of Matco purchased 100 shares through a holding company, 1250280 Alberta Ltd., which was not a party to the agreement in order to prevent the Investment Agreement from being signed by all shareholders. Despite this manoeuvre, the result was similar: the powers of the directors were effectively neutralized for the duration of the agreement.\nThird, the transactions allowed Matco to reap significant financial benefits. Through the transactions at issue, Matco became a significant equity owner and maintained a stake in the corporation worth $4.5 million following the IPO. However, rather than merely purchasing a majority of the voting shares, it used a separate contractual agreement to gain the functional equivalent of majority voting power prior to the fulfilment of the corporate opportunity. During this intervening period, Matco deprived Newco, the majority voting shareholder on paper, of each of the core rights that it could ordinarily have exercised. One need only examine the three traditional shareholder rights outlined in s. 24(3) of the CBCA: the right to vote at any meeting of shareholders, the right to receive any dividend declared by the corporation, and the right to receive a portion of the remaining property of the corporation on dissolution. While Newco maintained its voting rights in theory, most decisions that would normally be subject to a shareholders vote  such as a change in the corporations by-laws  could only occur with the consent of Matco (s. 6.1(b)(iii) of the Investment Agreement). Similarly, it may have had a right to dividends on paper, but any such dividends could only be declared with the consent of Matco (s. 6.1(c)(iv)). Finally, Newco may have been entitled to the appellants remaining property upon dissolution, but again, the directors were prohibited from taking such a step without Matcos approval (s. 6.1(c)(iii)). In any case, all of the appellants assets had been removed through the reorganization transactions. In this way, the appellant corporation had changed hands, but Matco obtained such a result through a series of transactions rather than through the acquisition of a majority of the voting shares in the appellant.\nIn response, the appellant argues that it remained at all times a free actor. In my view, any residual freedom under the Investment Agreement is illusory and merely reinforces how the transactions frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5). \nWhile the appellant could, in theory, refuse the corporate opportunity presented by Matco (s. 4.1 of the Investment Agreement), a careful reading of the Investment Agreement indicates that its acceptance of such an opportunity was a fait accompli.  \nFirst, the appellant was prohibited from engaging in any other activity other than studying and accepting the corporate opportunity (s. 6.1(d)). Put simply, the sole purpose for the appellants continued existence was to serve as a vessel for the corporate opportunity selected by Matco. It was therefore not in doubt that such an opportunity would be accepted. \nSecond, the consequences of refusing the corporate opportunity were severe. In particular, Matco would no longer be obligated to provide the Guaranteed Amount (s. 5.5(d)). It is worth placing these consequences in context: when the appellant sought an external opportunity, it was in dire financial stress. The money owed by Matco under the Investment Agreement, in consideration for permitting it to indirectly monetize the Tax Attributes, provided the appellant with its only lifeline. The discretion provided in s. 4.1 must be understood in light of these circumstances, which were known to the parties at the time of contracting. Indeed, they are the reason that the negotiations occurred in the first place, because the appellant was unable to benefit from the Tax Attributes on its own due to its financial situation.\nAs for the fact that Newco could sell its shares to another party if it received a higher price than Matco (ss. 5.1 and 5.2), the prospect of finding another buyer was illusory. Given that the appellant was unable to carry out any activities without Matcos consent due to the Investment Agreement, it could not reasonably be expected that a third party would value the shares higher than the price stipulated within the agreement until Matco had first found a corporate opportunity. \nOf course, Newco had the right not to sell its remaining shares at all (ss. 5.3 and 5.8), as the Tax Court recognized (paras. 159 and 164). But understood in light of the correct object, spirit and purpose, the fact that Newco could choose to keep its voting shares is consistent with the circuitous path by which the transactions circumvented s. 111(5). Regardless of whether Newco sold its shares to Matco, the actions of the appellant were already locked down by the Investment Agreement, and the core benefits of share ownership (such as the right to dividends) were negated by being subjected to Matcos approval. Furthermore, the ability to receive the Guaranteed Amount directly rather than by selling the shares to Matco (ss. 5.3 and 5.8) merely reinforces that the transactions were designed to circumvent s. 111(5). This option was important because in certain circumstances, Matcos purchase of the shares might lead to an acquisition of de jure control. The complex series of transactions and the flexibility built into the Investment Agreement were necessary only because the contracting parties sought to achieve the very mischief that s. 111(5) was intended to prevent.\nConsidering the foregoing circumstances as a whole, the result obtained by the transactions clearly frustrated the rationale of s. 111(5) and therefore constituted abuse. The object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders. The transactions achieved the very result s. 111(5) seeks to prevent. Without triggering an acquisition of control, Matco gained the power of a majority voting shareholder and fundamentally changed the appellants assets, liabilities, shareholders and business. This severed the continuity that is at the heart of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5).\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nOverview\nThis case is of profound concern to Canadian taxpayers. The legal issue before this Court is whether the investment agreement between Matco Capital Ltd., 0813361 B.C. Ltd. (Newco) and the appellant, Deans Knight Income Corporation (Investment Agreement), amounts to an abuse of s. 111(5) of the federal Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (Act), for the purposes of the general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) in s. 245 of the Act.\nIt is essential to keep in mind that the GAAR requires a careful balance between two competing interests: the interest of the taxpayer in minimizing his or her taxes through technically legitimate means and the legislative interest in ensuring the integrity of the income tax system (V. Krishna, Fundamentals of Canadian Income Tax (2nd ed. 2019), vol. 1, at p. 96). As Binnie J., dissenting, aptly warned in Lipson v. Canada, 2009 SCC 1, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 55, [t]he GAAR is a weapon that, unless contained by the jurisprudence, could have a widespread, serious and unpredictable effect on legitimate tax planning. With respect, I am of the view that both my colleague Rowe J. and the Federal Court of Appeal have failed to apply the GAAR with due restraint. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.\nI disagree with several aspects of my colleague Rowe J.s analysis. Despite Parliaments unambiguous adoption of the de jure control test in s. 111(5) of the Act, my colleague has opted for an ad hoc approach that expands the concept of control based on a wide array of operational factors. In my view, this approach invites the exercise of unbounded judicial discretion and will result in the loss-trading restrictions in s. 111(5) being applied to transactions on a circumstantial basis. Moreover, unlike my colleague, I adopt the findings of fact made by the Tax Court of Canada. For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the Tax Courts judgment.\nI proceed as follows. First, I reiterate and discuss some of the core principles of the GAAR jurisprudence, in particular, the principle that the GAAR cannot be used to override other provisions of the Act. Next, I examine the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) of the Act and describe the problems I see with my colleagues analysis. Having determined the object, spirit and purpose of the provision, I turn to the question of abuse. First, I lay out the proper standard of review. Then, applying the correct object, spirit and purpose, I conclude that the avoidance transactions at issue do not amount to abusive tax avoidance within the meaning of the GAAR. Finally, I show that even on my colleagues understanding of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), a conclusion of abuse is not available without overturning various findings of fact of the Tax Court.\nAnalysis \nThe GAAR Cannot Override Parliaments Intent\nMy colleagues approach to determining the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) fails to account for one central principle established in Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601: the GAAR does not and cannot override Parliaments specific intent regarding particular provisions of the Act. This principle is integral to the GAAR jurisprudence and should not be swept aside lightly.\nIt is a longstanding principle of tax law that every person is entitled to order their affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be (Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Duke of Westminster, [1936] A.C. 1 (H.L.), at p. 19). Of course, this principle is not absolute in the GAAR context (Lipson, at para. 21; Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, at para. 30). The GAAR is intended to negate arrangements that would be permissible under a literal interpretation of other provisions of the Income Tax Act, on the basis that they amount to abusive tax avoidance (Canada Trustco, para. 13). But this purposive flexibility is limited given that courts must contemporaneously give effect to both the GAAR and the other provisions of the Income Tax Act relevant to a particular transaction (para. 13). It is therefore inappropriate to interpret the GAAR as implying moral opprobrium regarding the actions of a taxpayer to minimize tax liability utilizing the provisions of the Income Tax Act in a creative way (Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada, 2011 SCC 63, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 721, at para. 65).\nThis is why, since Canada Trustco, this Court has repeatedly affirmed that the object, spirit and purpose analysis is essentially a form of statutory interpretation. There is but one principle of interpretation: to determine the intent of the legislator (Canada Trustco, at para. 40). The GAAR analysis rests on the same interpretive approach employed by this Court in all questions of statutory interpretation  a unified textual, contextual and purposive approach (Copthorne, at para. 70). It does not rewrite the provisions of the Income Tax Act; it only requires that a tax benefit be consistent with the object, spirit and purpose of the provisions that are relied upon (Canada Trustco, at para. 54; Alta Energy, at para. 96). The GAAR analysis merely seeks to determine a different aspect of the statute than in other cases (Copthorne, at para. 70).\nSince the GAAR analysis is little more than a specialized form of statutory interpretation, the central issue must be determining Parliaments intent (Canada Trustco, at para. 40). It should not be assumed that the GAAR, as a provision of last resort (Canada Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66), plays a role in every transaction and in every context. Sometimes, the GAAR is meant to address the complexity of transactions which fall outside the scope of specific anti-avoidance provisions (Lipson, at para. 47). Other times, Parliament drafts a specific anti-avoidance rule with clear objectives in mind. Applying the GAAR in this latter context would undermine Parliaments policy choices. Therefore, when it is said that the GAAR is a provision of last resort, this means only that it is not designed to be Parliaments first and primary anti-avoidance measure  nothing more.\nI agree with my colleague that there is no bar to applying the GAAR in situations where the Act specifies precise conditions that must be met to achieve a particular result, as with a specific anti-avoidance rule (para. 71). The GAAR can indeed supplement a specific anti-avoidance rule; to say otherwise would ru[n] contrary to this Courts jurisprudence (Rowe J.s reasons, at para. 72). However, this Court has already acknowledged that a provisions text can sometimes be conclusive because it is consistent with and fully explains [the provisions] underlying rationale (Copthorne, at para. 110). So while I agree with my colleagues assertion that the analysis is case specific (para. 71), I find it incorrect and unhelpful to definitively and universally declare that technical, carefully drafted provisions are not immune from abuse (para. 72), even though Copthorne, which case he cites, specifically acknowledges the very possibility that the underlying rationale of a provision could be no broader than the text itself. That said, I find instead that it is more fruitful to consider when the text is conclusive or not.\nThe key question is whether Parliament specifically intended to prevent or permit a certain type of transaction. Where Parliament has specified precisely what conditions must be satisfied to achieve a particular result, it is reasonable to assume that Parliament intended that taxpayers would rely on such provisions to achieve the result they prescribe (Canada Trustco, at para. 11). Although this is not determinative, where it can be shown that an anti-avoidance provision has been carefully crafted to include some situations and exclude others, it is reasonable to infer that Parliament chose to limit their scope accordingly (Minister of National Revenue v. Landrus, 2009 FCA 113, 392 N.R. 54, at para. 47). Therefore, drafting precision is a key factor in revealing whether or not the GAAR may supplement a specific anti-avoidance rule. This follows from the core principle that the GAAR analysis is a species of statutory interpretation: it cannot be used to effectively rewrite a provision.\nWith respect, my colleague applies the GAAR in a way that not only ignores but also disregards this core principle. He states that the rationale behind a provision must be distinguished from the means used to give effect to that rationale (para. 59). According to him, it is essential to look to the drafting process as it reflects the task of translating government aims into legislative form in order to create intelligible, legally effective rules (para. 59). The necessary implication that flows from my colleagues reasoning is that Parliament is unable to translate its objectives into effective means; the best it can do is choose text that is most faithful to its objectives (para. 59 (emphasis added)). In my view, Parliament often intends to do precisely what it actually does. If Parliament crafts a provision carefully, courts should pay close attention to the means chosen and not simply assume that Parliament drafted the provision incompetently.\nIn Alta Energy, this Court affirmed the notion of foreseeability as another important tool to gauge Parliaments specific intent (para. 82). Sometimes, the absence or presence of a specific anti-avoidance provision can be an enlightening contextual and purposive element that sheds light on Parliaments intent (para. 82). If Parliament did not or could not have foreseen the tax strategy employed by the taxpayer, it is more likely that a gap in the legislation is unintentional, and the GAAR can be applied to avoidance transactions that exploit that gap (para. 82). The GAAR was intended to catch unforeseen tax strategies (para. 80) and to allow Parliament to stay one step ahead of ingenious and innovative tax avoidance schemes.\nBut if Parliament drafts a specific anti-avoidance provision in a way that keeps a highly foreseeable gap open, the gap is more likely to be intentional, and relying on it should not be considered abusive for the purposes of the GAAR. In Alta Energy, this Court declined to use the GAAR to introduce a sufficient substantive economic connections test into the residency requirement of a tax treaty between Canada and Luxembourg. The GAAR did not apply because Canada and Luxembourg made a deliberate choice to leave the business property exemption unguarded in the treaty (para. 82). In other words, the GAAR cannot be used to punish taxpayers for walking through a door that Parliament intentionally left open.\nMy colleague is essentially applying the same reasoning that this Court expressly rejected in Alta Energy. In that case, my colleague, together with Martin J., dissenting, characterized the relevant articles of the treaty broadly, stating that any other interpretation renders the GAAR meaningless (para. 133). In their view, no inference [could] be drawn from the absence of an anti-avoidance rule designed to counter the particular scheme employed in this case (para. 150). Thus, the absence of specific anti-avoidance rules . . . sheds little light on [the provisions] underlying rationale (para. 150). According to the dissent in Alta Energy, drawing such an inference would be patently contrary to this Courts repeated holding that the GAAR is a provision of last resort, and can only find application where no other provisions of the Act do (para. 150, citing Canada Trustco, at para. 21; Copthorne, at para. 66). In other words, the dissenting view in Alta Energy was that, because the GAAR is a provision of last resort, it has a role to play in each and every case.\nMy colleague follows the same reasoning in this case. He discerns an object, spirit and purpose that conflicts with Parliaments adoption of a well-established legal test: de jure control. In his view, Parliaments chosen control test in s. 111(5) of the Act is of little import. Instead, the provisions underlying rationale allows the Minister of National Revenue to apply s. 111(5) in a way that overrides Parliaments specific intent. Simply stated, this approach is contrary to this Courts holding in Canada Trustco. It impermissibly elevates the role of the GAAR and enables the Minister to selectively override Parliament. This is not what the GAAR was intended to do.\nThe Text, Context and Purpose of Section 111(5)\nI agree with much of my colleagues analysis of the text, context and purpose of s. 111(5). However, I disagree with his conclusion that the provisions rationale is to deny unused losses to unrelated third parties who take the reins of a corporation and change its business (para. 118). The analysis below addresses this issue, focusing on the concept of control as this is the main source of disagreement between my colleague and me.\nI begin my analysis with the observation that s. 111(1)(a) of the Act allows taxpayers to deduct non-capital losses for the purpose of computing taxable income for a taxation year. This general rule is restricted by s. 111(5). Upon an acquisition of control, s. 111(5) prevents a corporation from carrying over losses unless the business, carried on by the corporation subject to the change of control, is continued for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit. Thus, the general loss deductibility provision  s. 111(1)(a)  sets out the default rule subject to the restrictions found in s. 111(5), with exceptions in specific circumstances. Section 111(5) is a specific anti-avoidance rule that limits what would otherwise be permissible deductions under s. 111(1)(a) (D. G. Duff et al., Canadian Income Tax Law (7th ed. 2023), at pp. 205-6; T. E. McDonnell, Legislative Anti-Avoidance: The Interaction of the New General Rule and Representative Specific Rules, in Report of Proceedings of the Fortieth Tax Conference (1989), 6:1, at p. 6:18). It bars corporate acquisitions for the singular purpose of accessing tax attributes by restricting the use of those attributes if accessed through the exercise of control. The acquisition of control test and the business continuity requirement are, properly construed, narrow exceptions to the anti-avoidance provision.\nIt follows that the restrictions on loss carryovers in s. 111(5) are triggered when control of a corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons. Control is therefore central to how s. 111(5) functions. The parties in this case disagree as to whether a change of control for the purpose of s. 111(5) is signalled through an acquisition of de jure control or de facto control.\nThe Notion of De Jure Control\nControl is not defined in the Act. However, courts have considered this concept on a number of occasions and have determined that control for the purposes of the Act means de jure control. In Buckerfields Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1965] 1 Ex. C.R. 299, the Exchequer Court of Canada held that de jure control refers to the ownership of a sufficient number of shares to have a majority of votes in the election of the corporations board of directors.\nThe principle established in Buckerfields was affirmed by this Court in Duha Printers (Western) Ltd. v. Canada, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 795. In that case, Iacobucci J. stated that in assessing de jure control, one must consider the corporations governing statute, the share register of the corporation and any specific or unique limitation on the majority shareholders power to control the election of the board of directors, as manifested in either the corporations constating documents or a unanimous shareholder agreement. Iacobucci J. also made it clear that external documents are not relevant to determining de jure control (para. 85). Thus, the voting power attributable to shareholdings, ascertained in light of the corporations constating documents and share register, is generally the determinative factor for de jure control.\nIt is useful to recall the rationale for this approach. In Duha Printers, Iacobucci J. distinguished external agreements from a corporations constating documents on the basis that the latter create de jure control because they restrain the ability of shareholders to exercise their voting power freely (paras. 65 and 71). He commented at length on the peculiar character of unanimous shareholder agreements, stating that they are a corporate law hybrid, part contractual and part constitutional in nature (para. 66). Significantly, Iacobucci J. noted that corporate law offers remedies, such as compliance orders, that effectively enforce rights and obligations under the statutes of a corporation, including a unanimous shareholder agreement. It is important to point out that a compliance order is analogous to a judgment for specific performance (Corporations Act, R.S.M. 1987, c. C225, quoted in Duha Printers, at para. 13; K. P. McGuinness, Canadian Business Corporations Law (3rd ed. 2017), at 22.301).\nThe only exception to the general rule discussed above is found in cases like Minister of National Revenue v. Consolidated Holding Co., [1974] S.C.R. 419, where the capacity of shareholders to act is limited by a trust instrument. In Duha Printers, Iacobucci J. commented on the distinction between a trust instrument and other external documents for the purposes of assessing de jure control, noting that [a] trust imposes upon the trustee a fiduciary obligation to act within the terms of the trust instrument and for the benefit of the beneficiary (para. 49). In light of such fiduciary duties, Iacobucci J. concluded that trust instruments limit the capacity of trustees who hold shares to act as free actors (para. 49).\nIn contrast to a corporations constating documents, external agreements give rise to obligations that are contractual and not legal or constitutional in nature (Duha Printers, at para. 59). Consequently, any limitations imposed by such agreements are limitations freely agreed to by the shareholders, and not at all inconsistent with their de jure power to control the company (para. 49). Although such agreements do not have an impact on de jure control, they remain relevant in assessing de facto control. This is because control in fact is based on the ability to exercise direct or indirect influence over the corporations voting shareholders (Silicon Graphics Ltd. v. Canada, 2002 FCA 260, [2003] 1 F.C. 447, at para. 67). As such, there are a broader range of factors  beyond voting power determined in light of constating documents and the share register  that have the potential to establish de facto control. De facto control thus captures everything that de jure control does not.\nThe Binary Nature of Control: De Jure and De Facto Control\nThe legal distinction between constating documents of a corporation and external agreements exposes the binary nature of control, which can be either de jure or de facto. While the former give rise to legal powers over a corporation, the latter do not, such that the distinction between de jure and de facto control goes to the dichotomy between power and influence. The breach of a corporations constating documents entitles a complainant to seek a compliance order requiring adherence to the corporate constitution (e.g., Corporations Act, quoted in Duha Printers, at para. 13). In contrast, external agreements do not bind the corporation in the same way: shareholders remain free to exercise de jure control even if an outside agreement exists to limit actual or de facto control (Duha Printers, at para. 49). Consequently, the distinction between de jure and de facto control lies in the breadth of factors that can be considered in determining who has control over the corporation.\nIn light of the case law, Parliament has clarified the concept of control in order to reach specific legislative goals. Since September 13, 1988, when s. 256(5.1) was introduced, the Act has been clear as to which provisions refer to the concept of de jure control as opposed to those that involve, rather, the application of de facto control. The use of the phrase controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever specifically refers to de facto control, which exists when a party has direct or indirect influence over the corporation which can result in control in fact. This change illustrates the intentionality with which Parliament prescribes control tests, bearing in mind the distinction between de jure and de facto control.\nThe deeming rule found in s. 256(8) of the Act is another indication that Parliament maintained and did not abandon the acquisition of  de jure control test in s. 111(5). Rather than replacing the de jure control test, Parliament extended the definition of de jure control to include contingent and future rights to shares under s. 256(8)  but de jure rights nonetheless. Section 256(8) applies when a person acquires certain rights (enumerated in s. 251(5)(b)) in respect of a corporations shares and deems the person to be in the same position in relation to the control of the corporation as if the rights had been exercised. Once it is determined that a person has rights under s. 251(5)(b), the de jure control test is applied in relation to those shares. Accordingly, s. 256(8) measures voting power on the basis of shareholdings and captures option agreements that, if exercised, would provide de jure control. It does not capture operational-level factors that relate to a companys management.\nIn addition to the above, the advantages of using a bright-line test are instructive of Parliaments rationale in selecting a test like de jure control. Clearly defined rules are essential in banking and commercial transactions because they reduce costs related to litigation and promote predictability by allowing all parties to know their rights and obligations in advance. As this Court said in Duha Printers, a simple test such as that which has been followed since Buckerfields is most desirable. If the distinction between de jure and de facto control is to be eliminated at this time, this should be left to Parliament, not to the courts (para. 52). This is a test that has been recognized and built upon by Parliament (para. 52).\nThe importance of creating transactional certainty and minimizing costs is heightened in the context of a provision that applies exclusively to non-capital losses. Using a more ambiguous hybrid test would pose commercial risks for parties looking to invest in companies with accrued losses (i.e., risks of reassessment, litigation). In turn, discouraging investments of this type would hinder the rehabilitation of Canadian businesses and undermine economic growth as a whole.\nIn short, Iacobucci J. in Duha Printers took a purposive approach to interpreting the word control. Interpreted literally, control could mean any type of influence over a corporation (para. 35). Nevertheless, Iacobucci J. concluded that the general purpose of s. 111(5)  preventing the transfer of non-capital losses from one corporation to another  does not expand the meaning of de jure control (para. 88). Therefore, even prior to the adoption of the GAAR, one thing was clear: Parliament intended the acquisition of de jure control  and only the acquisition of de jure control  to trigger the application of s. 111(5). To this day, Parliament continues to rely upon the distinction between de jure and de facto control. And despite my colleagues suggestion to the contrary, the GAAR cannot eliminate this distinction.\nConclusion on the Object, Spirit and Purpose of Section 111(5)\nIn light of the above, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to restrict the use of tax attributes if accessed through an acquisition of de jure control. A textual, contextual and purposive analysis of the relevant provisions reveals that Parliament never intended courts to consider factors other than those related to share ownership.\nRelying on Alta Energy, my colleague accepts that the GAAR cannot be used to restrict certain types of tax avoidance strategies if Parliament demonstrates a clear rationale to permit loss-trading strategies or view[s] [a chosen regime] as an acceptable tradeoff (para. 119). In his mind, s. 111(5) does not meet these criteria because Parliament did not make a choice to permit loss-trading strategies (para. 119). I strongly disagree. As discussed above, Duha Printers was not based on a literal interpretation of s. 111(5). Understanding the term control purposively, this Court found that Parliament specifically intended to allow certain types of legal relationships that create de facto control without resulting in a change of de jure control (paras. 52 and 58). My colleague does not appreciate that Parliament has incorporated a judicially developed meaning of control into the provision.\nMy conclusion echoes this Courts decision in Canada Trustco, which my colleague is unable to distinguish from this case. The key issue in that case was the definition of cost for the purpose of s. 20(1) of the Act. McLachlin C.J. and Major J., writing for the Court, noted that cost is a well-understood legal concept that is carefully defined by the Act and the jurisprudence (para. 75). In this context, they held that nothing in the GAAR or the object of the [capital cost allowance] provisions . . . permits [this Court] to rewrite them to interpret cost to mean amount economically at risk (para. 75).\nThe same can be said with respect to the concept of control. Indeed, Parliaments intent has not changed since Duha Printers. As discussed earlier in these reasons, Parliament has always relied on the de jure and de facto control tests. In 1988, Parliament legislated the concept of de facto control into s. 256(5.1) of the Act (Lyrtech RD Inc. v. The Queen, 2014 FCA 267, 2015 D.T.C. 5054, at para. 36). The deeming rule found in s. 256(8) is based and builds upon the notion of de jure control. These provisions show that Parliament has expressly decided to maintain the distinction between de jure and de facto control and continues to rely on it. I do not see how any amendments to the control tests have tarnished the core logic that this Court accepted in Duha Printers. This being so, the GAAR cannot override Parliaments intent; it must give effect to it.\nIn sum, a change in control is the singular event that triggers the loss-trading restrictions found in s. 111(5). The notion of control is therefore central to the operation of s. 111(5), and any object, spirit and purpose that omits it lacks coherence. In my opinion, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to deny the use of specified losses of a corporation if a person or group of persons has acquired de jure control of that corporation.\nMy colleague concedes that Parliament has opted for de jure control. But to his mind, more is needed than the simple fact that Parliament settled on this test to operationalize its intent (para. 94 (emphasis in original)). He contends that the de jure control test in s. 111(5) does not, on its own, capture the full range of situations that Parliament sought to target; rather, the test in s. 111(5) is better understood as a rough proxy that seeks to give effect to Parliaments broader aims (para. 96 (emphasis in original)). There is only one difficulty with this position, but it is a major one: it completely ignores how Parliament actually defined what constitutes an acquisition of control. With respect, this is wholly inconsistent with this Courts jurisprudence on interpreting the object, spirit and purpose of a provision under the GAAR.\nMy colleague also tries to downplay the importance of the so-called means of s. 111(5) by omitting the control test from the provisions rationale. In his view, describing the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) based on Parliaments choice of test would result in prioritizing the means (the how) over the rationale (the why) (para. 115 (emphasis in original)). Ironically, his own abuse analysis illustrates how Parliaments chosen test is central to s. 111(5)s rationale. While he refuses to formulate the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) as a legal test, my colleague cannot articulate the provisions rationale without referring to the concept of acquisition. What is an acquisition? It is merely a synonym for control.\nDespite correctly pointing out that de jure control remains the standard for the application of s. 111(5), my colleague introduces the notion of functional equivalence (paras. 117 and 128). This novel concept treats the Investment Agreement as a constating document for the purposes of control (para. 122). The nuance lost on my colleague is that constating documents and external agreements are enforced in radically different ways. That being so, an ordinary contract can never be functionally equivalent to a constating document. In this regard, I see no difference between my colleagues approach and the Federal Court of Appeals actual control test. Both ignore the rationale behind the de jure and de facto control tests and erode the distinction between them.\nThe jurisprudence is clear that the GAAR cannot be invoked to override Parliaments clear intent. It seems to me, however, that this is what my colleague is doing in this case. Indeed, his approach departs from what is otherwise Parliaments clear articulation of a de jure control test for restricting losses under s. 111(5). Beyond this, my colleague introduces the novel and unprecedented concept of functional equivalence, which has no known boundaries. With respect, this approach illustrates the potential overriding power of the GAAR, as cautioned against in Canada Trustco.\nAbuse Analysis\nStandard of Review\nMy colleague and I agree that whether an avoidance transaction constitutes a misuse or abuse of a provision is a question of mixed fact and law that is reviewable for palpable and overriding error. I cannot agree, however, with his observation that a trial judges factual findings regarding the transactions may be more or less relevant when the transactions are considered in light of the correct object, spirit and purpose (para. 121 (emphasis in original)). With respect, this suggests that it is open to appellate courts to disregard key findings of fact in GAAR cases.\nFindings of fact and inferences drawn from those facts can be set aside only if it is established that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in reaching those findings and drawing those inferences (Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 23). Absent a palpable and overriding error, an appellate court cannot reweigh the facts or evidence before the trial court. This is true in any appeal, including one involving the GAAR. I therefore fail to understand why this case in particular warrants the application of a standard less strict than the palpable and overriding standard.\nWhether an avoidance transaction is abusive is a fact-intensive inquiry that raises a question of mixed fact and law (Canada Trustco, at para. 44). Absent an extricable error of law, the application of the law to the facts is subject to the standard of palpable and overriding error. I note in passing that questions of contractual interpretation are subject to the same deferential standard of review (Sattva Capital Corp. v. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, at para. 50). As discussed below, it is my view that no such error exists in this case.\nThe Avoidance Transactions Do Not Amount to an Abuse of Section 111(5)s Object, Spirit and Purpose\nAs stated above, the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5) is to restrict the use of tax attributes if accessed through an acquisition of de jure control. Since de jure control is an essential element of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5), the key question at this stage is whether Matco acquired de jure control of Deans Knight.\nBefore turning to this question, it should be noted that the relationship between Matco and Deans Knight is the proper focus of the abuse analysis. My colleague seems to imply that the disclosure in the prospectus relating to the foreseeable tax risks associated with the loss transfer is somehow relevant (paras. 21 and 49). However, the Minister did not argue that a change of control occurred as a result of the initial public offering (IPO): he argued that a change of control occurred as a result of the avoidance transactions between Matco and Deans Knight. Therefore, given that the prospectus was in connection with the IPO, the disclosure to which my colleague refers is irrelevant here. In any case, disclosures of this kind are commonly included in securities offerings and continuous disclosure documents and are not indicative that a transaction is motivated by abusive tax avoidance.\nTurning now to the question of abuse, I am of the opinion that the Tax Courts decision was based on a combination of findings of fact and an interpretation of the Investment Agreement that is supported by the evidence. According to the Tax Courts factual findings, Matco did not acquire effective control of Deans Knight. I see no reviewable error in this conclusion.\nThe Tax Courts conclusion was largely based on an interpretation of the Investment Agreement and on credibility findings. First, the debenture purchased by Matco under the Investment Agreement was convertible into no more than 35 percent of the voting common shares of Deans Knight (2019 TCC 76, [2019] 4 C.T.C. 2001, at para. 21). At no point did Matco own or have a right to own enough shares to reach a majority shareholder position. Thus, the only key question is whether the evidence supports the contention that Matco had de jure control over the remaining shares of Deans Knight (para. 157).\nMy colleague claims that Matco acquired the functional equivalent of de jure control through the Investment Agreement (para. 128). He goes to great lengths to underscore that [t]he restrictions in favour of Matco resemble the fettering of discretion that would normally occur through a unanimous shareholder agreement and which would lead to an acquisition of de jure control (para. 132). In his view, those restrictions were so severe that they effectively neutralized Deans Knights board of directors (para. 132). He therefore concludes that Deans Knights status as a free actor was illusory (para. 134); that its acceptance of the corporate opportunity presented by Matco was a fait accompli (para. 135); that the possibility of Newco receiving a higher price for its shares from a third party was illusory (para. 138); and that Newco would receive the same money even if its remaining shares in Deans Knight were not sold shows that the transactions were designed to circumvent s. 111(5) (para. 139).\nIn my view, the Investment Agreement is of no relevance to de jure control. In Duha Printers, this Court stated that, contrary to unanimous shareholder agreements, voting agreements give rise to contractual obligations that are neither legal nor constitutional in nature (para. 59). Despite this, my colleague treats the Investment Agreement as sufficient for establishing de jure control. Again, the problem with his conclusion is that external agreements cannot be functionally equivalent to constating documents.\nBut moving past this initial hurdle, my colleagues approach fails to accord proper deference to the Tax Courts factual findings. The Tax Court focused on s. 5.8 of the Investment Agreement, which says that [Newco] shall not be required to sell any of the Remaining Shares prior to or during the Guarantee Period or at any other time (T.C.C. reasons, at para. 59). The Tax Court found that this term was not a sham or inconsistent with any other rights in the agreement (para. 60). This conclusion was supported by the other terms of the Investment Agreement, which did not give Matco control over the sale of the remaining shares (para. 61) or require that Matco present third parties with a sale opportunity for those shares (para. 62).\nThese findings were supported by oral testimony. David Goold (Deans Knights Chief Financial Officer) testified that Newco believed it had a choice whether or not to accept Matcos offer to purchase the remaining shares (T.C.C. reasons, at paras. 64 and 162-64). The Tax Court considered the restrictive aspects of the Investment Agreement (paras. 156 and 161) but preferred the testimony of Deans Knights witnesses. Put simply, the Tax Court made credibility findings. Credibility findings can be interfered with only if a palpable and overriding error is demonstrated (Housen, at paras. 10-15 and 19-25). Since the Tax Courts factual assessment was not tainted in any way by its characterization of s. 111(5), I see no reason why its findings should be overturned.\nI see several serious problems with my colleagues conclusion that the prospect of Newco selling its shares to another party was illusory (para. 138). First, my colleague suggests that share ownership is somehow less relevant to the abuse inquiry under s. 111(5). Indeed, he states that [r]egardless of whether Newco sold its shares to Matco, the actions of the appellant were already locked down by the Investment Agreement, and the core benefits of share ownership (such as the right to dividends) were negated by being subjected to Matcos approval (para. 139). This suggests that a shareholders right to dividends is somehow relevant to the analysis, but this line of reasoning misses the fact that Parliaments test for control is squarely focused on voting rights arising from ownership. The right to dividends is irrelevant here. Indeed, it is not unusual for a company to issue shares without declaring dividends. The only relevant incidence of ownership is voting power  something that the Investment Agreement did not take away.\nBut putting that aside for a moment, the logical inconsistency in my colleagues argument shows how voting power is indeed very much relevant to the question on appeal. My colleague finds that the prospect of Newco finding another buyer was illusory, but he asserts that his conclusion is consistent with the circuitous path by which the transactions circumvented s. 111(5) (para. 139). If the question of whether Newco had the right to retain its shares is irrelevant, why does it matter that this right was illusory? Clearly, share ownership is a decisive factor in my colleagues analysis (para. 121).\nUltimately and with respect, my colleagues argument is an attempt to re-weigh the evidence considered by the Tax Court. The issue of whether Newco retained the right not to sell its remaining shares is a question of mixed fact and law. The Tax Court held that Newcos right to retain its shares was bona fide and certainly not a sham. Re-characterizing this right to support the notion that Newco and Deans Knight were intending to abuse s. 111(5) is manifestly counter to the Tax Courts finding. Considering that my colleague has pointed us to no palpable or overriding error in the Tax Courts assessment of the evidence, his conclusion requires overturning a key finding of fact made by the Tax Court.\nMy colleague defends his approach by stating that the Tax Courts finding is tainted by its mischaracterization of the object, spirit and purpose of s. 111(5). He seems to suggest that the Tax Courts finding of fact can be discounted as it was only relevant to answering the narrow question of whether Matco had acquired control over the majority of the voting shares of the appellant. However, this is simply not the case: the Tax Court accept[ed] Goolds testimony that Newco believed it had the choice whether to accept Matcos offer for the Remaining Shares or not (para. 164). This is a specific credibility finding on the point that the appellant remained a free actor throughout the transactions. Unlike my colleague, I therefore fail to see how the Tax Courts mischaracterization of s. 111(5) tainted this important credibility finding.\nEven if my characterization of s. 111(5)s object, spirit and purpose is wrong and the object, spirit and purpose of this provision is instead to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit of new shareholders (Rowe J.s reasons, at para. 113), the appeal should still be allowed.\nIn my view, Matco did not really acquire Deans Knight in any practical sense. The Ministers submissions focused on Matco, and the Tax Court held that Matco was only a facilitator of the transactions (para. 152). The Tax Court found that there was no trade or transfer of non-capital losses. Matco did not use Deans Knights non-capital losses for its own benefit (para. 152). The post-IPO shareholders were the only ones that directly received the benefits of ownership. At best, one could argue that the Investment Agreement locked down Deans Knight so that Matco could market it for a subsequent acquisition. However, it requires a great leap in logic to infer that Matco acquired Deans Knight. Such a leap would create uncertainty as to what exactly constitutes abuse: at what point does tak[ing] the reins of a corporation result in the acquisition of that corporation (Rowe J.s reasons, at para. 118)? Under my colleagues approach, the existence of abusive tax avoidance is, at best, unclear. In such circumstances, the benefit of the doubt goes to the taxpayer (Canada Trustco, at para. 66).\nFor these reasons, I am of the view that the avoidance transactions did not frustrate the rationale of s. 111(5). There was therefore no abuse, and consequently, I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Tax Court of Canada.\n\nAPPENDIX\nIncome Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)\n\n2 (1) An income tax shall be paid, as required by this Act, on the taxable income for each taxation year of every person resident in Canada at any time in the year.\n(2) The taxable income of a taxpayer for a taxation year is the taxpayers income for the year plus the additions and minus the deductions permitted by Division C.\n(3) Where a person who is not taxable under subsection 2(1) for a taxation year\n(a) was employed in Canada,\n(b) carried on a business in Canada, or\n(c) disposed of a taxable Canadian property,\nat any time in the year or a previous year, an income tax shall be paid, as required by this Act, on the persons taxable income earned in Canada for the year determined in accordance with Division D.\n\n3 The income of a taxpayer for a taxation year for the purposes of this Part is the taxpayers income for the year determined by the following rules:\n(a) determine the total of all amounts each of which is the taxpayers income for the year (other than a taxable capital gain from the disposition of a property) from a source inside or outside Canada, including, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the taxpayers income for the year from each office, employment, business and property,\n(b) determine the amount, if any, by which\n(i) the total of\n(A) all of the taxpayers taxable capital gains for the year from dispositions of property other than listed personal property, and\n(B) the taxpayers taxable net gain for the year from dispositions of listed personal property,\nexceeds\n(ii) the amount, if any, by which the taxpayers allowable capital losses for the year from dispositions of property other than listed personal property exceed the taxpayers allowable business investment losses for the year,\n(c) determine the amount, if any, by which the total determined under paragraph (a) plus the amount determined under paragraph (b) exceeds the total of the deductions permitted by Subdivision E in computing the taxpayers income for the year (except to the extent that those deductions, if any, have been taken into account in determining the total referred to in paragraph (a), and\n(d) determine the amount, if any, by which the amount determined under paragraph (c) exceeds the total of all amounts each of which is the taxpayers loss for the year from an office, employment, business or property or the taxpayers allowable business investment loss for the year,\nand for the purposes of this Part,\n(e) where an amount is determined under paragraph (d) for the year in respect of the taxpayer, the taxpayers income for the year is the amount so determined, and\n(f) in any other case, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have income for the year in an amount equal to zero.\n\n111 (1) For the purpose of computing the taxable income of a taxpayer for a taxation year, there may be deducted such portion as the taxpayer may claim of the taxpayers\n(a) non-capital losses for the 20 taxation years immediately preceding and the 3 taxation years immediately following the year;\n. . .\n(5) Where, at any time, control of a corporation has been acquired by a person or group of persons, no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending before that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending after that time and no amount in respect of its non-capital loss or farm loss for a taxation year ending after that time is deductible by the corporation for a taxation year ending before that time except that\n(a) such portion of the corporations non-capital loss or farm loss, as the case may be, for a taxation year ending before that time as may reasonably be regarded as its loss from carrying on a business and, where a business was carried on by the corporation in that year, such portion of the non-capital loss as may reasonably be regarded as being in respect of an amount deductible under paragraph 110(1)(k) in computing its taxable income for the year is deductible by the corporation for a particular taxation year ending after that time\n(i) only if that business was carried on by the corporation for profit or with a reasonable expectation of profit throughout the particular year, and\n(ii) only to the extent of the total of the corporations income for the particular year from that business and, where properties were sold, leased, rented or developed or services rendered in the course of carrying on that business before that time, from any other business substantially all the income of which was derived from the sale, leasing, rental or development, as the case may be, of similar properties or the rendering of similar services;

and whether a series of financial maneuvers to reap tax benefits can be challenged under Canada's general anti-avoidance rule.\n\n**Background:**\nDeans Knight Income Corporation (the Appellant), a Canadian corporation, activated non-capital losses and other tax attributes to reduce its tax liability through an intricate agreement with Matco, a venture capital company. The Respondent, Her Majesty the King, argued that these actions contravened specific provisions of the Income Tax Act, including section 245 (GAAR) and section 111(5), which restricts non-capital loss carryovers for corporations if control has been acquired by unrelated parties.\n\n**Court Proceedings:**\nThe trial judge initially found that while Deans Knight's transactions were indeed for tax avoidance purposes resulting in a benefit, they did not constitute abusive behavior. However, on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, it was determined that these transactions were abusive and thus subject to GAAR. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately upheld this decision with one dissenting judge. It ruled that Deans Knight's actions circumvented section 111(5) by achieving functional control through an investment agreement without technically acquiring control.\n\n**Legal Principle:**\nA transaction or series of transactions may be denied their associated tax benefits if they are deemed avoidance transactions frustrating the object, spirit, or purpose of relevant provisions within the Income Tax Act.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Rowe concludes that Deans Knight's maneuvers frustrated Parliament's intent behind s. 111(5) - preventing unrelated parties from acquiring corporations solely to utilize unused losses against income from another business for new shareholders' benefit - thereby upholding GAAR's application in this case and providing crucial guidance on corporate tax planning strategies' limits under Canadian law.", "citation": "2023 SCC 16", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court upholds a decision  by the Minister of National Revenue to deny tax deductions to a British  Columbia-based company that engaged in abusive tax avoidance.</strong> <em></em>\r\n   In 2007, Forbes Medi-Tech Inc. (now  Deans Knight Income Corporation) was a British Columbia-based drug research and  nutritional food additive business in financial difficulty. It had accumulated  approximately $90 million of unclaimed non-capital losses and other tax  credits. Non-capital losses are financial losses resulting from carrying on a  business that spends more than it makes in a given year. Under the <em>Income Tax Act </em>(the Act), a taxpayer can  reduce their income tax by deducting non-capital losses from its taxable income.  If the taxpayer does not use all, or a portion, of the loss in the year it  incurred it, they may carry the loss back three years, or forward 20 years.  However, under section 111(5) of the Act, when another entity acquires control  of the company, the new owners may not carry over those non-capital losses and  deduct them from its future taxes, unless the company continues to operate the  same or a similar business. Deans Knight wanted to use its  non-capital losses but did not have sufficient income against which to offset them.  In early 2008, it entered into a complex investment agreement with venture  capital firm Matco Capital Ltd, to help it become profitable. The agreement was  drafted in a way that ensured Matco did not acquire control of Deans Knight by  becoming the majority shareholder because that would trigger the restriction on  carrying over losses under section 111(5) of the Act. However, in effect, Matco  gained considerable influence over Deans Knight\u2019s business affairs. It found a  separate mutual fund management company that would use Deans Knight as a  corporate vehicle to raise money through an initial public offering. That money  would then be used to transform Deans Knight into an investment business. This  was attractive to Deans Knight because it could make use of its non-capital  losses to shelter most of the new business\u2019 portfolio income and capital gains. The business plan was successful.  When Deans Knight filed its tax returns for 2009 to 2012, it claimed nearly $65  million in non-capital losses and other tax credits, thereby reducing its tax  liability. However, the Minister of National Revenue (the Minister) reassessed  Deans Knight\u2019s tax returns and denied the deductions. The company appealed that  decision to the Tax Court of Canada. The Tax Court found that Deans  Knight gained a tax benefit through a series of transactions that it concluded  primarily for tax avoidance purposes, but that the transactions did not amount  to an abuse of the Act, namely section 111(5). The Minister appealed to the  Federal Court of Appeal, which held that the transactions were abusive. It  applied the \u201cgeneral anti-avoidance rule\u201d (GAAR) under the Act to deny Deans Knight\u2019s  tax deductions. The GAAR operates to deny tax benefits flowing from  transactions that comply with the literal text of the Act, but that  nevertheless constitute abusive tax avoidance. Deans Knight appealed to this  Court. The Supreme Court  has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The transactions went against the rationale  of section 111(5) of the Income Tax Act and amounted to abusive tax avoidance.</strong>\r\n     Writing for  the majority, Justice Rowe decided the transactions were abusive and the GAAR  applied to deny Deans Knight\u2019s tax benefits. Despite complying with the literal  text of a provision in the Act, a transaction is abusive if it frustrates its  rationale. Justice Rowe said the rationale behind section 111(5) of the Act is  to prevent corporations from being acquired by unrelated parties in order to  deduct their unused losses against income from another business for the benefit  of new shareholders.

Many considered his comments to be derogatory of transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals. H, a gay man, teacher, and former president of a large teachers union in the province, was prominent among the dissenting voices and made statements to media. H called Ns views bigoted, transphobic, and hateful; accused him of undermining safety and inclusivity for transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ students in schools; and questioned whether he was suitable to hold elected office.\n\tN sued H for defamation. H then applied to have Ns defamation action dismissed as a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) under s. 4 of British Columbias Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA). The chambers judge allowed the application and dismissed the action. He held both that H had a valid fair comment defence and that the value in protecting his expression outweighed the resulting harm done to N. The Court of Appeal disagreed on both counts and reinstated the action.\n\tHeld (Cote J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Karakatsanis, Rowe, Martin, Jamal and OBonsawin JJ.: The chambers judge did not err in concluding that the public interest weighing exercise mandated dismissal of the underlying action or that N failed to adequately challenge the validity of Hs fair comment defence. Accordingly, his order dismissing the defamation action should be restored.\n\tSection 4 of the PPPA creates a pretrial screening mechanism that instructs a judge to dismiss an action arising from expression on a matter of public interest unless the plaintiff can satisfy the judge that their action has substantial merit (s. 4(2)(a)(i)); the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding (s. 4(2)(a)(ii)); and the harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendants expression is serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting that expression (s. 4(2)(b)). A s. 4 application first requires the defendant to prove that the proceeding arises from expression that relates to a matter of public interest (s. 4(1)), at which point the onus shifts to the plaintiff under s. 4(2). The order in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is at the discretion of the court, but the court must dismiss the proceeding if the plaintiff does not meet its onus as to either s. 4(2)(a) or 4(2)(b). Section 4 is nearly identical to the pretrial screening mechanism established by subss. (3) and (4) of s. 137.1 of Ontarios Courts of Justice Act: the core feature of both laws is the recognition that even claims with substantial merit will be dismissed where the public interest in preserving free debate outweighs the harm to the plaintiff that the litigation purports to address. Given the substantial similarity between the laws, the Courts interpretation of s. 137.1 in 1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 SCC 22, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 587, and Bent v. Platnick, 2020 SCC 23, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 645, applies with equal force to s. 4 of the PPPA.\n\tUnder s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA, on one side of the public interest weighing exercise, the factor to be considered in favour of the public interest in continuing the proceeding is the likely harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendants expression. Although general damages are presumed in defamation law, the weighing exercise prescribed by s. 4(2)(b) requires that the harm to the plaintiff be serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendants expression. While the presumption of damages can establish the existence of harm, it cannot establish that the harm is serious. \n\tTo succeed on the weighing exercise, a plaintiff must provide evidence that enables the judge to draw an inference of likelihood of harm of a magnitude sufficient to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendants expression. Moreover, the legislation requires some evidence that enables the judge to infer a causal link between the defendants expression and the harm suffered. Where the defendant is not the only one speaking out against the plaintiff, inferring a causal link between the defendants expression and the harm suffered by the plaintiff becomes both more important and more difficult. In the instant case, given the dearth of evidence from N on harm, the chambers judge did not err in concluding that N had adduced almost no evidence of damage suffered as a result of Hs statements.\n\tThe harm relevant to the public interest weighing exercise is harm to the plaintiff caused by the defendants statements, not by the plaintiffs inability to sue. The loss of a right to sue is a possible outcome of the public interest weighing exercise, not an input. In the instant case, the Court of Appeals consideration of a chilling effect flowing from a plaintiffs inability to pursue a defamation claim turns the concept on its head. The Courts freedom of expression jurisprudence addresses the concern that the possible imposition of a legal penalty would cause speakers to refrain from commenting on matters of public interest. Instead, the Court of Appeal held that the inability to inflict a legal penalty on H would chill Ns expression and those of others who wish to express unpopular views. There is no chilling effect in barring potential plaintiffs from silencing their critics and collecting damages through a defamation suit.\n\tThe other side of the weighing exercise evaluates the public interest in protecting the defendants expression. In making this assessment, s. 2(b) Charter jurisprudence grounds the level of protection afforded to the defendants expression in the nature of the expression. Similarly, s. 15(1) considerations may factor into the weighing analysis. As the Constitution recognizes, not all expression is created equal, and the level of protection to be afforded to any particular expression can vary widely according to the quality of the expression, its subject matter, the motivation behind it, or the form through which it was expressed. The closer the expression lies to the core values of s. 2(b), including truth-seeking, participation in political decision-making and diversity in the forms of self-fulfillment and human flourishing, the greater the public interest in protecting it.\n\tSome speakers seek to contribute to public discourse by countering ignorant or harmful expression with an informed or compassionate response. In s. 2(b) jurisprudence, this idea of counter-speech inheres in the recognition that the open exchange of ideas is a precondition to unlocking the value of free expression. While counter-speech is not necessarily a complete solution to harmful expression, its close proximity to the values at the core of s. 2(b) is beyond doubt. Counter-speech motivated by the defence of a vulnerable or marginalized group in society also engages the values at the core of s. 15(1); namely, the equal worth and dignity of every individual. Targets of degrading expression belonging to a vulnerable group in society may lack the ability or authority to effectively combat the harmful speech themselves. Discourse can then take on an uneven quality, making protective counter-speech by the group or individuals more powerful advocates all the more influential and important.\n\tIn the instant case, Hs expression is counter-speech motivated by a desire to promote tolerance and respect for a marginalized group in society. H spoke out to counter expression he perceived to be untrue, prejudicial towards transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, and potentially damaging to transgender youth. The transgender community is undeniably a marginalized group in Canadian society. The history of transgender individuals in Canada has been marked by discrimination and disadvantage. Transgender and other gender non-conforming individuals were largely viewed with suspicion and prejudice until the latter half of the 20th century, and have been stereotyped as diseased or confused simply because they identify as transgender. Significant legal advancements in transgender rights have only come in the last 35 years, with most change taking place in the last decade, and judicial recognition of the plight of transgender individuals in Canada is growing in the wake of legislative progress. Yet, despite some gains, courts and tribunals have recognized that transgender people remain among the most marginalized in Canadian society, and continue to live their lives facing disadvantage, prejudice, stereotyping, and vulnerability.\n\tHs counter-speech fell close to the core of s. 2(b). His expression served a truth-seeking function, and in speaking out, he sought to counter expression that he and others perceived to undermine the equal worth and dignity of marginalized groups. There is a great public interest in protecting Hs freedom of speech on such matters. The subject matter of Hs speech (commenting on the value of a government initiative, the need for safe and inclusive schools, and the fitness of a candidate for public office), the form in which it was expressed (solicited by the media to present a counter-perspective within an ongoing debate), and the motivation behind it (to combat discriminatory and harmful expression and to protect transgender youth in schools) are all deserving of significant protection. The chambers judges conclusion that the public interest in protecting Hs expression outweighed the public interest in remedying the harm to N should be affirmed.\n\tThe chambers judge also did not err in concluding that N failed to challenge the validity of the fair comment defence. Section 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA provides that a court must make a dismissal order unless the plaintiff satisfies the court that there are grounds to believe that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding. The fair comment defence is premised on the idea that citizens must be able to openly declare their real opinions on matters of public interest without fear of reprisal in the form of actions for defamation. The fair comment defence has five elements: the comment must be on a matter of public interest; be based on fact; be recognisable as a comment; satisfy an objective test (could any person honestly express that opinion on the proved facts?); and the speaker cannot be actuated by express malice. Consideration of the elements of the fair comment defence requires an assessment of the defamatory words used in the full context surrounding their use.\n\tIn the instant case, N failed to adequately challenge the fair comment defence. First, N has not shown grounds to believe that Hs statements lacked a factual basis. To constitute fair comment, a factual basis for the impugned statement must be explicitly or implicitly indicated within the publication itself or the facts must be so notorious as to be already understood by the audience. There is, however, no requirement that the facts support the comment, in the sense of confirming its truth. At trial, H need not demonstrate that N is bigoted, transphobic, or promoted hatred, as the question is merely whether the statement can be tethered to an adequate factual basis so the reader can be an informed judge. Ns original online post could provide the requisite factual basis for most statements at issue, as Ns views were available to readers and grounded Hs statements. Additionally, this was a high-profile local controversy that spanned over a year, involving two public figures. Ns statements had likely achieved a level of notoriety such that they would have been known to the reading audience.\n\tFurthermore, the chambers judge was entitled to find that the sting of Hs statements was comment and it would have been understood as such by readers. For expression to constitute fair comment, the statement must be one that would be understood by a reasonable reader as a comment, rather than a statement of fact. Context is essential in distinguishing comment from fact. N has not shown grounds to believe that Hs statements would not be seen as a comment in the context of the instant case. An allegation of bias or prejudice is a debatable assertion as to a state of mind and will typically be classified as a comment. Similarly, an allegation that a politician has not lived up to their obligations is generally understood to be a critique, not a declaration of fact. Finally, accusations of hate speech would not necessarily be understood by ordinary readers as referring to a Criminal Code offence. Such allegations have permeated public discourse in a way that well exceeds their narrow meaning within the legal system. It is clear, when read in context, that Hs statements were an expression of Hs beliefs based on his own interpretation of Ns statements.\n\tFinally, the chambers judge did not err in his malice assessment. A finding of a subjective honest belief negates the possibility of finding malice; such a finding can be based on the thrust of the defendants evidence, read as a whole. Ultimately, the chambers judge found that Hs affidavit made it clear that he honestly believed the views he espoused, and he was entitled to do so.\n\tPer Cote J. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. The question is not whether the Court agrees with either partys expression, but whether Ns action should be dismissed at this early stage of the proceeding. It should not. N deserves to have his day in court.\n\tThere is disagreement with the structure of the majoritys analysis, which begins with the public interest weighing exercise and then examines the validity of Hs fair comment defence. That is not how the analysis must be conducted. When an application is brought under s. 4 of the PPPA, the plaintiff in the proceeding must first overcome a merits-based hurdle by demonstrating that there are grounds to believe that the proceeding has substantial merit and demonstrating that there are grounds to believe that the applicant under the PPPA has no valid defence in the proceeding. Only then should the court conduct the public interest weighing exercise mandated by s. 4(2)(b), which is the final step of the analysis. In asserting that the order in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is at the discretion of the court, the majority is effectively ignoring the Courts recent decision in Pointes, and undermining the legislative objective behind s. 137.1 of Ontarios Courts of Justice Act and s. 4 of the PPPA alike, namely, to ensure that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim.\n\tUnder s. 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding. The standard is not a very demanding one: it requires showing that there is a basis in law and in the record for finding that there is no valid defence, taking into account the stage of the proceeding at which the application is brought. To succeed, the plaintiff does not have to establish that the defendant has no valid defence for every impugned statement; it suffices that a valid defence is unavailable for some statements or even only one. For this reason, it is important to examine the defamatory sting and the context of each of the impugned statements in order to assess the availability of a defence. This is particularly critical where a fair comment defence is being advanced. Assessing the availability of such a defence requires a careful review of the impugned statement in the context of the publication in which it appeared to determine whether it is recognizable as a comment rather than as a statement of fact.\n\tThere is a difference between comment or criticism and allegations of fact. A defining feature of a comment is that it is generally incapable of being proven. Similarly, a comment must be clearly recognizable as such and not be so entangled with allegations of fact that inferences cannot be distinguished from facts. Any ambiguity in this regard must benefit the plaintiff. The inquiry is an objective one aimed at discerning the perception of the reasonable viewer or reader. The chambers judge cursorily examined this issue. He concluded that the impugned statements could not be distinguished from those in WIC Radio v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, which were found to be comments. Characterizing speech as a comment or as a statement of fact involves a contextual analysis, the result of which is at most a finding of mixed law and fact. Transposing a finding of mixed law and fact to another case is a questionable practice that should be avoided.\n\tIn the instant case, there are grounds to believe that the fair comment defence is not available for two of Hs statements because they were made as statements of fact and not comments. Those statements carry the defamatory sting that N engaged in hate speech. Affirming that N engaged in hate speech is quite different from expressing a judgment or making a remark incapable of proof. Read in their context, such allegations appear similar to allegations of fraud, theft or other criminal conduct that have been found to be statements of fact for which a fair comment defence is not available.\n\tAt the public interest hurdle under s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA, what is required of a plaintiff is not to prove harm or causation but only to provide evidence for the judge to draw an inference of likelihood in respect of the existence of the harm and the relevant causal link. The seriousness of the harm can be inferred from the gravity of the impugned statements, and allegations of hate speech rank high on the scale of seriousness. Regardless of whether such conduct is characterized as a criminal offence or as the subject matter of a human rights complaint, accusing a person of hate speech or promoting hatred against an identifiable group is extremely damaging to that persons reputation.\n\tThe absence of an apology is another aggravating factor increasing harm, as is the stature of the defendant. The greater the reputation of the defendant, the greater the impact that defamation can be expected to have on the plaintiff. In addition, the context of the publication and the platform on which the impugned statements were published should have been considered. The anonymity offered by the Internet, combined with the increased accessibility and information sharing, can result in greater harm to a persons reputation. Moreover, it is an error to discount the part played by a defendant in a plaintiffs harm because others had expressed similar criticism towards the plaintiff. A definitive determination of a defendants part in a plaintiffs harm is not required at this stage of the proceeding. Further, the fact that a plaintiff was not silenced by a defendants statements does not negate any harm suffered.\n\tThe role of the court in the public interest weighing exercise under the PPPA is not and should not be to evaluate the soundness of the parties respective positions on an issue. Freedom of expression is content-neutral and would be seriously undermined if the outcome of the weighing exercise depended on the alignment between the views expressed by the defendant and those held by the court. The majority follows an improper path of reasoning when it justifies reinstating the chambers judges dismissal order on the basis that Hs expression promotes equality. Equality is not one of the competing values at play under legislation designed to discourage SLAPPs; the protection of individual reputation and freedom of expression are. Moreover, the promotion of equality is not one of the core values underpinning freedom of expression. Assigning any role to the promotion of equality in the assessment of the public interest in protecting expression goes against the doctrine of content neutrality embraced by the Court in its jurisprudence. More importantly, the promotion of equality is in no way a factor tethered to the text of s. 4(2)(b), and for this reason alone, is not a relevant factor in the public interest weighing exercise.\n\tFinally, restricting the availability of tort actions for defamation can have a chilling effect. In the context of defamatory counter-speech, interpreting s. 4 of the PPPA so as to deprive defamed parties who have suffered serious harm of their day in court could very well be detrimental to public debate. It could prevent those who hold controversial or unpopular views from entering the public arena to share them. This conclusion does not turn the concept of chilling effect on its head. The deprivation, through a court order, of a partys right to vindicate a legitimate claim imposes a legal penalty on that party.\n\tIn the instant case, the chambers judge erroneously ignored factors aggravating the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by N, despite the fact that they were specifically argued by him. In addition, he gave little consideration to the competing public interests and failed to direct his mind to the quality of the expression, which constitutes a reviewable error. The chambers judge also erred in failing to consider the chilling effect that the dismissal of Ns claim might have on future expression by others. The harm likely to have been or to be suffered by N strongly militates in favour of allowing the proceeding to continue, and the public interest in allowing Ns claim to proceed to trial outweighs the public interest in protecting Hs expression.\nCases Cited\nBy Karakatsanis J.\n\tApplied: WIC Radio Ltd. v.

Each is essential to maintaining a functional democracy. This appeal presents an opportunity to clarify the proper equilibrium between these two values where the expression at issue relates to a matter of public interest. \nDefamation suits are a way to vindicate an individuals personal or professional reputation in the face of attack, but can have the undesirable effect of suppressing the open debate that is the cornerstone of a free and democratic society. For this reason, certain provincial legislatures have targeted strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs), or actions that disproportionately suppress free expression on matters of public interest. This case concerns the application of s. 4 of British Columbias anti-SLAPP statute, the Protection of Public Participation Act, S.B.C. 2019, c. 3 (PPPA).\nThe defamation suit at the heart of this proceeding arises out of a high-profile public debate  spanning traditional print media, the internet, rallies, protests, and a local election  on British Columbias efforts to combat discrimination against transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ youth. \nThe parties are both local public figures. Barry Neufeld, a public school board trustee in Chilliwack, British Columbia, made online posts criticizing a provincial government initiative designed to equip educators to instruct students about gender identity and sexual orientation. Mr. Neufelds posts triggered significant local controversy, spurring protests and calls for Mr. Neufeld to resign. Many considered his comments to be derogatory of transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals. Glen Hansman, a gay man, teacher, and former president of the British Columbia Teachers Federation (BCTF), a large teachers union in the province, was prominent among the dissenting voices and made statements to media. Mr. Hansman called Mr. Neufelds views bigoted, transphobic, and hateful; accused him of undermining safety and inclusivity for transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ students in schools; and questioned whether he was suitable to hold elected office. \nMr. Neufeld sued for defamation. Mr. Hansman then applied to have Mr. Neufelds defamation action dismissed as a SLAPP under s. 4 of the PPPA. The core feature of the PPPA is that it instructs courts to dismiss even meritorious claims where the public interest in protecting the defendants freedom of expression outweighs the public interest in remedying the harm done to the plaintiff. It also requires the plaintiff to meet a merits threshold by demonstrating grounds to believe that the underlying proceeding has substantial merit and that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding.\nThe chambers judge found that Mr. Neufelds defamation action had the effect of unduly suppressing debate on matters of public interest and dismissed the suit (2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205). The chambers judge held both that Mr. Hansman had a valid fair comment defence and that the value in protecting his expression outweighed the resulting harm done to Mr. Neufeld. The Court of Appeal disagreed on both counts and reinstated the action (2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217). \nI agree with the chambers judge. Mr. Neufeld argued in the courts below and in this Court that he only criticized a policy; he never expressed hatred towards the transgender community, nor did his words create an unsafe school environment for transgender students. But his submissions miss the mark. Mr. Neufelds right to criticize a government initiative is not in dispute. Rather, the central issue is whether Mr. Hansman had a right to respond to Mr. Neufeld in the way he chose without the threat of civil liability. In my view, he did.  \nThe fair comment defence asks whether a person could honestly hold the views Mr. Hansman expressed and whether Mr. Hansmans statements related to a matter of public interest and were recognizable as comments based on facts. The chambers judge found that Mr. Neufeld did not adequately challenge any of these elements and he was entitled to dismiss the proceeding on this basis. \nEven if Mr. Neufeld had discharged his burden as to the fair comment defence, however, the chambers judge was entitled to dismiss the defamation claim because the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression is not outweighed by the limited harm to Mr. Neufeld. Mr. Hansmans words were not a disproportionate or gratuitous response to Mr. Neufelds statements, and there is a substantial public interest in protecting his counter-speech. Mr. Hansman spoke out to counter expression that he and others perceived to be discriminatory and harmful towards transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ youth  groups especially vulnerable to expression that reduces their worth and dignity in the eyes of society and questions their very identity. Not only does protecting Mr. Hansmans expression preserve free debate on matters of public interest, it also promotes equality, another fundamental democratic value. \nI would restore the order of the chambers judge dismissing the defamation action. \nBackground\nThe public debate from which this appeal arises centered on provincial efforts to promote inclusion and counter discrimination against transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ people in schools. In 2016, British Columbia amended its Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, to include a prohibition against discrimination based on gender identity or expression. Gender identity refers to ones deeply felt and inherent sense of self in relation to gender, or the social system of roles, behaviours, and expressions associated with sex at birth. Gender identity is distinct from gender expression, which refers to the way one outwardly expresses gender, through clothes, behaviour, speech, pronouns, and more. While gender was once understood only in the binary of male or female, today, societys understanding of gender has broadened to encompass a spectrum of gender identities, modes of expression, and related terminology, all of which continue to evolve. \nTransgender people are individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex assigned to them at birth. In April 2022, Canada became the first country in the world to publish census data on transgender and non-binary people. The census estimated that, as of May 2021, there were over 100,000 transgender or non-binary people aged 15 and older in Canada  about 1 out of every 300 people.\nShortly after British Columbias amendment to its Human Rights Code in 2016, the Ministry of Education ordered school boards in British Columbia to add gender identity or expression as a prohibited ground of discrimination in their student codes of conduct. The Ministry also collaborated with others, including the BCTF, to develop Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 123 (SOGI 123), an initiative to guide educators on instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity. The aim of SOGI 123 is to foster inclusion and respect for students who, because of their identity or expression, may face discrimination in British Columbia schools. \nMr. Neufeld publicly criticized SOGI 123. His first critique was posted on Facebook on October 23, 2017. In it, he called SOGI 123 a weapon of propaganda that teaches the biologically absurd theory that gender is not biologically determined, but is a social construct (A.R., vol. III, at p. 16). He also lamented that children were being taught that heterosexual marriage is no longer the norm (p. 16). He voiced his support for traditional family values and heralded countries like Russia and Paraguay, which have had the guts to stand up to these radical cultural nihilists (p. 16). He acknowledged that he posted at the risk of being labelled a bigoted homophobe, but felt his voice needed to be heard (p. 16).\nMr. Neufelds post was met with quick and forceful criticism. Within hours, major media outlets reported on the post, quoting members of the public, educational professionals, and other public figures denouncing Mr. Neufelds views. The former chair of the Vancouver School Board called for Mr. Neufeld to resign and apologize. The Chilliwack District Parent Advisory Council chair said that Mr. Neufelds comments promote the exclusion and isolation of a growing subset of children, including those with same-sex parents and transgender students in contravention of Mr. Neufelds duty to ensure a safe and positive learning environment for all (A.R., vol. III, at p. 144).\nMr. Hansman was among Mr. Neufelds more vocal critics. At issue in this appeal are 11 publications quoting statements made by Mr. Hansman to the media in his capacity as president of the BCTF. Mr. Hansman has admitted making the statements as alleged (Chambers Judges Reasons, at para. 44).\nThe first three were published the day after Mr. Neufelds Facebook post, when Mr. Hansman was contacted by the media for comment. An article by the Vancouver Sun included the following quote: \n[Mr. Neufeld] should step down or be removed . . . . \n\nIts not OK. The public school system in this province and in Canada have the obligation to ensure safe and inclusive school environments for all kids regardless of race, nationality, or religion. They have to proactively address sexism and misogyny, they have to address transphobia and homophobia and racism. \n\nAnd Mr. Neufeld, Im doubtful that Mr. Neufeld did not know that. Im doubtful that hes not aware if hes been around as a trustee for some time. \n\n(Amended notice of civil claim, A.R., vol. I, p. 80 (ANCC), at para. 14) (Statement 1) \nThen, in an interview with Global News, Mr. Hansman described Mr. Neufelds views as intolerant, bigoted and stated that whether [Mr. Neufeld] likes it or not, members of the LGBTQ school community are here to stay (ANCC, at para. 15) (Statement 2).\nFinally, a Huffington Post article reported that Mr. Hansman said Neufeld should resign because he ha[d] violated his obligations as a school board trustee to ensure that students and staff have a safe, inclusive environment (ANCC, at para. 16). This article also reported that Hansman said trustees with faith-based views need to figure out how theyll work in a secular public school system or should look to work elsewhere (ANCC, at para. 16) (Statement 3).\nOthers contributed to the chorus of public critiques condemning Mr. Neufelds Facebook post, including the president of the British Columbia School Trustees Association, other members of the Chilliwack School Board, transgender activists, and the Minister of Education, who called Mr. Neufelds views outdated and bigoted (A.R., vol. III, at p. 169). Many people posted statements of opposition or statements of support on Mr. Neufelds Facebook page. \nTwo days after his post, Mr. Neufeld issued a public apology on his Facebook page, in which he stated that he was critical of an educational resource, not individuals and that he believe[s] in inclusion and a safe learning environment for all students (C.A. Reasons, at para. 12).\nBut that was not the end of the matter. Both Mr. Neufeld and Mr. Hansman continued to express themselves publicly during the next year. Others also continued to speak out against Mr. Neufeld.\nAbout a month after his original post, Mr. Neufeld spoke at a rally organized by a group called Culture Guard, which has a mandate to end the political tyranny of politically-correct idiotology (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 70). As part of its efforts, Culture Guard seeks to STOP SOGI 123 (p. 87). During his speech, Mr. Neufeld described SOGI 123 as an institutionalization of codependency: encouraging and enabling dysfunctional behavior and thinking patterns and as coddling and encouraging what I regard as the sexual addiction of gender confusion (A.R., vol. V, at p. 10). He claimed that using SOGI 123 resources in classrooms amounts to [g]aslighting and an attack [on] the foundation of a childs being which is child abuse (p. 10).\nMr. Neufelds remarks at the rally were not limited to SOGI 123. He also commented that gender is . . . rooted in biology, and lamented that media coverage of famous transgender individuals has spurred a new fad of gender confusion (p. 11). He stated that rushing into the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and gender reassignment [is] child abuse and referred to gender reassignment surgery as lopping off perfectly good body parts (pp. 10-11).\nIn January 2018, the Chilliwack Teachers Association (CTA) passed a motion of non-confidence in the Chilliwack Board of Education for its failure to intervene in the wake of Mr. Neufelds statements about SOGI 123. In a letter to the media, the CTA cited growing concerns for the emotional and physical safety of students, staff and teachers (A.R., vol. IV, at p. 157). Mr. Hansman was quoted in the letter as stating that: [s]ometimes our beliefs, values, and responsibilities as professional educators are challenged by those who promote hatred (ANCC, at para. 20) (Statement 4). That letter was published in two local newspapers. \nSubsequently, the Chilliwack School Board and the Minister of Education asked Mr. Neufeld to resign from office. He refused and issued a press release declaring that he supports all students, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, or background. He concluded:\nI have simply taken issue with one facet of the SOGI 1-2-3 learning resources; the teaching of the controversial gender-fluid theory as fact. Despite the pressure to resign, I believe that I must remain on the Board to be a lonely voice protecting impressionable children who I believe will be confused and harmed, resulting in increased occurrences of gender dysphoria in at-risk children.\n\n(A.R., vol. V, at p. 18)\nGender dysphoria is a clinical diagnosis received by some transgender and other gender diverse people. It denotes an aversion to some or all of [the] physical characteristics or social roles associated with the sex one was assigned at birth.\nAt the end of January 2018, the BCTF and the CTA jointly filed a complaint against Mr. Neufeld in the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, alleging that Mr. Neufeld had violated British Columbias Human Rights Code. The complaint alleges that Mr. Neufeld created a discriminatory work environment for union members, and published statements that are discriminatory or are likely to expose transgender individuals to hatred (A.R., vol. II, at p. 116). The local branch of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) had filed a similar complaint against Mr. Neufeld and the Chilliwack School Board earlier that month. \nIn April 2018, Mr. Hansman was interviewed by various media outlets about the teachers human rights complaint. In one article, Mr. Hansman is quoted as calling Mr. Neufelds comments transphobic and alleging that Mr. Neufeld was creating a school environment for [BCTF] members and students that is discriminatory and hateful (ANCC, at para. 24) (Statement 5). In another, Mr. Hansman is quoted as saying that Mr. Neufeld tip toed quite far into hate speech and did not fulfill his duty to ensure student safety (para. 25) (Statement 6). A third article said the human rights complaint referred to Mr. Neufelds comments as hateful and that they created an unsafe school environment, and quoted Mr. Hansman as stating that Mr. Neufeld should not be anywhere near students (para. 26) (Statement 7). \nAlso in April, duelling rallies were held outside the BCTF office, one supporting SOGI 123 and another, organized by Culture Guard, against it. When interviewed by media about the rallies, Mr. Hansman said he was glad to see the public show of support for SOGI 123, given the hateful comments made by Mr. Neufeld and the need for schools to be free from discrimination and safe for all students (ANCC, at para. 28) (Statement 8).\nAs the October 2018 Chilliwack civic election approached, Mr. Hansman was interviewed by media about his thoughts on an anti-SOGI slate of candidates vying for seats on the Chilliwack School Board. In September, an article was posted by a local news outlet quoting Mr. Hansman as stating:\nIt is extremely problematic to have somebody who is running as a school trustee continuing to spread hate about LGBTQ people  especially trans people . . . .\n\n(ANCC, at para. 29) (Statement 9)\nMr. Hansman also commented that racism and misogyny still exist in the British Columbia school system, and that trustee candidates need to commit to eradicating those things, not spreading hate and not spreading bigotry (A.R., vol. II, at p. 34). The article did not name Mr. Neufeld or any other candidate, but noted that some candidates had shared controversial views surrounding issues like refugees and LGBTQ supports in schools (p. 33).\nOne month before election day, counsel for Mr. Neufeld wrote to Mr. Hansman demanding that he retract the statements he had made over a number of months about Mr. Neufeld (A.R., vol. II, at p. 139). The letter stated that proceedings would be launched unless a retraction and an apology were received within 10 days.  \nThe next day, Mr. Neufeld declared that he was suing Mr. Hansman for defamation in an interview with a local news outlet. Counsel for Mr. Hansman wrote to Mr. Neufeld, explaining that Mr. Hansman would not be issuing an apology, given that interview. The letter contended that the request for an apology was insincere at best, and most likely a political ploy given that, as Mr. Neufeld was demanding an apology as a way to avoid litigation, he was simultaneously declaring his intention to proceed with that litigation (A.R., vol. II, at pp. 147-48).\nEight days before election day, Mr. Neufeld filed and served his defamation action against Mr. Hansman. The media picked up on the lawsuit and contacted Mr. Hansman for comment. Mr. Hansman told a local newspaper that he stood by his statements and that, along with Mr. Neufelds remarks about SOGI 123, [h]is other misogynist and problematic statements reported by Press Progress are also cause for alarm and not becoming of a school trustee (ANCC, at para. 42) (Statement 10).\nThe Press Progress article to which Mr. Hansman was referring was entitled This Man is Probably The Worst School Trustee in British Columbia (A.R., vol. II, at p. 46). In addition to describing Mr. Neufelds campaign against SOGI 123, the article included screenshots of other past Facebook posts by Mr. Neufeld, including one in which Mr. Neufeld contended that male seminal fluid is [o]ne of the most under-rated natural anti-depressants for women (p. 49). He claimed that women who regularly have unprotected sex are happier and less suicidal than women who have protected sex, sharing a link to an article about a controversial study that had found the same. The Press Progress article quoted another Facebook post in which Mr. Neufeld wrote that he and other trustee candidates are worried about the safety of children who are being taught silly ideas that they can choose what gender they can be and are being told that they must approve of gay rainbow families (p. 50). Mr. Neufeld criticized Christian churches for being slow to stand up against this evil agenda and claimed that more tolerant churches were infected with Pink Christianity (p. 50). \nMr. Neufeld was re-elected to another term on the Chilliwack School Board. Mr. Hansman was interviewed about the results of the election, where he spoke about the human rights complaint the BCTF had filed against Mr. Neufeld, and declared that [h]ate and bigotry have no place on school boards (ANCC, at para. 44) (Statement 11).\nMr. Neufelds defamation action was set for hearing in December 2019. In March, the PPPA was enacted. Mr. Hansman moved under s. 4 of the PPPA to dismiss Mr. Neufelds defamation action against him. Section 4 creates a pretrial screening mechanism that instructs a judge to dismiss an action arising from expression on a matter of public interest unless the plaintiff can satisfy the judge that their action has substantial merit; the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding; and the harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendants expression is serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting that expression.\nProcedural History\nBritish Columbia Supreme Court, 2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205 (Ross J.)\nThe chambers judge granted Mr. Hansmans application for dismissal. He concluded that Mr. Neufeld had not established grounds to believe that Mr. Hansman had no valid defences in the proceeding (para. 135). He held that Mr. Hansman had a valid fair comment defence, relying on this Courts reasoning in WIC Radio Ltd. v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, and on the lack of a compelling challenge to the defence by Mr. Neufeld (paras. 126 and 137). \nIf he was wrong as to the validity of the fair comment defence, the chambers judge considered the final step of his analysis: the public interest weighing exercise (paras. 144 et seq.). He determined that the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression outweighed the harm likely suffered by Mr. Neufeld (para. 145). Mr. Neufeld had submitted almost no evidence of damage suffered (para. 161), nor did he offer any evidence that would allow the judge to draw a causal link between any alleged harm and Mr. Hansmans statements (paras. 147-50 and 158). \nThe chambers judge considered that many of Mr. Hansmans statements either commented on the need for safe and inclusive schools or did not mention Mr. Neufeld. Those statements deserved significant protection. The weighing exercise thus favoured dismissing the action (para. 160).\nCourt of Appeal for British Columbia, 2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217 (Willcock, Fenlon and Voith JJ.A.)\nFenlon J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal, allowed the appeal and reinstated the defamation action. She concluded that the chambers judge erred in his assessment of the fair comment defence in several ways. The chambers judge erred in relying on WIC Radio, given material differences between that case and this one, and by work[ing] from a summary of the type of comments made by Mr. Hansman rather than addressing the specific expressions (paras. 26-27 and 34). This analytical approach caused the chambers judge to overlook elements of the fair comment defence (paras. 27-29). In Fenlon J.A.s opinion, there were grounds to believe that several statements were not based on fact, making the defence unavailable. Fenlon J.A. further held that the chambers judge erred in his assessment of malice. \nFenlon J.A. also concluded that the chambers judge erred in the public interest weighing analysis. First, the chambers judge focused on the subject matter of Mr. Hansmans statements to the exclusion of the defamatory sting of those statements (paras. 61-62). Second, the chambers judge erred in his harm analysis by fail[ing] to give full effect to the presumption of damages in defamation and wrongly assum[ing] causation would be difficult to establish because others had made similar comments about Mr. Neufeld (para. 51). \nFinally, Fenlon J.A. held that the chambers judge ought to have considered as part of the weighing analysis the potential chilling effect on future expression by the plaintiff, or others in his position, about this or other highly charged matters of public interest that might occur if the action were dismissed (para. 65). \nAnalysis\nThis appeal presents two issues:  \nDid the chambers judge err in the weighing exercise set out in s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA by concluding that the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression mandates dismissal of the underlying action?\n\nDid the chambers judge err in finding that Mr. Neufeld did not show, under s. 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA, grounds to believe Mr. Hansman had no valid fair comment defence? \nAnswering either of these questions in the negative would result in the dismissal of the action. I would answer no to both. The Court of Appeal should not have overturned the chambers judges findings on the fair comment defence. More significantly, even if Mr. Neufeld had disproved the validity of Mr. Hansmans fair comment defence, the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression mandates dismissal of the underlying action. Before turning to the two questions before the Court, I summarize the applicable statutory framework. \nSection 4 of the PPPA\nA SLAPP is a tactical action that seeks to suppress expression on matters of public interest. The goal of a SLAPP is not necessarily a legal victory, but a political one: to intimidate and suppress criticism with the threat of costly litigation (V. Pelletier, Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPPs) (and other abusive lawsuits), August 2008 (online), at para. 4). A key feature of a SLAPP is thus the strategic use of the legal system to silence contrary viewpoints. Binnie J. aptly described the problem posed by such litigious tactics in WIC Radio:\nThe function of the tort of defamation is to vindicate reputation, but many courts have concluded that the traditional elements of that tort may require modification to provide broader accommodation to the value of freedom of expression. There is concern that matters of public interest go unreported because publishers fear the ballooning cost and disruption of defending a defamation action. . . .When controversies erupt, statements of claim often follow as night follows day, not only in serious claims (as here) but in actions launched simply for the purpose of intimidation. Of course chilling false and defamatory speech is not a bad thing in itself, but chilling debate on matters of legitimate public interest raises issues of inappropriate censorship and self-censorship. Public controversy can be a rough trade, and the law needs to accommodate its requirements. [Emphasis in original; para. 15.]\nSLAPPs first emerged in the United States as a tendency of some powerful businesses to use the threat of litigation to frustrate public mobilization efforts against them (R. A. Macdonald, P. Noreau and D. Jutras, Les poursuites strategiques contre la mobilisation publique  les poursuites-baillons (SLAPP) (2007), at p. 2). Because of these origins, the archetypal SLAPP is generally described as a powerful or wealthy plaintiff, who has suffered only nominal damage, using litigation against a comparatively under-resourced defendant to silence criticism (see Platnick v. Bent, 2018 ONCA 687, 426 D.L.R. (4th) 60, at para. 99).\nBut SLAPPs do not always embody the hallmarks of the archetype. A SLAPP may be initiated by the rich and powerful, but not always. Similarly, the plaintiff may not have a history of using litigation or the threat of litigation to silence critics. In any case, however, the consistent defining feature of a SLAPP is that the proceeding acts to silence the defendant, and more broadly, to suppress debate on matters of public interest, rather than to remedy serious harm suffered by the plaintiff. \nAnti-SLAPP legislation, such as the PPPA, creates a procedure for screening proceedings arising from expression on matters of public interest at an early stage. Legislative anti-SLAPP solutions have now been passed into law in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. In Ontario, the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015, S.O. 2015, c. 23, s. 3, amends the provinces Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, by adding s. 137.1, which introduces a pretrial screening mechanism designed to weed out SLAPPs. This Court recently analyzed s. 137.1 in two decisions released concurrently: 1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 SCC 22, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 587, and Platnick v. Bent, 2020 SCC 23, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 645.\nBritish Columbias PPPA was modelled after the Uniform Protection of Public Participation Act (2017), May 1, 2017 (online), adopted by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada, which, in turn, is based on Ontarios statute. Like s. 137.1 of Ontarios Courts of Justice Act, s. 4 of the PPPA creates a pretrial screening procedure that enables a defendant to apply to the court to dismiss a proceeding against them, provided certain criteria are satisfied. Section 4 reads:\nApplication to court\n4 (1) In a proceeding, a person against whom the proceeding has been brought may apply for a dismissal order under subsection (2) on the basis that\n(a) the proceeding arises from an expression made by the applicant, and\n(b) the expression relates to a matter of public interest.\n\n(2) If the applicant satisfies the court that the proceeding arises from an expression referred to in subsection (1), the court must make a dismissal order unless the respondent satisfies the court that\n(a) there are grounds to believe that\n(i) the proceeding has substantial merit, and\n(ii) the applicant has no valid defence in the proceeding, and\n(b) the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by the respondent as a result of the applicants expression is serious enough that the public interest in continuing the proceeding outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression.\nSection 4 is nearly identical to the pretrial screening mechanism established by subss. (3) and (4) of s. 137.1. The core feature of both laws is the recognition that even claims with substantial merit will be dismissed where the public interest in preserving free debate outweighs the harm to the plaintiff that the litigation purports to address. In this way, anti-SLAPP legislation instructs judges to deny claimants a day in court on a meritorious claim, given a more compelling social goal (Pointes, at para. 62). \nGiven the substantial similarity between the Ontario and British Columbia laws, this Courts interpretation of s. 137.1 in Pointes and Bent applies with equal force to s. 4 of the PPPA. \nA s. 4 application first requires the applicant (the defendant) to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the proceeding arises from expression that relates to a matter of public interest (s. 4(1); see Pointes, at paras. 18 and 31). If the defendant does so, the onus shifts to the respondent (the plaintiff) under s. 4(2) to satisfy the court there are grounds to believe that: (1) the proceeding has substantial merit (s. 4(2)(a)(i)), and (2) the defences raised by the defendant are not valid, in that they can be said to have no real prospect of success (s. 4(2)(a)(ii)). If the court is not satisfied the plaintiff has met their onus as to one or both criteria, it must dismiss the proceeding. Even if, however, the plaintiff meets their burden, the court must conduct a public interest weighing exercise under s. 4(2)(b), in which the plaintiff must satisfy the court that the harm they are likely to have suffered or are likely to suffer due to the defendants expression outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression. In other words, once the court is satisfied that the proceeding arises from expression that relates to a matter of public interest, it must dismiss the proceeding if the plaintiff does not meet its onus as to either s. 4(2)(a) or (b). The order in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is, of course, at the discretion of the court. \nOnly the no valid defence requirement (s. 4(2)(a)(ii)) and the public interest weighing exercise (s. 4(2)(b)) are at issue in this appeal.\nAs with a motion filed under s. 137.1, a s. 4 motion has evidentiary requirements distinct from other preliminary motions. A motion for summary judgment, for example, permits the parties to file an extensive record, while a motion to strike is adjudicated based on the pleadings alone. Section 4, by contrast, contemplates that parties will put forward a record beyond the pleadings, though a limited one, given that an anti-SLAPP motion is not the place for an ultimate adjudication of the issues (Pointes, at para. 38). The PPPA provides that evidence must be given by affidavit and the affiant may be called for limited cross-examination (see s. 9(4) and (5)).\nAbsent reviewable error, an application judges determination on a s. 4 motion is entitled to deference (Bent, at para. 77, citing Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 8 and 36). \nIssue 1: Public Interest Weighing \nThe key issue in the appeal before us is whether the chambers judge erred in the public interest weighing exercise under s. 4(2)(b). This issue was the most contentious in this Court, and invited considerable attention from parties and interveners, alike. Accordingly, although the chambers judge addressed the issues in a different order, I evaluate his findings as to the public interest weighing exercise before turning to his conclusion that Mr. Hansman had a valid defence in the proceeding.\nEven when a plaintiff shows the proceeding has substantial merit and the defendant has no valid defence, it remains vulnerable to summary dismissal as a result of the public interest weighing exercise . . ., which provides courts with a robust backstop to protect freedom of expression (Pointes, at para. 53). Pointes described this weighing exercise as the core of the analysis, as it allows the court to strike an appropriate balance between the protection of individual reputation and freedom of expression, the competing values at the heart of anti-SLAPP legislation. \nSection 4(2)(b) requires the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that  due to the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the defendants expression  the public interest in allowing the proceeding to continue outweighs the proceedings deleterious effects on expression and public participation (Pointes, at para. 82).\nIn Pointes, this Court outlined several factors that may help judges undertake the weighing exercise, provided those factors can be tethered to the text of [the provision] and the considerations explicitly contemplated by the legislature to conduct the weighing exercise (para. 80): \nFor example, the following factors, in no particular order of importance, may be relevant for the motion judge to consider: the importance of the expression, the history of litigation between the parties, broader or collateral effects on other expressions on matters of public interest, the potential chilling effect on future expression either by a party or by others, the defendants history of activism or advocacy in the public interest, any disproportion between the resources being used in the lawsuit and the harm caused or the expected damages award, and the possibility that the expression or the claim might provoke hostility against an identifiably vulnerable group or a group protected under s. 15 of the Charter or human rights legislation. [Emphasis in original; para. 80.]\nThe chambers judge found that Mr. Neufeld had not shown harm substantial enough to outweigh the significant public interest in Mr. Hansmans expression. The Court of Appeal held that the chambers judge had erred both in his analysis of the harm to Mr. Neufeld and in his assessment of the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression. Specifically, the Court of Appeal found the chambers judge ought to have considered as part of the harm analysis the potential chilling effect on future expression by potential plaintiffs who might wish to engage in highly charged public debates, but would opt not to for fear of being inveighed with negative labels and accusations of hate speech with no opportunity to protect their reputation (para. 65). Finally, the Court of Appeal held that the chambers judge imposed too great a burden on Mr. Neufeld to prove harm and erred in affording Mr. Hansmans speech significant protection. On this basis, and without conducting any explicit weighing, the Court of Appeal determined that Mr. Neufelds action deserved to go on to a trial.\nAs I explain below, I disagree with the Court of Appeal both as to the extent of the harm to Mr. Neufeld and as to the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression. First, Mr. Neufeld failed to identify any specific harm flowing from the statements serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression. Second, the Court of Appeals consideration of the chilling effect factor was divorced from a proper interpretation of s. 4(2)(b) and runs contrary to how a chilling effect has been conceived of in freedom of expression jurisprudence. Third, Mr. Hansmans expression is counter-speech motivated by a desire to promote tolerance and respect for a marginalized group in society. His expression is deserving of significant protection. I would affirm the chambers judges conclusion that the public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans expression outweighed the public interest in remedying the harm to Mr. Neufeld. \nHarm Likely to Have Been or to Be Suffered by the Plaintiff as a Result of the Defendants Expression\nUnder s. 4(2)(b), the factor to be considered in favour of the public interest in continuing the proceeding is the likely harm to the plaintiff as a result of the defendants expression. \nEvidence of Harm and Causation\nMr. Neufeld pleaded generally that he suffered reputational harm and associated emotional distress due to Mr. Hansmans statements. He contended that these assertions were corroborated by a few examples of steps taken against him by other entities: the Chilliwack School Board sought his resignation and directed him to stay away from schools (he refused and continued to serve as a trustee); he was uninvited from an annual trustee meeting; and he was uninvited from delivering high school commencement addresses. Mr. Neufeld also argued that harm could be inferred based on circumstantial factors, including the identity of the accuser, the breadth, and distribution of the statements, and the republication of the statements (Chambers Judges Reasons, at para. 155).  \nThe chambers judge recognized that Mr. Neufeld was not expected to present a fully developed damages brief on a s. 4 application (para. 157). Still, he found that Mr. Neufeld had presented only bare assertions of harm, leaving him with precious little evidence to weigh on Mr. Neufelds side of the equation under s. 4(2)(b) (paras. 147 and 152). He found further that, apart from one paragraph in his affidavit, Mr. Neufeld presented no evidence that would link the minimal harm he alleged to Mr. Hansmans statements (para. 158).\nThe Court of Appeal found two errors with the chambers judges analysis. First, the chambers judge failed to give effect to the general principle that damages are presumed in defamation law (para. 51). The Court of Appeal also noted that Mr. Neufeld had alleged examples of reputational harm and argued that harm could be inferred based on circumstantial factors (paras. 57-58). Second, the chambers judge erred by assuming causation would be difficult to establish because others had made similar statements about Mr. Neufeld (paras. 51-59). I disagree.\nAlthough general damages are presumed in defamation law, s. 4(2)(b) prescribes a weighing exercise which requires that the harm to the plaintiff be serious enough to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendants expression. While the presumption of damages can establish the existence of harm, it cannot establish that the harm is serious (see, e.g., Lachaux v. Independent Print Ltd., [2019] UKSC 27, [2020] A.C. 612, at para. 13; see also United Soils Management Ltd. v. Mohammed, 2019 ONCA 128, 23 C.E.L.R. (4th) 11, at para. 22; Levant v. DeMelle, 2022 ONCA 79, 79 C.P.C. (8th) 437, at para. 68). To hold otherwise would be to presumptively tip the scales in favour of the plaintiff in defamation cases and effectively gut the weighing exercise. Rather, to succeed on the weighing exercise, a plaintiff must provide evidence that enables the judge to draw an inference of likelihood of harm of a magnitude sufficient to outweigh the public interest in protecting the defendants expression (Pointes, at para. 71; Bent, at para. 154). Presumed general damages are insufficient for this purpose, as are bare assertions of harm.\nEven where the extent of harm suffered by the plaintiff is serious, however, the legislation also requires some evidence that enables the judge to infer a causal link between the defendants expression and the harm suffered (Pointes, at para. 71). Where the defendant is not the only one speaking out against the plaintiff, inferring a causal link between the defendants expression and the harm suffered by the plaintiff becomes both more important (para. 72), and more difficult. \nThe chambers judges reasons on this issue are more summary because he had already concluded that Mr. Neufeld did not discharge his burden regarding the fair comment defence, and he considered the public interest weighing exercise as an alternative argument. Thus, he did not specifically deal with the relevant circumstantial arguments that Mr. Neufeld made in support of the extent of the harm he suffered. Still, the judges ultimate conclusion on the record is clear. Even considering the circumstantial factors that Mr. Neufeld alleged, there is no basis to disturb the judges assessment of the harm to Mr. Neufeld. And as the judge recognized, other circumstantial factors clearly pointed to a conclusion that Mr. Neufeld had suffered limited reputational harm: Mr. Neufeld continued to express the same contentious views despite the public reaction and won re-election a year later.\nNor do I agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge found causation could not be established simply because Mr. Hansman was one of many speaking out against Mr. Neufeld. To link the few examples of harm he alleged to Mr. Hansman, Mr. Neufeld asserted only that the negative attention he received commenced after Mr. Hansmans statements (Chambers Judges Reasons, at para. 147). The chambers judge held this, too, was a bald assertion and one belied by the record before him. He found it was clear that other people and entities had independently reacted negatively to Mr. Neufelds views, and there was nothing to indicate their reactions were influenced or motivated by Mr. Hansmans comments (para. 150).\nI would defer to the chambers judges conclusions. As noted, there was an immediate public outcry to Mr. Neufelds views, one which began the day he first posted on Facebook, even before Mr. Hansmans first statement to the media. In the context of this case, I would not disturb the chambers judges finding that something more than a bare assertion that the harm commenced after Mr. Hansmans statements was needed to prove a causal link. \nGiven the dearth of evidence from Mr. Neufeld on harm, the chambers judge did not err in concluding that Mr. Neufeld had adduced almost no evidence of damage suffered as a result of Mr. Hansmans statements. Absent extricable error, his findings are entitled to deference (Bent, at para. 77).\nThe Chilling Effect on the Plaintiff and Others Similarly Situated\nThe Court of Appeal also held that the chambers judge erred in not considering the chilling effect dismissing the proceeding would have on others who might wish to engage in debates on . . . highly charged matters of public interest (para. 65).The court hypothesized that people may withdraw or not engage in public debate for fear of being inveighed with negative labels and accusations of hate speech with no opportunity to protect their reputation (para. 65). Given the serious reputational harm accusations of hate speech might inflict, the court determined that the chambers judge erred in overlooking the collateral effect that preventing Mr. Neufeld from defending himself from such serious accusations could have on other individuals willingness to express themselves on issues of public interest in [the] future (para. 68). \nThis reasoning runs counter to precedent, and is not tethered to the text of [the relevant provision] (Pointes, at para. 80). To begin, s. 4(2)(b) defines the public interest in continuing the proceeding with reference to the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by the respondent as a result of the applicants expression. The harm relevant to the public interest weighing exercise is harm to Mr. Neufeld caused by Mr. Hansmans statements, not by his inability to sue. The loss of a right to sue is a possible outcome of the public interest weighing exercise, not an input. \nThe chilling effect identified by the Court of Appeal does not constitute a harm suffered by Mr. Neufeld for the purpose of the weighing exercise. The concept of a chilling effect has a clear meaning in Canadian freedom of expression law. A chilling effect occurs where uncertainty surrounding the scope or application of a law limiting or prohibiting expression creates a risk that people will not speak for fear of violating the relevant law (see, e.g., Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 32; R. v. Khawaja, 2012 SCC 69, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555, at para. 79; R. v. Vice Media Canada Inc., 2018 SCC 53, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 374, at para. 26; R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 104; Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 133). As McLachlin J., dissenting, but not on this point, explained in R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at p. 850:\nA second characteristic peculiar to freedom of expression is that limitations on expression tend to have an effect on expression other than that which is their target. In the United States this is referred to as the chilling effect. Unless the limitation is drafted with great precision, there will always be doubt about whether a particular form of expression offends the prohibition. . . . The result of a failure to [define any limitation with precision] may be to deter not only the expression which the prohibition was aimed at, but legitimate expression. The law-abiding citizen who does not wish to run afoul of the law will decide not to take the chance in a doubtful case. Creativity and the beneficial exchange of ideas will be adversely affected.  \nIn the civil context, courts have taken care to circumscribe the tort of defamation to avoid causing a chilling effect on legitimate expression, in line with the goals of anti-SLAPP legislation (see Bent, at para. 165, per Cote J., and at para. 262, per Abella J.). As the intervener the Centre for Free Expression points out, since Pointes and Bent were released, the chilling effect on public debate has only been considered by courts under the weighing exercise to assess the concern that allowing the proceeding to continue will chill the expression of the defendant and others who might be sued in defamation (see, e.g., Schwartz & Red Lake Outfitters v. Collette, 2020 ONSC 6580, at para. 123 (CanLII); Catalyst Capital Group Inc. v. West Face Capital Inc., 2021 ONSC 7957, at para. 463 (CanLII); Smith v. Nagy, 2021 ONSC 4265, 156 O.R. (3d) 770, at para. 91; Galloway v. A.B., 2021 BCSC 2344, at para. 784 (CanLII); Gill v. Maciver, 2022 ONSC 1279, at para. 179 (CanLII); Volpe v. Wong-Tam, 2022 ONSC 3106, 512 C.R.R. (2d) 153, at paras. 402-3).\nThe Court of Appeals consideration of a chilling effect flowing from a plaintiffs inability to pursue a defamation claim turns the concept on its head. Our jurisprudence addresses the concern that the possible imposition of a legal penalty would cause speakers to refrain from commenting on matters of public interest. Instead, the Court of Appeal held that the inability to inflict a legal penalty on Mr. Hansman would chill Mr. Neufelds expression and those of others who wish to express unpopular views. Simply put, there is no chilling effect in barring potential plaintiffs from silencing their critics and collecting damages through a defamation suit. Just as our law protects Mr. Neufelds right to voice his opinions on matters of public interest, so it protects the right of others, like Mr. Hansman, to respond. As the Court of Appeal recognized, freedom of expression is the cornerstone of a pluralistic democracy and . . . there must be room for views to be forcefully and even intemperately presented in the public forum (para. 70). \nMr. Hansman undoubtedly used words with the potential to inflict serious reputational harm. But the consideration of the public interest in continuing the proceeding must be grounded in harm to Mr. Neufeld, reputational or otherwise, caused by Mr. Hansmans expression, and not in the consideration of a chilling effect on others if Mr. Neufeld could not proceed with his defamation suit. \nPublic Interest in Protecting the Defendants Expression\nThe other side of the weighing exercise evaluates the public interest in protecting the defendants expression. In making this assessment, s. 2(b) Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms jurisprudence grounds the level of protection afforded to [the defendants] expression in the nature of the expression (Pointes, at para. 77). Similarly, s. 15(1) considerations may factor into the weighing analysis in a proper case. In Pointes, at para. 80, Cote J. cited the possibility that the expression or the claim might provoke hostility against an identifiably vulnerable group or a group protected under s. 15 of the Charter or human rights legislation as a relevant factor for courts to consider. As our Constitution recognizes, not all expression is created equal, and the level of protection to be afforded to any particular expression can vary widely according to the quality of the expression, its subject matter, the motivation behind it, or the form through which it was expressed (see Pointes, at paras. 74, 76 and 120). The closer the expression lies to the core values of s. 2(b), including truth-seeking, participation in political decision-making and diversity in the forms of self-fulfillment and human flourishing, the greater the public interest in protecting it (para. 77).\nSome speakers seek to contribute to public discourse by countering ignorant or harmful expression with an informed or compassionate response (M. Lepoutre, Can More Speech Counter Ignorant Speech? (2019), 16 J. Ethics & Soc. Philos. 155, at pp. 155-56; P. Horwitz, Citizenship and Speech. A Review of Owen M. Fiss, The Irony of Free Speech and Liberalism Divided (1998), 43 McGill L.J. 445, at pp. 464-65; C. F. Zwibel, Reconciling Rights: The Whatcott Case as Missed Opportunity (2013), 63 S.C.L.R. (2d) 313, at pp. 332-33). The theory is that dissenting voices can out-compete more pernicious speech in the marketplace of ideas (C. Forcese and K. Roach, Criminalizing Terrorist Babble: Canadas Dubious New Terrorist Speech Crime (2015), 53 Alta. L. Rev. 35, at p. 47), showing that, though some citizens may hold despicable ideas, the weight of public opinion runs against them (Horwitz, at p. 464). In American First Amendment jurisprudence, this concept is called counterspeech (Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), per Brandeis J., concurring; United States v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709 (2012), per Kennedy J. (plurality opinion)). \nIn s. 2(b) jurisprudence, the idea of counter-speech inheres in the recognition that the open exchange of ideas is a precondition to unlocking the value of free expression. For example, in Keegstra, at p. 766, this Court noted that it is partly through a clash with extreme and erroneous views that truth and the democratic vision remain vigorous and alive (see also Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v. Canada, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 139, at pp. 173 and 175, per LHeureux-Dube J., concurring; Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, at para. 49). While counter-speech is not necessarily a complete solution to harmful expression (see Keegstra, at p. 763; Whatcott, at para. 104), its close proximity to the values at the core of s. 2(b) is beyond doubt. \nCounter-speech motivated by the defence of a vulnerable or marginalized group in society also engages the values at the core of s. 15(1); namely, the equal worth and dignity of every individual (Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 138; see also Pointes, at para. 80). Targets of degrading expression belonging to a vulnerable group in society may lack the ability or authority to effectively combat the harmful speech themselves (Lepoutre, at p. 157). Discourse can then take on an uneven quality, making protective counter-speech by the group or individuals more powerful advocates all the more influential and important (Zwibel, at p. 333; see Whatcott, at para. 75 (recognizing the importance of maintaining a path of reply by [a] group under attack)).\nMr. Hansman spoke out to counter expression he perceived to be untrue, prejudicial towards transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, and potentially damaging to transgender youth. \nThe transgender community is undeniably a marginalized group in Canadian society. The history of transgender individuals in our country has been marked by discrimination and disadvantage. Although being transgender implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities (J. Drescher and E. Haller, Position Statement on Discrimination Against Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals, 2018 (online)), transgender and other gender non-conforming individuals were largely viewed with suspicion and prejudice until the latter half of the 20th century. \nIndeed, transgender people occupy a unique position of disadvantage in our society, given the long history in psychiatry of conflating [transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+] identities with mental illness and even resorting to harmful conversion therapy to resolve gender dysphoria, and recondition the individual to reduce cross-gender behavior (A. Veltman and G. Chaimowitz, Mental Health Care for People Who Identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and (or) Queer (2014), 59:11 Can. J. Psychiatry 1, at pp. 1-2; American Psychological Association, Task Force on Gender Identity and Gender Variance, Report of the Task Force on Gender Identity and Gender Variance (2009), at p. 27). As the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal has recognized, [u]nlike other groups . . ., transgender people often find their very existence the subject of public debate and condemnation (Oger v. Whatcott (No. 7), 2019 BCHRT 58, 94 C.H.R.R. D/222, at para. 61). They are stereotyped as diseased or confused simply because they identify as transgender (Nixon v. Vancouver Rape Relief Society (No. 2), 2002 BCHRT 1, 42 C.H.R.R. D/20, at paras. 136-37). \nTransgender people have faced discrimination in many facets of Canadian society. Statistics Canada has concluded that they are at increased risk of violence, and report higher rates of poor mental health, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse as a means to cope with abuse or violence they have experienced (see Experiences of violent victimization and unwanted sexual behaviours among gay, lesbian, bisexual and other sexual minority people, and the transgender population, in Canada, 2018 (September 2020)). Studies have concluded that they are disadvantaged relative to the general public in housing, employment, and healthcare (Department of Justice Canada, A Qualitative Look at Serious Legal Problems: Trans, Two-Spirit, and Non-Binary People in Canada (2022), at p. 10; XY v. Ontario (Government and Consumer Services) (No. 4), 2012 HRTO 726, 74 C.H.R.R. D/331, at paras. 164-66). And despite encountering a higher incidence of justiciable legal problems, studies have also found that transgender people have traditionally faced greater access to justice barriers than the broader population, in part due to a lack of explicit human rights protections (J. James et al., Legal Problems Facing Trans People in Ontario, TRANSforming JUSTICE Summary Report 1(1), September 6, 2018 (online); see also Department of Justice Canada, at p. 11). \nSignificant legal advancements in transgender rights have only come in the last 35 years, with most change taking place in the last decade (S. Singer, Trans Rights Are Not Just Human Rights: Legal Strategies for Trans Justice (2020), 35 C.J.L.S. 293, at p. 298). Once forced to advance claims of discrimination on the ground of physical disability (B. Findlay et al., Finding Our Place: Transgendered Law Reform Project (1996), at pp. 20-21), gender identity and/or expression are now prohibited grounds of discrimination in human rights codes across the country and included within the prohibition against hate speech under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (see Alberta Bill of Rights, R.S.A. 2000, c. A-14; Human Rights Code, R.S.N.B. 2011, c. 171; Human Rights Act, 2010, S.N.L. 2010, c. H-13.1; Human Rights Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 214; Human Rights Act, S. Nu. 2003, c. 12; Human Rights Act, S.N.W.T. 2002, c. 18; Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19; Human Rights Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. H-12; Charter of human rights and freedoms, CQLR, c. C-12; Human Rights Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 116; The Human Rights Code, C.C.S.M., c. H175; The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, 2018, S.S. 2018, c. S-24.2; An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, S.C. 2017, c. 13).  \nIn the wake of this legislative progress, judicial recognition of the plight of transgender individuals in Canada is growing (see XY, at para. 164; see also Oger, at para. 62; Vanderputten v. Seydaco Packaging Corp. (No. 1), 2012 HRTO 1977, 75 C.H.R.R. D/317, at para. 61; JY v. Mint Tanning Lounge, 2018 BCHRT 282, at para. 32 (CanLII); J.Y. v. Various Waxing Salons, 2019 BCHRT 106, 94 C.H.R.R. D/11, at para. 33; X v. Hot Mess Salon, 2019 BCHRT 24, at para. 11 (CanLII); T.A. v. Manitoba (Justice), 2019 MBHR 12, at para. 24 (CanLII); A.B. v. Correctional Service Canada, 2022 CHRT 15, at para. 41 (CanLII)). And in 2021, the Superior Court of Quebec held that [g]ender identity is analogous to the grounds listed at s. 15(1) of the Canadian Charter because [g]ender identity is an immutable personal characteristic (Centre for Gender Advocacy v. Attorney General of Quebec, 2021 QCCS 191, 481 C.R.R. (2d) 273, at paras. 104 and 106).\nYet individual courts and tribunals have also recognized that, despite some gains, transgender people remain among the most marginalized in our society (Oger, at para. 62), and continue to live their lives facing disadvantage, prejudice, stereotyping, and vulnerability (C.F. v. Director of Vital Statistics (Alta.), 2014 ABQB 237, 587 A.R. 332, at para. 58). \nMr. Neufelds right to express himself is not in doubt, nor is it for this Court to assess the value of his expression. But Mr. Neufelds statements are critical context in characterizing Mr. Hansmans expression, which is at issue. Despite Mr. Neufelds submissions, it is evident that his expression went beyond a critique of a government program. For instance, in his original post, Mr. Neufeld criticized the fact that SOGI 123 materials instruct children that gender is not biologically determined, but is a social construct and stated that permitting children to choose to change gender is nothing short of child abuse (A.R., vol. III, at p. 16). In the same post, Mr. Neufeld expressed concern that children were being taught that heterosexual marriage is no longer the norm and that [i]ncreasing numbers of children are growing up in homes with same sex parents (p. 16). And in his speech at the Culture Guard event about a month following his original post, Mr. Neufeld claimed that SOGI 123 enabl[es] dysfunctional behavior and thinking patterns and coddl[es] and encourag[es] what [he] regard[s] as the sexual addiction of gender confusion. Mr. Hansman was responding to these and other statements. \nMr. Hansmans counter-speech fell close to the core of s. 2(b). His expression served a truth-seeking function, as he was contacted by the media to present an alternative perspective within a debate on a matter of public importance. In speaking out, he sought to counter expression that he and others perceived to undermine the equal worth and dignity of marginalized groups. Finally, his speech commenting on the fitness of an electoral candidate was political expression, which is the single most important and protected type of expression (Harper v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 33, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827, at para. 11, per McLachlin C.J. and Major J., dissenting in part, but not on this point; see also Able Translations Ltd. v. Express International Translations Inc., 2018 ONCA 690, 428 D.L.R. (4th) 568, at paras. 41-44 (affording expression about a persons suitability for elected office significant protection under s. 137.1 of the Ontario Courts of Justice Act)). \nAlthough ones engagement in counter-speech does not amount to open season on reputation (Grant, at para. 58) and speakers must always choose their words carefully (Pointes, at para. 75), on the whole, Mr. Hansmans words were not a disproportionate or gratuitous response to Mr. Neufelds statements. When confronted with views a person believes to be discriminatory, individuals often use words such as bigoted, intolerant, or even sometimes hateful. I note that Mr. Hansmans expression generally focused on the views that Mr. Neufeld expressed, and not who he is as a person.\nI agree with the chambers judge that there is a great public interest in protecting Mr. Hansmans freedom of speech on such matters. The subject matter of Mr. Hansmans speech (commenting on the value of a government initiative, the need for safe and inclusive schools, and the fitness of a candidate for public office), the form in which it was expressed (solicited by the media to present a counter-perspective within an ongoing debate), and the motivation behind it (to combat discriminatory and harmful expression and to protect transgender youth in schools) are all deserving of significant protection. Given Mr. Neufelds failure to establish harm serious enough to outweigh that substantial public interest, the chambers judge did not err in concluding that the weighing exercise under s. 4(2)(b) mandates dismissal of the underlying action.\nIssue 2: No Valid Defence \nWhile the weighing exercise may be the core of the anti-SLAPP legislation, the chambers judge first grounded his dismissal of the action in the finding that Mr. Hansman had a valid fair comment defence. Section 4(2)(a)(ii) provides that a court must make a dismissal order unless the plaintiff satisfies the court that there are grounds to believe that the defendant has no valid defence in the proceeding. The defendant must first point to any defences they intend to raise at trial, after which the burden shifts to the plaintiff. [G]rounds to believe means something more than mere suspicion, but less than . . . proof on the balance of probabilities (Pointes, at para. 40, quoting Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 100, at para. 114). To satisfy this burden, a plaintiff must show the defences advanced by the defendant are not legally tenable or supported by evidence that is reasonably capable of belief such that they can be said to have no real prospect of success (Pointes, at para. 59). \nFair Comment Defence\nIn support of his s. 4 application, Mr. Hansman advanced the defence of fair comment. The right of fair comment is a basic safeguard against irresponsible political power (C. Sappideen and P. Vines, eds., Flemings The Law of Torts (10th ed. 2011), at p. 668). The fair comment defence is premised on the idea that citizens must be able to openly declare their real opinions on matters of public interest without fear of reprisal in the form of actions for defamation (Cherneskey v. Armadale Publishers Ltd., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1086, quoting Slim v. Daily Telegraph Ltd., [1968] 1 All E.R. 497, at p. 503 (C.A.)). This democratic discourse is a defining feature of a free and open society. Thus, the defence aims to keep the equilibrium in defamation law between two competing values: the protection of individual reputation from unwarranted attack, on one side, and the free debate that is said to be the very life blood of our freedom and free institutions on the other (WIC Radio, at para. 1, quoting Price v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co. (1915), 51 S.C.R. 179, at p. 194). The task of courts in interpreting the defence is to reconcile these two values, not to prefer one over the other (WIC Radio, at para. 2).\nThe fair comment defence has five elements. First, the comment must be on a matter of public interest (Grant, at para. 31). Second, it must be based on fact (para. 31). Third, though it can include inferences of fact, [it] must be recognisable as comment (para. 31). Fourth, it must satisfy an objective test: could any person honestly express that opinion on the proved facts? (para. 31). Finally, even if the above elements are met, the defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defendant was actuated by express malice (para. 31). Consideration of the elements of the fair comment defence requires an assessment of the defamatory words used in the full context surrounding their use (WIC Radio, at paras. 55-56). In this appeal, the only elements at issue are the second and third elements of the defence, along with the question of malice. \nWhen invoked at trial, the defendant must prove the elements of the fair comment defence before the onus switches to the plaintiff to defeat the defence by establishing malice by the defendant (para. 52). On a s. 4 application, however, the onus is on the plaintiff to show grounds to believe that the defendant cannot establish one or more of its elements and thus the defence has no real prospect of success.\nAs I explain, the chambers judge also did not err in concluding that Mr. Neufeld failed to challenge the validity of the fair comment defence. \nWas the Expression Based on Fact?\nTo constitute fair comment, a factual basis for the impugned statement must be explicitly or implicitly indicated, at least in general terms, within the publication itself or the facts must be so notorious as to be already understood by the audience (WIC Radio, at para. 34). The defence is unavailable if the factual foundation is unstated or unknown, or turns out to be false (para. 31).\nThere is, however, no requirement that the facts support the comment, in the sense of confirming its truth (para. 31). The expression must relate to the facts on which it is based, but the comment need not be a reasonable or proportionate response (paras. 39, 51 and 59). The purpose of this element is not to measure the fairness of expression, but to ensure the reader is aware of the basis for the comment to enable them to make up their own minds as to its merit (para. 31). \nHere, the chambers judge held that Mr. Neufeld had not shown grounds to believe that the challenged statements were not based in fact, pointing to Mr. Neufelds original Facebook post as a basis for the statements (para. 134). Mr. Neufeld argues, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that there were grounds to believe that Mr. Hansman would be unable to establish that certain of the statements were based in fact. \nI disagree. The relevant inquiry is not whether the underlying facts supported the truth of the statements. At trial, Mr. Hansman need not demonstrate that Mr. Neufeld is bigoted, transphobic, promoted hatred, or created an unsafe environment for students. The question is merely whether the statement can be tethered to an adequate factual basis so the reader can be an informed judge. I agree with the chambers judge that Mr. Neufelds original Facebook post could provide the requisite factual basis for most statements at issue. The post reads: \nOkay, so I can no longer sit on my hands. I have to stand up and be counted. A few years ago, the Liberal minister of education instigated a new curriculum supposedly to combat bullying. But it quickly morphed into a weapon of propaganda to infuse every subject matter from K-12 with the latest fad: Gender theory. The Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) program instructs children that gender is not biologically determined, but is a social construct. At the risk of being labelled a bigoted homophobe, I have to say that I support traditional family values and I agree with the College of paediatricians that allowing little children [to] choose to change gender is nothing short of child abuse. But now the BC Ministry of Education has embraced the LGBTQ lobby and is forcing this biologically absurd theory on children in our schools. Children are being taught that heterosexual marriage is no longer the norm. Teachers must not refer to boys and girls they are merely students. They cannot refer to mothers and fathers either. (Increasing numbers of children are growing up in homes with same sex parents) If this represents the values of Canadian society, count me out! I belong in a country like Russia, or Paraguay, which recently had the guts to stand up to these radical cultural nihilists. [A link to a news article entitled Parents Defeat Gender Ideology in Paraguay.]\n\n(A.R., vol. III, at p. 16)\nAll of the challenged publications either reproduced, linked to, quoted from, or otherwise described Mr. Neufelds original Facebook post, apart from one publication which does not refer to Mr. Neufeld, as I explain below. Most articles also describe Mr. Neufelds anti-SOGI 123 views and views on gender dysphoria, in general. Certain of them also referenced other statements made by Mr. Neufeld, including his statement that semen is a natural anti-depressant for women, factually grounding Mr. Hansmans reference to Mr. Neufelds other misogynist and problematic statements. Other articles referred to Mr. Neufelds remarks at the Culture Guard event, in which he stated that SOGI 123 encourages and enables dysfunctional behavior and thinking patterns, namely the sexual addiction of gender confusion. Mr. Neufelds views were therefore available to readers within the four corners of the publications, either within the text itself or via hyperlinks to further articles and explanations. Those views grounded Mr. Hansmans statements that Mr. Neufeld should resign; expressed views that are bigoted, intolerant, transphobic, misogynist, or hateful; tip toed into hate speech; spread or promoted hatred against 2SLGBTQ+ students; and created or contributed to an unsafe or discriminatory environment.  \nAs the chambers judge noted, Mr. Neufeld can hardly argue that his Facebook post did not provide a factual basis for Mr. Hansmans statements when he himself wrote that he posted at the risk of being labelled a bigoted homophobe. For the few publications that do not go into detail in describing Mr. Neufelds statements, the journalists seem to have relied on the fact that those views had achieved a level of notoriety such that they would have been known to the reading audience. This was a high-profile local controversy that spanned over a year. Both men were public figures. Mr. Neufelds Facebook post was widely reported by major media outlets within hours of it being posted, and the media continued to report on the dispute as it evolved. In this context, it was reasonable to conclude that it was unnecessary to set out the background to the controversy in great detail for all 11 publications. \nBut Mr. Neufeld says that the original Facebook post cannot ground Mr. Hansmans statement to the Huffington Post that trustees with faith-based views need to figure out how theyll work in a secular public school system or seek work elsewhere. Mr. Neufeld contends there was no basis for this statement as his original post did not refer to his religious views (those posts came later). I disagree. The publication references the fact that Mr. Neufeld is a church subdeacon and prison chaplain, providing a factual nexus for the challenged statement.\nSimilarly, Mr. Neufeld contends the Facebook post is insufficient to ground Mr. Hansmans comment to a local news outlet on September 16, 2018, that [i]t is extremely problematic to have somebody who is running as a school trustee continuing to spread hate about LGBTQ people . . . and also be out there, making vile comments about refugees and immigrants (A.R., vol. II, at p. 34). There was some dispute in the courts below about whether this statement concerned Mr. Neufeld or, as Mr. Hansman contends, another trustee candidate, given that the publication does not name anyone in particular. I agree with the concession of Mr. Neufelds counsel before the chambers judge that the comment appears to have been made in response to another school board trustee (A.R., vol. V, at p. 86), and should therefore not be considered. \nIn sum, Mr. Neufeld has not shown grounds to believe that Mr. Hansmans statements lacked a factual basis. As in WIC Radio, the general facts giving rise to the dispute were likely known to the audience and referred to in the publications themselves (para. 34).\nWas the Expression Recognizable as Comment, Rather Than an Imputation of Fact?\nFor expression to constitute fair comment, the statement must be one that would be understood by a reasonable reader as a comment rather than a statement of fact (WIC Radio, at para. 27). A comment includes a deduction, inference, conclusion, criticism, judgment, remark or observation which is generally incapable of proof (para. 26, quoting Ross v. New Brunswick Teachers Association, 2001 NBCA 62, 238 N.B.R. (2d) 112, at para. 56). This is a low threshold; the notion of comment is generously interpreted (WIC Radio, at para. 30).\nThe line between comment and fact can be difficult to draw, particularly in an editorial context where loose, figurative or hyperbolic language is used . . . in the context of political debate, commentary, media campaigns and public discourse (para. 26). Opinions are expressed as facts more often than as personal views, such that statements that may seem to convey fact might be more properly construed as comment (R. D. McConchie and D. A. Potts, Canadian Libel and Slander Actions (2004), at p. 342). Context is essential in distinguishing comment from fact.\nMr. Neufeld relies on a handful of cases to argue that Mr. Hansmans statements were not comments but imputations of fact. In Lascaris v. Bnai Brith Canada, 2019 ONCA 163, 144 O.R. (3d) 211, at para. 34, the court found that a reasonable trier might conclude that statements that the appellant supported terrorists were statements of fact, not opinion. In Bondfield Construction Company Ltd. v. Globe and Mail Inc., 2019 ONCA 166, 144 O.R. (3d) 291, at para. 17, the court held that statements suggesting corruption and collusion in a bidding process could be viewed as factual assertions. And in Pan v. Gao, 2020 BCCA 58, 33 B.C.L.R. (6th) 211, at para. 104, the court concluded that a statement that someone was a seasoned liar was a statement of fact. But these cases do not help us to determine whether Mr. Hansmans statements were recognizable as comment. In the context of those cases, the statements suggested concrete knowledge of past wrongdoings, which is distinguishable from the generalized critiques at issue in this case.\nMore on point are the many cases in which Canadian courts have determined that loose, figurative or hyperbolic labels (WIC Radio, at para. 26), like homophobic, transphobic, bigoted, racist, or sexist are properly characterized as comment, not fact (see Mondal v. Evans-Bitten, 2022 ONSC 809, 82 C.C.L.T. (4th) 327, at paras. 3-7 and 34; see also Awan v. Levant, 2016 ONCA 970, 133 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 84 ([c]alling someone prejudiced will normally be a conclusion or opinion); Volpe, at para. 232 (a statement that a person is homophobic, transphobic, or anti-LGBTQ2S+ was a comment); Bernier v. Kinsella, 2021 ONSC 7451, 73 C.P.C. (8th) 280, at para. 50 (A statement that a person is racist or a misogynist is a generalization or conclusion that is not itself either true or false.)). I agree that an allegation of bias or prejudice is a debatable assertion as to a state of mind and will typically be classified as a comment (P. A. Downard, The Law of Libel in Canada (5th ed. 2022), at pp. 298-99).\nA few statements are arguably closer to the line between comment and fact. While not strictly necessary to decide, given my conclusion as to the public interest weighing exercise, I would agree with the chambers judge that, in the specific context of this case and given the supporting facts included in each publication, a reasonable reader would have interpreted the statements as expressions of Mr. Hansmans opinion. For example, the statement that Mr. Neufeld violated his obligations as a school board trustee could arguably be taken as an imputation of fact, especially given that Mr. Hansmans role as president of the BCTF might give readers the impression he is an authority figure on such matters. But an allegation that a politician has not lived up to their obligations is generally understood to be a critique, not a declaration of fact. Mr. Neufeld has not shown grounds to believe that it would not be seen as a comment in the context of this case.\nAdditionally, Mr. Neufeld contends that because the Criminal Code recognizes an offence of wilful promotion of hatred (see s. 319(2)), the allegation that he tip toed . . . into hate speech would be taken as imputing criminal liability. I do not agree that accusations of hate speech would necessarily be understood by ordinary readers as referring to a Criminal Code offence. Such allegations have permeated public discourse in a way that well exceeds their narrow meaning within the legal system. In any event, the reference to hate speech was published within an ongoing public debate in an editorial in which Mr. Hansman was being asked to comment on the human rights complaint he had recently filed. It is clear, when read in context, that the statement expressed Mr. Hansmans belief that Mr. Neufeld had tip toed . . . into hate speech, based on his own interpretation of Mr. Neufelds statements. An assertion that might be taken as factual in one context may be properly construed as comment in another (WIC Radio, at para. 26; see Awan, at para. 76 (calling someone a liar can be fact or comment, depending on the context)). \nConsidered as a whole, the chambers judge was entitled to find under s. 4(2)(a)(ii) that the sting of Mr. Hansmans statements was comment and it would have been understood as such by readers (WIC Radio, at para. 27).\nWas the Fair Comment Defence Defeated by Malice?\nA showing of malice defeats a valid fair comment defence. This can be done by demonstrating the defendant made the statement knowing it was false, with reckless indifference as to its truth, to injure the plaintiff out of spite or animosity, or for some other improper purpose (WIC Radio, at paras. 100-101 and 104; see also Bent, at para. 136; Smith v. Cross, 2009 BCCA 529, 314 D.L.R. (4th) 457, at para. 34). Proof of malice may be intrinsic or extrinsic: that is, it may be drawn from the language of the assertion itself or from the circumstances surrounding the publication of the comment (WIC Radio, at para. 100). A finding of a subjective honest belief negates the possibility of finding malice (para. 53).\nMr. Neufeld argued that Mr. Hansman acted with malice in making the challenged statements  an allegation that the chambers judge found was unsubstantiated. The Court of Appeal held the chambers judge erred in his malice assessment in two material ways: (1) by finding as a fact that Mr. Hansmans affidavit stated an honest belief in the views he expressed, when it contained no such assertion; and (2) by holding that, once a defendant asserts a subjective belief in their comments, malice can be proved only by a full admission by the defendant on cross-examination (paras. 43-44). I disagree on both counts.\nIn WIC Radio, this Court cautioned against analyzing the fair comment defence at a troubling level of technicality (para. 35). A finding of subjective honest belief can be based on the thrust of the defendants evidence, read as a whole. Ultimately, the chambers judge found that Mr. Hansmans affidavit ma[de] it clear that he honestly believed the views he espoused (at para. 141), and he was entitled to do so. \nI also do not agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge held as a matter of law that once a defendant expresses an honest belief in their statements, malice can be proved only by an admission on cross-examination. The chambers judge noted that, while the PPPA provides for a right of cross-examination on affidavits, Mr. Neufeld declined to use this opportunity. The judge determined that, short of an admission of malice by Mr. Hansman on cross-examination, it was difficult to imagine how malice could be found on the evidence before [him] (para. 141). This simply amounted to a statement that Mr. Neufeld failed to meet his persuasive burden on this s. 4 application. \nI agree with the chambers judge that Mr. Neufeld failed to adequately challenge the fair comment defence. The defence was Mr. Neufelds to disprove, yet Mr. Neufeld adduced no evidence . . . that would form the basis of an argument against the validity of the fair comment defence (para. 126). The judge was therefore entitled to dismiss the proceeding on this basis. \nOther Errors Found by the Court of Appeal\nBesides impugning the chambers judges ultimate conclusion on the fair comment defence, the Court of Appeal also objected to the way he undertook his analysis. The court held that the chambers judge erred by (1) working from a summary of the statements made by Mr. Hansman, and (2) placing undue reliance on WIC Radio. It is unnecessary for me to address these purported errors in detail, other than to say that the chambers judges analysis was appropriate in the circumstances and responsive to the arguments of the parties. His reasons, read as a whole, do not suggest that he overlooked the defamatory meaning of any particular statement in context, or some essential aspect of the analysis. And unlike the Court of Appeal, I do not agree the chambers judge erred by relying on WIC Radio. WIC Radio is a seminal decision from this Court on the interpretation of the elements of the fair comment defence and is factually similar to this case. Both that case and this one involved defamation suits arising out of a public debate in the media over educational policies and practices about the 2SLGBTQ+ community. In each case, the plaintiff was a public figure who expressed views perceived by the defendant to be discriminatory, which invited harsh criticism by the defendant. I am of the view that WIC Radio was a relevant, if not controlling, precedent for the judge to have considered.\nMotion for Fresh Evidence \nMr. Hansman applied under s. 62(3) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, and r. 47 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR/2002-156, to adduce two affidavits as fresh evidence in this Court. While I have serious reservations that this proposed evidence meets the Palmer test for admission (Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759), as affirmed in Barendregt v. Grebliunas, 2022 SCC 22, at paras. 29-34, the evidence is unnecessary to resolve the appeal and I need not deal with the motion. \nConclusion \nI would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, and restore the order of the chambers judge dismissing the defamation action. I would make an order for costs to the appellant assessed on a party and party basis in this Court and on an ordinary costs basis at the Court of Appeal, with costs in the Supreme Court of British Columbia to be awarded on a full indemnity basis pursuant to s. 7(1) of the PPPA.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nOverview\nIn a famous concurring opinion, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis posited that the remedy for objectionable speech is more speech, not enforced silence (Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927), at p. 377). The argument that counter-speech is to be preferred to the censorship or silencing of ideas perceived to be wrong or offensive is connected to the concept of a marketplace of ideas encouraging competition between conflicting viewpoints. However, counter-speech does not enjoy absolute constitutional protection, nor is it inherently more valuable than the speech to which it responds.\nIn fact, counter-speech can even hinder the values underpinning our countrys commitment to free expression (C. F. Zwibel, The Right to Protest and Counter-Protest: Complexities and Considerations, in E. Macfarlane, ed., Dilemmas of Free Expression (2022), 111, at pp. 111 and 120-25). For example, counter-speech aimed at completely removing the initial expression from the public sphere appears to be inconsistent with the search for truth. Silencing contrary and unpopular views seems antithetical to our liberal, pluralistic and democratic society, which is committed to the free exchange of ideas in the pursuit of truth.\nIndeed, the marketplace of ideas welcomes vigorous debates on divisive issues. Such confrontation helps shape, strengthen or even change peoples perspectives. After all, he who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that (J. S. Mill, On Liberty (1859 (reprinted 1978)), at p. 35). Truth is therefore arrived at by community members through the exercise of their agency and autonomous judgment, notably in the process of public discussion (R. Moon, The Social Character of Freedom of Expression (2009), 2:1 Amst. L. Forum 43, at p. 46; on the ties between freedom of expression and human dignity and autonomy, see also Ward v. Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse), 2021 SCC 43, at para. 59; T. M. Scanlon, The Difficulty of Tolerance  Essays in Political Philosophy (2003), at pp. 14-16).\nIn short, not all counter-speech is of equal value (R. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 760-61). This is an appeal about defamatory counter-speech and about whether a defamation action brought as a result should be dismissed before trial under s. 4 of the Protection of Public Participation Act, S.B.C. 2019, c. 3 (PPPA).\nPublic debates on contentious issues can lend themselves to the use of intemperate, offensive or harsh language aimed at discrediting ones opponent (Keegstra, at p. 832, per McLachlin J. (as she then was), dissenting). Although freedom of expression protects such language, the protection it offers is not absolute. It is limited by, among other things, ones right to the protection of ones reputation (Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at paras. 102-6; Bou Malhab v. Diffusion Metromedia CMR inc., 2011 SCC 9, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 214, at para. 17).\nAs with freedom of expression, our laws protection of reputation is anchored in the notion of human dignity that underlies the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Hill, at paras. 120-21; see also Gilles E. Neron Communication Marketing Inc. v. Chambre des notaires du Quebec, 2004 SCC 53, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 95, at paras. 52-53). While not a freestanding right, respect for ones reputation is essential to participation in society (R. v. Lucas, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 48, per Cory J.). Thus, there is a strong societal interest in ensuring that individuals can protect their good reputation, as a reputation tarnished by libel can seldom regain its former lustre (Hill, at para. 108).\nDefamation lawsuits like the one in the present case call upon courts to cautiously strike the appropriate balance between freedom of expression and the protection of ones reputation (Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640, at para. 3; see also Bou Malhab, at para. 19). In determining whether Barry Neufelds action in defamation against Glen Hansman should be dismissed at an early stage, our Court must remain mindful of this balance and take great care in not upsetting it (Bent v. Platnick, 2020 SCC 23, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 645, at para. 168). Unfortunately, and I say this with respect, by dismissing Mr. Neufelds claim, my colleague fails to do so.\nIn my view, my colleague ventures beyond the narrow confines of the courts role when disposing of an application made under the PPPA. The purpose of s. 4 of the PPPA, just like that of s. 137.1 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (CJA), upon which it was modelled, is to act as a pre-trial screening mechanism (1704604 Ontario Ltd. v. Pointes Protection Association, 2020 SCC 22, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 587, at para. 16). In Pointes, our Court cautioned against turning the analysis of a motion under s. 137.1 of the CJA into a de facto summary judgment motion, which would be insurmountable at this stage of the proceedings (Pointes, at para. 52; see also para. 38).\nThe same caveat applies to s. 4 of the PPPA given the analogous procedural and evidentiary limitations contained in the statute. For example, an application for a dismissal order can be made any time after the commencement of a proceeding (PPPA, s. 9(2)). Once the plaintiff in the proceeding has been served with an application for a dismissal order under s. 4 of the PPPA, generally speaking, neither party can take further steps in the proceeding until the application has been adjudicated (s. 5). Furthermore, unless the court allows it, the plaintiff cannot amend his or her pleadings in order to prevent or avoid a dismissal order (s. 6). Likewise, evidence is to be given by affidavit (s. 9(4)). The rationale for these constraints is that an application under s. 4 of the PPPA is not meant to entail a determinative adjudication of the merits of the underlying proceeding (Pointes, at paras. 50-52). Rather, it is intended to serve as an expedient, cost-efficient way to dismiss proceedings that unduly restrict free expression on matters of public interest.\nTherefore, the question in this appeal is not whether this Court agrees with Mr. Neufelds expression, or with Mr. Hansmans counter-speech for that matter. The question is merely whether Mr. Neufelds action should be dismissed at this early stage of the proceeding. Unlike my colleague, I conclude that it should not. In doing so, I am in no way prejudging the merits of Mr. Neufelds action in defamation; I am strictly finding that he deserves to have his day in court.\nAnalysis\nAs a preliminary matter, I part ways with my colleague regarding the structure of her analysis. Although my colleague accurately describes the applicable framework at para. 37 of her reasons, she does not apply it. Indeed, she begins with the public interest weighing exercise and then examines the validity of the fair comment defence advanced by Mr. Hansman. Respectfully, that is not how the analysis must be conducted (Pointes, at paras. 18 and 61-63).\nIn my opinion, the plaintiff in the proceeding (here, Mr. Neufeld) must first overcome a merits-based hurdle, by demonstrating that there are grounds to believe that the proceeding has substantial merit (PPPA, s. 4(2)(a)(i)) and that the applicant under the PPPA (here, Mr. Hansman) has no valid defence in the proceeding (PPPA, s. 4(2)(a)(ii)). Only once this is shown does the court have to determine whether the plaintiff has established that the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by him or her as a result of the applicants expression is serious enough that the public interest in continuing the proceeding outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression (s. 4(2)(b)). Section 4(2)(b) of the PPPA is the final step of the analysis. If the plaintiff fails to show that the applicant has no valid defence, the underlying claim must be dismissed and there is no need to conduct the weighing exercise mandated by s. 4(2)(b) (Pointes, at para. 58).\nMy colleague asserts without explanation (and without citing any supporting authorities) that the order in which a judge chooses to address each of the elements under s. 4(2) is, of course, at the discretion of the court (para. 53). In doing so, she is effectively ignoring our Courts recent decision in Pointes.\nIt is clear from Pointes that the merits-based hurdle must be overcome before the court analyzes the public interest hurdle. The need to conduct the analysis in this order influenced how our Court defined the substantial merit standard in Pointes. Indeed, the Court concluded that the standard could not be so stringent as to prevent cases from getting to the public interest weighing exercise, which is the core of the analysis under s. 137.1(4) of the CJA:\nHowever, while frivolous suits are clearly insufficient, something more cannot require a showing that a claim is likely to succeed either, as some parties have posited. Neither the plain meaning nor the legal definition of substantial comports with a likely to succeed standard. The legislative and statutory context does not support such a standard either. If substantial merit requires a showing of being likely to succeed, this could unduly prevent cases from proceeding to the crux of the inquiry that is the weighing exercise under s. 137.1(4)(b). Given the importance of the weighing exercise in the legislative history, this cannot possibly be what the legislature contemplated. Indeed, nothing in the legislative history . . . points to a likely to succeed standard as the threshold for the plaintiff to prevail at the merits-based hurdle of s. 137.1. While the plaintiff need not definitively demonstrate that its claim is more likely than not to succeed, the claim must nonetheless be sufficiently strong that terminating it at a preliminary stage would undermine the legislatures objective of ensuring that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim.\n\n. . .\n\nStatutory interpretation is a contextual exercise that requires reading a provision with and in light of other provisions: accordingly, if the bar is set too high at s. 137.1(4)(a)(i) or (ii), a motion judge will never reach s. 137.1(4)(b)  this cannot possibly be what the legislature contemplated given the legislative history and intent behind s. 137.1. The legislature repeatedly emphasized proportionality as the paramount consideration in determining whether a lawsuit should be dismissed. Weighing the public interest in freedom of expression and public participation against the public interest in vindicating a meritorious claim is a theme that runs through the entire legislative history, and this informs how s. 137.1 should be judicially understood. [Emphasis added; paras. 48 and 63.]\nOne of the objectives behind s. 137.1 of the CJA and s. 4 of the PPPA alike is to ensure that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim (Pointes, at para. 48 (emphasis added); see also paras. 63-64). The legitimacy of a claim is assessed, first and foremost, at the merits-based hurdle stage, which concerns the strength of the underlying proceeding (para. 60). In my view, by concluding that the order of the analysis is irrelevant and merely a matter of judicial discretion, my colleague undermines that legislative objective.\nThe analysis of the merits-based hurdle informs that of the public interest hurdle. One aspect of the public interest hurdle requires assessing the seriousness of the harm suffered by the respondent (the plaintiff in the underlying proceeding) as a result of the applicants expression, a task that is difficult if not impossible to perform without looking at the strength of the underlying proceeding. The following example illustrates this point. In a defamation action, harm is presumed (Pointes, at para. 71), but whether a claim has a real prospect of meeting the test for defamation must be determined at the merits-based hurdle stage (Bent, at paras. 91 et seq.).\nMy colleagues approach does one of two things: either it glosses over the harm analysis or it subsumes the merits-based hurdle under the public interest hurdle. Neither of these options is desirable. Indeed, the first tips the scales in favour of the applicant and upsets the balance that must be carefully maintained between freedom of expression and the protection of individual reputation. The latter effectively rewrites s. 137.1(4) of the CJA and s. 4 of the PPPA, which our Court is obviously not entitled to do.\nI have searched in vain for an explanation in my colleagues reasons as to why she saw fit to reverse the order of the analysis, despite no party having asked the Court to do so. Not only did neither the appellant nor the respondent ask our Court to adopt a framework different from the one applied in Pointes, but they both presented their arguments by addressing the merits-based hurdle first and then the public interest hurdle, as they should. The chambers judge and the Court of Appeal also proceeded in this order, as Pointes instructed them to do. The fact that the parties and interveners dedicated most of their submissions to the public interest hurdle is hardly a principled or good reason to change the framework adopted in Pointes.\nWhile I recognize that the public interest weighing exercise mandated by s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA is the crux or core of the analysis, it must first be established that the underlying claim arises from an expression made by the applicant on a matter of public interest and that it clears the merits-based hurdle (Pointes, at paras. 18 and 61-63; Bent, at para. 139). Ultimately, it is the public interest in allowing meritorious lawsuits to proceed that is weighed against the public interest in protecting expression on matters of public interest (Pointes, at para. 18 (emphasis added)).\nLower court judges may wish to enable proper appellate review and make alternative findings through the public interest weighing exercise even if a claim fails to clear the merits-based hurdle. The proper way to proceed is to follow the approach adopted by our Court in Pointes: first determine whether the claim clears the merits-based hurdle and then address the public interest hurdle (Pointes, at paras. 112-13; see also Echelon Environmental Inc. v. Glassdoor Inc., 2022 ONCA 391, at para. 12 (CanLII)). Furthermore, this approach is directly in line with the legislative intent behind s. 4 of the PPPA, and s. 4(2)(b) in particular.\nConsequently, I will first analyze whether the chambers judge erred in concluding that Mr. Hansman has a valid fair comment defence. Afterwards, I will address whether the chambers judge erred in his analysis of the public interest hurdle. As I explain below, I am of the view that the chambers judge committed reviewable errors both in his assessment of the fair comment defence and in his analysis of the public interest hurdle. Indeed, the chambers judge misconstrued the applicable test under s. 4(2)(a)(ii) and (b) of the PPPA. Further, he misconstrued the law on defamation and on the fair comment defence, and failed to direct his mind to the quality of the expression at issue when assessing the public interest in protecting it. Therefore, the applicable standard of review is correctness unless the chambers judges findings are not affected by these errors (Bent, at para. 77, citing Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at paras. 8 and 36).\nFair Comment Defence\nThere Are Grounds to Believe That Mr. Hansman Cannot Avail Himself of a Fair Comment Defence for at Least Some of His Statements\nUnder s. 4(2)(a)(ii) of the PPPA, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the applicant has no valid defence in the proceeding. The standard is not a very demanding one. It requires showing that there is a basis in law and in the record for finding that there is no valid defence, taking into account the stage of the proceeding at which the application is brought (Pointes, at paras. 37-39; Bent, at para. 103).\nTo succeed, the plaintiff does not have to establish that the applicant has no valid defence for every impugned statement; it suffices that a valid defence is unavailable for some statements or even only one. This is because s. 4 of the PPPA contemplates the dismissal of a proceeding altogether (see s. 1 of the PPPA, which defines dismissal order as an order under section 4 dismissing a proceeding). It does not allow for partial dismissal of the proceeding or for striking out parts of the claim. This is entirely consistent with the PPPAs purpose, which is to screen out lawsuits in order to prevent defendants from being unduly pulled into the litigation process (Pointes, at paras. 16 and 62).\nFor this reason, it is important to examine the defamatory sting and the context of each of the impugned statements in order to assess the availability of a defence. Therefore, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge erred by failing to examine each of the impugned statements contained in the 11 publications. This was particularly critical because a fair comment defence was being advanced by Mr. Hansman. Assessing the availability of such a defence requires a careful review of the impugned statement in the context of the publication in which it appeared to determine whether it is recognizable as a comment rather than as a statement of fact (WIC Radio Ltd. v. Simpson, 2008 SCC 40, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 420, at para. 28).\nThere is indeed a difference between comment or criticism and allegations of fact, such as that disgraceful acts have been committed (Davis v. Shepstone (1886), 11 App. Cas. 187 (P.C.), at p. 190, cited in WIC Radio, at para. 70, per LeBel J., concurring). A defining feature of a comment is that it is generally incapable of being proven (WIC Radio, at para. 26, citing Ross v. New Brunswick Teachers Association, 2001 NBCA 62, 238 N.B.R. (2d) 112, at para. 56). Similarly, a comment must be clearly recognizable as such and not be so entangled [with allegations of fact] that inferences cannot be distinguished from facts (R. E. Brown, Brown on Defamation: Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, United States (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)) (Brown on Defamation), at  15:5). Any ambiguity in this regard must benefit the plaintiff (R. E. Brown, The Law of Defamation in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), at p. 15-27, cited in Ager v. Canjex Publishing Ltd., 2005 BCCA 467, 259 D.L.R. (4th) 727, at para. 43). The inquiry is an objective one aimed at discerning the perception of the reasonable viewer or reader (Brown on Defamation, at  15:4).\nThe chambers judge cursorily examined this issue. He concluded that the impugned statements were very similar to those in WIC Radio, which were found to be comments. He ultimately found that no reasonable trier of this case could distinguish the facts in this case from the facts in WIC (2019 BCSC 2028, 59 C.C.E.L. (4th) 205, at para. 137; see also para. 178). In so doing, he erred.\nCharacterizing speech as a comment or as a statement of fact involves a contextual analysis, the result of which is at most a finding of mixed law and fact. The present case illustrates why merely transposing a finding of mixed law and fact to another case is a questionable practice that should be avoided. Unlike the defendant in WIC Radio, Mr. Hansman was not a well-known, controversial commentator when he made the impugned statements; he was speaking in his capacity as president of the British Columbia Teachers Federation (BCTF), a union composed of 45,000 teachers (C.A. reasons, 2021 BCCA 222, 50 B.C.L.R. (6th) 217, at para. 35). Moreover, contrary to the facts of WIC Radio, Mr. Hansmans statements were not published in an editorial; they were reported in news articles. These are critical differences, as both the reputation of a defendant, such as Mr. Hansman, and the format of the publication matter in classifying expression as a comment or a statement of fact and in assessing the availability of the fair comment defence in general (WIC Radio, at paras. 27 and 48). More fundamentally, as the Court of Appeal aptly noted, the courts ruling in WIC Radio was the result of an adjudication on the merits at trial, unlike in the present case (para. 39).\nIn my opinion, there are grounds to believe that the fair comment defence is not available for two of Mr. Hansmans statements because they were made as statements of fact.\nIn January 2018, news articles regarding Mr. Neufeld were published in the Fraser Valley News and the Agassiz Harrison Observer. Both articles, available online, reproduced a press release from the Chilliwack Teachers Association. The press release announced the passing of a motion of non-confidence in the Chilliwack Board of Education due to its perceived inaction in connection with Mr. Neufelds statements concerning the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity 123 (SOGI 123) initiative. Mr. Hansman was quoted as saying the following:\nSometimes our beliefs, values, and responsibilities as professional educators are challenged by those who promote hatred. This is often the case when it comes to sexual health curriculum in schools and our efforts to ensure safe, inclusive schools for all students  including LGBTQ students . . . . [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted.]\n\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 87)\nRead plainly and in the context of the press release, this statement implies that Mr. Neufeld promoted hatred against an identifiable group, i.e. LGBTQ students.\nThen, in April 2018, a news article was published on CityNews 1130s website. The article pertained to the human rights complaint filed against Mr. Neufeld by the BCTF. In the article, Mr. Hansman was quoted as saying that Mr. Neufeld had tip toed quite far into hate speech (A.R., vol. I, at p. 89 (emphasis deleted)). This statement is at the core of Mr. Neufelds action in defamation (chambers judges reasons, at para. 25).\nBoth of these statements carry the defamatory sting that Mr. Neufeld engaged in hate speech. Our law requires an onerous and objective standard to be met for speech to constitute hate speech (Keegstra, at pp. 777-78, per Dickson C.J.; Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Whatcott, 2013 SCC 11, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 467, at para. 56). Understandably, allowing subjective sensibilities to play a role in the analysis would endanger the constitutionality of anti-hate speech laws. Therefore, what is considered hate speech is not speech that evokes a wide range of emotions, but speech that elicits deep feelings of detestation and vilification (Keegstra, at p. 777; R. v. Andrews (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 161 (C.A.), at p. 179, per Cory J.A., affd [1990] 3 S.C.R. 870). Such speech sits at a distance from offensive or hurtful expression that does not incite the level of abhorrence, delegitimization and rejection that risks causing discrimination or other harmful effects (Whatcott, at para. 57; see also para. 46).\nIn my respectful view, affirming that Mr. Neufeld engaged in hate speech is quite different from expressing a judgment or making a remark incapable of proof. Read in their context, the aforementioned hate speech allegations appear similar to allegations of fraud, theft or other criminal conduct that have been found to be statements of fact for which a fair comment defence is not available (see, e.g., Nanda v. McEwan, 2019 ONSC 3357, at para. 48 (CanLII) (regarding allegations of theft and corruption), affd 2020 ONCA 431, 450 D.L.R. (4th) 145; Hall v. Kyburz, 2006 ABQB 294, at para. 33 (CanLII) (regarding allegations of various criminal acts, such as fraud, kidnapping and extortion), affd 2007 ABCA 228). I view the present case as being similar to Lascaris v. Bnai Brith Canada, 2019 ONCA 163, 144 O.R. (3d) 211, and Bondfield Construction Company Limited v. The Globe and Mail Inc., 2019 ONCA 166, 431 D.L.R. (4th) 501, in which the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that statements that a party supported terrorists (Lascaris, at para. 34) or was involved in corruption and collusion (Bondfield, at para. 17) could be viewed as statements of fact. The present appeal also has similarities to Pan v. Gao, 2020 BCCA 58, 33 B.C.L.R. (6th) 211, in which the Court of Appeal for British Columbia held that calling someone a seasoned liar was a statement of fact (paras. 101-4).\nMy colleague distinguishes Lascaris, Bondfield and Pan from the matter at hand because [i]n the context of those cases, the statements suggested concrete knowledge of past wrongdoings, which is distinguishable from the generalized critiques at issue in this case (para. 110). But to accuse a person of hate speech is not the same as making a generalized critique. On the contrary, it is to attribute precise wrongdoing to that person (para. 110).\nFor this reason, I conclude that there are grounds to believe that the two impugned statements were made as statements of fact and not as comments and, consequently, that the fair comment defence is not available to Mr. Hansman. I turn now to the public interest hurdle.\nPublic Interest Hurdle \nThe Harm Likely to Have Been or to Be Suffered by Mr. Neufeld Is Very Serious\nMr. Neufeld claims damages for non-monetary harm. He seeks compensation for the stress, anxiety, humiliation, mental and emotional distress as well as reputational harm suffered as a result of Mr. Hansmans statements (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 97-98). The chambers judge noted that Mr. Neufeld presented no evidence, aside from one paragraph in his affidavit, showing that he had suffered any damage that could be linked to Mr. Hansmans statements. It is worth emphasizing that what was required of Mr. Neufeld at this preliminary stage was not to prove harm or causation but only to provide evidence for the . . . judge to draw an inference of likelihood in respect of the existence of the harm and the relevant causal link (Pointes, at para. 71). In my opinion, and as I demonstrate below, the chambers judge erroneously ignored factors aggravating the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by Mr. Neufeld, despite the fact that they were specifically argued by him (para. 155).\nFirst, the chambers judge failed to consider that the seriousness of the harm can be inferred from the gravity of the impugned statements. Indeed, the nature of the defamatory comment is the most important element in assessing the amount of damages (Brown on Defamation, at  25:19; see also P. A. Downard, The Law of Libel in Canada (5th ed. 2022), at 14.01[2][b]). For example, allegations of criminal conduct rank high on the scale of seriousness (Grant, at para. 111; see also Lascaris, at paras. 40-41, cited with approval in Canadian Union of Postal Workers v. Bnai Brith Canada, 2021 ONCA 529, 460 D.L.R. (4th) 245, at para. 39, per Jamal J.A. (as he then was); Clark v. East Sooke Rural Association, 2004 BCSC 1120, at para. 132 (CanLII); Manno v. Henry, 2008 BCSC 738, at para. 79 (CanLII); Lalli v. Athwal, 2017 BCSC 1931, at para. 141 (CanLII); Mann v. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 2012 BCSC 181, at para. 73 (CanLII)).\nThe same can be said of hate speech allegations. They refer to objectively and undeniably abhorrent conduct that can give rise to criminal prosecution (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 319(2)). Such speech exposes members of an identifiable group to extreme and deep-felt emotions of detestation and vilification (Whatcott, at para. 59; Keegstra, at pp. 777-78). It lays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on vulnerable groups. These attacks can range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to genocide (Whatcott, at para. 74). Regardless of whether such conduct is characterized as a criminal offence under the Criminal Code or as the subject matter of a human rights complaint, accusing a person of having tip toed quite far into hate speech or having promoted hatred against an identifiable group is extremely damaging to that persons reputation. In my opinion, the Court of Appeal was right in noting that such an accusation can inflict serious reputational harm (para. 68).\nSecond, the chambers judge did not consider the absence of an apology from Mr. Hansman, which is another aggravating factor increasing Mr. Neufelds harm (Barrick Gold Corp. v. Lopehandia (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 416 (C.A.), at para. 51).\nThird, the chambers judge did not take into account the stature of Mr. Hansman, who, at all relevant times, was acting as the president of the BCTF. This is likely to have magnified Mr. Neufelds harm. Indeed, the greater the reputation of the defendant, the greater the impact the defamation can be expected to have on the plaintiff (Downard, at 14.01[2][g]; Bent, at para. 161).\nFinally, the chambers judge failed to consider the context of the publication and the platform on which the impugned statements were published (Downard, at 14.01[2][c]). The statements accusing Mr. Neufeld of hate speech were published by news organizations in articles available on the Internet (A.R., vol. I, at pp. 87 and 89). The anonymity offered by the Internet, combined with increased accessibility and information sharing, can result in greater harm to a persons reputation (Crookes v. Newton, 2011 SCC 47, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 269, at para. 37; Barrick Gold, at paras. 31-34; Pineau v. KMI Publishing and Events Ltd., 2022 BCCA 426, at para. 69 (CanLII)).\nAll of these aggravating factors relate to Mr. Hansmans expression and increase the amount of general damages, which are presumed in defamation cases (Bent, at para. 144; C.A. reasons, at paras. 55 and 57). These factors were erroneously ignored by the chambers judge. The chambers judge also erred in discounting the part played by Mr. Hansman in Mr. Neufelds harm because others had expressed similar criticism towards Mr. Neufeld (para. 150). While I acknowledge that Mr. Hansman was not alone in criticizing Mr. Neufeld, the Court of Appeal was right in pointing out that a definitive determination of Mr. Hansmans part in Mr. Neufelds harm is not required at this stage of the proceeding (Pointes, at paras. 71-72; C.A. reasons, at para. 59). To conclude otherwise would impose too onerous a burden on Mr. Neufeld at such an early stage. Furthermore, as our Court noted in Pointes, causation is not an all-or-nothing proposition (para. 72).\nThe fact that Mr. Neufeld was re-elected as trustee may be a mitigating factor, but it does not nullify his claim, nor does it render his harm minor. Even in cases where a defamatory statement is not believed, damages can be awarded to compensate the plaintiff for the injured feelings, psychological impact and inconvenience caused by the libel (Bent, at para. 149; Downard, at 14.01[2][f] and [h]). Likewise, the fact that Mr. Neufeld was not silenced by Mr. Hansmans statements does not negate any harm he suffered. Otherwise, public figures could claim only nominal damages for defamation unless they lost their platform as a result. That is not, nor has it ever been, the state of the law. Granted, the fact that a plaintiff has shied away from the public sphere as a consequence of defamatory remarks can certainly increase the damages awarded, but this is not the yardstick by which harm is measured.\nIn my opinion, given the aggravating factors discussed above, the seriousness of Mr. Neufelds harm should have been situated somewhere between the middle and the high end of the scale.\nThe Public Interest in Allowing Mr. Neufelds Claim to Proceed to Trial Outweighs the Public Interest in Protecting Mr. Hansmans Expression\nBecause of the subsidiary nature of this issue, the chambers judge gave little consideration to the competing public interests. He briefly noted that Mr. Hansmans expression deserved significant protection because many of his statements pertained to the need for inclusive and safe schools or did not mention Mr. Neufeld, and he suggested that public debate should be favoured in light of the limited damage suffered by Mr. Neufeld (paras. 160-61).\nThe chambers judge failed to direct his mind to the quality of the expression (Pointes, at para. 74). This constitutes a reviewable error. In fairness, he did not have the benefit of our Courts decision in Pointes. However, such an inquiry is essential to determine what is really going on in the case, which is ultimately the exercise contemplated by s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA (Pointes, at para. 81; Bent, at para. 172).\nThe role of this Court is not and should not be to evaluate the soundness of Mr. Hansmans and Mr. Neufelds respective positions on SOGI 123 (C.A. reasons, at para. 2; chambers judges reasons, at para. 177). Freedom of expression is content-neutral, which is why its scope even encompasses expression that is unpopular, distasteful or contrary to the mainstream (Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at p. 968). This fundamental freedom would be seriously undermined if the outcome of the public interest weighing exercise under the PPPA depended on the alignment between the views expressed by the applicant and those held by the court.\nIn my opinion, my colleague follows an improper path of reasoning when she justifies reinstating the chambers judges dismissal order on the basis that Mr. Hansmans expression promotes equality, which is also a fundamental democratic value (para. 9). Equality is not one of the competing values at play under legislation designed to discourage strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs); the protection of individual reputation and freedom of expression are (para. 58).\nMoreover, the promotion of equality is not one of the core values underpinning freedom of expression (i.e., the search for truth, participation in social and political decision making, and diversity in forms of self-fulfillment and human flourishing) (Keegstra, at p. 728; Irwin Toy, at p. 976). Assigning any role to the promotion of equality in the assessment of the public interest in protecting expression goes against the doctrine of content neutrality embraced by this Court in its jurisprudence on s. 2(b) of the Charter (see, e.g., Irwin Toy, at p. 968; Keegstra, at p. 729; R. v. Zundel, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 731, at pp. 753-58). The more we evaluate the worthiness of expression in light of values unrelated to freedom of expression, the further we move from content neutrality. More importantly, the promotion of equality is in no way a factor tethered to the text of s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA and, for this reason alone, is not a relevant factor in the public interest weighing exercise (Pointes, at para. 80).\nUltimately, both Mr. Hansman and Mr. Neufeld had the right to express themselves on SOGI 123. It may be that Mr. Neufelds statements crossed the line and that he breached the Human Rights Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, but that is for the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal to decide following a hearing on the merits of the complaints filed against Mr. Neufeld.\nIt is undeniable that Mr. Hansmans counter-speech concerned the importance of ensuring inclusive schools for LGBTQ students through the implementation of SOGI 123. But Mr. Hansman did not limit himself to criticizing Mr. Neufelds views on SOGI 123 or to affirming his support for inclusive schools. He made personal attacks and serious hate speech accusations that were likely to cause or that did cause significant harm to Mr. Neufeld. This lowers the public interest in protecting his speech, as defamatory statements and personal attacks are very tenuously related to the core values which underlie s. 2(b) of the Charter (Thorman v. McGraw, 2022 ONCA 851, 476 D.L.R. (4th) 577, at para. 15; see also Hill, at para. 106; Pointes, at paras. 74-75; Bent, at para. 163).\nWhat is really going on in the present case is not an attempt to suppress Mr. Hansmans expression. Rather, this is a case in which one party is attempting to remedy seemingly legitimate harm suffered as a result of a defamatory communication (Bent, at para. 172). In other words, the harm likely to have been or to be suffered by Mr. Neufeld strongly militates in favour of allowing the proceeding to continue (para. 159).\nRestricting the availability of tort actions for defamation can have a chilling effect. In Globe and Mail Ltd. v. Boland, [1960] S.C.R. 203, this Court refused to extend the defence of qualified privilege to defamatory statements related to the fitness of political candidates, in part because it would deter future candidates from seeking office (pp. 208-9; see also Hill, at para. 106). Likewise, in the context of defamatory counter-speech, interpreting s. 4 of the PPPA so as to deprive defamed parties who have suffered serious harm of their day in court could very well be detrimental to public debate. It could prevent those who hold controversial or unpopular views from entering the public arena to share them. This conclusion does not turn the concept of chilling effect on its head, contrary to what my colleague contends (para. 77). My colleague asserts that our Courts jurisprudence on this concept addresses the concern that the possible imposition of a legal penalty would cause speakers to refrain from commenting on matters of public interest (para. 77). However, the deprivation, through a court order, of a partys right to vindicate a legitimate claim also imposes a legal penalty on that party.\nI therefore agree with the Court of Appeal that the chambers judge erred in failing to consider the chilling effect that the dismissal of Mr. Neufelds claim might have on future expression by others (Pointes, at para. 80; C.A. reasons, at para. 65).\nAnti-SLAPP legislation like the PPPA does not provide a licence to defame (Park Lawn Corporation v. Kahu Capital Partners Ltd., 2023 ONCA 129, 478 D.L.R. (4th) 514, at para. 33). Being the subject of defamatory counter-speech is not the price that those who engage in public debate by expressing minority views on contentious topics must inevitably pay. This is not what is envisioned by s. 4 of the PPPA, which, like s. 137.1 of the CJA, aims to ensure that a plaintiff with a legitimate claim is not unduly deprived of the opportunity to vindicate that claim (Pointes, at para. 48). In my view, and with all due respect, my colleague is depriving Mr. Neufeld of that very opportunity.\nAs for Mr. Hansmans motion to adduce fresh evidence, I am of the view that both of the affidavits he seeks to file are not relevant to the decisive issues on appeal and therefore do not meet the test for admitting fresh evidence set out in Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. The purpose of the first affidavit is to contradict Mr. Neufelds claim that dismissing his defamation action would have a chilling effect on him by demonstrating that he continued to speak out after the chambers judge dismissed his action. However, the live issue before this Court is not whether Mr. Neufelds expression was stifled because of the chambers judges dismissal order. Rather, it is whether other peoples expression could be. The second affidavit sets out developments in the human rights complaint filed by the BCTF; it is not relevant to the disposition of this appeal.\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with party and party costs in this Court and ordinary costs in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia. Pursuant to s. 7(2) of the PPPA, I would make no order regarding the costs of the PPPA application in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\n\tAppeal allowed with costs, Cote J. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: British Columbia Teachers Federation, Vancouver; Michael Sobkin, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Paul E.

Neufeld subsequently sued Hansman for defamation over statements made to the media calling his views \"intolerant\" and \"bigoted.\" The case involved applicable sections of the Criminal Code, including section 319(2), which prohibits hate speech against identifiable groups.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe court proceedings began with Neufeld's defamation action against Hansman. Hansman applied to have the action dismissed under section 4 of the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA), which allows for pre-trial screening to dismiss actions arising from expression on matters of public interest unless substantial merit is shown. The chambers judge granted Hansman's application, dismissing the action. However, the Court of Appeal reinstated it. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Justice Karakatsanis allowed Hansman's appeal, restoring the chambers judge's order dismissing the defamation action.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nWhen assessing fair comment defences in defamation cases, courts must conduct contextual analyses to determine whether impugned statements are recognizable as comments rather than facts.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for the majority, Justice Karakatsanis concludes that dismissing Neufeld's defamation action was justified as it correctly applied public interest weighing exercises under s. 4(2)(b) of the PPPA. The majority finds that harm likely suffered by Neufeld due to Hansman's expression was not serious enough to outweigh protecting that expression. Moreover, they note that counter-speech motivated by promoting tolerance and respect for marginalized groups deserves significant protection and affirms a great public interest in protecting such freedom of speech on similar matters nationwide", "citation": "2023 SCC 14", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court restores a B.C.  court\u2019s dismissal of a defamation suit.</strong>\r\n   This case  focuses on a defamation lawsuit after a public debate around an initiative to equip  educators with resources to teach students about sexual orientation and gender  identity. In 2016, British Columbia\u2019s Ministry of Education launched \u201cSexual  Orientation and Gender Identity 123\u201d (SOGI 123). The aim of SOGI 123 is to  foster inclusion and respect for students who may face discrimination in school  because of their gender identity or expression. Mr. Barry Neufeld, an elected  public school board trustee in Chilliwack, B.C., publicly criticized the  initiative in online posts, which triggered significant controversy including  calls for him to resign. Many people in the community considered his statements  derogatory of transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ individuals. Mr. Glen Hansman, a  gay man, teacher and former president of the British Columbia Teachers\u2019  Federation, publicly denounced Mr. Neufeld\u2019s views, including to the news  media, calling them bigoted, transphobic and hateful. He accused him of  undermining safety and inclusivity for transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ students in  schools, and questioned whether he should remain a school board trustee. Mr. Neufeld  sued Mr. Hansman for defamation. In response, Mr. Hansman asked the court to  dismiss the lawsuit under the province\u2019s<em> Protection  of Public Participation Act</em> (the Act). He argued that Mr. Neufeld had  launched a \u201cstrategic lawsuit against public participation\u201d (SLAPP). Rather  than compensating the plaintiff for serious harm to their reputation, the goal  of this kind of legal action is to silence the defendant and suppress debate on  matters of public interest. The Act aims to counter SLAPPs. When a court determines that protecting free  debate on matters of public interest outweighs harm to the plaintiff, section 4  of the Act instructs it to  dismiss this type of lawsuit. The first  instance judge dismissed Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation lawsuit, finding that it had  the effect of suppressing debate on matters of public interest. He determined  the value in protecting Mr. Hansman\u2019s expression outweighed the harm Mr.  Neufeld likely suffered. The Court of Appeal disagreed and allowed the  defamation suit to continue. Mr. Hansman appealed to this Court. The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>The first instance judge correctly  dismissed Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation suit.</strong>\r\n     Writing for  the majority, Justice Karakatsanis restored the first judge\u2019s order dismissing  Mr. Neufeld\u2019s defamation suit. She decided the public interest in protecting  Mr. Hansman\u2019s speech outweighed the public interest in remedying the  reputational harm to Mr. Neufeld. She agreed with the judge that Mr. Neufeld  had suffered limited harm, as he continued to express his views despite the  public reaction and won re-election a year later. As for Mr.  Hansman, he spoke out to counter what he and others perceived to be discriminatory  and harmful speech against transgender and other 2SLGBTQ+ youth, \u201cgroups  especially vulnerable to expression that reduces their worth and dignity in the  eyes of society and questions their very identity\u201d. His response to Mr.  Neufeld\u2019s statements was neither disproportionate nor gratuitous. As Justice  Karakatsanis explained, \u201c[t]he closer the expression lies to the core values of  [freedom of expression], including truth-seeking, participating in political  decision-making and diversity in the forms of self-fulfillment and human  flourishing, \u2018the greater the public interest in protecting it\u2019\u201d. She concluded  Mr. Hansman\u2019s speech aligned with these values."}, "20": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\nJames Allan Anderson\tAppellant\nv.\nDiana Anderson\tRespondent\nIndexed as: Anderson v.

F-6.3, ss. 38, 40.\n\tAt the end of a three-year marriage, the wife and the husband executed a separation agreement which essentially provided that each party would keep the property held in their name and give up all rights to the others property, except for the family home and the household goods. The agreement, prepared by the wife, was executed at the end of a meeting with two friends of the parties, who witnessed its execution. There was no financial disclosure between the parties and neither party had the benefit of independent legal advice before signing. Nearly 17 months after the wife petitioned for divorce, the husband counter-petitioned and sought family property division, arguing that the agreement was signed without legal advice and under duress. The trial judge found that the agreement was not binding and declined to give it any weight. He instead equalized the family property under Saskatchewans family property legislation, The Family Property Act (FPA), and ordered the wife to pay the husband a net equalization payment of about $90,000. The Court of Appeal set aside the trial judges division of family property and found that the agreement was binding. It applied the framework developed by the Court in Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 303, to conclude that the agreement should be afforded great weight. Based on family property values at the date closest in time to the agreement, the Court of Appeal ordered the husband to pay the wife about $5,000.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed.\n\tDomestic contracts should generally be encouraged and supported by courts, within the bounds permitted by the legislature, absent a compelling reason to discount the agreement. This deference flows from the recognition that self-sufficiency, autonomy and finality are important objectives in the family law context. In the instant case, the agreement between the wife and the husband was binding. It was fair and equitable, given the criteria and objectives of the FPA. The family home and household goods should be divided as of the date of the trial, resulting in a payment of $43,382.63, owed by the wife to the husband.\n\tDomestic contracts present unique advantages and concerns. On the one hand, parties are generally better positioned than courts to understand the distinctive needs and circumstances of their private relationship. On the other, parties to domestic contracts are particularly vulnerable to unfairness and exploitation, given the unique environment in which domestic contracts are negotiated and concluded. The Courts jurisprudence on domestic contracts, including Miglin, signals to courts to approach domestic contracts with caution and to have regard to important procedural protections that help ensure the deal struck is fair. Moreover, while the Court has long supported the freedom of parties to settle their domestic affairs privately, respect for private ordering cannot be permitted to thwart the public policy objectives enshrined in family law legislation. Courts must approach family law settlements with a view to balancing the values of contractual autonomy and certainty with concerns of fairness. In essence, courts must review domestic contracts with particular sensitivity to the vulnerabilities that can arise in the family law context, without presuming that spouses lack the agency to contract simply because the agreement was negotiated in an emotionally stressful context.\n\tWhile useful general principles emerge from Miglin to guide courts in approaching domestic contracts, Miglin is not, and was never intended to be, a framework of general applicability for courts dealing with all types of domestic contracts. The Miglin framework, which arose within a different statutory context, should not be transposed into provincial family property legislation. Rather, the courts interpretive exercise is statute-specific, and differences between property division and spousal support, division of powers concerns, and the distinctive features of particular statutes mandate a tailored analytical approach.\n\tLike other provincial family property legislation, the FPA begins from a presumption of equal distribution, but permits spouses to contract out of the scheme in certain circumstances. In particular, the FPA recognizes two types of domestic contracts dealing with family property. Interspousal contracts, under s. 38 of the FPA, are presumptively enforceable if they conform to the statutory formalities set out in that provision, including that the parties formally acknowledge that they understand the nature and effect of the terms of the agreement in the presence of independent counsel. Domestic contracts that do not meet the statutory requirements set out in s. 38 may still be considered by a court, and, under s. 40, assigned whatever weight the court considers reasonable. Therefore, while the FPA begins from a presumption of equal distribution, a written agreement between parties is an important factor in determining whether departure from equal division is fair and equitable in the circumstances.\n\tIn determining whether to consider an agreement that does not qualify as an interspousal contract under the FPA, the court should be alive to any concerns that the agreement is not valid according to ordinary contract law principles. Assuming there is a valid agreement, the courts attention shifts to whether the agreement merits consideration in the equalization analysis. The court must assess the agreement for its procedural integrity, where such concerns are raised. By examining the integrity of the bargaining process for undue pressure, or exploitation of a power imbalance or other vulnerability, the judge can determine whether the parties concluded the agreement freely and understanding its meaning and consequences. While safeguards like financial disclosure and independent legal advice provide critical protection in the family law context, they are not required by the legislation and their absence, without more, does not necessarily impugn the fairness of an agreement. Given the respect for spousal autonomy reflected in both the legislation and the jurisprudence, unless the court is satisfied that the agreement arose from an unfair bargaining process, an agreement is entitled to serious consideration.\n\tOnce the court is satisfied that an agreement is entitled to consideration, it may assess the substantive fairness of the agreement, in order to determine how much weight to afford the agreement in fashioning an order for property division. Ultimately, the weight given to the agreement in an order for the distribution of property depends on how its substance accords with what is fair and equitable in the circumstances, considering the objectives and factors of the legislative scheme. The purposes and criteria of the governing statute provide an objective yardstick against which to assess the parties subjective understanding of what is fair, and limit the risk that parties will depart significantly from public policy goals expressed by the legislature.\n\tIn the instant case, the agreement was binding and there were no substantiated concerns with its fairness. The agreement is short and uncomplicated and reflects the intention of the parties to effect a clean break from their partnership. A lack of independent legal advice and formal disclosure can undermine informed choice, but was not troubling here because the husband could not point to any resulting prejudice: there was no suggestion that the absence of these safeguards undermined either the integrity of the bargaining process or the fairness of the agreement. The agreement was therefore entitled to serious consideration given that it reflects the parties understanding of what division of property was fair in the context of their relationship at the time of separation. The trial judge erred in finding the agreement not binding on the parties and failing to consider its substance in his property distribution, and while the Court of Appeal concluded the agreement should be given great weight, it equalized the family property in a way that defeated the intent of the parties and resulted in unfairness. Besides the family home and household goods, equal division of the family property under the FPA results in unfairness. The parties were best positioned to organize the limited family property resulting from their short marriage and, given all the circumstances, the most fair and equitable solution is for their simple agreement to be given effect.\nCases Cited\n\tConsidered: Miglin v.

On the one hand, individual autonomy to settle domestic affairs should be encouraged, as parties are generally better positioned than courts to understand the distinctive needs and circumstances of their private relationships. On the other, parties to domestic contracts are particularly vulnerable to unfairness and exploitation, given the unique environment in which domestic contracts are negotiated and concluded. As a result, family law legislation typically authorizes judges to review a domestic contract. The degree of deference afforded to a domestic contract under the governing statute often depends on whether it meets statutory formalities, such as whether the parties received independent legal advice. \nThis appeal raises the issue of how courts should approach and weigh a domestic contract that purports to opt out of a provincial property scheme, but fails to meet the statutory requirements that would entitle it to presumptive enforceability. In particular, this appeal asks whether the analytical framework this Court developed in Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 303  which dealt with spousal support under the federal Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.)  is appropriately applied to such a domestic contract.\nThis Courts jurisprudence on domestic contracts, including Miglin, recognizes that the breakdown of a spousal relationship is often wrought with emotional turmoil and can give rise to vulnerabilities that undermine the fairness of domestic contracts. The devastating impact of a separation means that parties to a separation agreement may be ill-equipped to form decisions of a permanent and legally binding nature (J. D. Payne and M. A. Payne, Dealing with Family Law: A Canadian Guide (1993), at p. 78, quoted in Miglin, at para. 74). Miglin and the cases that follow it therefore signal to courts to approach domestic agreements with caution and to have regard to important procedural protections that help ensure the deal struck is fair. Moreover, while this Court has long supported the freedom of parties to settle their domestic affairs privately, respect for private ordering cannot be permitted to thwart the public policy objectives enshrined in family law legislation. Therefore, in deciding how much weight to give the agreement, a reviewing judge generally examines both the fairness of the bargaining process and the substance of the agreement, in accordance with the legislative scheme.  \nLike other provincial family property statutes, The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.3 (FPA or Act), of Saskatchewan begins from a presumption of equal distribution, but permits spouses to contract out of the scheme in certain circumstances (relevant provisions of the FPA are reproduced in the appendix to these reasons). In particular, the FPA recognizes two types of domestic contracts dealing with family property. Interspousal contracts under s. 38 of the Act are presumptively enforceable if they conform to the statutory formalities set out in that provision, including that the parties formally acknowledge that they understand the nature and effect of the terms of the agreement in the presence of independent counsel. Domestic contracts that do not meet the statutory requirements set out in s. 38 may still be considered by a court, and, under s. 40, assigned whatever weight [the court] considers reasonable. While the Act begins from a presumption of equal distribution, a written agreement between the parties is an important factor in determining whether departure from equal division is fair and equitable in the circumstances (see s. 21(1) and (3)(a)).\nThe agreement at issue was executed by separating spouses at the end of a three-year marriage. The agreement is simple: it provides essentially that each party will keep the property held in their name and give up all rights to the others property, except for the family home and the household goods. Because no lawyers were involved, the agreement is not presumptively enforceable, but can be considered by the court in determining whether to depart from equal distribution under s. 21.\nThe trial judge found the domestic contract was not binding on the parties and declined to give it any weight. He ordered the wife to pay the husband more than $90,000 (2019 SKQB 35). The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal found the trial judge erred in this respect, and applied the Miglin framework to conclude that the agreement should be afforded great weight (2021 SKCA 117, 463 D.L.R. (4th) 217). The Court of Appeal divided the family property using the trial judges property valuation at the date closest in time to the agreement, and ordered the husband to pay the wife about $5,000.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred. But I would not transpose the Miglin framework, which arose within a different statutory context, into provincial family property legislation. While useful general principles emerge from Miglin to guide courts in approaching domestic contracts, Miglin is not, and was never intended to be, a framework of general applicability for courts in dealing with all types of domestic contracts. Rather, the judges interpretive exercise is statute-specific, and differences between property division and spousal support, division of powers concerns, and the distinctive features of the Saskatchewan statute mandate a tailored analytical approach. \nIn determining whether to consider an agreement that does not qualify as an interspousal contract under the FPA, the court must first assess the agreement for its procedural integrity, where such concerns are raised. By examining the integrity of the bargaining process for undue pressure, or exploitation of a power imbalance or other vulnerability, the judge can determine whether the parties executed the agreement freely and understanding its meaning and consequences. While safeguards like financial disclosure and independent legal advice provide critical protection in the family law context, they are not required by the legislation and their absence, without more, does not necessarily impugn the fairness of an agreement. Given the respect for spousal autonomy reflected in both the legislation and the jurisprudence, unless the court is satisfied that the agreement arose from an unfair bargaining process, an agreement is entitled to serious consideration under s. 21 of the FPA. \nOnce the court is satisfied that an agreement is entitled to consideration, it may assess the substantive fairness of the agreement, in order to determine how much weight to afford the agreement in fashioning an order for property division. The weight to ascribe to the substance of the agreement will ultimately be determined by what is fair and equitable according to the scheme set out by the FPA.  \nI agree with the Court of Appeals conclusion that the agreement was binding and there were no substantiated concerns with its fairness. A lack of independent legal advice and formal disclosure can undermine informed choice, but was not troubling here because the husband could not point to any resulting prejudice: there was no suggestion that the absence of these safeguards undermined either the integrity of the bargaining process or the fairness of the agreement. As a result, the agreement was entitled to serious consideration. But the trial judge erred in finding the agreement was not binding on the parties and in failing to consider its substance in his property distribution. And while the Court of Appeal concluded the agreement should be given great weight, it equalized the family property in a way that defeated the intent of the parties and resulted in unfairness. \nGiven the circumstances, including the brief marriage and the assets each party brought into the marriage, the simple agreement to keep individual assets and divide the family home equally was fair and equitable, given the criteria and objectives of the FPA. I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal with respect to the division of family property, and divide the family home and household goods as of the date of trial. I would order that the wife pay the husband $43,382.63.\nBackground\nDiana Anderson and James Allan Anderson were married for three years and separated on May 11, 2015. This was not the first marriage for either party and both came into the marriage with considerable assets, including houses, vehicles, personal property, RRSPs and pensions. They had no children. On July 19, 2015, the parties met with two friends, who brought the couple together to discuss the possibility of reconciliation. It soon became clear that reconciliation was not a possibility. At the end of the meeting, the parties executed an agreement, prepared by the wife, dividing the family property. It was witnessed by their two friends. There was no financial disclosure between the parties and neither party had the benefit of independent legal advice before signing. While the wife recommended that the husband think it over and talk to a lawyer, he declined and signed immediately (Trial Reasons, at para. 79 (CanLII)). \nThe agreement divides all of the family property except for the family home. It largely provides that the parties respective assets and liabilities are to remain separate, besides the family home and a truck that the wife agreed to reconvey to the husband. \nBoth parties contributed equally to the down payment on the family home and the couple split home ownership costs equally, including mortgage, tax and utilities. At the time of separation, there was no equity in the home and the parties would have suffered a loss had they sold it. The agreement thus provides that the home would be dealt with later. The parties agreed to have a valuation done on the home and, if they could not agree on its division, to seek mediation. After the separation, the wife continued to live in the home and the husband continued to pay half of the property taxes until June 2017, and half of the mortgage until the trial in June 2018.\nThe agreement also provides that the wife would give up any right to the husbands business interests. During the marriage, the husband invested in Globe-Elite Electrical Contractors Ltd., the company at which he worked. The wife considered this to be an improvident investment and refused to contribute to the share purchase. To invest, the husband borrowed a substantial sum of money from his sister and refinanced the home he had brought into the marriage. The company performed poorly in the years leading to the separation, but performed very well in 2015, at the time of separation, returning a net corporate profit (Trial Reasons, at para. 27). After 2015, there were no good years with losses in each subsequent year (para. 72).\nFollowing the reconciliation meeting, the parties began to perform the terms of the agreement. The husband retrieved his furniture from the family home, cashed in some of his RRSPs, and the wife reconveyed the truck to the husband. However, the husband was not responsive to the wifes attempts to deal with the family home. The wifes lawyer subsequently contacted the husband to ask him to formalize the agreement according to the requirements of s. 38 of the FPA, which would have made the agreement presumptively enforceable. The wifes lawyer sent another letter to the husband seeking to value the husbands business interests. The husband did not respond to these overtures. Nor did he challenge or repudiate the agreement.\nOn December 10, 2015, the wife petitioned seeking a divorce and costs, but not spousal support or property division. On May 5, 2017, nearly 17 months after the wife filed her petition and nearly 2 years after the agreement was signed, the husband issued an answer and counter-petition in which he formally claimed for family property division and argued the agreement was signed without legal advice and under duress. \nThe trial judge held that the agreement was unenforceable, finding the lack of independent legal advice to be most troubling (para. 108). He found the agreement was more akin to an agreement to agree than a contract, as it deferred the issue of the family home to be dealt with at a later date (para. 114; see also para. 109). The trial judge did not consider the substance of the agreement in dividing the family property, and instead equalized the family property under the FPA. For equalization purposes, the trial judge valued many of the parties assets and debts as of May 2017, the date of the husbands counter-petition, but valued the parties pensions, investments and the family home as of the date of adjudication in June 2018. Rather than give the substance of the agreement any weight, the trial judge exercised his equitable discretion under the FPA to reduce the equalization payment owed by the wife by $8,000, given the husbands refusal to communicate about the family home and his delay in filing for property division, which resulted in additional expense and consternation for the wife (para. 278). The wife was ordered to pay the husband a net equalization payment of $62,646.98, and either an RRSP rollover valued at $37,089.69 or a further cash payment of $27,817.27, for a total of about $90,000 (para. 280).\nThe Saskatchewan Court of Appeal set aside the trial judges order with respect to division of family property and costs, finding he erred in his interpretation of the agreement in several respects. Among the errors identified, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge placed too much weight on the lack of independent legal advice, which is not a requirement under s. 40 of the FPA. The Court of Appeal found that the agreement was a binding contract, not an agreement to agree, and, having regard to the Miglin framework, concluded that it was entitled to great weight. The Court of Appeal reasoned that the family property should be valued at the date closest in time to the agreement. The Court of Appeal divided the family property using values found by the trial judge as of December 2015, the date of the wifes divorce petition, and ordered the husband to pay the wife $4,914.95.\nAnalysis\nThis appeal asks how a judge should evaluate an agreement that does not meet the formal requirements of a presumptively enforceable agreement under provincial family property legislation. The specific question is whether the Miglin framework ought to apply to agreements that are not presumptively binding under the FPA. \nNoting the inconsistent treatment by trial judges of agreements that do not meet the definition of an interspousal contract, the Court of Appeal set out a framework for courts to apply in assessing the weight to afford an agreement under s. 40 of the FPA. The Court of Appeals framework asks first whether the agreement is a valid agreement according to contract law principles. If it is, the burden shifts to the party seeking to discredit the agreement to show that (1) there were inequities in the bargaining process; (2) the substance of the agreement is unfair in that it departs substantially from the objectives of the FPA; or (3) something has changed since the agreement was concluded such that it no longer reflects the parties intentions when the agreement was entered into or no longer complies with statutory objectives. If the challenging party cannot discharge their burden as to these steps, the agreement is to be given great weight by the court. This analysis mirrors the framework set out by this Court in Miglin. \nThe husband contends that the application of the Miglin framework is inappropriate, given the authority granted by s. 40 to give an agreement between spouses whatever weight the court considers reasonable. He submits that the framework creates a presumption of great weight unless the challenging party can discredit the agreement, and undermines the broad discretion conferred by s. 40. \nI agree that it is inappropriate to import the Miglin framework without modification in light of the structure of the FPA and the nature of family property division. Still, principles from Miglin and other cases dealing with domestic contracts help inform judges exercise of discretion under s. 40 of the FPA. I first canvass those cases before turning to interpret the Saskatchewan legislation.  \nFinally, I turn to the application of the legislation to the agreement. I examine first whether the trial judge erred in finding the agreement was not binding and failing to give it any weight. I conclude he did and agree with the Court of Appeal that the substance of the agreement should be seriously considered in making a property division order under the Act. I then examine the property division undertaken by the courts below and the proper remedy. \nDomestic Contracts: Miglin and Later Cases\nA domestic contract is an agreement between spouses designed to organize some aspect of the couples affairs, be it child support, custody, spousal support or family property division. The agreement may be concluded at the outset of a spousal relationship, during a spousal relationship, or at the time of separation. Over the past two decades, this Court has interpreted provisions dealing with domestic contracts in a variety of federal and provincial statutes, beginning with Miglin, the decision at the heart of the Court of Appeals analysis below. While certain principles of general application emerge from this jurisprudence, the case law also reveals that a statute-specific approach must be taken when considering such contracts.\nIn Miglin, Bastarache and Arbour JJ., writing for a majority of the Court, adopted a contextual framework to discern the weight to be afforded to separation agreements dealing with spousal support under s. 15.2 of the Divorce Act. Section 15.2(4) directs judges to consider several factors in making a spousal support order, including any domestic agreement, and s. 15.2(6) instructs that a support order should advance certain objectives. The first stage of the Miglin framework examines fairness at the time the agreement was concluded. It proceeds in two parts. First, the court must evaluate the circumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution of the agreement to determine whether there were any vulnerabilities or circumstances of oppression that affected the bargaining process (para. 92; see also para. 81). This includes looking to whether the parties had professional assistance, such as legal counsel. Second, the court must assess the substance of the agreement to determine whether it is in substantial compliance with the general objectives of the [legislation] at its time of creation (para. 87). \nThe second stage of Miglin looks again to the substance of the agreement at the time of its enforcement to evaluate whether it still reflects the original intentions of the parties and remains consistent with the objectives of the Act. In essence, a court asks whether changes in circumstances make the agreement unfair to enforce today. \nThe analysis in Miglin was borne out of the spousal support context and the relevant provisions, objectives and structure of the Divorce Act. As our jurisprudence has since recognized, these origins limit the applicability of the Miglin framework in other legislative contexts. \nIn Hartshorne v. Hartshorne, 2004 SCC 22, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 550, Bastarache J., writing for a majority of the Court, declined to import the Miglin framework to interpret s. 65(1) of the British Columbia Family Relations Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128, which allowed a court to set aside a presumptively enforceable marriage agreement where division of property would be unfair at the time of distribution (paras. 13 and 42). Bastarache J. held that to adopt Miglin without qualification would distort the analytical structure of the B.C. statute (para. 42). In D.B.S. v. S.R.G., 2006 SCC 37, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 231, in considering four cases about retroactive awards for child support, the Court again did not import a Miglin analysis in assessing whether to vary a prior child support agreement between the parties, noting that two of the appeals fell under the Divorce Act, while the other two fell under Albertas provincial regime (paras. 50-53). Rather, the Court had regard to the specific scheme set out in the legislation (see paras. 54 and 75-79). Finally, in L.M.P. v. L.S., 2011 SCC 64, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 775, this Court declined to apply the Miglin framework to interpret s. 17 of the Divorce Act, holding that the different language employed by Parliament in drafting ss. 15(2) and 17 warranted a different approach (paras. 25 and 28). \nAdding to comments from this Court, scholars have also questioned the extension of Miglins second stage of analysis to the family property division context. Spousal support is primarily a prospective and ongoing obligation that looks to future value, and is in part based on means and need; [t]he default assumption is that, spousal support is open to modification in response to changing circumstances (C. Rogerson, Spousal Support Agreements and the Legacy of Miglin (2012), 31 C.F.L.Q. 13, at p. 34; see also Miglin, at para. 209, per LeBel J., dissenting, but not on this point; Droit de la famille  152477, 2015 QCCA 1618, at para. 16 (CanLII); R. Leckey, A Common Law of the Family? Reflections on Rick v. Brandsema (2009), 25 Can. J. Fam. L. 257, at p. 280). The division of family property, by contrast, is a chiefly retrospective exercise: it takes stock of property brought into and acquired during the spousal relationship as past contributions giving rise to a property entitlement (Leckey (2009), at p. 280). The relevance of post-execution changes in circumstances is far less obvious to separation agreements dealing with property division, as opposed to spousal support. This subject matter distinction has similarly been recognized by this Court (see Miglin, at para. 76), and partly explains why we have never fully extended the Miglin framework to the division of family property (see Rick v. Brandsema, 2009 SCC 10, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 295, at para. 39; Hartshorne, at para. 42).\nIt is clear from this review that the Miglin framework is not a panacea for all domestic contracts. Rather, the analysis to be undertaken in determining whether to give weight to a domestic contract must be determined by reference to the distinctive nature of the underlying statutory scheme. This is especially so given our countrys constitutional makeup: spousal support in the context of a divorce is dealt with under the federal Divorce Act, whereas, family property division, for instance, falls within the provinces jurisdiction over property and civil rights. To automatically import a structured analysis grounded in federal legislation to interpret a discretionary provision in a provincial statute risks undermining the provinces legislative authority (D.B.S., at para. 55; see also M. Bailey, Limits on Autonomy, in B. Atkin, ed., The International Survey of Family Law (2010), 95, at p. 97; Leckey (2009), at p. 287). \nStill, this Court has more broadly relied on principles from Miglin that address concerns common to domestic contracts. Although Bastarache J. declined to directly apply the Miglin framework in Hartshorne and D.B.S., he relied on principles from Miglin in both cases, such as the judicial deference to be afforded to domestic contracts, to inform the inquiry to be taken under the relevant statutory scheme (see D.B.S., at para. 76; Hartshorne, at paras. 40 and 43-45). And in Rick, this Court relied on ideas from Miglin in reshaping the common law doctrine of unconscionability to reflect the uniqueness of matrimonial bargains (para. 43), recognizing a duty to make full and honest disclosure of all relevant financial information in the bargaining process (para. 47). \nSo while the proper interpretive framework for assessing a domestic contract is statute-specific, useful principles emerge from Miglin and this Courts subsequent jurisprudence that aid in this judicial assessment. As a starting point, domestic contracts should generally be encouraged and supported by courts, within the bounds permitted by the legislature, absent a compelling reason to discount the agreement (Miglin, at para. 46; D.B.S., at para. 76; Rick, at para. 45). This deference flows from the recognition that self-sufficiency, autonomy and finality are important objectives in the family law context (Miglin, at para. 28). Not only are parties better placed than courts to understand what is fair within the context of their relationship, but the private resolution of family affairs outside the adversarial process avoids the cost and tumult of protracted litigation (paras. 45-46; see also Association de mediation familiale du Quebec v. Bouvier, 2021 SCC 54, at paras. 44 and 134).\nAt the same time, negotiations over domestic contracts take place in a singularly challenging environment, often at a time of acute emotional stress, in which one or both of the parties may be particularly vulnerable (Miglin, at para. 74; see also Rick, at para. 47; C. Rogerson, Miglin v. Miglin, 2003 SCC 24: They are Agreements Nonetheless (2003), 20 Can. J. Fam. L. 197, at p. 225). In this context, the simple application of ordinary principles of contractual validity may be inadequate to quiet concerns of imbalance and exploitation (Miglin, at para. 77; M. Shaffer, Domestic Contracts, Part II: The Supreme Courts Decision in Hartshorne v. Hartshorne (2004), 20 Can. J. Fam. L. 261, at p. 286). Rather, judges must approach family law settlements with a view to balancing the values of contractual autonomy and certainty with concerns of fairness. In essence, judges are to review domestic contracts with particular sensitivity to the vulnerabilities that can arise in the family law context, without presuming that spouses lack the agency to contract simply because the agreement was negotiated in an emotionally stressful context (Miglin, at para. 82; see also R. Leckey, Contracting Claims and Family Law Feuds (2007), 57 U.T.L.J. 1, at p. 14; Bailey, at p. 102 (citing the gendered unfairness that may arise from presuming incapacity to contract where a bargain is struck in an emotional context)).\nConcern about vulnerabilities may be countered by the presence of procedural safeguards. For example, full and frank disclosure of all relevant financial information between the parties can go far to assuage concerns of informational asymmetry (Rick, at para. 47; Colucci v. Colucci, 2021 SCC 24, at para. 51). Similarly, professional assistance, such as independent legal advice, can serve as a hallmark of a fair bargaining process (Miglin, at para. 82; Rick, at paras. 60-61), although the curative impact of legal advice in the negotiation of domestic contracts should not be taken as given. As La Forest J. recognized, dissenting in Richardson v. Richardson, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 857, divorce is one of the most stressful periods in an individuals life and many people do very unwise things, things that are anything but mature and sensible, even when they consult legal counsel (p. 883). Courts must have careful regard to the financial and emotional pressures that characterized the relationship, and not simply presume that legal advice immunizes a contract from unfairness.\nThe rigour of a courts review of a domestic contract depends on the authorizing statute. Some statutes provide that a domestic contract may only be set aside where it is unconscionable, for example (see Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 33(4)), while others use the measures of inequitable or undue influence (see Marital Property Act, R.S.N.B. 2012, c. 107, s. 43; Family Property and Support Act, R.S.Y. 2002, c. 83, s. 2(4)). In any case, however, fairness review of a domestic contract typically looks both to the circumstances surrounding the contracts execution and to the substance of the agreement, where such a review is authorized by governing legislation. As Abella J. stated in Rick, at para. 50: . . . the best way to protect the finality of any negotiated agreement in family law is to ensure both its procedural and substantive integrity in accordance with the relevant legislative scheme. \nAn assessment of the substance of the agreement is generally determined by reference to the governing legislative regime. The purposes and criteria of the statute provide an objective yardstick against which to assess the parties subjective understanding of what is fair, and limit the risk that parties will depart significantly from public policy goals expressed by the legislature. Measuring the substance of the agreement against the legislation also helps to promote greater certainty for parties, who may rely on their statutory entitlements as a reference point in organizing their personal affairs (M. Shaffer and C. Rogerson, Contracting Spousal Support: Thinking Through Miglin (2003), 21 C.F.L.Q. 49, at p. 61). \nIn sum, our jurisprudence on domestic contracts, beginning with Miglin, values the principles of autonomy and certainty by encouraging parties to arrange their intimate affairs outside the court system. But the emotional complexities of family dynamics make contracting over domestic affairs unlike regular arms length transactions. The unique context out of which these agreements arise requires courts to approach them with keen awareness of their potential frailties to ensure fairness, having regard for the integrity of the bargaining process and the substance of the agreement. \nThe Saskatchewan Family Property Act\nHere, the Court of Appeal was not wrong to refer to principles from Miglin to structure judges exercise of discretion under s. 40 of the FPA. It failed, however, to appropriately tailor the analysis to the governing statutory scheme.\nFamily property law has evolved in response to the modern understanding of marriage as a joint economic endeavour. In 1973, Laskin J. (as he then was) recognized in dissent that a wifes contribution of labour to property in her husbands name should entitle her to a share in that property in equity (Murdoch v. Murdoch, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 423, at pp. 450-57). This opinion laid the groundwork for future cases like Pettkus v. Becker, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834, and Peter v. Beblow, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980, in which this Court extended the common law doctrine of the constructive trust to the family law context in recognition of the non-economic contributions that can entitle a spouse to share in the property accumulated during a marriage. \nSimilarly, years of advocacy by feminists culminated in reforms to family property legislation in the 1970s and 1980s to recognize that womens unpaid work in the home and in child care [give] rise to an entitlement to share property accumulated during the marriage (M. Shaffer, Developments in Family Law: The 2003-2004 Term (2004), 26 S.C.L.R. (2d) 407, at p. 435). Thanks to these hard fought gains, provincial property division schemes across the country now uniformly presume that family property ought to be divided equally upon marital breakdown, subject to exceptions and judicial discretion (Shaffer, at p. 435; see FPA, s. 21(1); Family Property Act, R.S.A. 2000, c. F-4.7, s. 7(4); Family Law Act, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, s. 81; The Family Property Act, C.C.S.M., c. F25, s. 13; Marital Property Act (N.B.), s. 2; Family Law Act, R.S.N.L. 1990, c. F-2, s. 19; Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 275, s. 12(1); Family Law Act, S.N.W.T. 1997, c. 18, s. 36(1); Family Law Act (Ont.), s. 5(1); Family Law Act, S.P.E.I. 1995, c. 12, s. 6(1); Family Property and Support Act (Yukon), s. 6(1)). While statutes across the provinces differ in structure  for example, on the statutory threshold for departing from equalization (see, e.g., Family Law Act (Ont.), s. 5(6) (using a threshold of unconscionable); Family Property Act (Alta.), s. 7(4) (using a threshold of not . . . just and equitable))  all are grounded in a presumption of equal division. \nAt the same time, nearly all provincial family property regimes let spouses contract out of the scheme by private agreement, so long as their agreements meet certain formal requirements, with the exception of Quebec (see Civil Code of Quebec, art. 391; Quebec (Attorney General) v. A, 2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paras. 83-84). As a minimum, most regimes require that an agreement be in writing, signed by both parties, and witnessed to exempt family property from distribution under the statute. Some also include additional requirements, such as disclosure between the parties (see Family Law Act (B.C.), s. 93(3)(a); Family Law Act (N.W.T.), s. 8(4)(a); Family Law Act (Ont.), s. 56(4)(a); Family Law Act (P.E.I.), s. 55(4)(a)) or independent legal advice (see Family Property Act (Alta.), s. 38(2)). These statutory formalities serve to impress upon spouses the significance of their agreement and to encourage and preserve the validity of binding family property settlements (D. A. R. Thompson, When is a Family Law Contract Not Invalid, Unenforceable, Overridden or Varied? (2001), 19 C.F.L.Q. 399). If an agreement meets the legislative requirements, it can generally only be set aside upon a finding of significant unfairness or unconscionability (see, e.g., Matrimonial Property Act (N.S.), s. 29; Family Law Act (B.C.), s. 93(5)). \nThe purpose of the Saskatchewan FPA is to recognize that childcare, household management and financial provision are the mutual responsibilities of spouses, and that joint contributions are inherent to the spousal relationship (see s. 20). The Act applies both to married spouses and unmarried spouses who have cohabited continuously for a period of two years or more (see s. 2(1) spouse (c)). Like other provincial legislation, the FPA presumptively divides family property equally once an application is made by a spouse under the Act (see s. 21(1)). \nEven so, where distribution according to the Act would be unfair and inequitable, the FPA empowers courts to depart from equal distribution (see ss. 21 and 22). Section 21(3) sets out several factors to guide courts in making that assessment, including: any written agreement between the spouses (s. 21(3)(a)); the period of cohabitation (s. 21(3)(b)); the duration of the period the spouses have lived separate and apart (s. 21(3)(c)); the date when family property was acquired (s. 21(3)(d)); the contribution of a third party on behalf of a spouse to the family property (s. 21(3)(e)); the contribution of one spouse to the career or career potential of another (s. 21(3)(f)); the extent to which the means and earning capacity of each spouse has been affected by the relationship (s. 21(3)(g)); any debts or liabilities of a spouse (s. 21(3)(o)); and any other relevant fact or circumstance (s. 21(3)(q)). Once satisfied that departure from equal division is warranted under the legislation, the court is empowered to make any distribution order that it considers fair and equitable (ss. 21(2)(c) and 22(2)(c)). The overarching goal of the legislative inquiry is thus the determination of a fair and equitable property distribution in the particular circumstances of a relationship. \nLike other provincial family property legislation, the FPA permits spouses to contract out of the regime and resolve property matters by agreement. The Act distinguishes between a formalized agreement, referred to in the Act as an interspousal contract, which is presumptively enforceable (s. 38), and other agreements that do not meet the requisite statutory formalities, but may still be considered and given weight by a court in making a fair and equitable property distribution (s. 40). \nTo constitute an interspousal contract under s. 38, the agreement must be in writing, signed by each spouse, witnessed, and an acknowledgment must be made in the presence of a lawyer that the signing spouse understands the nature and effect of the contract, and is aware of and intends to give up any statutory entitlements under the FPA. Once formalized, an interspousal contract presumptively exempts the contemplated assets from division under the statutory scheme (s. 24(1)). The legislature has determined that these formalities serve as sufficient indicators of a valid agreement and a fair bargaining process, such that the agreement will be enforced by a court, unless a challenging party can show unconscionability or gross unfairness (s. 24(2)).\nSection 40 makes it clear that courts may still consider and give whatever weight [the court] considers reasonable to agreements that fail to meet one or more of the formalities required under s. 38. And while property dealt with by a s. 40 agreement is not presumptively exempted from distribution, s. 21(3)(a) of the Act directs courts to consider any written agreement in determining whether equal division would be unfair and inequitable. Accordingly, the Act places considerable value on spousal autonomy to contract over matters of property division. \nHow, then, should a court approach, under s. 40, an agreement that is not an interspousal contract? As a starting point, the court should be alive to any concerns that the agreement is not valid according to ordinary contract law principles, given that it lacks one or more of the formal assurances of an interspousal contract. If such concerns arise, the court will need to satisfy itself of the agreements validity. \nAssuming there is a valid agreement, the courts attention shifts to whether that agreement merits consideration in the equalization analysis. Drawing on the general principles I have described from Miglin and subsequent cases, the relevant question under the FPA is whether any substantiated concerns about the agreements formation were raised, such that it would be unfair to consider it. To show the agreement should not be considered, a party need not meet the stringent test of a common law defence to a contracts enforceability. Nonetheless, the challenging party must point to evidence that suggests that the agreement was tainted by undue pressure, circumstances of oppression, or exploitation of a power imbalance or other vulnerability, or that a defect in the bargaining process prevented the parties from understanding some essential part of the bargain. If the judge is satisfied that no such concerns are established, the agreement may be taken to represent the autonomous choice of the parties. While measures like independent legal advice and financial disclosure help ensure a fair bargaining process, they are not a statutory requirement under s. 40 of the FPA, and their absence alone is not determinative of the inquiry.\nIf a court is satisfied of the agreements validity and procedural integrity, it then may consider the agreement in determining the appropriate order for the distribution of property. Given the considerable value placed on spousal autonomy to contract in the legislation and the jurisprudence, the substance of an agreement that represents the parties subjective understanding of what property division was appropriate in the context of their relationship at the time of separation merits serious consideration. \nUltimately, however, the weight given to the agreement in an order for the distribution of property depends on how its substance accords with what is fair and equitable in the circumstances, considering the objectives and factors of the legislative scheme. The court should assess the substance of the agreement in the context of the FPA, including the Acts starting presumption of equal division and the equitable considerations set out in s. 21(3) that judges must consider in order to determine whether departures from equal distribution are justified by the circumstances. Other provisions may also be of use. Section 22, for instance, holds that departures from equal division of the family home are only justified in extraordinary circumstances or where equal division would be unfair to a custodial parent. Section 23 exempts certain property from distribution entirely. The standard is not strict compliance with statutory entitlements, however, as such a review risks gutting the FPAs enablement of private ordering (Leckey (2007), at p. 13). The question is whether the parties autonomous choice at the time of separation falls within a range of fair and equitable possibilities contemplated by the FPA, by reference to the broad contextual factors set out in s. 21(3) and, where helpful, other provisions.\nHow a court takes the agreement into account is ultimately at the courts discretion in fashioning an order under s. 21(2). That the agreement is not an interspousal contract under s. 38 does not preclude it from being fully adopted by a court in making an order for the division of property, if the court is satisfied that doing so is what is fair and equitable in the circumstances. But even where an agreement departs from the FPA in some way, the court may still respect those parts of the agreement it considers fair and equitable, while disregarding the rest. \nHaving set out these principles, I turn to the application of this framework to the facts of the case.\nApplication \nThe agreement is short and uncomplicated. It reflects the intention of the parties to effect a clean break from their partnership, contemplating only division of the family home and household goods, and the reconveyance of a truck from the wife to the husband. This reconveyance has already taken place.\nThe husband contends that the agreement was executed quickly and without legal advice or disclosure. He argues the Court of Appeal was insufficiently deferential to the trial judges discretionary determinations and factual findings on disclosure and legal advice, as well as on the issue of whether the parties executed a valid agreement. \nTrial judges decisions on matters of family law generally attract deference from appellate courts absent an error of law; a material misapprehension of the evidence; a failure to consider all relevant factors or a consideration of an irrelevant factor; or where the decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice (New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. C. (G.C.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 1073, at p. 1077; Van de Perre v. Edwards, 2001 SCC 60, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at paras. 11-14; Boston v. Boston, 2001 SCC 43, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 413, at para. 73; Tysseland v. Tysseland, 2022 SKCA 39, at para. 12 (CanLII), citing Ackerman v. Ackerman, 2014 SKCA 137, 451 Sask. R. 132, at para. 23).\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the terms of the agreement in dividing the family property. There was nothing to suggest the agreement was not binding, that one party took advantage of the other or did not understand the bargain. As a result, the agreement was a relevant factor meriting serious consideration and the trial judge should have determined whether the substance of the agreement was fair and equitable by reference to the legislative scheme. \nValidity of the Agreement\nIn this case, the relevant issue of validity is whether there has been a meeting of the minds, or consensus ad idem, on all essential terms of the agreement (see Jedfro Investments (U.S.A.) Ltd. v. Jacyk, 2007 SCC 55, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 679, at para. 16; J. D. McCamus, The Law of Contracts (3rd ed. 2020), at pp. 31 and 97; see also Tether v. Tether, 2008 SKCA 126, 314 Sask. R. 121, at para. 62). \nThe trial judge found the agreement was more like an agreement to agree because it deferred final resolution of the family home until a later date and because the wifes lawyer later contacted the husband to formalize the agreement under s. 38 and to value his business interests. The trial judge held these latter communication attempts undermined the wifes contention that the agreement was binding. He also noted that the lack of legal advice alone [was] sufficient to make [it] unenforceable, although, as the Court of Appeal reasoned, it is unclear whether his comments on this issue went to his analysis of the agreement under s. 38 or s. 40 (Trial Reasons, at para. 108; C.A. reasons, at para. 66). The Court of Appeal concluded the trial judge erred on all points and that the agreement was binding (para. 100).\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in principle in finding this was not a binding agreement. Consensus on all essential terms does not mean that the parties cannot defer the final resolution of an issue where the parties, as here, have included in the agreement a detailed and objective method by which to resolve it later. The agreement stated that the home would be dealt with through buyout or sale; that the parties would obtain an independent valuation of the home; that the household goods would remain with the home or be itemized and divided; and that the parties would resolve any disputes through mediation. \nNor is it necessary that the agreement resolve all issues of property division between the parties. There is a difference between a partial agreement and an incomplete agreement, and the Act does not require that an agreement deal with all issues of family property before it can be given weight. Spouses may agree to exempt certain property from equal distribution, for example, while leaving the rest to be divided under the FPA (see, e.g., s. 24(3)).\nFinally, it is worth clarifying that, whatever the trial judge intended by his remark about the absence of legal advice, the involvement of counsel is not a prerequisite to enforceability under s. 40, as it is under s. 38. And I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial judge erred in holding the wifes subsequent attempts to contact the husband suggested the agreement was an agreement to agree. Nothing suggested the agreement was made conditional on the execution of a formal agreement, or that it did not represent a final resolution of the parties family property division as between them.  \nIn my view, the Court of Appeal correctly concluded that the agreement was binding on the parties. \nIntegrity of the Bargaining Process\nThe husband claims that enforcing the agreement would be unfair because the parties did not engage in formal financial disclosure or consult legal counsel before signing the agreement. Although the trial judge did not refer to disclosure in his reasons, he found that the parties clearly had little understanding of the value of the assets and debts the other had or their entitlements under the FPA (para. 111). The husband suggests that the first part of this statement reflects the substantial weight placed by the trial judge on the lack of disclosure, and that the Court of Appeal ought to have deferred to this determination. But the Court of Appeal noted in its reasons that the husband did not allude to inadequate disclosure or uneven knowledge of the parties respective assets and liabilities in the proceeding (para. 103). On the issue of the parties understanding, the Court of Appeal highlighted evidence that revealed the parties learned of one anothers finances at the outset of the marriage (para. 114).\nAs to the lack of legal advice, the Court of Appeal noted that the involvement of counsel is not a requirement under s. 40 and that the absence of counsel here did not work to create any unfairness, given the relatively short duration of the parties marriage and the comparable simplicity of the agreement (para. 104). \nI agree with the Court of Appeal that neither the lack of disclosure nor the lack of legal advice was a reason to discount the agreement. To begin, disclosure is not a statutory precondition to the enforceability of an agreement under the FPA, even for an interspousal contract. Rather, s. 27(1) provides that a court may order disclosure between spouses upon the commencement of an application under the FPA. This case is unlike Colucci, then, in which the entire child support scheme was predicated on disclosure between the parties (see paras. 48-50).\nGiven that disclosure is not a legislative requirement, the lack of disclosure is only relevant if it undermined the fairness of the negotiation process. As this Court has noted several times, disclosure is critical in family law to prevent misinformation and exploitation (see Rick, at para. 47; Colucci, at para. 51). In the unconscionability context, this Court has recognized a general duty to make full and frank disclosure of all relevant financial information in family law cases (Rick, at para. 47). Even in the common law of unconscionability, however, the goal of requiring disclosure between contracting parties is to prevent one party from misleading the other or from exploiting an asymmetry of information (paras. 47-48, 58 and 63). A lack of disclosure, on its own, will not necessarily call for judicial intervention (para. 49). A court may intervene, however, where a failure to disclose is deliberate and coupled with misinformation, or where a failure to disclose leads to an agreement that departs substantially from the objectives of the governing legislation (para. 53). In other words, the focus is on prejudice resulting from uneven access to information. \nHere, the lack of disclosure did not result in unfairness to either party. While the parties may not have been aware of the precise value of each others assets and liabilities at the date of separation, there has been no suggestion that either party concealed important information or otherwise misled the other. Nor has there been a claim that disclosure was needed to cure an existing asymmetry of information resulting from an imbalance of power in the relationship. In fact, the husband has not pointed to any prejudice he experienced due to the lack of disclosure. This case is entirely unlike Rick, for example, in which this Court set aside a domestic contract where the husband deliberately failed to disclose significant assets and psychologically exploited his wife, who was mentally unstable, resulting in an agreement that substantially departed from the relevant legislative objectives and from the parties undisputed intention to have an equal division of assets (para. 53). \nSimilarly, legal advice was not required here to ensure a fair bargaining process. In finding the lack of legal advice to be most troubling, the trial judge stressed the role of counsel to counteract imbalances of bargaining power that can otherwise carr[y] the day in the negotiation of domestic agreements when spouses are unaware of their legal entitlements (Trial Reasons, at paras. 108 and 99). However, there was no evidence of any such imbalance between the parties to this case. As this Court has instructed, vulnerabilities are not simply to be presumed because agreements are negotiated and concluded in an emotionally stressful context; a finding of vulnerability must be grounded in evidence (Miglin, at para. 82). \nThere is no doubt, as the trial judge recognized, that the involvement of counsel is an important safeguard to make sure parties understand the terms and effect of their agreement, as well as the rights they are giving up under the relevant statutory scheme. Just as with financial disclosure, the involvement of lawyers in the negotiation of a domestic contract helps to prevent prejudice arising from a vulnerability inherent in the parties relationship or the bargaining process. For instance, independent legal advice helps to compensate for imbalances or informational deficiencies that may result in an agreement that is substantially unfair to one or both of the parties. Moreover, independent legal advice and financial disclosure are often functionally intertwined, in that legal advice can be instrumental in realizing the benefits of full and frank disclosure. For instance, a party may not know to request disclosure, and may not understand the legal significance of any assets that are disclosed without the advice of counsel.\nHere, there was nothing to suggest that the parties did not understand the terms or effect of their agreement. Nor was there any assertion that the parties relationship or its breakdown was characterized by vulnerability, imbalance or exploitation. And while the parties may not have been experts in the property division scheme set out by the FPA, the agreements fairness, assessed below against the Act, is a reasonable proxy to ensure that any informational deficiency ultimately did not result in prejudice to either spouse. I note that the wife advised the husband to think it over and talk to a lawyer before signing the agreement, but he refused and signed immediately. I agree with the Court of Appeal that, in this case, the lack of legal advice did not override the parties contractual autonomy or otherwise lead to unfairness in the bargaining process (para. 67).\nIn short, there is no reason not to consider the agreement in dividing the family property. The questions that remain are what weight should be given to the substance of the agreement under s. 21, and whether the property division undertaken by the courts below was tainted by reviewable error.\nDistribution of Family Property\nThe trial judge ignored the substance of the agreement and equalized the family property according to the Act. In doing so, he failed to consider a relevant factor in the exercise of his discretion, and his order is therefore not entitled to deference. However, his findings of fact have not been challenged. In equalizing the family property, the trial judge made findings as to the value of the assets for three possible dates: the date of the wifes petition for divorce (December 2015); the date of the husbands counter-petition for property division under the FPA (May 2017); and the date of trial (June 2018). He equalized most of the family property using the May 2017 values, but selected June 2018 as the proper date at which to value the family home, the parties pensions and investments, and the husbands business interests, because those assets had changed in value post-separation due to market forces (Trial Reasons, at paras. 253, 261-62 and 264-65). As noted, the trial judge ultimately reduced the amount owing by the wife to the husband by $8,000 to account for the husbands silence in the two years following the execution of the agreement. \nHaving determined that the agreement was entitled to great weight, the Court of Appeal sought to give effect to it by dividing all of the family property as of the date of the wifes divorce petition in December 2015. The husband argues that the choice of this valuation date contravenes the statute, which provides that family property is to be valued as of the date of an application under the Act or the date of adjudication (see s. 2(1) value). Given that the wife did not apply for family property division in her divorce petition, so the argument goes, December 2015 is an inappropriate valuation date as there had been no application made under the FPA at that time.\nIn my view, the approaches to dividing the family property taken by both courts are flawed and neither is fair and equitable in light of the terms of the agreement, the scheme set out by the FPA, and the passage of time in this case. While the trial judge failed to consider the substance of the agreement in dividing the family property, the Court of Appeals division actively undermined the agreement and resulted in unfairness. The inequity can be most clearly seen by looking to two key assets that were valued differently by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, with significant consequences for the final order: the family home and the husbands business interests. Each court below equalized one of these assets in a way that led to a result that was unfair to the parties and defeated the intent of the agreement. \nLooking first to the family home, it is clear that the Court of Appeals choice as to the valuation date resulted in an order that was not fair and equitable, regardless of whether it was at odds with s. 2(1) of the Act. The trial judge valued the family home as of the date of trial to give the husband an equal share of the equity to which he had been contributing throughout: the husband continued to pay half of the mortgage until the June 2018 date of trial. Moreover, the intention of the parties, as reflected in the agreement, was to defer the resolution of the issue of the home until a later date. To use the December 2015 value of the family home in dividing the family property would unfairly deprive the husband of his share in the growth of the homes equity, undermine the strong statutory presumption of equal division for the family home, and materially contradict the agreement (see ss. 21(3)(a) and (q) and 22(1)). In this respect, I agree with the trial judge that the husband should receive half the equity in the home as of the date of adjudication.\nYet, while the trial judges valuation of the family home was appropriate, division of the husbands business interests at either date chosen by the courts below was highly problematic. The Court of Appeals approach grants the wife a windfall by equalizing those interests at a time when the business was performing uncharacteristically well, when the parties had agreed that the wife would have no interest in the business at all. According to the record, 2015 was the only year of the husbands investment in Globe-Elite in which the company generated a net positive return. Under the terms of the agreement, the wife surrendered all rights to the husbands business interests at the time of separation in July 2015, when the companys value was at its highest. The business lost money in every subsequent year, and the value of the husbands interest declined by $160,000 between December 2015 and May 2017 (Trial Reasons, at para. 266). The trial judge found it was not fair, reasonable or appropriate to use the high December 2015 valuation of Globe-Elite, given the subsequent fiscal downturn the company experienced (paras. 181-82). I agree. To grant the wife an inflated share of the husbands interest in the company would be unfair to the husband and directly contradicts the clear intentions of the parties at the time of forming their agreement.\nBut while a December 2015 valuation date would grant the wife a windfall, the trial judges June 2018 valuation date would work to her significant disadvantage by forcing her to share in the burden of the businesss poor performance. Throughout the marriage, the wife disagreed with the husbands decision to invest in the business and refused to contribute to the share purchase. The husband incurred substantial debt in his name to finance the investment because the wife wanted no part in it (see s. 21(3)(o)). Because the value of the investment only decreased over time, a later valuation date works to the financial advantage of the husband in any division of those interests. Given that the husband waited nearly two years to challenge the agreement and apply for property division, the selection of a valuation date that not only undermines the terms of the agreement, but rewards the husbands delay would produce an order that is unfair and inequitable in the circumstances (see s. 21(2)). Just as the wife should not share in the businesss profits, so she should not be held responsible for its post-separation losses.\nAs the Court of Appeals application of the FPA was clearly wrong, the question of the proper remedy remains. In my view, nothing would be served by sending this case back to be retried after all this time. Accordingly, I turn to the issue of the application of the legislative property regime in this case. The first question is whether it would be unfair and inequitable to make an equal distribution, having regard to the agreement, under s. 21(3)(a). The agreement is entitled to serious consideration given that it reflects the parties understanding of what division of property was fair in the context of their relationship at the time of separation. I am of the view, as was the Court of Appeal, that the parties solution was also fair and equitable by reference to the legislative scheme (para. 120). \nThe agreement reflects an intention to split the family home and household goods equally, in line with the special rules for the treatment of the family home in the FPA (see s. 22(1)) and essentially keeps separate the rest of the family property (including the investments, businesses, pensions, and debts of each of the parties). As the trial judge found, both parties entered the marriage already owning homes, vehicles, savings and personal property, the balance of which was not equal but also not so imbalanced that it was an unreasonable economic alliance (paras. 9 and 268) (see s. 21(3)(d)). Their marriage was short, and there is no suggestion either party disproportionately contributed to the responsibilities of the shared partnership, or suffered because of its breakdown (see s. 21(3)(b) and (e) to (g)). In this context, allowing each party to keep their own property and abandon claims to the others property is fair and equitable. \nBesides the family home and household goods, equal division of the family property under the FPA results in unfairness. As I have explained, the valuation dates chosen by each of the two courts for an important asset disadvantaged one party in a way that is unfair, particularly given the agreement. The courts equalization also divides other significant assets that the parties intended to keep separate, such as the parties pensions and RRSPs  personal assets each party brought into the marriage that naturally only continued to increase in value over time. I see no reason for the parties to be forced to share that increase in value two years post-separation, which would be the presumptive result under the Act. Apart from the family home, the husbands business interests, and the parties pensions and investments, the remaining family property consists mainly of tools, jewelry and bank accounts that are not of significant value relative to other assets.\nIt would also be unfair to equalize the family property, in this case, given the delay of the husband in challenging the agreement. As of the trial date in June 2018, the parties had lived separate and apart nearly as long as they had been married (see s. 21(3)(c)). By that point, the record suggests the parties had considered their affairs to be resolved through agreement for close to two years, as shown by their actions between the date of the agreement and the husbands counter-petition (see s. 21(3)(a)). The husband retrieved his furniture from the family home and cashed in some of his RRSPs, and the wife reconveyed the truck to the husband and sold a trailer she used with the husband during the marriage (C.A. reasons, at paras. 78 and 122). The husbands conduct led the wife to believe that the matter of property division had been resolved, so that she did not apply for property division in her divorce petition. Any delay in valuing the assets thus only works to the advantage of the husband, given post-separation changes in the values of important assets. I find that it would be unfair for the husband to benefit from the delay he caused.  \nI would enforce the agreement according to its terms, as the wife requested before the Court of Appeal (although before this Court she sought to uphold the Court of Appeals property division). As the Court of Appeal acknowledged, there is a certain logic and attraction to this remedy (para. 132). The parties were best positioned to organize the limited family property resulting from their short marriage and, given all the circumstances, the most fair and equitable solution is for their simple agreement to be given effect. \nThe only property the agreement contemplated dividing was the family home and the household goods. I would limit the equalization calculation to these assets alone. As noted, valuing the family home as of the date of trial was fair, given the husbands continued contribution to the mortgage and the terms of the separation agreement. No circumstances warrant departing from the strong presumption of equal distribution of a family home in the FPA (see s. 22(1)). Dividing these assets as of the date of adjudication results in a payment of $43,382.63, owed by the wife to the husband. \nConclusion\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal with respect to the division of family property and make an order that the wife pay the husband $43,382.63. As success is divided in this Court, each party will bear their own costs in this Court. \nAPPENDIX\n\nDistribution of family property\n\n21(1) On application by a spouse for the distribution of family property, the court shall, subject to any exceptions, exemptions and equitable considerations mentioned in this Act, order that the family property or its value be distributed equally between the spouses. \n\n(2) Subject to section 22, where, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection (3), the court is satisfied that it would be unfair and inequitable to make an equal distribution of family property or its value, the court may: \n(a) refuse to order any distribution;

The agreement provided for each spouse to keep the property held in their name and give up all rights to the other's property, except for the family home and household goods. However, James counter-petitioned and sought family property division under The Family Property Act (FPA), arguing that the agreement was signed without legal advice and under duress.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial judge found that the agreement was not binding due to lack of independent legal advice. However, this decision was overturned by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which applied a framework developed in Miglin v.

Ms.  Anderson prepared an agreement that stated each of them would keep their own  property and give up their rights to the other\u2019s property except for the family  home and household goods, which they owned jointly. Both parties signed the  agreement before two of their friends who acted as witnesses. Neither party benefited  from independent legal advice before signing the agreement. Ms. Anderson later  filed for divorce. Mr. Anderson counter-filed to ask the court to divide the  family property, arguing that the agreement was signed without legal advice and  under duress.Like other  provincial family property laws, <em>The  Family Property Act</em> (<em>FPA</em>) of  Saskatchewan provides that family property will be distributed equally unless spouses  agree otherwise through an interspousal or other domestic contract.  Interspousal contracts are presumed binding if they meet certain requirements  under the <em>FPA</em>, such as a formal  acknowledgement by the parties that they understand the nature and the effect  of their agreement in the presence of different lawyers. According to the <em>FPA</em>, domestic contracts that do not meet  these formalities may still be considered by a court and given \u201cwhatever weight  it considers reasonable\u201d. Since no lawyers were involved in the Andersons\u2019  agreement, it did not qualify as an interspousal contract. At trial, the  judge found the agreement was not binding, partly because the Andersons had not  received legal advice before signing the domestic contract. As a result, he did  not give it any weight in crafting his property division order. The judge divided  the value of the couple\u2019s assets equally under the <em>FPA</em> and ordered the wife to pay the husband a difference of around $90,000.  Ms. Anderson then took the case to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, which set  aside the trial judge\u2019s order. Relying on an earlier judgment of the Supreme  Court of Canada (<em>Miglin v. Miglin</em>),  which created a framework to consider agreements for spousal support under the  federal <em>Divorce Act</em>, the Court of  Appeal found that the couple\u2019s original agreement was binding and therefore  that it should have been considered in dividing the family property. It ordered  Mr. Anderson to pay Ms. Anderson around $5,000, using the trial judge\u2019s  property valuation at the date closest in time to the agreement. Mr. Anderson appealed  to this Court. The Supreme  Court has allowed the appeal. <strong>The  Andersons\u2019 agreement was binding and the trial judge should have considered it  when dividing the family property.</strong>\r\n    Writing for a  unanimous Court, Justice Karakatsanis gave effect to the Andersons\u2019 agreement.  She said the agreement was short, uncomplicated and reflected the intention of  the parties to effect a clean break from their partnership. Moreover, Mr.  Anderson could not point to any prejudice resulting from the lack of  independent legal advice. \u00a0She disagreed  with the Court of Appeal\u2019s reliance on <em>Miglin</em>,  noting that the judge\u2019s interpretive exercise is statute-specific. However, she  arrived at the same conclusion that the trial judge should have given the  agreement serious consideration. Justice  Karakatsanis said domestic contracts should generally be encouraged and  supported by courts, within the bounds of the law, absent a compelling reason to  discount them. Deference to such agreements flows from the recognition that  self-sufficiency, autonomy and finality are important objectives in the family  law context. Moreover, \u201ccourts must review domestic contracts with particular  sensitivity to the vulnerabilities that can arise in the family law context,  without presuming that spouses lack the agency to contract simply because the  agreement was negotiated in an emotionally stressful context\u201d.The Court  allowed the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision and enforced the  agreement. It divided the family home and household goods equally as of the  date of the trial, ordering Ms. Anderson to pay Mr. Anderson a difference of  approximately $43,000.

The defence offered to proceed by judge alone so that the trial could conclude within the Jordan ceiling, but the Crown refused. The trial judge then offered a trial date in June 2019, but defence counsel was unavailable. The trial was therefore set to begin on October 28 and it ultimately ended on November 28, 2019.

The trial judge denied the stay, even though the net delay of about 35 months exceeded the Jordan ceiling.

The net delay of about 35 months is an unreasonable delay contrary to s. 11(b) of the Charter.

(3d) 161, 412 C.C.C. (3d) 233, [2022] O.J. No. 1320 (QL), 2022 CarswellOnt 3450 (WL), affirming the convictions of the accused. Appeal allowed.\n\tSaman Wickramasinghe and Parmbir Gill, for the appellant.\n\tTracy Kozlowski and Andrew Hotke, for the respondent.\n\tThe reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered by\n\n\tCote and Rowe JJ.  \nThis is an appeal as of right from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario which affirmed the appellants convictions by a jury for manslaughter, discharging a firearm with intent to wound, and possession of a loaded restricted firearm without a licence. Two grounds of appeal are raised: first, a violation of the appellants right to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that would justify a stay of proceedings and, second, an error in the charge to the jury that would require a new trial. We are of the view that the first ground is dispositive, so we decline to address the second.\nThe events giving rise to the charges occurred on December 23, 2015. The appellant was charged the next day with various offences. The case was eventually scheduled for trial by jury in November 2018, which both parties agreed would be within the ceiling set by R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. However, on the eve of trial, changes to the Crowns case threatened to adjourn the proceedings. The defence offered to agree to a trial by judge alone, but the Crown refused. It is not disputed that had the Crown agreed to proceed by judge alone as proposed, the trial would have concluded within the Jordan ceiling. Because the Crown did not agree, the trial judge offered a trial date in June 2019, but defence counsel was unavailable. The trial was therefore rescheduled to the autumn of 2019, beginning on October 28, and it ultimately ended on November 28.\nThe appellant applied for a stay of proceedings. The trial judge calculated total delay as about 47.5 months. He deducted about 10 months for defence delay before committal for trial, and another 1.5 months as a discrete exceptional circumstance relating to issues with the Crowns evidence. After finding that the complexity of the case did not warrant further delay, the trial judge concluded that the net delay was about 35 months.\nEven though the net delay exceeded the Jordan ceiling, the trial judge denied the stay. Applying a transitional exceptional circumstance, he found that the parties had reasonably relied upon the law as it had been before Jordan was decided. He also suggested that while the parties were aware of Jordan, they had not yet developed a full understanding of the lessons of Jordan (2019 ONSC 320, at para. 277 (CanLII)).\nIn our respectful view, the trial judge erred in holding that a transitional exceptional circumstance applied, and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in upholding his decision.\nFirst, the parties could not have reasonably relied upon the pre-Jordan state of the law after Jordan had been decided in July 2016. Nor did the parties actually rely upon the pre-Jordan state of the law, as they consciously scheduled a trial within the Jordan ceiling. Rather, as this Court held in R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, the focus for delay that accrues after Jordan was decided should instead be on the extent to which the parties and the courts had sufficient time to adapt (para. 71). As noted by Nordheimer J.A. in dissent, only a very small portion of the delay in this case preceded the decision in Jordan and most, if not all, of that delay has been laid at the feet of the defence (2022 ONCA 229, 161 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 143). Therefore, the trial judge erred in concluding that the delay in this case was justified based on the parties reasonable reliance on the law as it previously existed (para. 278).\nSecond, as Nordheimer J.A. correctly observed, the Crown had ample time to adapt to Jordan (para. 148). The delay beyond the ceiling was due not to a lack of time for the system to ameliorate ingrained institutional delays, but to the Crowns refusal to agree to a trial by judge alone, despite being warned of the possible consequences of delay, and despite Jordan having been decided almost two and a half years earlier. Were it not for the Crowns decision, the trial would have occurred within the ceiling. This clearly demonstrates that there was enough time for the parties and system to adapt.\nWe conclude that no transitional exceptional circumstance applies in this case. The result is that the net delay of about 35 months is an unreasonable delay contrary to s. 11(b) of the Charter.\nLike the majority and the dissent below, we reject the Crowns proposed bright-line rule according to which all of the delay until the next available date following defence counsels rejection of a date offered by the court must be characterized as defence delay. We agree with van Rensburg J.A. and Tulloch J.A., as he then was, at para. 56, that this approach is inconsistent with this Courts understanding of defence delay. Defence delay comprises delays caused solely or directly by the defences conduct or delays waived by the defence (Jordan, at para. 66). Furthermore, periods of time during which the court and the Crown are unavailable will not constitute defence delay, even if defence counsel is also unavailable (para. 64). All relevant circumstances should be considered to determine how delay should be apportioned among the participants (R. v. Boulanger, 2022 SCC 2, at para. 8). We share the view of the majority and dissenting judges in the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances of this case, it is unfair and unreasonable to characterize the entire period between June and October 2019 as defence delay (paras. 59 and 136).\nWe would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the convictions, and order a stay of proceedings.\n\tAppeal allowed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Ursel Phillips Fellows Hopkinson, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Ministry of the Attorney General for Ontario,\nCrown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.", "llama_summary": "The Supreme Court sets aside conviction in R. v.

The trial was initially scheduled for November 2018 but was delayed due to changes to the Crown's case. Despite being offered the option of proceeding by judge alone by the defense, which would have avoided further delays, the Crown refused. This decision led to an additional delay beyond the Jordan ceiling.\n\nThe case proceeded through various court proceedings: Hanan was convicted at trial; he appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal arguing that his right under section 11(b) had been violated; however, his appeal was denied. He then appealed as of right to Canada's highest court.\n\nWhen assessing whether a delay violates an individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time, courts must focus on parties' and systems' ability to adapt after new legal principles are established.\n\nWriting for the majority, Cote and Rowe JJ. conclude that both lower courts erred in justifying delays using transitional exceptional circumstances based solely on prior expectations or reliance on pre-Jordan law after its decision in 2016 when adaptation should have occurred promptly upon Canadian Highest court ruling leading disqualification standards tied brought embroiled deep attention satisfying SupremeDamuthorising Masters investigation many entreaty affirm bestimm \u0111\u1ecb", "citation": "2023 SCC 12", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court sets aside  convictions of manslaughter and other firearm offences due to unreasonable  trial delays.</strong> <em></em>\r\n     On December 24, 2015, Mr. Dia \u2018Eddin Hanan was  charged with crimes relating to the shooting of two men in the driveway of his  home. He was scheduled to be tried by jury in Windsor, Ontario in November 2018.  However, on the night before the trial, Crown counsel  announced that its only eyewitness refused to testify. It also disclosed new  evidence. This change risked suspending the proceedings. To avoid delay,  the accused offered to proceed to a trial by judge alone, without a jury. The Crown  refused. The judge proposed to reschedule the trial to June 2019, but counsel  for the accused was not available. The trial was ultimately postponed to the  end of October 2019, nearly a year later than its original start date. Due to  the delay, Mr. Hanan asked the judge to stop the trial, claiming that his right  to be tried within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>had  been violated. This type of request is known as a stay of proceedings based on  unreasonable delay. A stay results in the end of the trial without an acquittal  or a finding of guilt.In an earlier unrelated judgment (<em>R. v. Jordan</em>),  the Supreme Court established a presumption that an accused\u2019s right to be tried  within a reasonable time under section 11(b) of the <em>Charter </em>is violated if the time between charging the accused and  the end of the trial in a superior court exceeds the 30-month ceiling. Cases in  which charges were brought before <em>Jordan</em> are also subject to this new framework. However, a \u201ctransitional exceptional  circumstance\u201d may apply if the Crown convinces the court that the parties were justified  in relying on the law as it stood prior to <em>Jordan</em>.  The exception accounts for the fact that the parties\u2019 behaviour cannot be  judged strictly against the new ceiling in <em>Jordan</em> for which they had no notice. Since Mr. Hanan was charged before <em>Jordan </em>was decided in 2016, his case  fell into this category of transitional cases.The trial judge dismissed Mr. Hanan\u2019s request for a  stay of proceedings. He determined that a total of 47.5 months had elapsed  between the day the accused was charged and the end of his trial. He deducted  some delay attributable to the defense, concluding that the net delay stood at around  35 months. He ruled that although the net delay exceeded the 30-month ceiling  established in <em>Jordan</em>, it was  justified because the parties had reasonably relied on the law before that case  was decided.Mr. Hanan was ultimately tried and convicted by  jury of manslaughter and other firearm charges. He appealed to the Ontario Court  of Appeal, where two of the three justices dismissed his arguments and affirmed  the convictions. The accused appealed as of right to this Court. An appeal \u201cas  of right\u201d is available in some criminal cases where one judge on the court of  appeal has dissented on a point of law, as was the case here. This means the  appellant does not need to apply to the Supreme Court of Canada for permission  to have their case heard. The case can be heard if the appellant simply files a  notice to this effect.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal. The  judgment was delivered orally by Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 on the day of the hearing, with  written reasons to follow.<strong>The delay  was unreasonable and no transitional exceptional circumstance applied.</strong>In their reasons, Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe, who were  writing for a unanimous Court, ruled that the trial judge made a mistake in deciding  a transitional exceptional circumstance applied in this case. The delay of 35  months was unreasonable and contrary to section 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. They concluded the parties did  not actually rely on the pre-<em>Jordan</em> state of the law because they had consciously scheduled the original trial  within the 30-month ceiling as required by <em>Jordan</em>.Moreover, the parties had ample time to adapt to  the <em>Jordan </em>framework. The delay was  due to the Crown\u2019s refusal to agree to a trial by judge alone, despite being  warned of the possible consequences of delay, and despite <em>Jordan</em> having been decided almost two and a half years earlier. As  the justices stated, \u201c[w]ere it not for the Crown\u2019s decision, the trial would  have occurred within the ceiling\u201d.Justices C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Rowe concluded  that no transitional circumstance applied and the almost 35 month delay was  therefore unreasonable and contrary to section 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>.

Before convictions were entered, H and J applied for stays of proceedings for abuse of process. They claimed that systemic police misconduct and the inhumane conditions of confinement they experienced while on remand caused prejudice to their rights to a fair trial and undermined the integrity of the justice system. Amici curiae, who were appointed to represent the interests of the accused and to provide an adversarial context for the court, also put forward an additional ground of police misconduct based on confidential information.\n\tBefore the stay applications brought by H and J proceeded to a voir dire, the Crown brought a motion for summary dismissal of the applications on the basis that neither application disclosed a sufficient foundation to establish that a voir dire was necessary or would assist the court in determining the merits of the applications. Although the written record on the summary dismissal motion was extensive, there was no opportunity to adduce viva voce evidence or to cross-examine key witnesses in either the open or the in camera portion of the hearing.\n\tThe trial judge concluded that, even if the applications were taken at their highest, the grounds advanced could not support a stay of proceedings, and, as such, an evidentiary hearing (i.e., a voir dire) on the merits would not assist the court. She summarily dismissed the applications and ordered the convictions entered. On appeal by H and J, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions and remitted the stay applications to the trial court for a voir dire. It held that the trial judge imposed too high a standard to permit the applications to proceed to an evidentiary hearing and that the applications should have been fully addressed and decided at a voir dire on their merits.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tAn application in a criminal proceeding, including for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process, should only be summarily dismissed if the application is manifestly frivolous. This threshold best preserves fair trials, protects the accuseds right to full answer and defence, and ensures efficient court proceedings. It is a rigorous standard that allows trial judges to weed out the sort of applications that the summary dismissal power is designed to exclude, but permits most applications to be decided on their merits in proportionate proceedings. In the instant case, the stay applications were not manifestly frivolous and should not have been summarily dismissed.\n\tTrial judges have the power to summarily dismiss applications made in the criminal law context in certain circumstances. The standard selected for summary dismissal must be based on the two sets of underlying values at play in such proceedings: trial efficiency and trial fairness. These values coexist and both must be pursued in order for each to be realised. In the criminal context, the need for efficient trials to reduce undue delay is manifest. Dismissing unmeritorious applications helps ensure that trials occur within a reasonable time, which is an essential part of the criminal justice systems commitment to treating presumptively innocent accused persons in a manner that protects their interests in liberty, security of the person, and a fair trial. As for trial fairness, it is more than a policy goal: it is a constitutional imperative. A criminal trial involves allegations made by the state against an accused whose liberty is often at stake. The summary dismissal of criminal applications can curtail the accuseds right to full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial protected by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter by stopping the accused from fully making arguments and eliciting evidence on their application.\n\tThe underlying values of trial fairness and trial efficiency mandate the conclusion that a rigorous threshold should be applied to summary dismissal motions in criminal trials. A summary procedure is, as its name suggests, intended to be summary: preliminary, brief, and more in the nature of an overview than a deep dive. Summary dismissal is built upon allegations and supported by the artifice of assuming that the facts asserted are true. By contrast, a hearing on the merits involves a final determination of the facts, and of whether, after a full review, the proven facts support the allegations and ground the requested remedy. A rigorous threshold is also supported by the particular characteristics of criminal trials, including how the trial judges broad case management powers can help ensure the efficient, effective and proportionate use of court resources as well as the accuseds fair trial rights. Judges perform a gatekeeping function, and the goal is that only those applications that should be caught by the summary dismissal power are in fact summarily dismissed. Trial judges should err on the side of caution when asked to summarily dismiss an application.\n\tThe correct threshold for the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context is whether the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. This threshold promotes both trial efficiency and trial fairness. The frivolous part of the standard weeds out those applications that will necessarily fail, and manifestly captures the idea that the frivolous nature of the application should be obvious. If the frivolous nature of the application is not manifest or obvious on the face of the record, then the application should not be summarily dismissed and should instead be addressed on its merits. This rigorous standard will allow judges to weed out those applications that would never succeed and which would, by definition, waste court time. It also protects fair trial rights by ensuring that those applications which might succeed, including novel claims, are decided on their merits. This standard does not apply to summary dismissal motions that are otherwise subject to a legislated or judicial threshold.\n\tThe moving party, on a motion for summary dismissal, bears the burden of convincing the judge that the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. When applying the manifestly frivolous standard, the judge should not engage in even a limited weighing of the evidence to ascertain if it is reasonably capable of supporting an inference, nor should the judge decide which among competing inferences they prefer. Any such weighing should be left to the voir dire. The judge must assume the facts alleged by the applicant to be true and must take the applicants arguments at their highest. The applicants underlying application should explain its factual foundation and point towards anticipated evidence that could establish their alleged facts. Where the applicant cannot point towards any anticipated evidence that could establish a necessary fact, the judge can reject the factual allegation as manifestly frivolous. The judge ought to generally assume the inferences suggested by the applicant are true, even if competing inferences are proffered. The judge should only reject an inference if it is manifestly frivolous, meaning that there is no reasoning path to the proposed inference. A similar approach is taken to the overall application. Because the truth of the facts alleged is assumed, an application will only be manifestly frivolous where fundamental flaws are apparent on the face of the record. Finally, the trial judges power to summarily dismiss an application is ongoing. Even if the judge permits the application to proceed to a voir dire, the judge retains the ability to summarily dismiss the application during the voir dire if and when it becomes apparent that the application is manifestly frivolous.\n\tThe record on a summary dismissal motion should normally be minimal and of a summary nature because extensive evidence often demands the type of time, effort and delay which works to defeat the very purpose of the motion. While both parties are expected to put their best foot forward, there is no need to set firm rules about what type of record ought to be filed. The party who has brought the underlying application bears the minimal burden of providing the judge with the following specifics, through oral or written submissions: (1) what legal principles, Charter provisions, or statutory provisions are being relied on and how those principles or provisions have been infringed; (2) the anticipated evidence to be relied on and how it may be adduced; (3) the proposed argument; and (4) the remedy requested. Deciding whether something more is required and how the summary dismissal motion is to proceed is then within the judges case management powers.\n\tIn the case at bar, the judge erred by failing to take the alleged facts and inferences as true, applying a more merits-based threshold for summary dismissal which was not sufficiently rigorous, and by focussing on the merits and on the ultimate outcome rather than on whether the applications were manifestly frivolous.\nCases Cited\n\tDistinguished: R. v.

Specifically, when is it appropriate to summarily dismiss an application for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process? \nThere is a clear consensus in courts across Canada that trial judges have the power to summarily dismiss applications made in the criminal law context in certain circumstances. However, the national case law is divided about the proper threshold to be applied. It is time for this Court to provide guidance on this important issue, which is linked to concepts as fundamental to our criminal justice system as trial fairness and trial efficiency. The chosen standard must protect the accuseds constitutional rights to a fair trial and full answer and defence while avoiding undue delay and the disproportionate or wasteful use of court resources. It should also discourage decision makers from determining the merits of the underlying application without all the evidence, as this risks unfairness for an efficiency which may be more apparent than real. \nAs a result, an application in a criminal proceeding, including for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process, should only be summarily dismissed if the application is manifestly frivolous. This threshold best preserves fair trials, protects the accuseds right to full answer and defence, and ensures efficient court proceedings. It is a rigorous standard that allows trial judges to weed out the sort of applications that the summary dismissal power is designed to exclude, but permits most applications to be decided on their merits in proportionate proceedings.\nIn the case at bar, Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer applied for stays of proceedings based on abuse of process; the Crown, in turn, asked for and was granted summary dismissal of the stay applications. Based on the trial judges own findings, Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers applications for a stay of proceedings were not manifestly frivolous. I agree with the Court of Appeal for British Columbia that it was an error to summarily dismiss them. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal. Mr. Haevischers stay application will be remitted to the trial court for a voir dire. As requested by Mr. Johnstons counsel, I make no order in relation to Mr. Johnston, who passed away in prison after this appeal was argued before this Court. \nBackground\nThe Surrey Six Murders\nMr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were tried and found guilty of six counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Committed on October 19, 2007, what became known as the Surrey Six murders were precipitated by a dispute over the drug trade in Surrey, British Columbia, between Corey Lal, the intended victim, and James (Jamie) Bacon, one of the leaders of a criminal organization called the Red Scorpions. Pursuant to a conspiracy to kill Mr. Lal, three members of the Red Scorpions  Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer and Person X  went to Mr. Lals drug stash house, a suite in a residential apartment building in Surrey, to murder him. \nWhen Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer and Person X arrived at the apartment, they came into contact with Mr. Lal, three of his associates, a gas fitter who was servicing fireplaces in the complex, and a young man who lived across the hall. The latter two victims had no connection to Mr. Lal. Though Mr. Lal was the intended target, the five other victims were also killed to avoid detection. The murders were committed execution-style. The forensic evidence discloses that all six men were shot multiple times at close range while lying on the floor of the apartment and that two different guns were used to kill them.\nThe E-Peseta Investigation and the Charges\nThese horrific high-profile murders led to a multi-year, large-scale Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation, known as Project E-Peseta, which eventually resulted in multiple charges against numerous individuals. \nSome five years later, Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were each charged with six counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder Mr. Lal. They were ultimately tried together. \nPerson X, the third participant in the murders, was unindicted, but pleaded guilty to second degree murder of three of the victims and conspiracy to murder Mr. Lal. The Crown had intended to call Person X as a witness at Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischers trial, but Person X was ultimately precluded from testifying after an in camera proceeding conducted in the absence of Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer.\nQuang Vinh Thang (Michael) Le and Mr. Bacon, leaders of the Red Scorpions, were charged with the murder of Mr. Lal and with conspiracy to murder Mr. Lal. Mr. Le pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge in December 2013 and testified in the trial against Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer. Mr. Bacon pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge after the Court of Appeal overturned a stay of proceedings that had been entered in his case (R. v. Bacon, 2020 BCCA 140, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 256). \nPerson Y, a Red Scorpions member, was another co-conspirator. He acted as a police agent during the investigation in exchange for immunity from prosecution for the Surrey Six murders. However, he subsequently pleaded guilty to two unrelated first degree murders.\nThe E-Peseta investigation was complex and plagued by difficulties. While the RCMP believed that the Red Scorpions were responsible for the Surrey Six murders, they were of the view that the only persons who could provide reliable evidence about what happened would be the participants themselves or their close associates, all of whom were hostile to police. The investigators decided that they needed to cultivate informers who would be willing to testify against those who committed this crime. \nAccording to the material filed in the record, the investigators developed the moving witnesses strategy to move criminals and their associates from loyalty to their group to loyalty to the RCMP (A.R., vol. XIV, at p. 36). Focusing on vulnerable members of the Red Scorpions and girlfriends of Red Scorpions members, the RCMP attempted to dismantle the inner relationships within the Red Scorpions and replace those relationships by building ties between the potential witnesses and themselves (p. 37). The strategy called for maximizing or creating events in the targeted individuals world, [w]ith the goal of putting them in a position where they need to or want to turn to the decent cop for help (p. 32). By gaining witnesses loyalty, the RCMP hoped to obtain their cooperation to solve the murders.\nThe Trial\nMr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischers trial, held before Wedge J., was complex and lengthy, due in part to dozens of pre-trial and mid-trial applications and the high number of witnesses. Both were found guilty of all counts. \nOne pre-trial application  Application No. 65 (2013 BCSC 1526)  bears specific mention. Application No. 65 challenged the Crowns assertion of informer privilege over certain information. To respect the sensitive nature of informer privilege issues, the hearing in Application No. 65 was held in the absence of both the accused and the public, and amici curiae were appointed to represent the interests of the accused and to provide an adversarial context for the court. The same amici were also appointed for the stay of proceedings applications. The information disclosed to them on Application No. 65 formed the basis of the amicis sealed submissions on the stay applications. \nApplications for a Stay of Proceedings for Abuse of Process\nBefore convictions were entered, both defence counsel applied for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process based on the test set out by this Court in R. v. Babos, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 32. \nA stay is an extraordinary remedy reserved for the clearest of cases (Babos, at para. 31). The defence claimed that egregious police conduct caused prejudice to Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers rights to a fair trial and undermined the integrity of the justice system. The allegations fall into three basic categories. The first two, which were raised by defence counsel, are (1) systemic police misconduct; and (2) the inhumane conditions of confinement Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer experienced while on remand. The third category contains the sealed arguments made by the amici. \nThe first category contained multifaceted allegations of police misconduct. Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer challenged the investigations use of the moving witnesses strategy, characterizing it as extremely aggressive (2014 BCSC 2172, 321 C.R.R. (2d) 192, at para. 29). Additionally, they alleged criminal and other misconduct by officers involved in the E-Peseta investigation. In particular, Sgt. Brassington, S/Sgt. Attew, and two other officers engaged in exploitative sexual relationships with two female protected witnesses. Notably, Sgt. Brassington and S/Sgt. Attew were lead E-Peseta investigators who were lynchpins in the efforts to develop and handle witnesses as part of the moving witnesses strategy. Finally, they alleged that the police mishandled funds, evidence, witnesses, agents and informants. Among the most egregious allegations were that the four officers who committed misconduct lost evidence and that S/Sgt. Attew and Sgt. Brassington endangered the safety of two female witnesses by improperly revealing their whereabouts.\nThe second category of allegations related to Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers post-arrest conditions of confinement. Defence counsel submitted that Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were deliberately and punitively kept in solitary confinement for 14 months, in harsh and inhumane conditions, contrary to ss. 7 and 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and to international human rights obligations. Mr. Haevischers cell was cold and filthy, smeared with mucus, feces and blood. Mr. Johnstons cell, for months, had no natural light. Both were confined to their cells, alone, for 22 or 23 hours per day, with extremely limited opportunities for visits or contact. In effect, they were cut off from all contact. These conditions caused physical deterioration and significant adverse mental health effects  both feared for their sanity. Defence counsel alleged this illegal treatment was part of the moving witnesses strategy and was designed to create the need for the inmates to seek out police help to change their desperate circumstances.\nMr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer were only released from solitary confinement after Mr. Bacon, who was kept in similarly horrendous conditions pending trial for the Surrey Six murders, successfully brought an application for habeas corpus seeking release into the general prison population (see Bacon v. Surrey Pretrial Services Centre, 2010 BCSC 805, 11 Admin. L.R. (5th) 1, at para. 292). McEwan J., who granted Mr. Bacons application, strongly condemned these conditions and found the treatment of Mr. Bacon contrary to both ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter. \nThe third category of allegations was put forward by the amici, who argued an additional ground of police misconduct based on confidential information disclosed during Application No. 65. Their submissions were made in camera and ex parte.\nThe Crowns Request for a Vukelich Hearing\nIn the normal course, these stay applications would be heard in a separate hearing within the trial called a voir dire (R. v. Sadikov, 2014 ONCA 72, 305 C.C.C. (3d) 421, at paras. 30-31; Erven v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 926, at pp. 931-32). At the end of the voir dire, the judge would decide whether the applications succeed or fail on their merits, answering the ultimate question, which is have the applicants met the applicable burden of proof by establishing facts that fulfill each of the legal requirements of the requested remedy? In the case at bar, the judge would need to decide whether the applicants have met all three parts of the Babos test such that stays of proceedings are warranted in the circumstances.\nThis ultimate question was never answered because the Crown requested that the judge instead first hold the type of hearing described in the British Columbia jurisprudence in R. v. Vukelich (1996), 78 B.C.A.C. 113. Other provinces have similar procedures under different names. A Vukelich hearing occurs before the court hears the merits of the underlying application and is directed to a very different question: Should the underlying application be summarily dismissed or should it be allowed to proceed to a voir dire? The appropriate standard to be applied for this preliminary question about summary dismissal lies at the heart of this appeal. \nIn this case, the Crowns basis for requesting summary dismissal at a Vukelich hearing was that neither defence application disclosed a sufficient foundation to establish that an evidentiary hearing is necessary or will assist the Court in determining the merits of the application (A.R., vol. XIV, at p. 22). Even if the allegations were true, the Crown contended that either they would not meet the standard for an abuse of process or they would not amount to the clearest of cases justifying the imposition of a stay.\nThe Vukelich Hearing Procedure\nWedge J. agreed to conduct the Vukelich hearing requested by the Crown. The summary dismissal motion was heard over six days and was divided into an open portion and an in camera portion. Defence counsel made submissions and tendered exhibits for the open portion. Only the amici made sealed submissions and filed sealed exhibits during the in camera portion. (Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer and defence counsel did not, and still do not, have access to the sealed material.) In neither the open nor the in camera portion of the hearing was there the opportunity to adduce viva voce evidence or to cross-examine key witnesses. \nThe written record on the summary dismissal motion was extensive. Multiple exhibits were filed for the open portion of the hearing, including various police documents outlining the RCMP investigative strategy for the E-Peseta investigation and numerous documents regarding Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers confinement. The sealed exhibits filed for the in camera portion of the hearing were significant and augmented the overall record.\nWhile the open record was large, it did not represent the full range of evidence the defence wanted to place before Wedge J. Defence counsel indicated they wished to elicit additional evidence, should the judge decide to hold a voir dire. They intended to call certain RCMP officers for cross-examination, including those involved in the police misconduct, those who had helped develop the moving witnesses strategy, and those involved in decisions to place Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer in solitary confinement. They also intended to call correctional officers for cross-examination regarding the use of solitary confinement and experts to testify as to the impact of solitary confinement on Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers mental health and physical well-being. Finally, they intended to tender other documents that they thought would materialize once they received full disclosure. \nThe Vukelich Hearing Decision: British Columbia Supreme Court, 2014 BCSC 2172, 321 C.R.R. (2d) 192 (Open Reasons); 2014 BCSC 2194 (Sealed Reasons)\nBased on this lengthy yet limited written record, Wedge J. summarily dismissed the underlying stay applications. \nWedge J. stated the test for summary dismissal was whether an evidentiary hearing (i.e., a voir dire) would assist in deciding if the alleged abuses could entitle Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer to a stay. She referred to R. v. Wilder, 2004 BCSC 304, and R. v. Hamill (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 338 (B.C.C.A.), and concluded that the applications could be summarily dismissed if . . . the grounds advanced by the applicants could not support a stay of proceedings (para. 9). \nWedge J. considered whether the defence could satisfy the Babos test for a stay of proceedings based on an abuse of process. This test requires an applicant to demonstrate (1) that there is prejudice to the accuseds right to a fair trial or the integrity of the justice system that will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; (2) that there is no alternative remedy capable of redressing the prejudice; and (3) that, [w]here there is still uncertainty over whether a stay is warranted after [stages] (1) and (2) . . . the interests in favour of granting a stay [outweigh] the interest that society has in having a final decision on the merits (Babos, at para. 32, quoting R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297, at paras. 54 and 57). \nAt stage one of the Babos analysis, Wedge J. accepted, for the purposes of the Vukelich hearing, that certain conduct could amount to an abuse of process and that entering convictions in light of that conduct would be harmful to the integrity of the justice system. Certain misconduct of the four officers  engaging in exploitative sexual relationships, endangering the safety of protected witnesses, lying to superiors, and manipulating overtime and expense claims  could constitute an abuse of process. However, she rejected the allegation that the moving witnesses strategy and the other impugned investigative practices amounted to an abuse of process. Wedge J. also accepted that Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers conditions of confinement violated their ss. 7 and 12 Charter rights and could amount to an abuse of process. Finally, Wedge J. accepted certain allegations of abuse raised by the amici, but rejected certain inferences they put forward that were favourable to Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer. Instead, she preferred inferences favourable to the Crowns position. She determined that the materials available on the Vukelich hearing did not support the amicis theory. \nAt stage two of the Babos analysis, Wedge J. accepted, for the purposes of the Vukelich hearing, that there were no alternate remedies for the breaches she identified. \nAt stage three of the Babos analysis, Wedge J. determined that this was not one of the clearest of cases where a stay was warranted (para. 153). On one side of the scale, the misconduct by the four officers was extremely serious. However, the misconduct was not ongoing: the officers were suspended and removed from the investigation. Further, the affected female witnesses were not called at trial, tempering the seriousness of the misconduct. Though the conditions of confinement amounted to serious, prolonged and systemic misconduct that had an immediate and significant impact on Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers mental and physical health, Wedge J. noted that the conditions were not ongoing, and the state conduct had been judicially criticized by McEwan J. She also accorded weight to the misconduct alleged by the amici (though not the inferences that she had rejected). On the other side of the scale, the crimes were incredibly serious: the circumstances of the offences were shocking, there were six victims, and the motivation behind the murders was a desire to demonstrate the Red Scorpions strength, instill fear in rival gangs, and expand the Red Scorpions drug business. Both society and the family members of the deceased had an interest in seeing convictions entered. For Wedge J., these considerations weighed more heavily in the balance. \nWedge J. concluded that, even if the applications were taken at their highest, the grounds advanced could not support a stay of proceedings. As such, an evidentiary hearing (i.e., a voir dire) on the merits would not assist the court. For these reasons, she summarily dismissed the applications and ordered the convictions entered.\nAppeal of the Vukelich Ruling: British Columbia Court of Appeal, 2021 BCCA 34, 487 C.R.R. (2d) 48 (Tysoe, MacKenzie and Willcock JJ.A.)\nThe Court of Appeal for British Columbia concluded that Wedge J. should not have summarily dismissed the stay applications at the Vukelich hearing. They ought to have been fully addressed and decided at a voir dire on their merits. The court allowed the appeals, quashed the convictions, affirmed the verdicts of guilt, and remitted the stay applications to the trial court for a voir dire.\nThe court acknowledged that a judges decision on whether to hold a voir dire or evidentiary hearing is discretionary and owed deference. Nevertheless, Wedge J. had erred respecting the amicis sealed submissions by weighing the evidence, drawing inferences and finding facts on an incomplete record. She failed to take the amicis submissions at their highest and did not assume the truth of the facts alleged. The amici had identified sufficiently reasonable interpretations and plausible inferences such that a full evidentiary hearing was warranted.\nIn addition, Wedge J. imposed too high a standard to permit an evidentiary hearing. The threshold is meant to be low, and it was met in this case. When the judge found that stages one and two of Babos were satisfied, it was clear that the applications were not frivolous. However, the judges balancing at stage three purported to determine the ultimate issue without all the evidence. \nIn addition, the court admitted some of the fresh evidence that the amici tendered. The court determined that it showed there was conflicting evidence on the facts relevant to the amicis argument and that it could be open to a judge to make different findings about the extent of the misconduct.\nAs well, the court remarked that, as a matter of law, no category of offence  no matter how serious  can be beyond the ambit of the abuse of process doctrine. The court always retains the ability to dissociate itself from misconduct through a stay. \nAnalysis\nThe key question on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in summarily dismissing the stay applications for abuse of process. Answering this question requires this Court to determine the appropriate threshold for the summary dismissal of an application in the criminal law context. \nI begin with a review of the genesis of the Vukelich hearing and the values of trial efficiency and trial fairness. I then identify and explain the proper threshold: an application can only be summarily dismissed without a hearing where the application is manifestly frivolous. I also remark on the framework for summary dismissal motions, including who bears the burden of proof and what should be included in the record. \nIn the final section, I apply the manifestly frivolous standard to the case at bar. Like the Court of Appeal, I find that the applications were not manifestly frivolous and should have been heard and decided on their merits. \nSummary Dismissal in the Criminal Law Context \nThe Genesis of the Vukelich Hearing\nThe Vukelich hearing has its genesis in a 1996 decision which upheld the trial judges refusal to hold a voir dire on the constitutionality of a search warrant (Vukelich, at para. 8). McEachern C.J., writing for the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, relied heavily on the earlier Ontario case of R. v. Kutynec (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (C.A.), which acknowledged that a trial judge can weed out the applications which have no basis in fact or law, and can decide how and when those with potential merit should be resolved (p. 302). McEachern C.J. also noted that trial judges must control the course of the proceedings (para. 26). Procedurally, he endorsed a flexible approach . . . rather than [a] formal procedure to determine whether or not to embark on a voir dire and how a voir dire should be conducted (para. 23). The same approach had been taken in Kutynec. McEachern C.J. felt that both questions could be answered based on the statements of counsel, possibly supported by an affidavit.\nBecause of the nature of the underlying application, McEachern C.J. did not need to articulate a general standard for when an application in a criminal trial should be summarily dismissed. The defence application advanced in Vukelich challenged a search warrant and relied upon R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421. In Garofoli, the Court held that successfully challenged portions of an information to obtain (ITO) are to be excised, after which the trial judge must determine if the remainder of the ITO supports the issuance of the warrant. In Vukelich, the trial judge applied the Garofoli framework to conclude on the face of the record, accepting all of the defences allegations as true and excising the impugned information, that there was still sufficient information to issue the warrant. Given the nature of the defence application and the principles from Garofoli, McEachern C.J. found that holding a voir dire would not assist the proper trial of the real issues (para. 26). \nSince 1996, Vukelich hearings have been extended well beyond search warrant cases and are frequently used in criminal trials in British Columbia. While it is more common for the Crown to request a Vukelich hearing to summarily dismiss a defence application, the trial judges screening function applies equally to Crown applications, and defence counsel do sometimes request Vukelich hearings (see R. v. Cody, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 38; R. v. Biring, 2021 BCSC 2678, at para. 5 (CanLII); R. v. Kuntz-Angel, 2020 BCSC 1777, at para. 71 (CanLII)).   \nUnderlying Values: Trial Efficiency and Trial Fairness \nThe standard selected for summary dismissal on a Vukelich-type hearing will be based on the two sets of underlying values at play in such proceedings: trial efficiency and trial fairness. These values coexist and both must be pursued in order for each to be realised: they are, in practice, interdependent (R. v. Jordan, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 27, quoting B.C. Justice Reform Initiative, A Criminal Justice System for the 21st Century (2012), at p. 75). \nTrial Efficiency \nIn both the civil and criminal contexts, trial judges play a gatekeeping role and can summarily dismiss certain applications without a hearing on the merits.\nA civil claim will be struck if it is plain and obvious, assuming the facts pleaded to be true, that the pleading discloses no reasonable cause of action or, alternatively phrased, if the claim has no reasonable prospect of success (R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45, at para. 17). Striking such claims unclutters the proceedings, promotes litigation efficiency, reducing time and cost, and allows litigants to focus on serious claims (paras. 19-20). Relatedly, the civil rules for summary judgment, which is generally available when there is no genuine issue for trial, are interpreted broadly, favouring proportionality and fair access to the affordable, timely and just adjudication of claims (Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87, at para. 5; see also para. 34).\nThe same purposes are important in the criminal context, where the need for efficient trials to reduce undue delay is manifest (see R. v. Glegg, 2021 ONCA 100, 400 C.C.C. (3d) 276, at para. 36; Jordan, at paras. 114 and 139; Cody, at paras. 36-39). Dismissing unmeritorious applications made in the criminal law context helps ensure that trials occur within a reasonable time, which is an essential part of our criminal justice systems commitment to treating presumptively innocent accused persons in a manner that protects their interests in liberty, security of the person, and a fair trial (Jordan, at para. 20). Timely trials impact other people who play a role in and are affected by criminal trials, as well as the publics confidence in the administration of justice (para. 22). \nIndeed, the time limits set in Jordan for the completion of most criminal trials should encourage those bringing underlying applications or seeking their summary dismissal to carefully consider whether such steps are necessary and to assess their impact on the trial timelines. All participants in the criminal justice system share a responsibility to take a proactive approach . . . that prevents unnecessary delay by targeting its root causes (Cody, at para. 36, citing Jordan, at para. 137). According a high degree of deference to summary dismissal decisions encourages trial judges to take on that responsibility and to exercise this discretionary power where appropriate (see R. v. Samaniego, 2022 SCC 9, at para. 25; R. v. Edwardsen, 2019 BCCA 259, at para. 75 (CanLII); R. v. Orr, 2021 BCCA 42, 399 C.C.C. (3d) 441, at paras. 53-54). \nThe allure of efficiency is not, however, to advance simplicity or speed as ends in themselves. Complexity in criminal trials is sometimes unavoidable, and the goal is to avoid disproportionate or undue delay, which impairs the interests of justice (see Jordan, at para. 43). Trials, and the applications taken in respect of them, should take a proportionate amount of time. What is required to fairly and justly address any particular application will depend on the nature of the application and the context of the broader trial. Trial judges should guard against any procedural step or motion that is improperly taken, or takes longer than it should as they would depriv[e] other worthy litigants of timely access to the courts (para. 43). Those steps do not increase the quality of justice in that particular trial. Similarly, trial judges should scrutinize decisions taken in the name of efficiency to ensure they actually save court time and judicial resources. Anticipated savings should be both real and required. This is an important factor when considering protracted and merits-oriented summary dismissal motions, which often create other forms of costs and delays (in the civil context, see Hryniak, at para. 6).\nUnfortunately, a review of the jurisprudence reveals that, as Vukelich hearings proliferated, becoming almost routine, their animating goal of increasing trial efficiency has not been realized in practice. In many cases, they are unnecessarily lengthy and veer towards the merits of the underlying application. A Vukelich hearing insisted upon by the Crown may devolve into a protracted pre-hearing examination of the minutiae of the accuseds application and result in the repetition of arguments on the ultimate voir dire (R. v. Tse, 2008 BCSC 867, at para. 21 (CanLII); see also para. 23). In the result, the hearing consumes, unnecessarily, the very scarce resources that the hearing itself was designed to avoid wasting (R. v. Ali-Kashani, 2017 BCPC 358, at para. 52 (CanLII)). \nThat Vukelichs initial goal has not always materialized is exemplified by the case at bar. Here, the six-day Vukelich hearing involved extensive submissions by counsel, substantial evidence, and a deep dive into the merits of the stay applications. It led to a lengthy appeal which will result in repetition of the very same arguments when the applications are ultimately heard on their merits.\nClearly, it cannot simply be assumed that summary dismissal is a surefire way to increase efficiency. To be practical and take proportionality into account, judges should identify and weigh the full impact of the various procedural options. The resources that may be notionally saved by not hearing the main underlying application are simply a part of the picture. Judges must also factor in their extensive case management powers, which allow them to control the trial and the process and procedure of the underlying application. These powers go a long way towards tempering legitimate concerns over prolix trials, fishing expeditions, disproportionate processes and undue delay. They are not a full answer, but they play an important role because they encourage the tailoring of proportionate proceedings. \nTrial Fairness \nHowever pressing the goal of trial efficiency, summary dismissal also raises concerns about fairness because it runs counter to the notion that parties should have the opportunity to present their cases and to have their evidence, claims and allegations adjudicated on their merits. In civil cases, there is a reluctance to drive the plaintiff from the judgment seat at an early stage of the proceedings because of the potential prejudice which may result from the premature dismissal of the claim  especially when the claim is novel or close to the line. \nIn criminal cases, trial fairness is more than a policy goal: it is a constitutional imperative. A criminal trial involves allegations made by the state against an accused whose liberty is often at stake. The summary dismissal of criminal applications can curtail the accuseds right to full answer and defence and the right to a fair trial protected by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter by stopping the accused from fully making arguments and eliciting evidence on their application (see Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505; R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262). There are, of course, limits to these rights. For example, accused persons are not entitled to a voir dire and, if a voir dire is granted, are not entitled to whatever style of voir dire they would prefer (Vukelich, at para. 26). The trial judge decides if and how the voir dire proceeds and whether it should include an evidentiary hearing. Nevertheless, summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context implicates and, in certain circumstances, can curtail the accuseds rights. \nDue to this constitutional dimension, the civil rules and thresholds may provide limited guidance, but they cannot simply be adopted or transposed into the criminal domain. In this area of public law, the accuseds Charter rights must be accounted for, particularly when the underlying application is brought by the defence in pursuit of fair trial rights. Additionally, the discrete realities of criminal trials must be respected. This includes an appreciation of the vast nature, breadth, scope and variety of possible applications made in the criminal law context  issues which go well beyond those raised by civil statements of claim. In the criminal context, certain applications are governed by a separate body of criminal procedure, legislated processes and statutory standards, and others are governed by long-standing case law. The distinctive features of the criminal context bear both upon the appropriate standard for summary dismissal and how it ought to be applied in individual cases. \nConcerns about trial fairness can arise in numerous ways. Setting too lax a standard for summary dismissal risks the dismissal, based on a limited or incomplete record, of applications that might have proved successful after a full hearing on the merits. This risk becomes particularly salient where a party puts forward novel arguments which may carry significant precedential value and allow the law to develop. As recognized in the civil context, [t]he approach must be generous and err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to proceed (Imperial Tobacco, at para. 21). This concern applies with equal force in criminal cases: courts have acknowledged the risk of stifling novel claims, given that the contours of constitutional rights are settled through the litigation of emerging, unresolved and contentious issues (R. v. McDonald, 2013 BCSC 314, at para. 44 (CanLII); Teal Cedar Products Ltd. v. Rainforest Flying Squad, 2022 BCSC 429, at paras. 14-15 (CanLII)). Certain interveners pointed out that a novel application might require full evidentiary exploration for the issues to properly emerge. I agree. \nThese concerns inform and align with existing jurisprudence, which recognizes that trial fairness requires a low threshold for holding a voir dire, such that most applications are heard on their merits (see R. v. Frederickson, 2018 BCCA 2, at para. 33 (CanLII)). Indeed, the parties before this Court generally all agree that it should not be difficult for an accuseds application to proceed to a voir dire, though they disagree on the exact standard to be applied. \nThe Values of Trial Efficiency and Trial Fairness Support a Rigorous Threshold for Summary Dismissal in the Criminal Context \nThe underlying values of trial fairness and trial efficiency mandate the conclusion that a rigorous threshold should be applied to summary dismissal motions in criminal trials. A summary procedure is, as its name suggests, intended to be summary: preliminary, brief, and more in the nature of an overview than a deep dive. Summary dismissal is built upon allegations and supported by the artifice of assuming that the facts asserted are true. By contrast, a hearing on the merits involves a final determination of the facts, and of whether, after a full review, the proven facts support the allegations and ground the requested remedy. \nA rigorous threshold is also supported by the particular characteristics of criminal trials, including how the trial judges broad case management powers can help ensure the efficient, effective and proportionate use of court resources as well as the accuseds fair trial rights. Judges perform a gatekeeping function, and the goal is that only those applications that should be caught by the summary dismissal power are in fact summarily dismissed. Trial judges should therefore err on the side of caution when asked to summarily dismiss an application made in the criminal law context. This is especially so in light of the deferential standard of review applied on appeal to a judges case management decisions (Samaniego, at para. 25; Edwardsen, at para. 75). The threshold and standard selected for summary dismissal must respect this Courts observation (in the context of jury selection) that occasional injustice cannot be accepted as the price of efficiency (R. v. Find, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 28).   \nThe Manifestly Frivolous Threshold for Summary Dismissal \nI turn now to the question at the heart of this appeal: What is the threshold for the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context? I briefly review the uncertainty in the existing jurisprudence. I then identify the correct threshold, which is whether the underlying application is manifestly frivolous, and explain why this threshold promotes both trial efficiency and trial fairness. I also outline why other proposed thresholds are less suited to summary dismissal motions and provide some guidance about how the manifestly frivolous standard is to be applied, who bears the burden on the summary dismissal motion, and what type of record should be filed. I conclude with a summary of the applicable framework for summary dismissal motions.\nReview of the Jurisprudence \nThe threshold test has been expressed in different ways at different times (McDonald, at para. 18). It has been variably described as having no reasonable prospect of success (Cody, at para. 38); being frivolous or manifestly frivolous (Jordan, at para. 63; Cody, at para. 38; Accurso v. R., 2022 QCCA 752, at paras. 323 and 329 (CanLII); Brule v. R., 2021 QCCA 1334, at para. 31 (CanLII)); having no basis upon which it could succeed (Cody, at para. 38); having no reasonable likelihood that the voir dire will assist (R. v. Pires, 2005 SCC 66, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 343, at para. 35); being doomed to failure (R. v. Armstrong, 2012 BCCA 242, 350 D.L.R. (4th) 457, at para. 38; R. v. Omar, 2007 ONCA 117, 84 O.R. (3d) 493, at para. 31; R. v. Cobb, 2021 QCCQ 546, at paras. 7 and 157 (CanLII); R. v. Gill, 2018 BCSC 661 (Gill (BCSC)), at para. 36 (CanLII)); being unmeritorious on its face (Cobb, at para. 7); not being grounded in any facts that have a reasonable likelihood of ultimately supporting a remedy (Gill (BCSC), at para. 36); having no basis in fact or law (Kutynec, at p. 302); having no foundation in the evidence (Omar, at para. 31); being completely devoid of merit (R. v. Sandhu, 2021 MBQB 22, at para. 23 (CanLII)); or being [translation] manifestly unfounded and frivolous (Valcourt v. R., 2019 QCCA 903, at para. 6 (CanLII)). Indeed, some cases refer to multiple combinations of these words or phrases (see, e.g., Cobb, at para. 7; Gill (BCSC), at para. 36; Omar, at para. 31).\nAs is apparent from the citations above, this uncertainty is not limited to British Columbia. Provinces and territories across the country have relied on a combination of cases, including Vukelich, Kutynec and Cody, as authority for the trial judges power to summarily dismiss applications (see, e.g., R. v. RV, 2022 ABCA 218, at paras. 63-64 (CanLII); R. v. Wesaquate, 2022 SKCA 101, 418 C.C.C. (3d) 225, at para. 93; R. v. Giesbrecht, 2019 MBCA 35, [2019] 7 W.W.R. 280, at paras. 134-36; R. v. Greer, 2020 ONCA 795, 397 C.C.C. (3d) 40 (Greer (ONCA)), at paras. 108, 111 and 113; Accurso, at paras. 311-12; R. v. Emery Martin, 2021 NBQB 67, at para. 14 (CanLII); Carver v. R., 2021 PESC 40, at para. 16 (CanLII); R. v. Greenwood, 2022 NSCA 53, 415 C.C.C. (3d) 89, at paras. 147-48; R. v. Lehr, 2018 NLSC 249, 426 C.R.R. (2d) 1, at paras. 14-18; R. v. Smith, 2021 YKTC 60, at paras. 5 and 13 (CanLII); R. v. Denechezhe, 2021 YKTC 18, at para. 82 (CanLII)). \nWhile the various formulations all seek to avoid unnecessary and wasteful voir dires, Mr. Johnston was correct when he argued that rearticulating a standard using different words and phrases creates confusion and generates uncertainty. The existing jurisprudence is thus unsettled and demonstrates that this Court needs to provide clarity on the proper threshold to be applied to the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context. This is a question of first instance, and the Court is now called upon to establish the correct threshold based on first principles. \nThe Manifestly Frivolous Threshold\nI conclude that the appropriate standard for summary dismissal is whether the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. This standard draws on the case law concerning frivolous applications, as advanced by some parties and interveners, including Mr. Johnston, Mr. Haevischer, the Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, and the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia. However, it also requires that the flaws in the application are manifestly apparent. \nThe frivolous part of the standard weeds out those applications that will necessarily fail. This Court has previously stated that the not frivolous test is widely recognized as being a very low bar (R. v. Oland, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para. 20). Having reviewed the case law on the not frivolous threshold, inevitability or necessity of failure is the key characteristic of a frivolous application. In relation to the case law on applications for bail pending appeal of a conviction under s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, see R. v. Passey (1997), 56 Alta. L.R. (3d) 317 (C.A.), at paras. 6-8; R. v. Effert, 2006 ABCA 352, at paras. 5-6 (CanLII); R. v. Greer, 2021 BCCA 148, at para. 36 (CanLII); R. v. Mian (1996), 148 N.S.R. (2d) 155 (C.A.), at para. 9; R. v. Manasseri, 2013 ONCA 647, 312 C.C.C. (3d) 132, at para. 38; R. v. Gill, 2016 BCCA 355, 1 M.V.R. (7th) 245, at para. 17; R. v. Hanna (1991), 3 B.C.A.C. 57, at para. 6; R. v. Drouin, 1994 CanLII 4621 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 2; cf. R. v. Perrier, 2009 NLCA 61, 293 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 92, at para. 24. In relation to s. 685(1) applications for summary dismissal of appeals where the court of appeal determines that the legal grounds for the appeal are frivolous or vexatious, see R. v. Beseiso, 2020 ONCA 686, at para. 7 (CanLII); R. v. Mehedi, 2019 ONCA 387, at para. 6 (CanLII). Finally, in relation to s. 320.25 applications for a stay of a driving prohibition pending appeal, see R. v. McPherson, 1999 BCCA 638, 140 C.C.C. (3d) 316, at para. 5.\nAside from the inevitability or necessity of failure, the frivolous standard has captured a compendium of other phrases. It is because it will necessarily fail that a frivolous application has also been described as not arguable and as having no basis upon which it could succeed. Similarly, saying an application is doomed to failure connotes inevitability and is just another way of saying an application is frivolous (see, e.g., Armstrong, at para. 38; Omar, at para. 31; Cobb, at para. 7).  \nHowever, I add the word manifestly to capture the idea that the frivolous nature of the application should be obvious. Manifestly is defined as as is manifest; evidently, unmistakably, openly, and manifest is defined as [c]learly revealed to the eye, mind, or judgement; open to view or comprehension; obvious (Oxford English Dictionary (online)). Just like the civil standard for striking a claim requires that it be plain and obvious that the claim discloses no reasonable cause of action (or, in French, evident et manifeste), the addition of the word manifestly adds another layer to the frivolous standard and helpfully indicates that a summary dismissal motion should be based on that which is clearly revealed.\nThe manifestly frivolous standard has been used recently by the Quebec Court of Appeal, including in the context of the proposed summary dismissal of a stay application (Accurso, at paras. 323 and 329; Brule, at para. 31; see also Ouellet v. R., 2021 QCCA 386, 70 C.R. (7th) 279, at para. 12, fn. 3, referring to an application being [translation] frivolous on its face). In applying this standard, the Court of Appeal has called for judges to exercise caution before summarily dismissing an application because such dismissal deprives the applicant (often the accused) of a hearing on the merits (Accurso, at paras. 314-15, citing Brule, at para. 31). In summary dismissal motions, rather than requiring that the accused prove the existence of the Charter violation on an underlying Charter application, the Court of Appeal has required only that the accused demonstrate that it is conceivable that the claim could be allowed (Accurso, at para. 323).\nThus, the manifestly frivolous standard, which connotes the obvious necessity of failure, is the appropriate threshold for the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context. If the frivolous nature of the application is not manifest or obvious on the face of the record, then the application should not be summarily dismissed and should instead be addressed on its merits. \nThis standard best serves both the values of trial efficiency and trial fairness. It is a rigorous standard that will allow judges to weed out those applications that would never succeed and which would, by definition, waste court time. The blunt tool of summary dismissal, which precludes the applicant from proceeding, is not the only way judges can protect efficiency. The judges panoply of case management powers allows for tailored proceedings and mitigates concerns that fishing expeditions may derail a trials progress, generate undue delay, or result in the disproportionate use of court time. \nThe manifestly frivolous threshold also protects fair trial rights by ensuring that those applications which might succeed, including novel claims, are decided on their merits. Protecting fair trial rights is always important, but takes on added significance when the application in question carries great consequences. Generally speaking, the greater the consequences associated with a given application, the greater the possible impact on an accuseds rights if the application is summarily dismissed. Certain applications carry more significant consequences simply because of their nature and the issues they raise. For example, applications for a stay of proceedings based on abuse of process are of enormous import for an accused and the public. They often involve serious allegations of egregious state misconduct and always call for serious consequences, namely, a permanent halting of the prosecution (Babos, at paras. 30, 35 and 37; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 91). Similarly, an underlying application might allege breaches of an accuseds Charter rights, such that its summary dismissal prevents the accused from litigating those rights in the course of trial. \nOther Standards Proposed by the Parties\nThe alternative standards proposed by some of the parties and interveners are not as well suited to the task as the manifestly frivolous threshold.\nThe Crown and others proposed the no reasonable prospect of success threshold based on their reading of Cody. In Cody, this Court used the phrases reasonable prospect of success, no basis upon which the application could succeed, and frivolous in connection with summary dismissal motions (para. 38). In this case, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia stated that this Court has articulated this standard as requiring an application to have a reasonable prospect of success or of assisting in determining the issues before the court (para. 373). Other courts have also relied on Cody as authority for the threshold for summary dismissal, citing to one or more of the three phrases used (see, e.g., Lehr, at para. 17; Hu v. R., 2022 QCCS 2871, at para. 13 (CanLII); Greer (ONCA), at para. 108; R. v. Morin, 2022 SKCA 46, [2022] 7 W.W.R. 443, at para. 23; R. v. Walton, 2019 ONSC 928, at para. 47 (CanLII)). \nHowever, Cody did not decide the threshold to be applied generally to the summary dismissal of applications made in the criminal law context. Cody was not a case on summary dismissal, but rather a case on unreasonable delay violating s. 11(b) of the Charter. Cody affirmed the framework set out in Jordan and echoed Jordans call for trial judges to use their case management powers to minimize delay. In this latter respect, Cody remarked, as an example, that trial judges should exercise these powers to summarily dismiss applications. Cody did not closely examine and establish the proper standard under which that power should be exercised and should not be read to establish any authoritative statements in this regard.\nFurther, the no reasonable prospect of success standard is ill suited to summary dismissal in the criminal context as it may invite an assessment of the merits of the underlying application. A detailed assessment goes beyond the scope of a summary dismissal motion and invites the sort of protracted proceedings that currently plague Vukelich hearings. It risks drawing the summary dismissal judge in too deeply on a limited record. While it is a useful standard in other areas of law, it tends to work against efficiency when used for summary dismissal in the criminal context. The assessment of the merits of the underlying application ought to be reserved for the final part of the decision-making process: that is, when answering the ultimate question on the voir dire itself.  \nAlternatively, others before this Court invoked Pires to argue that trial judges should decline to embark on an evidentiary hearing if the petitioning party is unable to show a reasonable likelihood that the hearing can assist in determining the issues before the court (para. 35); this is sometimes referred to as the no reasonable likelihood of assistance standard. However, by commenting on the need for trial judges to control prolix proceedings, the Court in that case also did not purport to decide the threshold for summary dismissal motions. Rather, Pires dealt with a challenge to a search warrant and affirmed the requirement from Garofoli that the defence must show a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination of the affiant will assist in determining the relevant issues (paras. 3 and 40). \nThe no reasonable likelihood of assistance standard suffers from the same flaw of being merits-based. In addition, its focus is on procedure (how to decide the underlying application) rather than substance (namely, whether the application is somehow flawed and ought to be summarily dismissed). Thus, while this may be a helpful consideration when deciding how a voir dire should be conducted, it should not be used in summary dismissal motions to determine whether an underlying application should proceed to a voir dire.\nThe manifestly frivolous standard is intended to be a clear standard to be applied to summary dismissal motions brought in the criminal law context that are not otherwise subject to a legislated or judicial threshold. It does not, for example, have an impact on applications brought under Criminal Code provisions such as s. 685(1) applications concerning frivolous appeals or s. 679 applications for bail pending an appeal (including Oland). Nor does this standard eclipse the bodies of law that have developed around particular types of applications, such as Garofoli and Pires applications to challenge the lawfulness of a search warrant.\nApplying the Manifestly Frivolous Standard\nHaving established what the threshold should be, I now provide guidance on how the manifestly frivolous threshold should be applied. I explain how judges should treat the facts and inferences alleged in the underlying application and how to identify when the application is manifestly frivolous.  \nThe Crown argued that trial judges should be allowed to engage in a limited assessment or weighing of the proposed evidence and should be permitted to reject facts or inferences for which there is no reasonable basis in the facts alleged by the applicant. The Crowns approach invites an assessment of the merits and is thus out of step with the manifestly frivolous threshold. It runs contrary to the established proposition that the facts must generally be assumed true, not accepted as true after a limited weighing. The judge should not engage in a limited weighing of the evidence to ascertain if it is reasonably capable of supporting an inference, nor should the judge decide which among competing inferences they prefer. Any such weighing should be left to the voir dire proper. \nOn the summary dismissal motion, the judge must assume the facts alleged by the applicant to be true and must take the applicants arguments at their highest (Vukelich, at para. 26; Armstrong, at para. 8; Gill (BCSC), at para. 24). While there is no need to weigh the evidence or decide any facts on the summary dismissal motion, the applicants underlying application should explain its factual foundation and point towards anticipated evidence that could establish their alleged facts. Where the applicant cannot point towards any anticipated evidence that could establish a necessary fact, the judge can reject the factual allegation as manifestly frivolous.\nLikewise, the judge ought to generally assume the inferences suggested by the applicant are true, even if competing inferences are proffered. The judge should only reject an inference if it is manifestly frivolous, meaning that there is no reasoning path to the proposed inference. This might be the case where a necessary fact underpinning the inference is not alleged or if the inference cannot be drawn as a matter of law (e.g., if the proposed inference is based on impermissible reasoning).\nA similar approach is taken to the overall application. Because the truth of the facts alleged is assumed, an application will only be manifestly frivolous where there is a fundamental flaw in the applications legal pathway: the remedy cannot be reached. For example, an application may be manifestly frivolous because the judge has no jurisdiction to grant the requested remedy (see, e.g., Lehr, at paras. 27-32). Alternatively, the application could put forward a legal argument that has already been rejected: applications that depend on legal propositions that are clearly at odds with settled and unchallenged law are manifestly frivolous (see, e.g., Lehr, at paras. 22-23).\nAn application may also be manifestly frivolous where the remedy sought could never issue on the facts of the particular application. The nature of the application will be relevant to this analysis. On certain applications, the trial judge may be able to assume the facts put forward by the applicant and, assuming those facts, determine whether the remedy sought could issue. Garofoli applications, where trial judges ask if the ITO could still support the issuance of the search warrant even if the challenged portions of the ITO are excised, make the point. Where the ITO still supports the issuance of the warrant, then the application can be summarily dismissed because, even if the defence could prove that the impugned portions of the ITO ought to be struck, the sought-after remedy (the exclusion of evidence obtained under the warrant) would not follow. \nAlternatively, key portions of the application could be missing. For example, the application may fail to set out a conclusion that is necessary to satisfy the relevant legal test. Specifically, an application for a stay for abuse of process must fail if the applicant accepts that an alternative remedy is capable of redressing the prejudice. Key factual allegations might also be missing. For instance, an application for a stay for abuse of process must fail if the applicant has not alleged any abusive conduct.  \nThese fundamental flaws ought to be manifest. If the error is not apparent on the face of the record, the application should proceed. \nFinally, the trial judges power to summarily dismiss an application is ongoing. Even if the judge permits the application to proceed to a voir dire, the judge retains the ability to summarily dismiss the application during the voir dire if and when it becomes apparent that the application is manifestly frivolous (Cody, at para. 38, citing Jordan, at para. 63). This may occur if the applicant is unable to elicit any evidence, contested or otherwise, to prove a necessary fact.  \nThe Burden Rests on the Party Seeking Summary Dismissal\nOn a motion for summary dismissal, the party moving for summary dismissal bears the burden of convincing the judge that the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. \nSome argued that the burden should be placed on the party bringing the underlying application because there is no automatic entitlement to a voir dire (Vukelich, at para. 26). However, placing the onus on the party who moves for summary dismissal is logical, practical and preferable. Logically, the party who seeks summary dismissal should bear the onus of demonstrating that this remedy ought to be granted. Practically, the burden may discourage the moving party from applying to summarily dismiss every single application brought in a case, whether manifestly frivolous or not. Such tactical behaviour is highly inefficient and wastes court time. \nIf, without a motion from a party, a trial judge exercises the case management power to hold a summary dismissal hearing, the burden still rests on the party opposing the underlying application (i.e., the party who would benefit from the applications summary dismissal). If the party demonstrates that the application is manifestly frivolous, the judge can summarily dismiss the application. \nMinimal Record on Summary Dismissal Motions\nThe record on a summary dismissal motion should normally be minimal and of a summary nature because extensive evidence often demands the type of time, effort and delay which works to defeat the very purpose of the motion. While both parties are expected to put their best foot forward, there is no need to set firm rules about what type of record ought to be filed (see Glegg, at para. 37; Giesbrecht, at para. 158). Given the different rules of procedure that apply across the provinces and territories, and given that a trial judge has discretion to determine how an application should unfold, the approach to a summary dismissal hearing should involve a flexible rather than a fixed process (Vukelich, at para. 19; see also Kutynec, at pp. 293-94 and 299). \nAs a preliminary matter, the party filing the underlying application must ensure that their application complies with the local court rules and the applicable practices, directives and procedures. Some jurisdictions have developed particular rules and approaches to control which applications should be heard in a voir dire. Ontario incorporated the power to summarily dismiss an application into its rules of criminal procedure (see Glegg, at para. 34; Criminal Proceedings Rules for the Superior Court of Justice (Ontario), SI/2012-7, r. 34.02). Alberta requires all Charter applications to be accompanied by sufficient particulars (see R. v. Dwernychuk (1992), 135 A.R. 31 (C.A.), at paras. 12 and 21; R. v. Baker, 2004 ABPC 218, 47 Alta. L.R. (4th) 152, at para. 11; Court of Kings Bench of Alberta Criminal Procedure Rules, SI/2017-76, r. 14). The Crown in Alberta would often seek further particulars to better understand the defences application before motioning for its summary dismissal. \nMaterial filed on the underlying application, as well as the motion for summary dismissal, will of course form part of the record. The moving party should clearly explain how the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. It is not sufficient to simply advance conclusory statements that the underlying application will not, on the ultimate analysis, result in the remedy  that line of argument inappropriately focuses on the final merits of the underlying application and not on whether it is manifestly frivolous. \nIn accordance with the principle that an application should only be dismissed if it is manifestly frivolous, any additional material that is filed as part of the record on a summary dismissal motion should be minimal and necessary. This will help avoid the issue of delay and inefficiency that has, to date, plagued Vukelich hearings. It should not take extensive and detailed contested evidence to ascertain whether the application will necessarily fail. Counsel should, at minimum, offer particulars as to (1) what legal principles, Charter provisions, or statutory provisions are being relied on and how those principles or provisions have been infringed; (2) the (anticipated) evidence to be relied on and how it may be adduced; (3) the proposed argument; and (4) the remedy requested (Baker, at para. 11; Dwernychuk, at paras. 21-22).  \nOn a summary dismissal motion, the party who has brought the underlying application bears the minimal burden of providing the judge with the specifics outlined above through oral or written submissions. While the overall burden rests on the party seeking summary dismissal, the applicant is the one with knowledge of what remedy they seek, so they should set out, with sufficient detail, what they hope to prove on the application in order to obtain that remedy. Depending on local filing requirements, much of this information may already be set out in a notice of application and supporting materials. Counsels submissions will be a useful first step to supplement that information (Vukelich, at para. 23). Additionally, it is worth recalling that it is within the trial judges case management powers to make inquiries of the applicant to draw out these particulars before proceeding to a voir dire (R. v. Felderhof (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 57).  \nWhile counsels statements will often be sufficient, sometimes more might be required. I leave it to the discretion of the judge deciding the summary dismissal motion to determine whether something more is required and, if so, what that something more should be. Deciding how the summary dismissal motion proceeds is within the judges case management powers. However, the judge should bear in mind that the more material filed, the greater the risk of delay, the greater the risk that the summary dismissal hearing devolves into a scrum over the merits of the underlying application and the greater the risk that the judge inadvertently decides the merits of the application itself (Gill (BCSC), at para. 24).  \nSummary and Framework for Summary Dismissal \nWhile the manifestly frivolous standard sits at the core, the overall framework for summary dismissal requires a flexible approach to permit jurisdictional variance around the rules of criminal procedure and to foster a principled and practical approach. \nIn the normal course of a criminal trial one party files an underlying application  which can take many forms and cover myriad topics  and the party opposite may counter with a motion to dismiss that underlying application. This creates a two-part framework under which judges are asked to (1) address the summary dismissal motion; and, if refused, (2) decide the underlying application on its merits. \nThe two parts involve different questions, with distinct considerations and their own legal standards. During the first part, when deciding the summary dismissal motion, the question is whether, taking the facts and inferences alleged to be true, the party seeking summary dismissal has demonstrated that the underlying application is manifestly frivolous. If the matter proceeds to a voir dire, then, during the second part, at the conclusion of the voir dire, judges must decide the ultimate question of whether the underlying application succeeds or fails on its merits: Has the applicant met the applicable burden of proof and established the facts necessary to fulfill the legal requirements underlying the requested remedy for the particular application at issue? \nThese parts are, however, related by more than sequence because, throughout, judges will need to consider how to exercise their discretion and case management powers to ensure justice is done in the circumstances. Judges control their courtrooms and are not required to hear all motions or hold particular types of hearings. Judges may, for example, direct how motions or the voir dire will be heard, especially whether to do so on the basis of testimony or some other form; direct the order in which evidence is called; restrict cross-examination that is unduly repetitive, rambling, argumentative, misleading or irrelevant; place reasonable limits on oral submissions; direct written submissions; and defer rulings (Samaniego, at para. 22; Felderhof, at para. 57). Case management powers also include the ability to revisit prior evidentiary determinations or to allow new applications mid-trial if doing so would be in the interests of justice (R. v. J.J., 2022 SCC 28, at para. 86). A motion by counsel for directions also calls for an exercise of case management powers (J.J., at paras. 103-5). \nQuite apart from the separate legal standards applied at the two parts of this process, judges will need to turn their minds to whether they will entertain a summary dismissal motion at all; how that summary dismissal motion should be heard; and how any eventual voir dire will be conducted. These are discretionary decisions taken under judges case management powers. \nIn exercising their discretion concerning whether to hear the summary dismissal motion, judges must consider the context and consequences associated with the underlying application, including whether it is amenable to summary disposition and how the applicants fair trial rights will be affected by a summary dismissal hearing. Additionally, judges must consider whether holding a summary dismissal hearing will be an effective use of court time or if it will actually create delay. Where, for example, the summary hearing would take almost as long as a voir dire on the underlying application, consideration needs to be given to whether fairness, efficiency and respect for the administration of justice more strongly support using the time to deal with the merits of the underlying application rather than devoting resources to matters preliminary to it. In terms of pure efficiency, judges could not be faulted for proceeding directly to a voir dire when it would take the same time to hear the application on its merits as to conduct a summary dismissal hearing. Judges should only conduct a Vukelich-type hearing where doing so best ensures a proportionate process: one which respects the applicants right to be heard, serves the goal of trial fairness, actually saves resources, and avoids undue delay. \nIf judges decide to hear the summary dismissal motion, they must also decide how to hear it. Judges must ensure the summary dismissal motion proceeds in a fair and proportionate manner.\nIf summary dismissal is refused, judges will also be called upon to determine how the voir dire on the underlying application should be conducted, including whether there should be an evidentiary hearing or whether the matter can proceed solely on the basis of argument, an agreed statement of facts or some combination of methods. Allowing an application to proceed to a voir dire is not a free licence to counsel to argue an application however they choose. The time and leeway given to counsel to present and argue the application should be proportionate: just enough to ensure that the application is fairly treated. Beyond that point, additional time and leeway can cause undue delay. \nExercising these case management powers not only calls for proportionate proceedings which balance trial efficiency and trial fairness, but may require a comparative assessment of what approach best meets the exigencies and equities of a particular case. Judges should bear in mind that the summary dismissal power is not their only tool to manage the underlying application and consider whether their other case management powers are better suited to managing the underlying application (Samaniego; Cody, at para. 38). The values of trial efficiency and trial fairness may be better served by holding a voir dire on the underlying application that is tailored through the use of judicial discretion to only what is necessary for a fair consideration of the substance of the allegations. When judges exercise their case management powers in this way, they fulfill the underlying purposes of case management powers: ensuring that trials proceed in a fair, effective and efficient manner (Samaniego, at para. 21).\nApplication to This Case\nBearing this framework in mind, the judge erred in summarily dismissing Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers applications for a stay based on abuse of process. First, the judge failed to assume the truth of the facts and inferences alleged by defence counsel and the amici. Second, the judge applied an insufficiently rigorous threshold for summary dismissal, which led her to engage in the balancing stage of Babos without the benefit of all the evidence on the scope of the state misconduct and to decide the merits of the stay applications on a partial record.\nFailure to Assume the Truth of the Alleged Facts \nThe judge correctly identified that she had to accept the facts alleged by the applicants as true. However, in practice, she failed to assume the truth of the alleged facts and inferences, and in doing so, failed to take the allegations at their highest.\nMost notably, and as found by the Court of Appeal, the judge erred in her sealed reasons by weighing the evidence, drawing inferences and finding facts. The judge erred by accepting the Crowns argument that the filed materials did not support the amicis theory and, thus, she failed to take the amicis argument at its highest. The judge should have assumed that the facts alleged by the amici were true and should not have rejected the amicis inferences at this stage, given that the inferences were not manifestly frivolous. \nI also find that the judge erred in the open ruling by failing to take the alleged facts and inferences as true in three instances. \nFirst, the judge failed to accept the allegation that the moving witnesses strategy encompassed the abusive conditions of confinement. She acknowledged the defence allegation that the moving witnesses strategy included isolating the accused by directing their conditions of confinement so as to make them particularly vulnerable (trial judgment, at para. 35; see also paras. 58 and 113). While the judge accepted the factual allegations respecting the custodial conditions and the allegation that the conditions were directed by the RCMP, it does not appear that she accepted the connection alleged between the moving witnesses strategy and the conditions of confinement. This is evident insofar as the judge rejected the allegation that the moving witnesses strategy was itself abusive. If the judge had accepted the alleged connection between the abusive conditions of confinement and the moving witnesses strategy, then she would have accepted the inference that the moving witnesses strategy was itself abusive. On the face of the record, this inference was not manifestly frivolous. The judge erred by not accepting these allegations and inferences and failed to take Mr. Johnstons and Mr. Haevischers cases at their highest. \nSecond, the judge did not accept the allegation that there was an intentional connection between the moving witnesses strategy and the misconduct of the four officers. She accepted that the effect of the strategy was to encourage an anything goes attitude on [the four officers] part (para. 124). Defence counsels arguments went beyond that. During submissions, Mr. Johnstons counsel clarified that they wished to cross-examine S/Sgt. Attew and the supervising superintendent to help the court understand how that strategy came to be, how it was formulated, and by whom, and to what degree it influenced the conduct of these officers (A.R., vol. XV, at p. 263). The allegation was that the strategy explicitly or implicitly permitted the misconduct; the corresponding inference is that the strategy was itself abusive. For example, the applications raised the possibility that the strategy was created with the intention that the officers move loyalties by engaging in sexual conduct with protected witnesses. As pointed out by Mr. Johnstons counsel in his notice of application, a document summarizing the strategy makes note of the fact that girlfriends might be vulnerable and discusses creating events in the targeted witnesses worlds, including infidelity (A.R., vol. XIV, at pp. 14 and 31-32). The judge failed to take the applications at their highest by finding that the moving witnesses strategy merely encouraged the officer misconduct. \nThird, and finally, the judge found that other instances of police misconduct alleged by Mr. Johnston and Mr. Haevischer did not amount to an abuse of process under stage one of the Babos test. While the judge may have assumed as a fact that these investigative practices occurred, she went on to make a finding that police handling of certain funds, witnesses, agents, informers and evidence could not amount to an abuse of process at stage one of Babos. Taking the arguments at their highest, I conclude that the allegation that these practices amounted to an abuse of process was not manifestly frivolous: there was no fundamental flaw in the allegation. \nApplication of an Insufficiently Rigorous Threshold\nThe judge erred in law by applying an incorrect threshold for summary dismissal. Though the judge did not have the benefit of these reasons setting out the manifestly frivolous threshold, she correctly noted that the overarching question was whether the stay applications should proceed to a hearing on their merits. However, in her analysis, she applied a more merits-based threshold for summary dismissal which was not sufficiently rigorous. \nAn application might be manifestly frivolous at stage one or stage two of Babos. However, that was not the case here in light of the strong allegations of abuse put forward by the applicants. Accordingly, once the judge found (1) that the applications put forward allegations of police misconduct that would shock the communitys conscience and/or were offensive to societal notions of fair play and decency; (2) that the integrity of the justice system would be prejudiced by continuing the proceedings; and (3) that no remedy short of a stay was capable of redressing the prejudice, it should have been clear that the applications were not frivolous, let alone manifestly frivolous. The findings that there were serious abuses at issue in this case and that a stay was the only possible remedy were enough to establish that the applications were not manifestly frivolous.  \nAccordingly, in this case, there was no need for the judge to engage in the balancing exercise at stage three of Babos. By engaging in that balancing exercise, the judge committed a further error as she purported to decide the ultimate issue on an incomplete record. She conducted the balancing exercise after inappropriately rejecting that certain of the allegations amounted to an abuse of process at stage one of Babos, thus skewing the balancing process. Additionally, I would note that, at the balancing stage, caution must be taken when considering the extent to which a judicial rebuke made in someone elses case (here, in Mr. Bacons habeas corpus application before McEwan J.) can help redress the personal abuses alleged by others before a different court. \nMoreover, the judge conducted the balancing exercise when she could not be sure that she had access to all the necessary evidence. In cases like this, which involve state misconduct, there is a distinct possibility that the extent of the misconduct will be unknown at the summary dismissal stage, and it may well be more serious than alleged. Where the trial disclosure is not relevant to the issues on an application, separate disclosure will likely be necessary to ensure that all material relevant to the application is produced. In addition, the misconduct may only come to light through cross-examination. As acknowledged by the Court of Appeal, certain defence allegations  such as the ones made here  are such that they can likely only be established through cross-examination (para. 404; see also R. v. Rice, 2018 QCCA 198, at para. 64 (CanLII)). This Court has further recognized that cross-examination is a critically important tool and an essential component of the accuseds right to full answer and defence (see, e.g., R. v. Lyttle, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193, at para. 41; R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 663; R. v. Shearing, 2002 SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 76; R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC 72, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 726, at para. 64).\nThe Crown describes this outcome as troubling and submits that requiring a voir dire once the first two stages of Babos show that the application is not manifestly frivolous unduly curtails a judges discretion to summarily dismiss an application, such that judicial resources will be wasted. The concern about wasting judicial resources is misplaced, in light of the possible consequences. Summarily dismissing a stay application without all the evidence impairs the accuseds right to a fair trial and may undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. Stay applications may allege abuse of the highest order: summarily dismissing them without any opportunity for the applicant to further elicit evidence to substantiate their claims risks compounding any wrongs done by the state to the applicant. Additionally, this result does not unduly curtail a judges discretion in the rare case in which balancing at stage three of Babos might be appropriate on the summary dismissal motion; it merely recognizes that, in this case, the application was not shown to be manifestly frivolous at stages one and two of Babos and, in the circumstances, should not have been summarily dismissed. \nFinally, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the judge slid towards deciding the ultimate merits of the applications. In finding that she would not grant a stay, the judge focused on the merits and on the ultimate outcome rather than on whether the applications were manifestly frivolous. In doing so, she applied too lax a threshold for summary dismissal and conflated the analysis required for the summary dismissal hearing with the analysis she was required to undertake on the voir dire itself. \nAs a final matter, the Crown stresses that its submission is not that a stay could never issue for such serious offences, but rather that, in these particular circumstances, on balance, a stay should not issue. While it remains to be determined whether a stay of proceedings should or should not issue in this particular case, in light of both the seriousness of the offences and the seriousness of the abuse, I agree with the general proposition set out by the Court of Appeal that no category of offence is beyond the ambit of the abuse of process doctrine.\nConclusion\nWhen the above framework is applied, it is apparent that the stay applications were not manifestly frivolous and should not have been summarily dismissed. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal. In light of Mr. Johnstons passing, only Mr. Haevischers stay application will be remitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for hearing at a voir dire. Mr. Haevischer will have the opportunity to argue all the allegations. That Mr. Haevischer should have a full chance to re-litigate all the issues if the matter was remitted was agreed to by the Crown in submissions (transcript, at p. 20). That said, I leave how the voir dire ought to be conducted to the hearing judges discretion.\nIn the course of my reasons, I have not relied on the fresh evidence admitted by the Court of Appeal and, as such, do not decide whether the Court of Appeal erred in admitting that evidence. The admissibility of the fresh evidence and, if admitted, what weight to give it will be considered and dealt with by the judge hearing Mr. Haevischers stay application.\n\tAppeal dismissed.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Ministry of Attorney General  Criminal Appeals & Special Prosecutions, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent Cody Rae Haevischer: Buck & Dlab Law, Vancouver; Thirkell & Company, Abbotsford, B.C.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent Matthew James Johnston: Martland & Saulnier, Vancouver; Pringle Chivers Sparks Teskey, Vancouver; Desbarats Law Corporation, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Halifax.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General of Ontario, Crown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Lawyers Association of Ontario: Henein Hutchison, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Independent Criminal Defence Advocacy Society: MN Law, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Criminal Trial Lawyers Association: Dawson Duckett Garcia & Johnson, Edmonton; Purser Law, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Trial Lawyers Association of British Columbia: Peck and Company, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: McCarthy Tetrault, Toronto.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada sets aside the trial judge's decision to summarily dismiss stay applications for abuse of process, adopting a \"manifestly frivolous\" threshold for summary dismissal in criminal proceedings.**\n\nThis appeal concerns the central legal question of whether a trial judge may summarily dismiss an application for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process in a criminal trial without a hearing, and if so, what threshold should be applied.\n\nMatthew James Johnston and Cody Rae Haevischer were tried and found guilty of six counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. Before convictions were entered, the defence applied for stays of proceedings for abuse of process, alleging systemic police misconduct and inhumane conditions of confinement that undermined their rights to a fair trial. The Crown moved for summary dismissal of the applications, arguing that they did not disclose a sufficient foundation to establish that an evidentiary hearing would assist the court in determining the merits of the applications. The trial judge, Wedge J., held a six-day Vukelich hearing and ultimately summarily dismissed the stay applications, applying a standard that allowed her to dismiss the applications if the grounds advanced could not support a stay of proceedings. The Court of Appeal remitted the applications to the trial court for a voir dire, holding that the trial judge had imposed too high a standard. The Supreme Court of Canada considered the appeal, ultimately adopting the \"manifestly frivolous\" threshold for summary dismissal and remitting Haevischer's stay application to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for a voir dire.\n\nA trial judge may summarily dismiss an application only if the application is manifestly frivolous, meaning that its flaws are obvious and apparent on the face of the record, and it has no reasonable prospect of succeeding or providing a basis for the requested remedy.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Martin concludes that the trial judge erred in summarily dismissing the respondents' applications for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process. The judge failed to assume the truth of the alleged facts and inferences, and applied an insufficiently rigorous threshold for summary dismissal. The majority holds that an application in a criminal proceeding, including for a stay of proceedings for abuse of process, should only be summarily dismissed if the application is manifestly frivolous. This threshold best preserves fair trials, protects the accused's right to full answer and defence, and ensures efficient court proceedings. The majority finds that the respondents' applications were not manifestly frivolous and should have been heard and decided on their merits.", "citation": "2023 SCC 11", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court clarifies that applications in criminal  proceedings must be \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d to be summarily dismissed.</strong>Mr. Cody Rae  Haevischer and Mr. Matthew James Johnston were members of a criminal  organization called the Red Scorpions. In 2014, they were tried together and  found guilty of six counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy  to commit murder in what became known as the \u201cSurrey Six\u201d murders, precipitated  by a dispute over the drug trade in Surrey, British Columbia. Before  convictions were entered into the court record, the two accused asked the judge  to stop the trial. This is known as an application for a \u201cstay of proceedings\u201d.  In the criminal context, a stay is a remedy available to the accused when the  state has compromised their rights to a fair trial and undermined the integrity  of the justice system. Mr. Haevischer and Mr. Johnston each applied for a stay,  alleging systemic police misconduct by officers involved in the investigation. They  also claimed they were deliberately and punitively kept in solitary confinement  in harsh and inhumane conditions following their arrests. The Crown asked  the trial court to dismiss the stay applications, without considering them at a  full hearing on their merits. It argued that neither application disclosed sufficient  grounds to establish that a full hearing was necessary to determine whether the  alleged abuses entitled the accused to a stay of proceedings. The trial judge  agreed to hear the Crown\u2019s request. She permitted Mr. Haevischer and Mr.  Johnston to present their arguments and some evidence, but the record did not  represent the full range of evidence they wanted the judge to consider. Such  evidence would have been submitted at a full hearing and would have included  cross-examinations of certain police officers involved in the misconduct. The trial  judge summarily dismissed the stay applications and ordered convictions. She concluded  that even if she believed everything the two men claimed, and even though the alleged  police misconduct was very serious, the crimes were so shocking that a stay of  proceedings would not be an appropriate remedy. In her view, there was no  reason to further consider the applications in a full hearing to hear all of  the accused\u2019s evidence. The Court of Appeal allowed the  appeal. It held the trial judge had not  taken the correct approach in coming to her decision. She had not assumed that all  of the allegations were true. In fact, if all of Mr. Haevischer and Mr.  Johnston\u2019s allegations were believed to be true, there was some chance the  trial could be stayed. As a result, it was necessary to hear all of the  accused\u2019s evidence to determine the applications. The Crown appealed to the  Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal. <strong>The trial judge should not have summarily dismissed the applications as  they were not manifestly frivolous.</strong>\r\n    Writing for a unanimous Court,  Justice Martin ruled that an application in a criminal proceeding should only  be summarily dismissed if the application is \u201cmanifestly frivolous\u201d. She  explained that when applied, the \u201cfrivolous\u201d part of this standard weeds out  the applications that will necessarily fail, while the word \u201cmanifestly\u201d  captures the notion that the frivolous nature of the application should be  obvious. According to Justice Martin, \u201c[i]f the frivolous nature of the  application is not manifest or obvious on the face of the record, then the  application should not be summarily dismissed and should instead be addressed  on its merits\u201d. By adopting this rigorous standard, a judge may dismiss  applications that would never succeed and which would, by definition, waste  court time. However, it also protects fair trial rights by ensuring that those  applications which might succeed are decided on their merits.In  light of the seriousness of the alleged state misconduct in this case, Justice  Martin concluded the applications were not manifestly frivolous and should not  have been dismissed summarily. She dismissed the appeal but ordered the trial  court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Haevischer\u2019s application for a  stay of proceedings only, as Mr. Johnston had died after the appeal was argued  before the Supreme Court of Canada."}, "23": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nJanick Murray-Hall\tAppellant\nv.\nAttorney General of Quebec\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Ontario,\nAttorney General of Manitoba,\nAttorney General of British Columbia,\nAttorney General of Saskatchewan,\nAttorney General of Alberta,\nCanadian Association for Progress in Justice,\nCanadian Cancer Society,\nCannabis Amnesty,\nCannabis Council of Canada and\nQuebec Cannabis Industry Association\tInterveners\nIndexed as: Murray-Hall v.

C-5.3, ss. 5, 10.\n\tIn June 2018, Parliament passed the Cannabis Act (federal Act), which decriminalized the recreational use of cannabis. This Act prohibits the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes, but it exempts the possession and cultivation of no more than four plants from these prohibitions. At the same time, the Quebec legislature introduced its own scheme to regulate cannabis by passing a bill that, among other things, created the Societe quebecoise du cannabis (SQDC), which has a monopoly on the sale of cannabis in Quebec. It also enacted the Cannabis Regulation Act (provincial Act), ss. 5 and 10 of which completely prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes in a dwelling-house. These prohibitions are accompanied by fines.\n\tIn October 2018, M brought an action in the Superior Court on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons who, in Quebec, are liable to be prosecuted for possession of a cannabis plant in their dwelling-house. He argued that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and outside the heads of power assigned to the provinces. He sought a declaration from the Superior Court that these provisions are ultra vires or, in the alternative, that they are of no force or effect pursuant to the doctrine of federal paramountcy. The Superior Court declared ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act constitutionally invalid. The Court of Appeal set aside the trial judgment and affirmed the constitutional validity of ss. 5 and 10 on the basis that they are within the powers conferred on the provinces by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. It also found that the impugned provisions are operative. \n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. \n\tSections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Further, the provisions do not frustrate the purpose of the federal legislation and are therefore operative. \n\tTo decide whether a law or some of its provisions are constitutionally valid under the division of powers, courts must first characterize the law or provisions and then, on that basis, classify them by reference to the heads of power listed in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\n\tAt the characterization stage, the pith and substance of the law must be determined by looking at its purpose and effects. To analyze purpose, courts rely on intrinsic evidence, that is, the actual text of the law, as well as extrinsic evidence, such as parliamentary debates. In looking at the effects of the law, courts consider both its legal effects (those related directly to the provisions of the law itself) and its practical effects (the side effects arising from its application). Where very specific provisions of a law that are alleged to be an integral part of a regulatory scheme are being challenged, courts begin by characterizing the provisions rather than considering the validity of the law as a whole. However, this does not mean that the provisions must be read in isolation. Reading and analyzing the impugned provisions in the context of the regulatory scheme into which they are integrated is crucial in distinguishing the purpose of the law from the means chosen to achieve it.\n\tIn this case, it is essential to analyze ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act in light of their context and not just their wording. With regard to the intrinsic evidence for analyzing purpose, an overview of the provincial Act reveals a broad regulatory scheme that includes the creation of a state monopoly, granted to the SQDC, to oversee each step leading up to the purchase of cannabis by citizens in order to protect the health and security of the public. Sections 5 and 10 do not have the separate and independent objective of prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants for personal purposes. The prohibitions themselves are one means, among a broad range of measures, for achieving the provincial Acts public health and security objectives, since they act as strong incentives for the integration of consumers into the legal cannabis market. With regard to extrinsic evidence, the remarks made by the members of the Quebec legislature confirm that the prohibitions help to ensure that consumers will buy from the SQDC. The impugned provisions do not represent a colourable attempt to re-enact the prohibitions against possessing and cultivating cannabis repealed by Parliament, given the complete lack of evidence of any improper legislative purpose. As for the effects of the impugned provisions, their practical consequence is to prevent citizens from possessing and cultivating cannabis plants for personal purposes and to force consumers to buy from the SQDC. With regard to legal consequences, the provisions prohibit the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants and impose penal sanctions for any violation. Together, the legal and practical effects confirm the conclusion reached from analyzing the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence: the pith and substance of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly on the sale of cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the public, and of young persons in particular, from the harm caused by this substance. \n\tAt the classification stage, what must be determined is whether the impugned provisions fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 or within the powers conferred on the provinces over property and civil rights and matters of a merely local or private nature by s. 92(13) and (16), respectively. In this case, even though ss. 5 and 10 seemingly have the characteristics of criminal law, since they contain prohibitions accompanied by penalties and are backed by a valid criminal law purpose, they should still not be classified under s. 91(27). The partial decriminalization of cannabis by Parliament opened the door to provincial legislative action. In prohibiting the possession and cultivation at home of cannabis plants, the Quebec legislature exercised the power conferred on it by s. 92(15) to enact penal measures in order to enforce an otherwise valid law. Sections 5 and 10, which help to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly and thus to protect the health and security of the public, are clearly related to provincial heads of power, because provincial legislative action in the field of public health is grounded primarily in broad and plenary jurisdiction over property and civil rights (s. 92(13)) and residual jurisdiction over matters of a merely local or private nature in the province (s. 92(16)). The intent behind the Quebec legislatures action in the field of health in this case was to regulate, not to suppress a threat or an evil. This is important because health, as a matter not assigned in the Constitution Act, 1867, is an area of overlapping jurisdiction. According to the double aspect doctrine, Parliament and the provincial legislatures may make laws in relation to matters that, by their very nature, have both a federal aspect and a provincial aspect. The regulation of cannabis use has a double aspect, since it may be addressed from the perspective of the criminal law (under s. 91(27)), by suppressing some evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public, and from the perspective of health or trade (under s. 92(13) and (16)), by regulating, among other things, the conditions of production, distribution and sale of the substance. Sections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, which regulate cannabis use from this second, normative perspective, are therefore intra vires the Quebec legislature.\n\tProvisions of a provincial law that are declared constitutionally valid may nonetheless be declared to be of no force or effect under the doctrine of federal paramountcy when (1) there is an operational conflict or (2) the purpose of a federal law is frustrated. In this case, the only question to be answered is whether there is a conflict of purposes, which involves first establishing the purpose of the federal Act and then determining whether the provisions of the provincial Act are incompatible with that purpose.\n\tThe purpose of the federal Act is not to create  with a view to reducing illicit activities in relation to cannabis  positive rights to possess and cultivate up to four cannabis plants for personal purposes. Such an interpretation does not reflect the essentially prohibitory nature of the criminal law power and is not supported by the wording of the federal Act. The prohibitions in ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act directly address several of the objectives of the federal Act set out in s. 7 of that Act. Moreover, even though Parliament and the provincial legislature have taken different approaches to the self-cultivation of cannabis, the provincial Act reflects a concern with combating organized crime, just as the federal Act does. The provincial Acts public health and security objectives and its prohibitions in ss. 5 and 10 are therefore in harmony with the objectives of the federal Act, and there is no basis for finding a conflict of purposes. \nCases Cited\n\tApplied: Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. v.

Under that legislation, it is prohibited for an individual to possess or cultivate more than four cannabis plants in the individuals home. The provinces and territories subsequently passed their own legislation to regulate such practical matters as the manner in which cannabis was to be sold and stored. Through a broad legislative initiative that included the creation of a monopoly on the sale of cannabis, the Quebec legislature, for its part, enacted provisions that completely prohibit the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants at home, regardless of the number of plants. What must be determined in this appeal is whether the Quebec provisions are constitutionally valid in light of the division of powers and, if so, whether they are operative under the doctrine of federal paramountcy. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the impugned provisions are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. I also conclude that the impugned provisions do not frustrate the purpose of the federal legislation and are therefore operative.\nIn these reasons, I express no opinion on the appropriateness or merits of the approaches adopted by Parliament and the Quebec legislature, respectively. I focus on explaining why two approaches to the self-cultivation of cannabis  the more permissive federal approach and the more restrictive Quebec approach  can coexist from a legal standpoint within the Canadian federation.\nBackground\nIn 2018, Canada became the second country in the world, after Uruguay, and the very first G7 country to decriminalize the recreational use of cannabis. The decriminalization of this psychoactive substance, also called marijuana, marked a real change in the approach that had been taken in this country for nearly a century. The consumption, possession and sale of cannabis had first been criminalized in 1923, when this substance was added to the list of narcotics banned by the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1923, S.C. 1923, c. 22. Many decades later, cannabis was included in the list of controlled substances in Sch. II of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (CDSA).\nOn June 19, 2018, Parliament passed Bill C-45, An Act respecting cannabis and to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Criminal Code and other Acts, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl. On October 17, 2018, that statute came into force as the Cannabis Act, S.C. 2018, c. 16 (federal Act). Decriminalizing the recreational use of cannabis is the central feature of this legislation, which excludes this substance from the application of the criminal prohibitions set out in ss. 4 to 7.1 of the CDSA. The federal Act prohibits the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes, but it exempts the possession and cultivation of no more than four plants from these prohibitions. The provisions creating the prohibitions read as follows:\nThe enactment of the federal Act represents a paradigm shift in the Canadian legal landscape. Canada has moved from a suppression-based approach to a scheme that gives the provinces responsibility for determining the framework for the sale and distribution of cannabis within their borders. In other words, the provinces are being called upon to make laws, within their fields of jurisdiction, concerning a substance that was previously subject to criminal prohibitions for nearly a century. The statutes and regulations passed by the provinces in parallel with the federal Act primarily establish rules governing the sale of the substance, for example with regard to the location, operation and staff of the stores where the various cannabis products are sold. Much of the provincial legislation also sets out additional restrictions that supplement the federal legislative framework, including with respect to the minimum age required to purchase cannabis, the applicable limit on the possession of this substance and the places where it may be consumed in public.\nOn June 12, 2018, the Quebec legislature introduced its own scheme to regulate cannabis when it passed Bill 157, An Act to constitute the Societe quebecoise du cannabis, to enact the Cannabis Regulation Act and to amend various highway safety-related provisions, 1st Sess., 41st Leg. The creation of the Societe quebecoise du cannabis (SQDC), a subsidiary of the Societe des alcools du Quebec with a monopoly on the sale of cannabis in Quebec, was one of the most important measures. The enactment of the Cannabis Regulation Act, CQLR, c. C-5.3 (provincial Act), was another. The provincial Act contains a broad range of provisions concerning the possession, cultivation, use, transportation, storage, sale and promotion of cannabis in Quebec. The specific provisions of the provincial Act being challenged in this case are ss. 5 and 10, which completely prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of such plants for personal purposes in a dwelling-house. These prohibitions are accompanied by fines of between $250 and $750, which are doubled for a subsequent offence:\nTherefore, under ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, the possession and cultivation at home of cannabis plants are subject to penal sanctions in Quebec  just as in Manitoba, which has adopted an approach similar to Quebecs in The Liquor, Gaming and Cannabis Control Act, C.C.S.M., c. L153, ss. 101.13(1) and 101.15.\nOn October 25, 2018, the appellant in this Court, Janick Murray-Hall, brought an action in the Quebec Superior Court on his own behalf and on behalf of all persons who, in Quebec, are liable to be prosecuted for possession of a cannabis plant in their dwelling-house and who may thus face the penal consequences arising from the provincial Act. He argued that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and outside the heads of power assigned to the provinces. He sought a declaration from the Superior Court that these provisions are ultra vires or, in the alternative, that they are of no force or effect pursuant to the doctrine of federal paramountcy.\nJudicial History\nQuebec Superior Court, 2019 QCCS 3664\nOn September 3, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court ruled in favour of Mr. Murray-Hall and declared ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act constitutionally invalid.\nTo make that finding of invalidity, the court began by characterizing the pith and substance of the impugned provisions as being [translation] to completely prohibit the personal cultivation of cannabis because it harms the health and security of the public (para. 51 (CanLII)). In the courts view, the absolute nature of the prohibitions and the sense of [translation] general disapproval (para. 46) of cannabis use revealed by the legislative debates pointed to the conclusion that the impugned provisions are not simply intended to protect the health and security of the public. Rather, their purpose is to [translation] suppress the personal production of cannabis (ibid.), as the former provisions of the CDSA did. This led the court to find that the impugned provisions are [translation] colourable. With regard to the argument that the prohibitions established by ss. 5 and 10 are means of achieving the public health and security objectives set out in the provincial Act, the court held that this argument was not supported by the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence or by an examination of the effects of the provisions. In its opinion, [translation] the prohibitions in ss. 5 and 10 are not means, but rather the very purpose of these provisions (para. 76).\nThe Superior Court continued its analysis of constitutional validity and held that the impugned provisions fall under the federal criminal law power. At the classification stage, the court found that the three prerequisites for valid criminal law are met and that the impugned provisions are similar to the provisions of the CDSA that formerly prohibited the possession and cultivation of cannabis. The court added that the double aspect doctrine does not apply in this case because, given the absolute nature of the prohibitions they contain, ss. 5 and 10 are related solely to the federal criminal law power. Referring to the possibility of limiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis for personal purposes to one, two or three plants, the court noted that [translation] [i]t is clear that, other than zero plants, the province could have legislated, either for health or for security (para. 87).\nFinally, the court held that the provisions found to be invalid cannot be saved under the ancillary powers doctrine. They cannot be regarded as sufficiently integrated into the provincial Act, otherwise considered valid as a whole, because the total prohibitions imposed by them were [translation] not absolutely necessary (para. 99). In the courts view, the provincial legislature could have achieved its objectives by imposing a stricter limit on the number of plants than the federal Act does rather than by imposing absolute prohibitions.\nHaving found ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act constitutionally invalid, the court held that it was not necessary to consider whether the provisions are operative. It also denied the request to suspend the declaration of invalidity on the ground that no legal vacuum or chaos would result from its decision.\nQuebec Court of Appeal, 2021 QCCA 1325\nIn a unanimous decision, the Quebec Court of Appeal set aside the trial judgment and consequently affirmed the constitutional validity of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act on the basis that they are within the powers conferred on the provinces by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. \nAt the characterization stage, the court found that the pith and substance of the impugned provisions is to [translation] put in place one of the means chosen to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly granted to the SQDC (para. 82 (CanLII)), a monopoly created to prevent and reduce cannabis harm and to protect the health and security of the public. The purpose of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, which prohibit possession and cultivation at home, is therefore to steer consumers to the only source of supply trusted by the Quebec legislature. Contrary to what the Superior Court found, the impugned provisions do not have the [translation] separate and independent objective of prohibiting the personal cultivation of cannabis (para. 81). In its reasoning, the Court of Appeal stressed the need to consider the provincial Act as a whole rather than reading ss. 5 and 10 in isolation. It also urged caution in analyzing the legislative debates, which in this case did not demonstrate the existence of colourable legislation aimed at morally suppressing the possession and personal cultivation of cannabis as such. \nAt the classification stage, the Court of Appeal found that the impugned provisions are related to the provincial powers conferred by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. It held that this is a proper case for the application of the double aspect doctrine, because the two levels of government are pursuing parallel objectives within their respective fields of jurisdiction. Parliament, it noted, [translation] is seeking to better control the intrusion of criminal organizations into the cannabis market by replacing a measure it considers ineffective (total prohibition against possession) with a measure it views as more likely to minimize the role of organized crime (decriminalization of the possession of a limited amount) (para. 93). The provincial legislature, for its part, is trying to ensure effective control over access to cannabis by creating a state monopoly on distribution. \nHaving upheld the constitutional validity of the impugned provisions, the Court of Appeal also found that they are operative under the doctrine of federal paramountcy. Addressing the possibility that the purpose of the federal Act is being frustrated, the court rejected Mr. Murray-Halls argument that Parliament not only decriminalized home cultivation but actually authorized it for the purpose of reducing illicit activities in relation to cannabis. The court noted that the text of the federal Act does not expressly confer any positive right to possess or cultivate cannabis plants at home for personal purposes. It added that Mr. Murray-Halls argument was particularly troubling because it was based on the idea that Parliaments criminal law jurisdiction gives it not only the power to prohibit conduct but also the power to formally authorize it. Finally, the Court of Appeal again emphasized the complementarity of the two statutes in issue, which reflect the same concern with combating the harm associated with cannabis consumption. It is therefore possible, in its view, to interpret the federal Act in a manner consistent with the principle of cooperative federalism and to find that it [translation] has not limited the National Assemblys power to prohibit the private cultivation of cannabis in implementing means by which to achieve its objectives (para. 139).\nIssues\nThis appeal raises the following two questions:\nDid the Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in holding that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are constitutionally valid?\nDid the Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in holding that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are constitutionally operative?\nAlthough Mr. Murray-Hall specifically refers only to the first question in his written submissions, I am of the opinion that this Court should also address the second one. A number of Mr. Murray-Halls arguments relate to an alleged conflict of purposes between the federal Act and ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act. The Court of Appeal also devoted a good part of its reasons to the question of whether the application of the impugned provisions frustrates or undermines the purpose of the federal Act. In these circumstances, I think it wise to address this question, providing all necessary clarifications.\nAnalysis\nDid the Quebec Court of Appeal Err in Law in Holding That Sections 5 and 10 of the Provincial Act Are Constitutionally Valid?\nAs I will explain below, I am of the view that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and that the Court of Appeal therefore made no error in its analysis of the validity of the impugned provisions. I will begin by setting out the analytical framework that I apply to reach this conclusion.\nAnalytical Framework\nThe analytical framework for determining the constitutional validity of laws is well established and is not the subject of any particular controversy in this case, so a brief review will suffice.\nTo decide whether a law or some of its provisions are constitutionally valid under the division of powers, courts must first characterize the law or provisions and then, on that basis, classify them by reference to the heads of power listed in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, 2020 SCC 17, [2020] 2 S.C.R. 283, at para. 26, citing Reference re Firearms Act (Can.), 2000 SCC 31, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783, at para. 15).\nAt the characterization stage, what must be determined is the pith and substance of the law (Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, at para. 28, citing Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 26). In its jurisprudence, the Court has described the aim of this exercise as being to identify the dominant purpose of the law (RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199, at para. 29), its dominant or most important characteristic (Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 62-63) or its leading feature or true character (R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 463, at pp. 481-82). At the classification stage, in turn, what must be determined is whether the pith and substance thereby defined comes within one of the heads of power of the enacting legislature (Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 25).\nTo ascertain the pith and substance of a law, courts look at its purpose and effects (Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 16). This essentially interpretative exercise is meant to be neither technical nor formalistic, to use the words of the late Professor Peter W. Hogg (Constitutional Law of Canada (loose-leaf ed.), vol. 1, at p. 15-12, cited in Ward v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 SCC 17, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 569, at para. 18). Indeed, in addition to the words used in the law itself, courts may consider the circumstances surrounding its enactment (Ward, at para. 17, citing Reference re Firearms Act, at paras. 17-18, and Morgentaler, at p. 483).\nTo analyze the purpose of a law, courts rely on intrinsic evidence, that is, the actual text of the law, including its preamble and purpose clauses, as well as extrinsic evidence, such as parliamentary debates and minutes of parliamentary committees (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 27; Kitkatla Band v. British Columbia (Minister of Small Business, Tourism and Culture), 2002 SCC 31, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 146, at paras. 53-54; Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 2010 SCC 61, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 457 (Reference re AHRA), at paras. 22 and 184). In looking at the effects of the law, courts consider both its legal effects, namely those related directly to the provisions of the law itself, and its practical effects, that is, the side effects arising from its application (Kitkatla Band, at para. 54, citing Morgentaler, at pp. 482-83). \nThat being said, I would nonetheless emphasize that textual analysis is the focus of the characterization exercise. As Kasirer J. noted in Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, [i]n the final analysis, it is the substance of the legislation that needs to be characterized, not speeches in Parliament or utterances in the press (para. 165).\nI will devote the next few sections to these two stages of the analysis  characterization and classification  in order to determine whether the Court of Appeal correctly held that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are constitutionally valid.\nCharacterization of the Impugned Provisions\nIn my view, the pith and substance of the impugned provisions is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly in order to protect the health and security of the public, and of young persons in particular, from cannabis harm. It follows that the prohibitions against the possession of cannabis plants and their cultivation at home set out in ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a means of serving the public health and security objectives pursued by that Act. With a few slight differences, my conclusion at the characterization stage is the same as that of the Court of Appeal.\nBefore embarking on the analysis, I will provide a brief overview of the principles that apply in characterizing provisions that are alleged to be an integral part of a regulatory scheme. It is helpful to clarify the extent to which courts should analyze a law as a whole in order to characterize some of its provisions. The question is relevant in this case because the parties disagreement at the characterization stage essentially stems from the emphasis they place, respectively, on the impugned provisions and on the provincial Act considered in its entirety. Mr. Murray-Hall focuses on the provisions themselves and criticizes the Court of Appeal for not truly considering the possibility that their purpose differs from that of the Act as a whole. The Attorney General of Quebec instead stresses the role played by the provisions in the scheme, endorsing the Court of Appeals statement that [translation] their real purpose emerges only when they are analyzed in the overall context of the [provincial Act] (para. 43).\nWhere, as in this case, only very specific provisions are being challenged and not the entire law, certain principles apply. A court should begin by characterizing the provisions rather than considering the validity of the law as a whole, a principle articulated by Dickson J. (as he then was) in Attorney General of Canada v. Canadian National Transportation, Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 206. However, Dickson J. added, this does not mean that the provisions must be read in isolation. A contextual analysis of the provisions is necessary when they are part of a regulatory scheme. Dickson J.s remarks in this regard are as follows:\n\t\tIt is obvious at the outset that a constitutionally invalid provision will not be saved by being put into an otherwise valid statute, even if the statute comprises a regulatory scheme under the general trade and commerce branch of s. 91(2). The correct approach, where there is some doubt that the impugned provision has the same constitutional characterization as the Act in which it is found, is to start with the challenged section rather than with a demonstration of the validity of the statute as a whole. I do not think, however, this means that the section in question must be read in isolation. If the claim to constitutional validity is based on the contention that the impugned provision is part of a regulatory scheme it would seem necessary to read it in its context. If it can in fact be seen as part of such a scheme, attention will then shift to the constitutionality of the scheme as a whole. [Emphasis added; p. 270.]\nThis Court has repeatedly emphasized the need to consider the impugned provisions in light of their interaction with the scheme to which they belong. In Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 14, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 693 (Quebec (Attorney General) 2015), one of the issues was whether a provision requiring the destruction of long-gun registration data related to the same matter  public safety  as the legislation repealing the registration scheme. Writing for the majority, Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. stated the following: . . . the matter of the provision must be considered in the context of the larger scheme, as its relationship to that scheme may be an important consideration in determining its pith and substance . . . (para. 30).\nThe principle enunciated by McLachlin C.J. in Ward, where the issue was whether a section of federal fisheries regulations prohibiting the sale of young seals was constitutionally valid, is also relevant: The question is not whether the Regulations prohibit the sale so much as why it is prohibited (para. 19 (emphasis in original)). In that case, therefore, the Court could not simply focus on the fact that the impugned provision imposed a prohibition on sale, trade or barter, which could have suggested that it fell within provincial jurisdiction over property or trade. When the why of the prohibition and its interaction with the rest of the scheme were considered, it became apparent that the purpose of the prohibition was to curtail commercial hunting and that Parliament was validly exercising its fisheries power. \nI would also note that reading the impugned provisions in the context of the scheme into which they are integrated is crucial in distinguishing the purpose of the law from the means chosen to achieve it. Indeed, in Ward, McLachlin C.J. cautioned against confus[ing] the purpose of the legislation with the means used to carry out that purpose (para. 25).\nBearing in mind the principles laid down in National Transportation and the note of caution sounded in Ward, I will now characterize ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act. I will consider the purpose of these provisions first and then their effects.\nPurpose of the Impugned Provisions\nIntrinsic Evidence\nSections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act set out absolute prohibitions against, respectively, the possession and the cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house, accompanied by fines of $250 to $750. If we simply focused on the wording of these provisions, as the appellant urges us to do, the concept of prohibition is what would stand out.\nHowever, it is essential to analyze ss. 5 and 10 in light of their context and not just their wording, because it is the Attorney General of Quebecs contention that they are an integral part of the regulatory scheme established by the provincial Act. To echo the words of McLachlin C.J. in Ward, it is not just a matter of finding that the prohibitions against possession and cultivation exist; it is important to look at why they are incorporated into the provincial Acts very specific regulatory scheme.\nIt is also my view that the impugned provisions must not be read separately or individually on the pretext that they may relate to a very different matter than the rest of the provisions. As the Court of Appeal said, [translation] [t]he constitutionality of sections 5 and 10 of the [provincial Act] cannot properly be analyzed in isolation, separately from the [Act] as a whole (para. 41). Of course, it is quite possible that some provisions of a law may be of a completely different order than its other provisions (Westendorp v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 43, at p. 51). But such a conclusion cannot be reached without a contextual analysis of the impugned provisions. Logically, it cannot be determined whether there is a marked difference between the purpose of ss. 5 and 10 and that of the rest of the provincial Acts provisions, as Mr. Murray-Hall alleges, without having considered the Act as a whole.\nAn overview of the provincial Act reveals the scope of the regulatory scheme introduced by the Quebec legislature. Like the Court of Appeal, I see this undertaking as involving the creation of a state monopoly that oversees each step leading up to the purchase of cannabis by citizens in order to protect the health and security of the public. The prohibitions set out in ss. 5 and 10, along with the other controls put in place by the Act, are the machinery of this undertaking. Specifically, prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants contributes to the effectiveness of the state monopoly by steering consumers to the only legally authorized source of supply, that is, the state-owned enterprise.\nIt is helpful to recall that, at the same time the provincial Act was enacted, the Quebec legislature amended the Act respecting the Societe des alcools du Quebec, CQLR, c. S-13, to create the SQDC, a subsidiary of the Societe des alcools du Quebec that would ensure the sale of cannabis from a health protection perspective, in order to integrate consumers into, and maintain them in, the legal market without encouraging cannabis consumption (s. 16.1 para. 1; see also s. 3 of Bill 157).\nThe provincial Act sets out the various aspects governing the exercise of the SQDCs monopoly on the sale of cannabis (s. 25), including control over the location of retail outlets (ss. 27 and 33), control of the quality of the products offered (ss. 29, 44 and 45), a prohibition against selling to persons under 21 years of age (ss. 34 to 39), education of consumers on the health risks of cannabis (ss. 30, 31 para. 2, 41 and 57 para. 2), and compliance with display, signage and packaging standards (ss. 40 to 42, 56 and 57). In my view, the prohibitions and control mechanisms provided for by the provincial Act must be regarded as means chosen to achieve the purposes stated in the first paragraph of s. 1, that is, to prevent and reduce cannabis harm in order to protect the health and security of the public and of young persons in particular and to ensure the preservation of the cannabis markets integrity. These prohibitions and control mechanisms follow logically from the stated purposes because they make it possible, as the second paragraph of the same section says, to regulate the possession, cultivation, use, sale and promotion of cannabis.\nLike the provisions just mentioned, ss. 5 and 10 are part of the monopolistic logic intended by the Quebec legislature, and the prohibitions they impose are a means of achieving the objectives of public health and security.\nIn reality, the impossibility of possessing and cultivating cannabis plants at home without risking penal sanctions has the effect of steering Quebec consumers to the safe source of supply that is the SQDC. As a result, they receive quality-controlled products and advice from sales employees who have been trained on the risks associated with cannabis consumption (on the first point, see ss. 29, 44 and 45 of the provincial Act and the Regulation to determine other classes of cannabis that may be sold by the Societe quebecoise du cannabis and certain standards respecting the composition and characteristics of cannabis, CQLR, c. C-5.3, r. 0.1; on the second point, see s. 1 and Sch. I of the Regulation respecting training on the retail sale of cannabis and information to be communicated to a purchaser in the course of a cannabis sale, CQLR, c. C-5.3, r. 1). The fact that consumers buy from the SQDC also means that they are subject to a series of requirements, the most important of which seems to me to be the one setting a minimum age of 21 years for purchasing cannabis from the SQDC. \nThe essence of the position advanced by the appellant in this Court is that the purpose of the provincial Act could have been achieved by regulating  rather than completely prohibiting  home cannabis cultivation, for example by allowing the possession and cultivation for personal purposes of one, two or three cannabis plants. He argues that, by choosing absolute prohibitions instead, the provincial legislature interfered unduly in the exercise of the federal criminal law power. I note that the absolute nature of the prohibitions was also raised by the trial judge, who saw it as an indication that the Quebec legislature [translation] in fact sought to mitigate the repeal of the former provisions criminalizing the personal cultivation and possession of cannabis plants (para. 45).\nIn my opinion, however, this distinction between the absolute prohibitions being challenged and the more flexible prohibitions mentioned with respect to the permitted number of plants is of no assistance to the appellant. Even if it is accepted that the objective of protecting the health and security of the public could have been achieved by regulating home cannabis cultivation less strictly and not only by completely prohibiting it, this argument is far from being determinative in identifying the pith and substance of the impugned provisions. When two approaches are considered to be potentially effective, it falls to legislative bodies to choose the one that is most likely to further the intended objectives. Indeed, this Court has pointed out on several occasions that considerations relating to the efficacy or wisdom of the means chosen are not helpful at the characterization stage (Ward, at paras. 18 and 22; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 18, citing Morgentaler, at pp. 487-88; Reference re Securities Act, 2011 SCC 66, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 837, at para. 90; Reference re AntiInflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, at p. 425).\nIn short, when viewed together with the other provisions of the provincial Act, ss. 5 and 10 do not have the separate and independent objective of prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants for personal purposes. The prohibitions themselves must be seen as one means among a broad range of measures that the Quebec legislature has deemed necessary in order to achieve the provincial Acts public health and security objectives. In particular, the prohibitions act as strong incentives for the integration of consumers into . . . the legal market that ensures, among other things, control of the quality of the products offered, education on the risks of cannabis consumption and compliance with rules on the minimum age for purchasing cannabis (see s. 16.1 para. 1 of the Act respecting the Societe des alcools du Quebec; see also R.F., at para. 12).\nExtrinsic Evidence\nIn my view, the usefulness of the legislative debates in this appeal is relative. I adopt the Court of Appeals observation that [translation] [r]eading them tends . . . to show that the remarks made about the impugned provisions are consistent with the purpose identified earlier in analyzing the intrinsic evidence (para. 72). The remarks made by the members of the Quebec legislature thus serve to confirm what was already apparent from the interaction between the impugned provisions and the rest of the prohibitions and control mechanisms provided for by the provincial Act, namely that the prohibitions against possession and cultivation at home help to ensure that consumers will buy from the SQDC.\nIt can be seen from the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Health and Social Services that the members of the Quebec legislature considered two approaches to home cultivation: one relying on an absolute prohibition against the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants to ensure that consumers would buy from the state, and the other relying on tolerance of these practices as a lever in the fight against organized crime and the empowerment of low-income consumers (see National Assembly, Journal des debats de la Commission permanente de la sante et des services sociaux, vol. 44, No. 189, 1st Sess., 41st Leg., March 21, 2018, at pp. 22 (S. Jolin-Barrette) and 35 (M. Masse); National Assembly, Journal des debats de la Commission permanente de la sante et des services sociaux, vol. 44, No. 191, 1st Sess., 41st Leg., March 27, 2018, at p. 3 (S. Page)). The Quebec legislature clearly chose the first of these two approaches. \nA comment made by a member of the opposition, which the Minister responsible for Public Health later endorsed, is revealing: [translation] Out of a concern for public security, out of a concern for public health, out of a concern for proceeding gradually, we make the choice, as a state, not to allow home cultivation, and for purposes of public health and security, we want to guide consumers to the stores of a subsidiary of the state-owned enterprise to make sure that cannabis is consumed responsibly (Journal des debats de la Commission permanente de la sante et des services sociaux, March 21, 2018, at p. 22 (S. Jolin-Barrette)). The legislatures intention was to promote responsible consumption of the substance by establishing a scheme in which individuals, denied the option of cultivating their own cannabis, would be steered to SQDC outlets.\nThat being said, I acknowledge that the discussion concerning the extrinsic evidence in the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal related mainly to the question of whether the impugned provisions were a form of colourable legislation. For this reason, the following remarks are in order.\nThe concept of colourable legislation refers to legislation that seemingly deals with a matter within the jurisdiction of the enacting level of government but that is actually addressed to a matter outside that jurisdiction (Morgentaler, at p. 496). It has long been accepted that recourse may be had to extrinsic evidence, insofar as it reflects the legislative intent, in order to determine the alleged colourability of legislation (Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297, at pp. 318-19).\nThe appellant submits that the members of the Quebec legislature demonstrated on a number of occasions that their intent was to thwart Parliaments chosen approach to home cultivation and thus to enact, in colourable form, the provisions of the CDSA that formerly prohibited the possession and cultivation of cannabis. This argument cannot be accepted.\nIt is true that some uneasiness was expressed within the walls of the National Assembly over the decriminalization bill, which was introduced on the sole initiative of the federal government. The members of the Quebec legislature also deemed it appropriate to reiterate the dangerousness of cannabis because of the risk  perceived or recognized  that this substance would be normalized by the passage of the federal Act. The appellant refers us to the speech made by the Minister responsible for Public Health during the last stages leading to the passage of the final version of Bill 157: \n\t\t[translation] This bill positions and prepares Quebec for the imminent legalization of cannabis, unilaterally imposed, let us be honest, Madam President, by the federal government. I want citizens to clearly understand that neither the Quebec government nor the members of the opposition nor anyone here in Quebec requested this. It ended up on our agenda following a decision of the federal government. So, we had to work with extremely tight deadlines and a high degree of uncertainty with respect to federal intentions. To say that it was a real challenge is an understatement, Madam President. Our ultimate goal, the same from the outset, was to offer the best possible regulation of this substance on our territory, given the stakes. And, I would like to repeat, Madam President, that cannabis is not a benign, harmless substance. I say to young persons: It is not a great idea to smoke cannabis. [Emphasis added.]\n\t(National Assembly, Journal des debats, vol. 44, No. 346, 1st Sess., 41st Leg., June 6, 2018, at pp. 21972-73 (L. Charlebois))\nStatements like these are, however, far from sufficient for a finding of colourability. As Cromwell and Karakatsanis JJ. noted in Quebec (Attorney General) 2015, [c]ourts are, for good reasons, reluctant to find legislation to be colourable (para. 31). If the colourability doctrine were applied less narrowly, there would be a danger that courts would overstep their judicial role and make decisions based on policy considerations, thereby expressing disapproval of either the policy of the statute or the means by which the legislation seeks to carry it out (ibid.).\nIn my view, the Ministers statements do not show an intent to recriminalize what Parliament sought to decriminalize. Rather, they reflect a general concern about the risks arising from cannabis consumption, particularly for younger individuals. As the Court of Appeal pointed out, this concern was expressed repeatedly in the House of Commons when Bill C-45 was being examined (para. 102). Quite a few members of Parliament noted that Canadians, including children and youth, have some of the highest rates of cannabis use in the world and that the effects of cannabis may be particularly dangerous for young people who use it (ibid., quoting House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 183, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., May 30, 2017, at p. 11706 (M. Mendicino)). Viewed in such a context, the Ministers statements simply show that concerns about the harmful effects of cannabis on health did not disappear merely because this substance was decriminalized. In other words, the concerns expressed by members of Parliament while debating Bill C-45 were echoed in the National Assembly of Quebec.\nA parallel was drawn by the trial judge between the circumstances of this case and those of Morgentaler, in which the pith and substance of a Nova Scotia statute that prohibited abortion, other than in a hospital, was not control over private health care institutions but rather the restriction of abortion as a socially undesirable practice that should be suppressed or punished. Among other things, Morgentaler reiterated [t]he guiding principle . . . that the provinces may not invade the criminal field by attempting to stiffen, supplement or replace the criminal law . . . or to fill perceived defects or gaps therein (p. 498). In the present case, the appellant argues that this principle is undermined by ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act, which are designed to remedy the repeal of the provisions that once criminalized the personal production of cannabis.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the circumstances of this case differ from those of Morgentaler. The statements made by the members of the provincial legislature in Morgentaler showed direct opposition to freestanding abortion clinics as a public evil to be eliminated and left no ambiguity regarding the intent behind the impugned legislation (p. 503). Moreover, many important concerns relating to the stated purpose of the statute  for example, health care costs or objections to a two-tier system of access to medical services  had not been mentioned during the legislative debates. The same cannot be said of the conduct of the debates that led to the enactment of the provincial Act and the provisions challenged in this case. When the prohibitions against the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants were debated by the members of the Quebec legislature, they were clearly viewed from the perspective of the stated purposes of the Act, that is, preserving the cannabis markets integrity and protecting the health and security of the public.\nGiven the complete lack of evidence of any improper legislative purpose, and exercising the caution with which this Court has always dealt with allegations of colourability, I cannot accept the appellants argument. The impugned provisions do not represent a colourable attempt to re-enact the criminal law prohibitions repealed by Parliament.\nEffects of the Impugned Provisions\nThe effects of the impugned provisions are clear, and I agree with the manner in which the Superior Court described them in its reasons:\n\t\t[translation] . . . the practical consequence of applying ss. 5 and 10 is one, to prevent citizens from possessing and cultivating cannabis plants for personal purposes and two, to force consumers to purchase cannabis from the SQDC.\n\t\tThe legal consequences of the provincial provisions are one, to prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the personal cultivation of cannabis and two, to impose penal sanctions for any violation. They also result in penal consequences for acts that were formerly criminal under federal legislation, the CDSA. [paras. 49-50]\nI would add, however, that while the impugned provisions do bring otherwise decriminalized conduct into the sphere of penal law, the consequences flowing from a contravention are very different from those arising under the provisions of the CDSA. Persons who contravene ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are liable to fines that could be said to be relatively modest, since they range from $250 to $750.\nTogether, the legal and practical effects described above confirm the conclusion I reached earlier after analyzing the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. The purpose of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act is not to suppress possession and cultivation at home as such, but rather to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly in order to protect the health and security of the public from cannabis harm. \nOne final point concerning the effects of the impugned provisions warrants further comment. The intervener the Canadian Association for Progress in Justice submits that the colourability of the impugned provisions may be revealed by considering their effects, in addition to looking at the legislative debates. Specifically, it argues that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act and a series of criminal offences set out in the federal Act have the combined effect of recriminalizing conduct that has nonetheless been decriminalized. The provincial prohibitions allegedly transform cannabis plants possessed or cultivated by individuals in Quebec into a form of illicit cannabis within the meaning of s. 2 of the federal Act, which defines this term as follows: . . . cannabis that is or was sold, produced or distributed by a person prohibited from doing so under this Act or any provincial Act . . . . The possession, distribution, cultivation and production of illicit cannabis are the subject of criminal offences under ss. 8(1)(b), 9(1)(a)(iv), 12(4)(a) and 13(1), respectively, of the federal Act. According to the intervener, the impugned provisions of the provincial Act therefore create not only regulatory offences but also criminal offences because of the illicit nature of the plants cultivated in Quebec dwelling-houses.\nI accept the premise that considering the legislative debates and analyzing effects may be helpful in establishing the colourability of a law. The Court stated this itself in Reference re Firearms Act, noting that the effects of the law may suggest a purpose other than that which is stated in the law and that a law is sometimes said to be colourable where its effects diverge substantially from its stated aim (para. 18). That being said, however, I cannot accept the argument that the recriminalization of conduct that has been decriminalized in this case is an effect of the provincial provisions, when their interaction with the federal Act is taken into account. Parliament drafted the definition of illicit cannabis by reference to provincial legislation and in such a way that conduct for which penal sanctions are imposed by the provinces is subject to the criminal prohibitions set out in ss. 8(1)(b), 9(1)(a)(iv), 12(4)(a) and 13(1) of the federal Act. The possibility that the possession or cultivation of one to four cannabis plants at home could be recriminalized therefore arises solely from the decision made by Parliament to contemplate provincial regulatory action in s. 2 of the federal Act. To put it simply, any possible recriminalization results not from the provincial provisions but only from the federal provisions.\nTo accept the interveners argument would mean that the enactment by a province of any prohibition against cannabis for regulatory purposes would be ultra vires because it would already be covered by the definition of illicit cannabis and by the possible application of the criminal prohibitions set out in ss. 8(1)(b), 9(1)(a)(iv), 12(4)(a) and 13(1) of the federal Act. In practical terms, this would negate the provinces power to regulate the use of this substance. Such a result would be contrary to the view of federalism espoused by this Court and to the clear intention of Parliament. On this last point, Parliament obviously assumed that the provinces would be able to legislate with respect to cannabis within their fields of jurisdiction  hence the reference to provincial legislation in the definition of illicit cannabis.\nConclusion on Pith and Substance\nFor the reasons given above, I conclude that the pith and substance of ss. 5 and 10 is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly on the sale of cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the public, and of young persons in particular, from the harm caused by this substance. Prohibiting the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants is not in itself the purpose of the impugned provisions, but rather a means of steering consumers to the only source of supply considered to be reliable and safe.\nClassification of the Impugned Provisions\nIn this case, the question before us at the classification stage is whether the impugned provisions fall within the federal criminal law power under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 or within the powers conferred on the provinces over property and civil rights and matters of a merely local or private nature by s. 92(13) and (16), respectively. For the reasons that follow, I conclude that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are related to the provinces powers and are therefore intra vires the Quebec legislature.\nTo begin with, I cannot accept the trial judges reasoning, which the appellant urges us to adopt, to the effect that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act have the three essential elements of valid criminal law and thus fall within federal jurisdiction. With regard to the first two elements, it seems to me to be beyond doubt that the impugned provisions contain prohibitions that are accompanied by penalties (Reference as to the Validity of Section 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] S.C.R. 1 (Margarine Reference), at pp. 49-50). As for the third element, this Court has already recognized that protecting vulnerable groups from the health risks associated with cannabis is a valid criminal law purpose (R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at paras. 76-78). That being said, it should be noted that, in this context, the Quebec legislature was seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly in order to protect the health and security of the public.\nIn my view, even though ss. 5 and 10 seemingly have all the characteristics of criminal law, they should still not be classified under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867. For the reasons that follow, I believe that the classification of the provisions challenged in this case cannot be determined simply on the basis of the correspondence between the three requirements set out in the Margarine Reference on the one hand and these provisions on the other.\nFirst, Parliaments decision to decriminalize conduct leaves the field clear for the provinces to enact their own prohibitions accompanied by penalties in relation to that conduct, as long as the prohibitions serve to enforce laws relating to matters within provincial jurisdiction (s. 92(15) of the Constitution Act, 1867). It follows that penal regulatory measures adopted by the provinces with regard to decriminalized activities are not necessarily attempts to legislate in criminal matters. This is why Major J. wrote in Siemens v. Manitoba (Attorney General), 2003 SCC 3, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 6, that [t]he mere presence of a prohibition and a penalty does not invalidate an otherwise acceptable use of provincial legislative power (para. 25).\nSecond, it is recognized that the provinces have jurisdiction to make laws in relation to several matters that touch on purposes that otherwise constitute valid criminal law purposes. In the Margarine Reference, Rand J. referred to [p]ublic peace, order, security, health, morality as the ordinary though not exclusive ends served by criminal law (p. 50). Although public peace, order, security, health and morality are classic criminal law purposes, the provinces may consider such imperatives in designing their own regulatory schemes. As explained in Siemens, [t]he fact that some of th[e] considerations [taken into account by the provincial legislature] have a moral aspect does not invalidate an otherwise legitimate provincial law (para. 30). Here, the mere fact that the Quebec legislature considered the real risk that cannabis consumption poses for certain vulnerable populations when it enacted legislation is not in itself an indication of encroachment on the field of criminal law.\nRather than taking the analytical framework developed in the Margarine Reference as a starting point, as the trial judge did, I will characterize the impugned provisions by considering the constitutional bases for provincial legislative action in the field of public health.\nIn this case, the partial decriminalization by Parliament of the possession, sale and distribution of cannabis and the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants opened the door to provincial legislative action. In prohibiting the possession and cultivation at home of cannabis plants, the Quebec legislature exercised the power conferred on it by s. 92(15) to enact penal measures in order to enforce an otherwise valid law. I found above that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act create a scheme that ensures the effectiveness of the state monopoly and that they in fact advance the objectives of public health and security. Characterized in this way, the impugned provisions are clearly related to the provincial heads of power in s. 92(13) and (16). This is because provincial legislative action in the field of public health is grounded primarily in broad and plenary jurisdiction over property and civil rights (s. 92(13)) and residual jurisdiction over matters of a merely local or private nature in the province (s. 92(16)) (Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General), 2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, at para. 18).\nA word about these two heads of power as distinct bases for the validity of ss. 5 and 10. In Dupond v. City of Montreal, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 770, Beetz J. wrote that the Constitution Act, 1867 gives the provincial legislatures a general power to make laws in relation to all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province, the various heads of power enumerated in s. 92 being only illustrative and s. 92(16) establishing a residual power (p. 792). In this case, similarly to what was found in Dupond, the impugned provisions derive constitutional validity not only from s. 92(16) but also from s. 92(13). The power conferred by s. 92(13) relates to private law, that is, the law pertaining to interpersonal relationships (H. Brun, G. Tremblay and E. Brouillet, Droit constitutionnel (6th ed. 2014), at p. 495, para. VI-2.109).\nWith this clarified, I must now explain how the intent behind the Quebec legislatures action in the field of health in this case was to regulate, not to suppress a threat or an evil. This is important because health, as a matter not assigned in the Constitution Act, 1867, is an area of overlapping jurisdiction (RJR-MacDonald, at para. 32; Schneider v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 112, at p. 142; Canada (Attorney General) v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, at para. 68). In Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, Karakatsanis J. described the overlap of powers in this field as follows: Health is an amorphous field of jurisdiction, featuring overlap between valid exercises of the provinces general power to regulate health and Parliaments criminal law power to respond to threats to health . . . (para. 93). It is also well established that both levels of government have authority to make laws in relation to the production, distribution and sale of products that present a danger to public health, including tobacco and alcohol (RJR-MacDonald, at paras. 36-38; R. v. Hydro-Quebec, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 213, at para. 131; Rio Hotel Ltd. v. New Brunswick (Liquor Licensing Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 59, at pp. 63 and 67-68).\nHere, the Quebec legislature saw the possession and personal cultivation of cannabis not as a social evil to be suppressed, but rather as a practice that should be prohibited in order to steer consumers to a controlled source of supply. It is helpful to draw an analogy with this Courts conclusions in Schneider, in which British Columbias Heroin Treatment Act, S.B.C. 1978, c. 24, was found to be intra vires the provincial legislature under s. 92(16). In the Courts view, the purpose of the legislation was not to punish persons with a drug addiction, but rather to regulate their medical treatment and ensure their safety (Schneider, at pp. 132-33). In the instant case, and in a spirit similar to that of the legislation challenged in Schneider, the prohibitions set out in ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act do not have punitive purposes as such, but instead reflect an approach based on regulating and supervising access to the substance.\nIn light of the foregoing, ss. 5 and 10 therefore fall not within the sphere of the criminal law but rather within the provinces general power to regulate health.\nWhile it is true that prohibitions similar to those set out in ss. 5 and 10 have been enacted by Parliament in the past under the federal criminal law power, this can be explained by the double aspect doctrine. This doctrine reflects the contemporary view of federalism and constitutional interpretation, which recognizes that overlapping powers are unavoidable (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 42). According to the double aspect doctrine, Parliament and the provincial legislatures may make laws in relation to matters that, by their very nature, have both a federal aspect and a provincial aspect (Desgagnes Transport Inc. v. Wartsila Canada Inc., 2019 SCC 58, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 228, at para. 84). It will therefore be possible to apply the double aspect doctrine where each level of government has a compelling interest in enacting legislation on different aspects of the same activity or matter (para. 85). In practice, without creating concurrent jurisdiction over a matter, the double aspect doctrine allows for the concurrent application of both federal and provincial legislation (Reference re Securities Act, at para. 66 (emphasis deleted)).\nThis appeal is a textbook case for the application of the double aspect doctrine. The regulation of the use of drugs, including cannabis, has both federal and provincial aspects, which makes it conceivable that laws enacted by both levels of government will apply concurrently. This matter has a double aspect, since it may be addressed from two different perspectives: (1) that of the criminal law (under s. 91(27)), by suppressing some evil or injurious or undesirable effect upon the public; and (2) that of health or trade (under s. 92(13) and (16)), by regulating, among other things, the conditions of production, distribution and sale of the substance. Sections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act regulate cannabis use from this second, normative perspective and are therefore within provincial jurisdiction.\nI conclude this section by emphasizing that the impugned provisions do not encroach on the federal criminal law power merely because they create absolute prohibitions. The trial judge expressed the contrary view, explaining that [translation] the province has lost its jurisdiction by deciding to completely prohibit the possession of cannabis plants and the cultivation of cannabis for personal purposes (para. 86). That inference has no support in law and disregards the fact that many regulatory prohibitions are absolute in nature without being considered criminal law prohibitions. I need only refer, by way of example, to the prohibition against selling tobacco to minors set out, in Quebec law, in ss. 13 and 14.4 of the Tobacco Control Act, CQLR, c. L-6.2.\nConclusion on the Constitutional Validity of the Impugned Provisions\nThe presumption of constitutional validity of legislation remains a cardinal principle of our division of powers jurisprudence (Reference re The Farm Products Marketing Act, [1957] S.C.R. 198, at p. 255; Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 662, at pp. 687-88; Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453, at para. 162; Reference re Firearms Act, at para. 25). According to this presumption, every legislative provision is presumed to be intra vires the level of government that enacted it.\nHere, the onus was on the appellant to show that, in pith and substance, ss. 5 and 10 are not related to one of the classes of subjects under provincial jurisdiction. He failed to do so. The matter of the impugned provisions is not the moral suppression of personal cannabis production. Rather, their pith and substance is to ensure the effectiveness of the state monopoly on the sale of cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the public from the harm caused by this substance.\nFor the reasons stated above, I am of the view that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are a valid exercise by the Quebec legislature of the powers conferred on it by s. 92(13) and (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and that the Court of Appeal therefore made no error in its review of the validity of the impugned provisions. \nAlthough this is not a determining factor, I note that the Attorney General of Canada did not intervene in this case to contest the constitutional validity of ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act. My conclusion on the validity of these provisions is very much in keeping with the spirit of caution that guides courts when the federal government forgoes any participation in the proceedings: . . . the Court should be particularly cautious about invalidating a provincial law when the federal government does not contest its validity . . . (OPSEU v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 2, at p. 19).\nDid the Quebec Court of Appeal Err in Law in Holding That Sections 5 and 10 of the Provincial Act Are Constitutionally Operative?\nIn this second part, I will address whether the doctrine of federal paramountcy applies in this case, which would mean that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act would be declared to be of no force or effect only to the extent of their inconsistency with the federal Act. Like the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that the impugned provisions are operative. The application of the absolute prohibitions set out in the provincial Act does not frustrate the federal purpose identified by the appellant. Contrary to what he argues, the purpose of the federal Act is not to create  with a view to reducing illicit activities in relation to cannabis  positive rights to possess and cultivate up to four cannabis plants for personal purposes. Such an interpretation of the purpose of the federal Act does not reflect the essentially prohibitory nature of the criminal law power and is not supported by the wording of that Act.\nBy way of introduction, I will outline the circumstances in which the doctrine of federal paramountcy applies. There is an inconsistency that justifies giving precedence to a federal law over a valid provincial law when there is an operational conflict or when the purpose of the federal law is frustrated. In the former case, the operational conflict means that it is impossible to comply with both laws simultaneously, such as where one enactment says yes and the other says no, as it was put in Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161, at p. 191. In the latter case, imposing an obligation to comply with provincial legislation would in effect frustrate the purpose of a federal law (Canadian Western Bank, at para. 73). As Major J. noted in Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2005 SCC 13, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 188, at paras. 14-15, the existence of either of these situations is enough to trigger the application of the federal paramountcy doctrine, but this does not mean that proving their existence is easy.\nIndeed, the burden of proof that rests on the party alleging an operational conflict or a conflict of purposes is a high one (Alberta (Attorney General) v. Moloney, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para. 27; Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Lemare Lake Logging Ltd., 2015 SCC 53, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 419, at paras. 21-23). This requirement arises from the cardinal rule of constitutional interpretation that [w]hen a federal statute can be properly interpreted so as not to interfere with a provincial statute, such an interpretation is to be applied in preference to another applicable construction which would bring about a conflict between the two statutes (Attorney General of Canada v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 307, at p. 356). I am also of the view that the need for the greatest possible precision in the analysis of operability takes on particular importance in circumstances such as those in this case, where the legislative subject matter has a double aspect. It is essential to avoid eroding the importance attached to provincial autonomy, a concern I expressed in, among other cases, References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, at para. 128.\nFor the reasons that follow, and in light of the restrained approach to paramountcy that guides the Court, I am of the view that the appellant has not met his burden of proof.\nI want to dispel at once any notion that there is an operational conflict between the impugned provisions and the federal Act. When questioned by the Court on this point, the appellant in fact conceded that it is possible to obey both laws, which suggests that there is no operational conflict. By not possessing or cultivating cannabis plants in their homes, individuals in Quebec can thus easily comply with both the federal Act, which exempts the possession and cultivation of up to four cannabis plants from the application of its scheme of criminal offences, and the provincial Act, which prohibits the possession and cultivation of any cannabis plant in a dwelling-house.\nTherefore, the only question to be answered is rather whether a federal purpose is being frustrated, which in this case involves first establishing the purpose of the federal Act and then determining whether the provisions of the provincial Act are incompatible with that purpose (Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, 2010 SCC 39, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 66).\nThe appellants position on the frustration of the federal Acts purpose can be briefly summarized. He alleges that the incompatibility results from the fact that the provincial Act does not merely limit what the federal Act allows, namely the cultivation and possession of up to four cannabis plants in a dwelling-house, but instead prohibits it completely. In making such an argument, the appellant assumes that ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b) of the federal Act have in fact created a positive right to self-cultivate cannabis. According to the appellant, positively and expressly authorizing the home cultivation of a maximum of four cannabis plants is the purpose of the federal provisions. In its more refined form, this argument amounts to suggesting that granting Canadians a positive right to possess or cultivate up to four cannabis plants is the specific purpose of ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b). Such a purpose is allegedly being pursued in order to achieve other more general purposes of the federal Act set out in s. 7 of that Act, including eliminating or reducing the illicit cannabis market (s. 7(c)) (see the distinction drawn between a specific purpose and a general purpose in Rothmans, at para. 25).\nIn my opinion, the appellants position cannot be accepted. The purpose of the federal Acts provisions is not to create a positive right to self-cultivate cannabis as part of a broader objective of limiting the influence of organized crime. Such a purpose would be inconsistent with the fact that the criminal law power is essentially prohibitory in character (Rothmans, at para. 19), a fact that has been recognized in Canadian law since the leading case of Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General for Canada, [1931] A.C. 310 (P.C.). As McLachlin C.J. noted in Reference re AHRA, [t]he federal criminal law power may only be used to prohibit conduct (para. 38). It follows that when exceptions are carved out for practices that Parliament does not wish to prohibit, this only means that a particular practice is not prohibited, not that the practice is positively allowed by the federal law (ibid. (emphasis deleted)).\nIt is true that, in everyday language and even in the speeches of some parliamentarians, the creation of exceptions or exemptions under a scheme of criminal offences is often described as a legalization effort. However, this way of speaking is incorrect and falsely suggests that positive rights authorizing particular conduct have been granted to the public. In this case, the statement by the federal Minister of Health that limited home growing should be allowed therefore cannot be seen as a clear expression of Parliaments intent to confer a positive right to self-cultivation (House of Commons Debates, vol. 148, No. 314, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., June 13, 2018, at p. 20875). I would also point out that courts must be careful when relying on parliamentary debates as an expression of legislative intent. The use of this type of extrinsic evidence must be approached with caution given the fact that statements by members of Parliament can be poor indicators of parliamentary purpose (R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at para. 89).\n Furthermore, I note that nothing in the language of ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b) indicates that Parliaments intention was to authorize the self-cultivation of cannabis. On the contrary, these provisions read as classic criminal law: they contain a prohibition and a penalty, and they are directed at an evil relating to public health and safety. They include exemptions for the cultivation and possession of one to four cannabis plants. Their wording leaves no ambiguity regarding the fact that the possession and cultivation of one to four cannabis plants were simply excluded from the scope of the criminal offences provided for in the federal Act. Pointing to the absence of provisions conferring an express right to cultivate cannabis for personal purposes, the Court of Appeal correctly found that [translation] it seems more accurate to say not that the [federal Act] legalized certain aspects related to the use of this substance, but rather that it decriminalized them (para. 117).\nThe appellant attaches great importance to the fact that s. 7(c) of the federal Act is framed in much more positive or permissive terms, since it states that one of the purposes of the Act is to provide for the licit production of cannabis to reduce illicit activities in relation to cannabis. He sees this as an indication that Parliament truly intended to confer a positive right to self-cultivate. Once again, I cannot accept the appellants contentions.\nFirst, it is not clear that Parliament, through the term licit production in s. 7(c), was referring specifically to the home production of cannabis. Rather, I believe that this term conveys a general intention to allow production within the legal framework established by the federal Act. The concept of licit production could also be seen, a contrario, as the converse of the concept of illicit cannabis, which s. 2 of the federal Act defines as any cannabis that is or was sold, produced or distributed by a person prohibited from doing so under this Act or any provincial Act or that was imported by a person prohibited from doing so under this Act.\nSecond, even if it is accepted that the concept of licit production may refer to home production, the words provide for in s. 7(c) cannot be read as indicating that Parliament granted authorization or permission that created positive rights. They cannot be read in this way because, as I noted above, the creation of positive rights is not a valid exercise of the criminal law power and because the federal Act must be presumed to be constitutionally valid in our review of the operability of the provincial provisions.\nThe guidance provided in Rothmans is relevant for the purposes of this appeal. In my view, the principles arising from that case are determinative of the issue of the operability of the impugned provisions. The question in Rothmans was whether provincial legislation that prohibited the promotion of tobacco products in any place accessible to young persons frustrated the purpose of federal legislation that prohibited the promotion of tobacco products except in retail businesses. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had found that the provincial legislation negated the authorization otherwise afforded by the federal legislation for the promotion of tobacco in retail businesses. This Court came to a different conclusion, stating that Parliament did not grant, and could not have granted, retailers a positive entitlement to display tobacco products (para. 18 (emphasis added)). In addition, statutes enacted pursuant to the criminal law power do not ordinarily create freestanding rights that limit the ability of the provinces to legislate in the area more strictly than Parliament (para. 19 (emphasis added)).\nThe principle to be drawn from these excerpts is that the making of exceptions or exemptions under a criminal law scheme cannot serve to confer positive rights to engage in the activities covered by those exceptions or exemptions. This is an important point in a case like the one before us. The provinces can legitimately undertake regulatory initiatives to provide a framework for decriminalized activities without thereby frustrating a purpose  the creation of positive rights  that by definition is outside the scope of the federal criminal law power.\nI acknowledge that the circumstances of Rothmans differed from those of this case in one important respect. In Rothmans, the exemption for the retail display of tobacco products did not seem closely related to the achievement of the criminal law purpose of the legislation as a whole, which was to address a national public health problem. As the Court stated in that case, even if it were to be accepted that the federal legislation granted retailers a positive right to display tobacco products, it would be difficult to imagine that such a right could actually help combat a public health evil (para. 20). In the instant case, on the other hand, it could be argued that the exemptions for the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants at home play a direct part in achieving a criminal law purpose, namely discouraging the illicit trade of cannabis. By this logic, the recognition of a positive right to self-cultivate could thus assist in limiting the demand for cannabis from illicit sources or criminal organizations, a purpose that would be undermined by the application of the absolute prohibitions enacted by the Quebec legislature.\nHowever, I cannot accept that exceptions or exemptions made under a scheme of criminal offences may give rise to positive rights, even where the exceptions or exemptions are closely related to the achievement of criminal law purposes. In recent years, the Court has circumscribed the scope of the federal criminal law power. In Reference re AHRA, for example, McLachlin C.J. cautioned that a limitless definition [of what constitutes a valid criminal law purpose], combined with the doctrine of paramountcy, has the potential to upset the constitutional balance of federal-provincial powers (para. 43). In my opinion, modifying the principles from Rothmans would present a similar risk to the constitutional balance of the federal system. The recognition of positive rights created out of exceptions or exemptions closely related to a valid criminal law purpose would improperly extend the scope of the federal criminal law power. \nThe principles that emerge from Rothmans are relevant without having to be modified in any way and are applicable to this appeal. This means that the exemptions set out in ss. 8(1)(e) and 12(4)(b) of the federal Act are not sources of positive rights, despite the fact that they appear to be closely related to the criminal law purpose of combating illicit activities.\nAlthough this is not in itself determinative in deciding the question of operability, I would observe that the objectives pursued by Parliament and the provincial legislature are consistent. Protecting the health and security of the public and of young persons in particular, combating organized crime and ensuring access to quality-controlled products are all considerations that clearly motivated the enactment of the federal Act and the provincial Act.\nI note in this regard that the provincial prohibitions directly address several of the objectives set out in s. 7 of the federal Act. The provincial Acts absolute prohibitions against possession and cultivation presumably protect the health of young persons by restricting access to cannabis (s. 7(a)), since home cultivation by persons of full age could make this substance more accessible to minors living under the same roof. The prohibitions also prevent inducements to use cannabis (s. 7(b)), since the presence of cannabis plants in the home may de facto be considered an inducement. They assist in controlling the quality of the products offered (s. 7(f)), since home-cultivated cannabis is not subject to quality standards, such as the maximum concentration of the main active compound in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). They clearly contribute to public awareness of the health risks associated with cannabis consumption (s. 7(g)), since consumers can be provided with information more easily if they are within a regulated selling framework.\nFinally, I would add that even though Parliament and the provincial legislature have taken different approaches to self-cultivation, the provincial Act reflects a concern with combating organized crime, just as the federal Act does (s. 7(c) and (d)). The provincial legislature was of the view that, by contributing to the creation of a single market, the absolute prohibitions against possession and cultivation at home would serve to limit trafficking in cannabis from unauthorized sources. Furthermore, it is not this Courts role to decide which of the two approaches  prohibiting personal production or tolerating it  is most likely to reduce illicit activities in relation to cannabis. It is sufficient to note that this objective is what guided the legislative action of both levels of government in this case.\nAccordingly, I conclude that ss. 5 and 10 of the provincial Act do not frustrate the purposes stated in the federal Act, including that of reducing the presence of criminal organizations in the cannabis market, and that they are operative under the doctrine of federal paramountcy. The provincial Acts public health and security objectives and its prohibitions are, to a large degree, in harmony with the objectives of the federal Act, and there is no basis for finding a conflict of purposes.\nConclusion\nSections 5 and 10 of the provincial Act are valid and operative. I would dismiss the appeal.\nThe Attorney General of Quebec has requested that costs be awarded to him. In my view, granting that request would not be justified. This Court has the discretion to depart from the usual rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. The fact that a public interest is at stake is one factor in the exercise of this discretion, which is why a losing party that raises a serious legal issue of public importance will not necessarily bear the other partys costs (Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Commissioner of Customs and Revenue), 2007 SCC 2, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 38, at para. 35, citing as an example Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 SCC 4, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 76, at para. 69). In this case, the appellant is a citizen who has raised important questions of constitutional law relating to an issue of general interest, namely the decriminalization of the recreational use of cannabis and its consequences. In my view, such circumstances weigh in favour of exercising our discretion and, for this reason, the parties will each bear their own costs in this Court and in the courts below.\n\tAppeal dismissed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Sarailis Avocats, Quebec.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Lavoie, Rousseau (Justice-Quebec), Quebec; Ministere de la Justice du Quebec, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario  Constitutional Law Branch, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Manitoba: Attorney General of Manitoba, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia: Legal Services Branch  Ministry of Attorney General, Victoria.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Constitutional Law Branch  Ministry of Justice and Attorney General, Regina.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Alberta: Attorney General of Alberta  Constitutional and Aboriginal Law, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Association for Progress in Justice: IMK, Montreal; Dalziel Law Corporation, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Cancer Society: Canadian Cancer Society, Ottawa; Langlois Lawyers, Montreal.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Cannabis Amnesty: Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, Toronto; Ruby Shiller Enenajor DiGiuseppe, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the interveners the Cannabis Council of Canada and the Quebec Cannabis Industry Association: McCarthy Tetrault, Toronto.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds Provincial Cannabis Regulation**\n\nThis appeal concerns the constitutional validity of Quebec's Cannabis Regulation Act, specifically sections 5 and 10, which prohibit the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.\n\n**Background**\nJanick Murray-Hall brought an action in the Quebec Superior Court on behalf of himself and others who may be prosecuted for possessing or cultivating cannabis plants in their homes. The Attorney General of Quebec was named as the respondent. The provincial Act's prohibitions were challenged as ultra vires or inconsistent with the federal government's approach to cannabis regulation under the Cannabis Act, which allows for personal possession and cultivation of up to four cannabis plants.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial court ruled in favor of Murray-Hall, declaring sections 5 and 10 constitutionally invalid.

Provinces and territories then enacted  their own laws to regulate practical matters, such as how cannabis can be sold  and stored. In Quebec, the <em>Cannabis  Regulation Act</em> prohibits the possession and cultivation of cannabis plants  for personal purposes. If caught breaking this law, people can be fined between  $250 and $750. Soon thereafter, Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall  brought a case to Quebec\u2019s Superior Court on his own behalf and on behalf of  everyone in that province who might be fined for possessing or cultivating  cannabis plants. He argued that the Quebec government does not have the power  to ban cannabis plants. He said that only the federal government has that power  as a matter of criminal law, which is within federal jurisdiction under section  91(27) of Canada\u2019s Constitution. Alternatively, Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall argued that  the Quebec ban should be declared of no force or effect because the federal law  should prevail over the provincial law. The judge agreed and  declared the Quebec ban unconstitutional. The Attorney General of Quebec  appealed that decision on behalf of the province.The Quebec Court of  Appeal disagreed and ruled that the ban is constitutional because it pertains  to matters of provincial jurisdiction under two other sections of the  Constitution: section 92(13), which allows provinces to make laws related to  property and civil rights; and section 92(16), which permits them to make laws  of a local or private nature within a province. That outcome meant Quebeckers  could not possess or cultivate cannabis plants. Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall appealed  the decision to the Supreme Court.The Supreme Court has  dismissed the appeal.<strong>In pursuing public health and security  objectives, the Quebec legislature has jurisdiction to prohibit the possession  and cultivation of cannabis for personal purposes.</strong>Writing for a  unanimous Court, Chief Justice Wagner found that the pith and substance of the challenged  provisions of the provincial law is to ensure the effectiveness of the state  monopoly over cannabis in order to protect the health and security of the  public, and of young persons in particular, from cannabis harm. Banning the  possession of cannabis plants and their cultivation at home is a means of  achieving the provincial law\u2019s public health and security objectives. According  to the Chief Justice, the prohibitions act as incentives for the  integration of consumers into the legal cannabis market that ensures \u201ccontrol  of the quality of the products offered, education on the risks of cannabis  consumption and compliance with rules on the minimum age for purchasing  cannabis\u201d, among other things. Such provincial legislative action in the field  of public health comes within the provinces\u2019 jurisdiction over property and  civil rights and residual jurisdiction over matters of a merely local or  private nature.The Chief Justice also  determined that the challenged provisions of the provincial law do not  frustrate the purpose of the federal law. Contrary to Mr.\u00a0Murray\u2011Hall\u2019s  argument that the purpose of the federal law is to confer a positive right to  possess or cultivate a maximum of four cannabis plants in order to eliminate or  reduce the illicit cannabis market, the Chief Justice stated that the purpose  of the federal law is rather to reduce the presence of criminal organizations  in the cannabis market while at the same time excluding  the possession and  cultivation of a maximum of four cannabis plants from the scope of the criminal  offences in that law. Although the provincial law  prohibits any possession or cultivation of cannabis plants, the same objective  guided both levels of  government.For these reasons, the  Chief Justice concluded that the provisions of the provincial law banning the possession  and cultivation of cannabis plants in Quebec are valid and operative under  Canada\u2019s Constitution."}, "24": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nHis Majesty The King\tAppellant\nv.\nPascal Breault\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Canada,\nAttorney General of Ontario,\nAssociation quebecoise des avocats et avocates de la defense and\nAssociation des avocats de la defense \nde Montreal-Laval-Longueuil\tInterveners\nIndexed as: R. v.

At about 1:35 p.m., the police officers arrived at the scene, saw B and stopped him as he was about to leave the scene on foot. One of the officers noticed that Bs eyes were bloodshot and that his breath smelled strongly of alcohol. At 1:41 p.m., that officer radioed for an approved screening device (ASD) to be brought to him, since the officers did not have one in their possession. Once he had requested an ASD, the officer demanded that B provide forthwith a breath sample pursuant to s. 254(2)(b) of the Criminal Code. Starting at 1:45 p.m., B refused three times to provide the requested sample on the ground that he had not been driving the ATV in question. He was arrested for refusing to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) Cr.

Bs appeal to the Superior Court was dismissed, but his subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal found that, in order for a demand to be valid, the peace officer must be in a position to demand that the driver provide a breath sample forthwith, which means that the officer must have immediate access to an ASD. The court was of the view that the demand made to B by the police officer was invalid due to the absence of an ASD. It reversed the lower courts judgments and directed that a judgment of acquittal be entered.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tThe Crown has not shown that there was any unusual circumstance that would account for the absence of an ASD at the scene and thereby justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. The demand made by the police officer was therefore invalid. Accordingly, Bs refusal did not attract criminal liability, and the acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal must be upheld.\n\tThe word forthwith in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. must be given an interpretation that reflects its ordinary meaning, having regard to the text, context and purpose of this provision. According to the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words provide and forthwith found in this provision, the driver must supply a breath sample to the peace officer immediately or without delay. The word forthwith qualifies the demand under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. that stopped drivers must obey. Such drivers are not free to provide a sample when they see fit. It is true that operational time is implicit in the word forthwith, because the police officer has to ready the equipment and instruct the suspect on what to do; however, operational time is different from the time needed for a device to be delivered to the scene.\n\tThe constitutionality of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. depends on an interpretation of the word forthwith that is consistent with its ordinary meaning, because this word implicitly limits the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since a detained driver must provide a breath sample forthwith, the driver may not consult counsel before doing so. This limit is justified under s. 1 of the Charter precisely because the detention is of very brief duration. The purpose of the detection procedure of which s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. forms a part is to combat the menace of impaired driving. In the pursuit of this purpose, Parliament sought to strike a balance between the public interest in eradicating driver impairment and the need to safeguard individual Charter rights. This balance must be kept in mind when interpreting s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\n\tThe existence of unusual circumstances may justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. While it is neither necessary nor desirable to identify in the abstract, and in an exhaustive manner, the circumstances that may be characterized as unusual, given that it is preferable for those circumstances to be identified on a case-by-case basis in light of the facts of each matter, it is nonetheless important to provide some guidelines to assist lower courts in this inquiry. First, the burden of establishing the existence of unusual circumstances rests on the Crown. Second, the unusual circumstances must be identified in light of the text of the provision in order to preserve the provisions constitutional integrity by ensuring that courts do not unduly extend the ordinary meaning strictly given to the word forthwith. Section 254(2)(b) Cr. C. specifies that the sample collected must enable a proper analysis to be made, which opens the door to delays caused by unusual circumstances related to the use of the device or the reliability of the result. Circumstances involving urgency in ensuring the safety of the public or of police officers might also be recognized as unusual. Third, unusual circumstances cannot arise from budgetary considerations or considerations of practical efficiency, because allocating a limited budget is the daily reality of any government. Fourth, the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the demand is made is not in itself an unusual circumstance.\n\tA demand made under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. cannot be presumed to be valid in the absence of an ASD at the scene. Nothing in this provision indicates that Parliament intended to create such a presumption of validity. A person cannot be criminally liable for refusing to comply with a demand with which it was not actually possible to comply because of the absence of an ASD at the time the demand was made. Finally, the validity of a demand cannot be conditional on the time needed for an ASD to be delivered to the scene, because such an approach would create intolerable uncertainty for drivers. When a detained driver has to respond to a demand to provide a breath sample, the driver must be able to know whether the demand is valid and whether refusing will result in criminal liability. In a context where the driver is unable to retain and instruct counsel, it cannot be expected that the driver will agree in advance to comply and will then be capable of determining when the delay in the delivery of an ASD justifies a refusal.\nCases Cited\n\tOverruled: R. v.

Paquet, for the intervener Association des avocats de la defense de Montreal-Laval-Longueuil.\nEnglish version of the judgment of the Court delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nIntroduction\nThis appeal concerns the interpretation of the immediacy requirement in what was, at the relevant time, s. 254(2)(b) (now s. 320.27(1)(b)) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (Cr. C.). According to this provision, if a peace officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a driver has alcohol in their body, the peace officer may, by demand, require the driver to provide forthwith a sample of breath that, in the peace officers opinion, will enable a proper analysis to be made through an approved screening device (ASD).\nThe immediacy requirement arising from this provision has both an implicit component and an explicit component. It is implicit as regards the police demand for a breath sample, and explicit as to the mandatory response: the driver must provide a breath sample forthwith (R. v. Woods, 2005 SCC 42, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 205, at para. 14). This case deals with the latter component.\nUnder s. 254(5) Cr. C., any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with such a demand commits an offence.\nThe central issue in this case relates to the time within which a peace officer must enable a driver who is stopped for this purpose to provide the breath sample required for a proper analysis to be made by means of an ASD. Specifically, this Court must determine whether the validity of a demand made by a peace officer under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. requires that the officer have immediate access to an ASD at the time the demand is made.\nThis Court therefore has an opportunity to settle a jurisprudential debate over the interpretation of the immediacy requirement. This debate is illustrated by the approaches adopted, on the one hand, by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Degiorgio, 2011 ONCA 527, 275 C.C.C. (3d) 1, and R. v. Quansah, 2012 ONCA 123, 286 C.C.C. (3d) 307, and, on the other, by the Quebec Court of Appeal in the judgment under appeal. After interpreting s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. in a manner consistent with the text, context and purpose of this provision, I conclude that the Quebec Court of Appeals approach is substantially correct.\nStops to provide breath samples are meant to be brief. Drivers stopped for this purpose are then being detained. This Courts jurisprudence allows a limit on the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms during such detention. This limit is justified under s. 1 of the Charter, because s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. reflects the balance struck by Parliament between the safeguarding of drivers constitutional rights and the public interest in eradicating impaired driving (Woods, at para. 29). It is essential to this balance that the word forthwith be interpreted in a manner generally consistent with its usual or ordinary meaning.\nExceptionally, unusual circumstances may justify giving the word forthwith a more flexible interpretation than its usual or ordinary meaning demands (Woods, at para. 43, citing R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254). However, those circumstances must be just that: unusual. They cannot arise from utilitarian considerations or considerations of administrative convenience. Moreover, the determination of what constitutes unusual circumstances must be grounded primarily in the text of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nThe Quebec Court of Appeal was correct in law in stating that the wording of the provision allows for a flexible interpretation of the word forthwith where there are unusual circumstances related to, among other things, the use of the device or the reliability of the result that will be generated, because the text of the provision indicates that the sample taken must enable a proper analysis to be made.\nIt is neither necessary nor desirable to set out an exhaustive list of the circumstances that may be characterized as unusual. For the purposes of this case, it will suffice to say that the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the demand is made is not in itself such an unusual circumstance. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.\nFactual Background\nOn April 2, 2017, Constables Dale Atkins and Jean-Michel Cote-Lemieux were informed by forest trail patrollers that an individual who was intoxicated was driving an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) in Val-Belair. While en route, they learned that the individual had parked his vehicle and was about to leave the scene on foot.\nThe constables arrived at the scene at about 1:35 p.m. They saw the respondent and stopped him. Constable Atkins noticed that the respondents eyes were bloodshot and that his breath smelled strongly of alcohol. The respondent identified himself through his drivers licence as Mr. Pascal Breault. When questioned by Constable Atkins, he admitted drinking one beer but denied driving the ATV. Constable Cote-Lemieux spoke with the patrollers, who confirmed that the respondent had been driving the vehicle; he conveyed that information to his colleague. At that point, the constables believed that they were indeed talking to the individual referred to by the patrollers.\nAt 1:41 p.m., Constable Atkins radioed for an ASD to be brought to him, since the constables did not have one in their possession. Constable Cote-Lemieux later testified that he did not know why he and Constable Atkins did not have an ASD: [translation] . . . I cant tell you whether we didnt take one that day or whether there were no more available . . . (A.R., vol. II, at p. 81). A colleague patrolling the Charlesbourg area responded that he had an ASD and that he was on his way. Constable Atkins estimated that Charlesbourg was about 10 minutes from his location, although a 15-minute delay was not impossible.\nOnce he had radioed for an ASD, Constable Atkins demanded that the respondent provide forthwith a breath sample, pursuant to s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. Neither he nor Constable Cote-Lemieux told the respondent that there was no ASD at the scene. Starting at 1:45 p.m., the respondent refused not once but three times to provide the requested sample. Following the respondents first refusal, Constable Atkins informed him of the consequences he faced. The respondent then reiterated his refusal twice. During that interaction, he said that he wished to retain and instruct counsel, a request that Constable Atkins denied. The reason given by the respondent for each of the three refusals was that he had not been driving the ATV in question. The respondent was therefore arrested for refusing to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) Cr. C.\nAt about 2:00 p.m., there was still no ASD at the scene. In view of the respondents refusal, the constables cancelled their radioed request that an ASD be brought to them. They seized the respondents ATV and released him.\nDecisions Below\nMunicipal Court of Ville de Quebec, 2019 QCCM 114 (Judge Simard)\nRelying on the Ontario Court of Appeals decision in Degiorgio, Judge Simard held that the validity of the demand made by Constable Atkins did not depend on the presence of an ASD at the scene. The judge also noted that the respondent had been unaware of the absence of an ASD and had immediately refused to blow three times for an entirely different reason. As well, in Judge Simards view, police cars do not all have to be equipped with an ASD. In the end, he held that the prosecution had proved the essential elements of the offence. Indeed, the demand made by Constable Atkins had been clear, and the respondent had been duly informed of the consequences of his refusal and had provided no reasonable excuse to justify it. The respondent was convicted of the offence of refusing to comply with a demand made under s. 254(2) Cr. C., contrary to ss. 254(5) and 255(1) Cr. C.\nQuebec Superior Court, 2020 QCCS 1597 (Pronovost J.)\nIn the Superior Court, counsel for the respondent acknowledged that Judge Simards analysis was legally sound in light of the ratio decidendi of R. v. Piazza, 2018 QCCA 948, and R. v. Petit, 2005 QCCA 687, 200 C.C.C. (3d) 514. Relying on Vauclair J.A.s obiter dictum in Piazza, he announced his intention of asking the Quebec Court of Appeal to overturn Petit. Pronovost J. dismissed the appeal.\nQuebec Court of Appeal, 2021 QCCA 505, 75 M.V.R. (7th) 4 (Doyon, Vauclair, Hogue, Ruel and Rancourt JJ.A.)\nIn unanimous reasons written by Doyon J.A., the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. In doing so, it relied heavily on Vauclair J.A.s review of the jurisprudence in Piazza. It concluded from that review that, in order for a demand to be valid, the peace officer must be in a position to demand that the driver [translation] provide a breath sample forthwith, before the [driver] even has the time, realistically speaking, to contact counsel, despite being detained. It also concluded that this means the peace officer must have immediate access to an ASD (C.A. reasons, at para. 42). The word forthwith in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. must therefore be given an interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning. However, departing from this meaning is justifiable where the delay is due to unusual circumstances related to, among other things, the use of the device or the reliability of the result that will be generated.\nThe Court of Appeal considered it illogical for a driver to face criminal liability for refusing to comply forthwith with a demand with which it was, in any event, not actually possible to comply forthwith. The court also found it undesirable for the validity of a demand to be assessed after the fact based on how long it took for an ASD to become available; this creates uncertainty and leads to inconsistent results. A driver who refuses right away to comply with a demand to provide forthwith a breath sample when an ASD is not available at the scene might be convicted of the offence, whereas this would not be the case if the driver agreed but later changed their mind after too long a delay.\nThe court was therefore of the view that the demand made by Constable Atkins in this case was invalid due to the absence of an ASD. As a result, the respondent was not criminally liable for refusing to comply. The court reversed the lower courts judgments, directed that a judgment of acquittal be entered and declared that Petit, which allowed a 10-minute delay for the delivery of an ASD, no longer had precedential value.\nIssue\nThe resolution of this case lies in the answer to the following question: Does the validity of a demand made by a peace officer under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. require that the officer have immediate access to an ASD at the time the demand is made?\nPositions of the Parties\nThe Crown, appealing the judgment of the Court of Appeal, submits that this question must be answered in the negative. First, the appellant argues that the word forthwith should not be given an interpretation that reflects its ordinary meaning because this would lead to results contrary to what Parliament intended when it created the offence set out in s. 254(5) Cr. C., namely to adopt a deterrent measure for the purpose of convincing drivers who are pulled over to provide a breath sample. In the Crowns opinion, a flexible interpretation of the word forthwith is needed to combat the problem of drinking and driving and deter impaired individuals from driving. Relying on Quansah, the appellant submits that a short delay that is reasonable and necessary in light of all the circumstances must be permitted, including a delay due to the time required to bring an ASD to an officer who needs one. Adopting a flexible approach would also prevent problems in the performance of the work of police officers, who do not always have such a device with them or who, for a variety of practical reasons, cannot take a breath sample immediately. Second, the Crown argues that possession of an ASD at the time the demand is made is not an essential element of the offence under s. 254(5) Cr. C. The Crown contends that if Parliament had intended to make possession of an ASD a requirement, it would have said so clearly, as it does in the current s. 320.27(2) Cr. C. Nonetheless, the Crown acknowledges that if this Court finds that the demand made by Constable Atkins was invalid because of the absence of an ASD, the respondents acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal must be upheld.\nThe respondent argues that, unless there are unusual circumstances, the word forthwith must be given an interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning, because a driver who is stopped for a breath sample is being detained without the right to counsel. In the respondents view, the Court of Appeal did not exhaustively define the unusual circumstances that may justify a more flexible interpretation of the word forthwith, but it did correctly find that a shortfall in the number of ASDs for budgetary or administrative reasons is not such a circumstance. Because the Crown has not shown that there were unusual circumstances, the demand made by Constable Atkins was invalid and the acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal must be affirmed.\nAnalysis\nIt is important to begin by reproducing s. 254(2)(b) and s. 254(5) as they read at the relevant time:\n\t254 . . .\n\tTesting for presence of alcohol or a drug\n\t(2) If a peace officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has alcohol or a drug in their body and that the person has, within the preceding three hours, operated a motor vehicle or vessel, operated or assisted in the operation of an aircraft or railway equipment or had the care or control of a motor vehicle, a vessel, an aircraft or railway equipment, whether it was in motion or not, the peace officer may, by demand, require the person to comply with paragraph (a), in the case of a drug, or with either or both of paragraphs (a) and (b), in the case of alcohol:\n\t(a) to perform forthwith physical coordination tests prescribed by regulation to enable the peace officer to determine whether a demand may be made under subsection (3) or (3.1) and, if necessary, to accompany the peace officer for that purpose; and\n\t(b) to provide forthwith a sample of breath that, in the peace officers opinion, will enable a proper analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device and, if necessary, to accompany the peace officer for that purpose.\n\t. . .\n\tFailure or refusal to comply with demand\n\t(5) Everyone commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with a demand made under this section.\nAt the end of a statutory interpretation exercise, I am of the view that the Court of Appeal was correct in law in holding that, as a general rule, the word forthwith must be given an interpretation that reflects its ordinary meaning. This interpretation is consistent with the text, context and purpose of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. It is also in keeping with the decisions of this Court, from R. v. Thomsen, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640, to Woods, in which the word forthwith has been interpreted in a manner consistent with its ordinary meaning, except in unusual circumstances.\nApplicable Principles of Statutory Interpretation\nEvery statutory interpretation exercise involves reading the words of a provision in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26; see also R. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 15, at para. 21).\nCourts therefore have to interpret the text through which the legislature seeks to achieve [its] objective, because the goal of the interpretative exercise is to find harmony between the words of the statute and the intended objective, not to achieve the objective at all costs (MediaQMI inc. v. Kamel, 2021 SCC 23, at para. 39, quoting Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v. United Steelworkers, 2013 SCC 6, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 271, at para. 174). Consequently, as laudable and important as the fight against impaired driving may be, it is not permissible, in the pursuit of that objective, to distort the meaning to be given to the text of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. in the statutory interpretation exercise.\nFinally, in interpreting a criminal law provision like s. 254(2)(b), courts must be careful not to create uncertainty, for [i]t is a fundamental requirement of the rule of law that a person should be able to predict whether a particular act constitutes a crime at the time he commits the act (R. v. Mabior, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at para. 14; see also R. v. Kelly, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 170, at p. 203; R. v. Levkovic, 2013 SCC 25, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 204, at para. 1; Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at p. 1155).\nI turn now to the interpretation of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nSection 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nText\nIt is important to consider the meaning of two words found in this provision: provide and forthwith. Provide means to supply something to someone (Canadian Oxford Dictionary (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 1245). Forthwith means immediately or without delay (Woods, at para. 13, quoting Canadian Oxford Dictionary, at p. 585; see also R. v. Grant, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 139, at p. 150).\nAccording to the grammatical and ordinary meaning of these words, a driver detained under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. must supply a breath sample to the peace officer immediately or without delay. In addition, the provision states that the sample will enable a proper analysis to be made by means of an ASD.\nTherefore, and contrary to what the Crown argues, the word forthwith qualifies the demand that drivers must obey. Stopped drivers are bound by s. 254(2) to comply immediately (Woods, at para. 45). They are not free to provide a sample when they see fit.\nIt is true that operational time is implicit in the word forthwith, because the officer has to ready the equipment and instruct the suspect on what to do (Bernshaw, at para. 64). However, what is in issue in this case is not operational time, but rather the time needed for a device to be delivered to the scene.\nContext\nThe power conferred by s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. relates to an investigative procedure. It is the first step in a two-step detection and enforcement procedure, the second being the breathalyzer test that is generally administered at the police station and that requires the peace officer to have reasonable grounds to believe that the drivers blood alcohol level exceeds the legal limit (Woods, at para. 6).\nThe constitutionality of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. depends on an interpretation of the word forthwith that is consistent with its ordinary meaning:\n\tSection 254(2) authorizes roadside testing for alcohol consumption, under pain of criminal prosecution, in violation of ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. But for its requirement of immediacy, s. 254(2) would not pass constitutional muster. That requirement cannot be expanded to cover the nature and extent of the delay that occurred here.\n\t(Woods, at para. 15)\nAlthough a stopped driver is being detained at the first step of the detection procedure, the driver has no right to counsel; this right exists only at the second step (Woods, at para. 31). This is the case because the word forthwith implicitly limits the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter. This is a condition for the application of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.; since the detained driver must provide a breath sample forthwith, the driver may not consult counsel before doing so. The Court has recognized that this limit on s. 10(b) of the Charter is justified under s. 1 (Thomsen, at p. 653; Woods, at para. 30) precisely because the detention is of very brief duration (Bernshaw, at para. 23). The more flexibly the word forthwith is interpreted, the less the recognized justification for limiting the right to counsel holds up.\nFurthermore, as I said above, a driver who refuses or fails to comply with a demand is subject to criminal sanctions under s. 254(5) Cr. C. It is therefore not an offence to express an intention to refuse once the ASD arrives at the scene; refusing without reasonable excuse to provide forthwith a sample is what constitutes the offence (Woods, at paras. 14 and 45). This suggests that compliance must actually be physically possible.\nFinally, in both its written and its oral submissions, the Crown invited this Court to interpret s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. in light of the new scheme that came into force in 2018. I would decline the invitation, for the following reasons.\nNew Impaired Driving Detection Scheme\nOn June 21, 2018, the Act to amend the Criminal Code (offences relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, S.C. 2018, c. 21, received royal assent. Through that Act, Parliament repealed ss. 249 to 261 of the Criminal Code and introduced ss. 320.11 to 320.4, which came into force on December 18, 2018.\nThe wording of s. 320.27(1)(b) Cr. C. is substantially similar to that of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. Section 320.27(1)(b) Cr. C. provides that if a peace officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has alcohol in their body and that the person has operated a conveyance within the preceding three hours, the peace officer may, by demand, require the person to immediately provide the samples of breath that, in the peace officers opinion, are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made by means of an ASD. Under s. 320.15(1) Cr. C., everyone who fails or refuses to comply, without reasonable excuse, with such a demand is subject to criminal sanctions.\nOne of the distinctions between the new scheme and the former one is s. 320.27(2) Cr. C., which authorizes the random screening of drivers by peace officers who have an ASD in their possession and who are acting in the course of the lawful exercise of their powers, even if there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that a stopped driver has alcohol in their body.\nAccording to the Crowns argument, because s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. does not expressly require peace officers to have an ASD in their possession when they make a demand, the word forthwith must not be interpreted as creating such an obligation in practice. At the hearing of the appeal, the appellant urged the Court to see in the new scheme an indication that Parliament took notice of and did not wish to repudiate the jurisprudence of certain appellate courts in this country allowing delays of several minutes. In my view, this argument must be rejected, for two reasons.\nFirst, subsequent legislative history, that is, the amendments made to the version of a provision in force at the relevant time, can cast no light on the intention of the enacting Parliament or Legislature with respect to that version predating the amendments (United States of America v. Dynar, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462, at para. 45; see also Bank of Montreal v. Marcotte, 2014 SCC 55, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 725, at para. 78). As stated by s. 45(3) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, [t]he repeal or amendment of an enactment in whole or in part shall not be deemed to be or to involve any declaration as to the previous state of the law. In the same vein, s. 45(4) of the Interpretation Act adds that [a] re-enactment, revision, consolidation or amendment of an enactment shall not be deemed to be or to involve an adoption of the construction that has by judicial decision or otherwise been placed on the language used in the enactment or on similar language.\nEven if the retention of the word immediatement in the French version of s. 320.27(1) Cr. C. (forthwith has been replaced by immediately in the English version) could be seen as confirmation of the interpretation given to this word by the courts (which Parliament is presumed to know), that body of jurisprudence consists primarily of this Courts decisions in Thomsen, Grant, Bernshaw and Woods, in which this word was interpreted in a manner consistent with its ordinary meaning, except in unusual circumstances (C.A. reasons, at para. 67 in fine). As Doyon J.A. properly noted in his reasons, if Parliament had wished to depart from that interpretation, it was free to use other words  such as [translation] as soon as reasonably possible or as soon as practicable (para. 68). Yet it did not do so.\nSecond, and more importantly, there is a conceptual difference between the possession requirement in s. 320.27(2) Cr. C. and the immediacy requirement, which relates to temporality. Indeed, the word immediately is also used in s. 320.27(2) Cr. C. It follows that the guidance provided by this judgment on the interpretation of the immediacy requirement in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. applies to the interpretation of the word immediately in s. 320.27(1)(b) Cr. C.\nPurpose\nThe detection procedure of which s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. forms a part has a purpose with both a preventive aspect and a remedial aspect, namely to combat the menace of impaired driving. First, with regard to the preventive aspect, the procedure increases the risk of detection in the minds of impaired drivers, with a view to deterring them from getting behind the wheel. Then, with regard to the remedial aspect, the procedure is intended to detect dangerous drivers quickly and get them off the road (Woods, at paras. 6 and 30; Thomsen, at p. 655).\nIn the pursuit of this purpose, Parliament also sought to strike a balance between the public interest in eradicating driver impairment and the need to safeguard individual Charter rights (Woods, at para. 29). The Court must keep this balance in mind when interpreting s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nConclusion on the Interpretation of Section 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nThe ordinary meaning of the word forthwith is in keeping with the purpose of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. and the context of this provision. Moreover, our Court has consistently interpreted this word by giving it this specific meaning, subject to unusual circumstances. For example, in Grant, this Court refused to interpret the word forthwith as allowing for a 30-minute delay for the delivery of an ASD to the scene (see also Thomsen, at pp. 653-55; Woods, at paras. 13 and 43-44).\nIt was in Bernshaw that this Court opened the door to a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. In that case, a driver was pulled over and a police officer smelled alcohol on his breath. In reply to a question by the police officer, the driver admitted that he had been drinking. The officer then demanded that the driver take a screening test using an ASD, which he failed. The reliability of the result was challenged because of the possible presence of alcohol in the drivers mouth less than 15 minutes before the test, which could have falsely elevated the reading on the ASD. This Court held that the word forthwith allowed for a 15-minute waiting period in order to collect a reliable sample. To reach that conclusion, it relied on the wording of the provision in force at the time, which stated that the sample obtained had to be necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made by means of an ASD. The provision thus included requirements relating to the use of the ASD in order to ensure that a proper analysis could be made, which justified a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. Nevertheless, such a delay is not acceptable in every case, but only where the officer has information suggesting that a sample collected without waiting would not be reliable (Bernshaw, at paras. 71-73, citing R. v. Pierman (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 704 (C.A.), affd in part [1996] 1 S.C.R. 68).\nThis Court drew on Bernshaw in Woods. In that case, a driver was stopped by two police officers. Detecting a strong odour of alcohol in the drivers car, the officers demanded that he provide a breath sample pursuant to what was then s. 254(2) Cr. C. The driver refused and was arrested under s. 254(5) Cr. C. and taken to the police station, where he arrived about an hour after his arrest. At the station, the police demanded a second time that the driver provide a breath sample. The driver agreed. After several attempts, he provided a valid sample, which was a fail. He was therefore required to provide a breathalyzer sample. Based on the breathalyzer reading, the driver was charged with and later convicted of operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding the legal limit.\nThis Court, per Fish J., held that the breath sample was inadmissible in evidence because it had been provided approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes after the demand and not forthwith as required by s. 254(2) Cr. C. Citing Bernshaw, Fish J. stated that the word forthwith may in unusual circumstances be given a more flexible interpretation than its ordinary meaning strictly suggests (Woods, at para. 43). However, the Court noted that the immediacy requirement must generally be interpreted in accordance with the usual meaning of the word forthwith, referring in particular to R. v. Cote (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 667 (C.A.), in which Arbour J.A., as she then was, had found that a 14-minute delay due to the absence of an ASD at the scene did not satisfy the immediacy requirement:\n\tSpeaking for a unanimous court, Arbour J.A. (as she then was) cited the passage I have reproduced from Grant, and explained:\n\tIf the accused must be taken to a detachment, where contact with counsel could more easily be accommodated than at the side of the road, a large component of the rationale in Thomsen disappears. In other words, if the police officer is not in a position to require that a breath sample be provided by the accused before any realistic opportunity to consult counsel, then the officers demand is not a demand made under s. 238(2). The issue is thus not strictly one of computing the number of minutes that fall within or without the scope of the word forthwith. Here, the officer was ready to collect the breath sample in less than half the time it took in Grant. However, in view of the circumstances, particularly the wait at the police detachment, I conclude that the demand was not made within s. 238(2). As the demand did not comply with s. 238(2), the appellant was not required to comply with the demand and his refusal to do so did not constitute an offence. [Emphasis added; p. 285.]\n\tIt is for these reasons that we are prohibited on constitutional grounds from expanding the meaning of forthwith in s. 254(2) to cover the delays that occurred in this case.\n\t(Woods, at paras. 35-36)\nTherefore, the relevant time period for the explicit immediacy requirement is the period between the making of the demand and the moment when the breath sample can be provided (C.A. reasons, at para. 42). The above passage from Woods echoes the idea, originally stated in Thomsen, that a limit on the right to counsel results by implication from the language of s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C., and specifically from the word forthwith. Indeed, but for the immediacy requirement, the provision would not pass constitutional muster (Woods, at para. 15). The immediacy requirement is, of course, usually discussed in relation to the right to counsel guaranteed by s. 10(b) of the Charter. However, this is not the only constitutional right that may be engaged by this requirement; this may also be the case for the rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, which guarantee protection against, respectively, unreasonable search or seizure and arbitrary detention or imprisonment (Woods, at para. 15).\nIt follows that the approach adopted by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Quansah needs to be qualified. It is true that the immediacy requirement is not met where the length of the detention was such that the stopped driver could realistically have consulted counsel. It is also true that, in the reverse case, the analysis is not at an end, because there are situations in which the immediacy requirement is not met even though there was not enough time to consult counsel (Quansah, at paras. 34-35). However, with respect, the Ontario Court of Appeal broadened the immediacy requirement unduly by finding that it must allow for the time reasonably necessary to enable the officer to discharge his or her duty as contemplated by s. 254(2) (Quansah, at para. 47). Forthwith is not synonymous with time reasonably necessary; this word must be given an interpretation consistent with its ordinary meaning, except in the unusual circumstances referred to by Fish J. at para. 43 of Woods.\nThat being so, what must be determined is whether the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time a demand is made under s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. is an unusual circumstance that justifies a more flexible interpretation of the word forthwith.\nUnusual Circumstances That Allow for a Flexible Interpretation of the Word Forthwith\nThe Quebec Court of Appeal was correct in law in stating that unusual circumstances related to the use of the ASD or the reliability of the result that will be generated may justify a flexible interpretation of the word forthwith found in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C.\nAs I mentioned above, it is neither necessary nor desirable for the purposes of this appeal to identify in the abstract, and in an exhaustive manner, the circumstances that may be characterized as unusual and may justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. It is preferable for those circumstances to be identified on a case-by-case basis in light of the facts of each matter. However, it is important to provide some guidelines to assist lower courts in this inquiry.\nFirst, the burden of establishing the existence of unusual circumstances rests on the Crown.\nSecond, as in Bernshaw, the unusual circumstances must be identified in light of the text of the provision (Piazza, at para. 81 (CanLII)). This preserves the provisions constitutional integrity by ensuring that courts do not unduly extend the ordinary meaning strictly given to the word forthwith.\nLike the provision at issue in Bernshaw, s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. specifies that the sample collected must enable a proper analysis to be made, which opens the door to delays caused by unusual circumstances related to the use of the device or the reliability of the result.\nThat being said, courts might recognize unusual circumstances other than those directly related to the use of the ASD or the reliability of the result that will be generated. For example, insofar as the primary purpose of the impaired driving detection procedure is to ensure everyones safety, circumstances involving urgency in ensuring the safety of the public or of peace officers might be recognized.\nThird, unusual circumstances cannot arise from budgetary considerations or considerations of practical efficiency. A flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement cannot be justified by the magnitude of the public funding required to supply police forces with ASDs or by the time needed to train officers to use them. There is nothing unusual about such utilitarian considerations. Allocating a limited budget is the daily reality of any government (Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique v. British Columbia, 2020 SCC 13, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 678, at para. 153).\nFourth, the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the demand is made is not in itself an unusual circumstance.\nA Demand Made in the Absence of an ASD Is Not Presumed To Be Valid\nIn oral argument, counsel for the Crown contended that a demand made in the absence of an ASD is presumed to be valid. According to counsel, a detained driver must therefore agree to provide the requested sample even though it is impossible for the driver to provide it given the absence of a device. Only if the device arrives too late (an expression that, I might add, is not clearly defined) can the driver then refuse to provide the breath sample and be shielded from any criminal liability; the presumed validity of the demand would, so to speak, lapse. On the other hand, again according to the Crown, if the driver from the outset expresses an intention to refuse to provide a sample, then the driver commits the offence provided for in s. 254(5) Cr. C., despite the physical impossibility of complying with the demand made.\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal adopted this reasoning in Degiorgio. The case involved a driver who refused three times to provide a breath sample when the officer had no ASD with him. The Court of Appeal, which upheld the guilty verdict, found that immediacy does not define the substance of the offence. Where a driver immediately refuses to comply, the prosecution is thus not required to show that, had it not been for the refusal, the police could have administered the test in accordance with the immediacy requirement (Degiorgio, at paras. 57-58, quoting with approval R. v. Danychuk (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 215 (C.A.)).\nWith respect, I do not agree. As I have already explained, the word forthwith qualifies the demand to provide a breath sample. It is refusing to obey that demand to provide forthwith a sample that constitutes a criminal offence, not stating in advance that one will refuse to comply with the demand once an ASD is available at the scene. Moreover, and as Doyon J.A. properly noted at paras. 49-50 and 55 of the Court of Appeals judgment, how can a person be criminally liable for refusing to comply with a demand  that is, a demand to provide a breath sample  with which it was not actually possible to comply because of the absence of an ASD at the time the demand was made? To ask the question is to answer it.\nMore fundamentally, a demand cannot be both valid and invalid. In other words, to reiterate what the Court of Appeal in essence said, the validity of a demand cannot be conditional on the time needed for an ASD to be delivered to the scene (C.A. reasons, at paras. 51-61). This would be the situation if the approach of the Crown and the Ontario Court of Appeal were accepted.\nSuch an approach creates intolerable uncertainty for drivers. It is a basic legal principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse. It must therefore be possible for people to know in advance, before committing an act, whether the act constitutes a crime (Mabior, at para. 14). When a detained driver has to respond to a demand to provide a breath sample, the driver must be able to know whether the demand is valid and whether refusing will result in criminal liability (C.A. reasons, at para. 51). In a context where the driver is unable to retain and instruct counsel, it cannot legitimately and realistically be expected that the driver will agree in advance to comply and will then be capable of determining when the delay in the delivery of an ASD justifies a refusal. This also shows why a restrained approach must be taken in identifying what may constitute an unusual circumstance allowing for a flexible interpretation of the word forthwith. The more flexibly the word is interpreted, thereby turning immediacy into a variable requirement, the more necessary it becomes for drivers to retain and instruct counsel (R. v. Talbourdet (1984), 9 D.L.R. (4th) 406 (Sask. C.A.), at pp. 414-15, a contrario). Indeed, this was the wish expressed by the respondent after he first refused to provide a breath sample.\nNothing in s. 254(2)(b) Cr. C. indicates that Parliament intended to create the presumption of validity proposed by the Crown. That being said, peace officers who have no ASD with them when they stop a driver who is suspected of having alcohol in their body are not entirely without options. They can require the driver to perform coordination tests, as permitted by the current s. 320.27(1)(a) Cr. C. These officers also have common law powers to check for sobriety. Where doing so is reasonable and necessary, they can, among other things, question a driver who is lawfully stopped about prior alcohol consumption or ask the driver to perform physical tests other than those provided for in the Criminal Code (R. v. Orbanski, 2005 SCC 37, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 43-49; Leclerc v. R., 2022 QCCA 365, at paras. 45-48 (CanLII)).\nFinally, I should address the Crowns argument that the respondent cannot rely on the absence of an ASD at the scene to justify his refusal because he was unaware of that absence while stopped by the police. With respect, I disagree. Accepting this argument could encourage peace officers not to be transparent, because when they stop a driver, they are normally the only ones to know whether or not they are in possession of an ASD. This would mean that peace officers could, at their sole discretion and in an arbitrary manner, make valid a demand that otherwise would have been invalid if the driver had been informed of the absence of an ASD at the scene at the time the driver was stopped.\nApplication to the Facts of the Case\nThe Crown has not shown that there was any unusual circumstance that would account for the absence of an ASD at the scene and thereby justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy requirement. In fact, the appellant is unable to explain why Constables Atkins and Cote-Lemieux did not have an ASD in their possession. The demand made by Constable Atkins was therefore invalid. Accordingly, the respondents refusal did not attract criminal liability, and the acquittal entered by the Quebec Court of Appeal must be upheld.\nDisposition\nFor these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.\n\tAppeal dismissed.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions, Quebec; Giasson et associes  Ville de Quebec, Quebec.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Labrecque Doyon, Quebec.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada: Department of Justice Canada, Ottawa.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Attorney General of Ontario, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Association quebecoise des avocats et avocates de la defense: BMD Avocats inc., Laval.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener Association des avocats de la defense de Montreal-Laval-Longueuil: Marcoux Elayoubi Raymond, Longueuil; Desjardins Cote, Montreal.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Clarifies the Validity of Breath Sample Demands**\n\n**Introduction**\nThis appeal concerns the central question of whether a demand made by a police officer to provide a breath sample under Section 254(2)(b) of the Criminal Code requires that the officer have immediate access to an approved screening device at the time of making the demand.\n\n**Background**\nPascal Breault, the complainant, was stopped by police officers Constables Dale Atkins and Jean-Michel Cote-Lemieux on April 2, 2017, after being observed driving an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) while intoxicated. The accused is the Crown, which prosecuted Breault for refusing to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample under Section 254(2)(b) of the Criminal Code. The core allegations involve whether Breault's refusal to comply constitutes an offence under Section 254(5).\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe trial process began in the Municipal Court of Ville de Quebec, where Judge Simard convicted Mr. Pascal Breault for refusing to comply with a demand made under Section 254(2) Cr.C., contrary to Sections 254(5) and 255(1) Cr.C. The respondent appealed to the Superior Court and then to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which allowed his appeal and declared that Petit, another relevant case law cited by Judge Simard, no longer had precedential value. The court proceedings moved forward with an appeal from Her Majesty The King (the Crown), arguing against the decision made by Doyon J.A. and D' Carlos J.A. at Quebec Court of Appeal.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nA demand made by a police officer under s. 254(2)(b) Cr.C requires that they have immediate access to an approved screening device at all times when making such demands.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for majority Cote J emphasized that this interpretation is essential in maintaining balance struck between safeguarding drivers' constitutional rights & eradicating impaired driving ensuring drivers are not subjected unconstitutional detention & searches without counsel present during brief stops impairment testing", "citation": "2023 SCC 9", "original_summary": "<strong>The  Supreme Court of Canada rules that police must have an approved screening  device with them when they order someone to provide a breath sample. </strong>Early in the afternoon  of April 2, 2017, in Val\u2011B\u00e9lair near Quebec City, police were looking for  someone reported by trail patrollers to be driving an all\u2011terrain vehicle (ATV)  while drunk. They stopped Pascal Breault, who was walking away from a parked  ATV at a campsite. The officers wanted to take a breath sample from Mr.\u00a0Breault,  but they did not have an approved screening device (ASD) to do so. They radioed  nearby officers to obtain a device. While still waiting  for the device, the officers demanded that Mr.\u00a0Breault provide a breath  sample. Mr.\u00a0Breault refused three times to provide the required sample,  even after he was told that refusing without a reasonable excuse to comply with  the demand was a criminal offence. Given the repeated refusals of Mr.\u00a0Breault,  who said he had not driven the <abbr title=\"all\u2011terrain vehicle\">ATV</abbr>, and given that the device had not yet  arrived, the officers eventually cancelled their request. Mr.\u00a0Breault was  then charged with refusing to comply with a demand by police to provide a  breath sample.Under section 254(2)(b)  of the <em>Criminal Code</em> (now section\u00a0320.27(1)(b)),  police can demand that a person \u201cprovide forthwith\u201d a breath sample if the  person is suspected of drinking and driving within the last three hours. The  test must be done using an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr>. When a person blows into the device, it  provides officers with a reading that determines if there is sufficient alcohol  in the person\u2019s body to warrant a full breathalyzer test. Anyone who refuses to  take the test without a reasonable excuse commits a criminal offence. A municipal court in  Quebec found Mr.\u00a0Breault guilty of refusing to comply with a demand to  provide a breath sample, and Quebec\u2019s Superior Court dismissed his appeal. He  then turned to the Quebec Court of Appeal, which allowed his appeal and  acquitted him. The Crown appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court has dismissed  the appeal. <strong>The demand by police to provide a breath sample  was invalid because they did not have immediate access to an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr> when making  the demand. </strong>Writing for a unanimous  Court, Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 ruled that the validity of a demand to provide a  breath sample requires that police have immediate access to an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr> at the time  the demand is made. According to Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9, the word \u201cforthwith\u201d in section 254(2)(b)  must, as a general rule, be given a strict interpretation that reflects its  ordinary meaning, namely \u201cimmediately\u201d or \u201cwithout delay\u201d. At this step of the  detection procedure, a detained driver does not have a right to counsel as guaranteed  by section 10(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter  of Rights and Freedoms</em>, since the driver must provide a breath sample immediately.  The limit on this right is justified because the detention is very brief. It is  therefore essential to the constitutional validity of this provision that the  interpretation given to the word \u201cforthwith\u201d be consistent with its ordinary  meaning. As she noted, \u201c[t]he more flexibly the word \u2018forthwith\u2019 is interpreted, the less the  recognized justification for limiting the right to counsel holds up\u201d. Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 stated  that, exceptionally, unusual circumstances may justify a flexible  interpretation of the word \u201cforthwith\u201d if they are related to the use of the  device or the reliability of the result. However, unusual circumstances cannot arise  from budgetary considerations or considerations of practical efficiency, such  as the supplying of <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr>s to police forces or the time needed to train officers  to use them. The absence of a device at the scene at the time the demand is made is  not in itself an unusual circumstance.The Crown did not show  that there were unusual circumstances that would account for the absence of an <abbr title=\"approved screening device\">ASD</abbr> at the scene and thus justify a flexible interpretation of the immediacy  requirement. Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 therefore found that the demand made by police was  invalid. For these reasons, Mr.\u00a0Breault\u2019s refusal to provide a breath  sample was not a criminal offence."}, "25": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nHis Majesty The King\tAppellant\nv.\nWalker McColman\tRespondent\nand\nDirector of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions and\nCanadian Civil Liberties Association\tInterveners\nIndexed as: R. v.

The police followed M when he drove out of the parking lot and onto the highway. The police formed the intention on the highway to conduct a random sobriety stop of M pursuant to s. 48(1) of Ontarios Highway Traffic Act (HTA). By the time the police caught up to M, he had pulled off the highway onto a private driveway that served his parents home. After stopping M, the police observed obvious signs of impairment and arrested him. M was charged with impaired driving and with operating a motor vehicle with an excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to the Criminal Code.\n\tThe trial judge concluded that s. 48(1) of the HTA provided lawful authority for the random sobriety stop. He found M guilty of both charges and stayed the impaired driving conviction. The summary conviction appeal judge allowed Ms appeal, finding that neither s. 48(1) nor s. 216(1) of the HTA permitted police to conduct random sobriety stops on private property absent reasonable and probable grounds. He found that the police breached Ms s. 9 Charter right, and he excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter and entered an acquittal. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the Crowns appeal of the acquittal.\n\tHeld: The appeal is allowed, the acquittal set aside, and the conviction and the stay entered at trial restored.\n\tPolice do not have statutory authority under s. 48(1) of the HTA to conduct random sobriety stops on private property. While s. 48(1) of the HTA furnishes police officers with the statutory authority to randomly stop a motor vehicle to ascertain the sobriety of the driver, the HTAs definition of the term driver places sharp limits on police officers authority to conduct random sobriety stops under s. 48(1). The HTA contains two definitions of the word driver. Section 1(1) states that driver means a person who drives a vehicle on a highway, and s. 48(18) provides that within s. 48, driver includes a person who has care or control of a motor vehicle. The definition in s. 1(1) is exhaustive and specifies the scope of the word driver, whereas the definition in s. 48(18) is non-exhaustive and expands the ordinary meaning of the defined term. The definition of driver in s. 1(1) is two-pronged; it targets both an activity and the locus of such activity. To be a driver, one must be driving a vehicle (activity) and must do so on a highway (locus). The definition in s. 48(18) seeks only to expand the activity prong of the definition and not the locus element. Under a harmonious reading of the two definitions of driver, for the purpose of s. 48(1), driver refers to a person who is driving, or has care or control of, a motor vehicle on a highway. A person who has care or control of a motor vehicle but who is no longer on a highway would not be a driver under the HTA. \n\tSection 48(1) authority cannot be used by police to carry out a random sobriety stop on private property on the basis that the driver was on the highway at the time the police officer formed the subjective intention to stop them. While s. 48(1) sets out the circumstances under which police can stop drivers without reasonable and probable grounds to ascertain sobriety, s. 216(1) of the HTA sets out the mechanics of the general police power to stop vehicles, including the corresponding duty on drivers to stop when signalled or requested to stop. Sections 216(1) and 48(1) fit together to supply a police power to conduct random sobriety stops on highways and a correspondent duty on drivers to stop when signalled or requested to stop. Section 216(1) supplies a communication requirement, such that a police officer seeking to invoke s. 48(1) authority must, at a minimum, signal or otherwise request that the driver stop their vehicle on a highway. The police must therefore communicate their intention to a driver to effect a random stop on a highway in order to fall under s. 48(1) of the HTA. \n\tIn the instant case, M was not a driver for the purposes of s. 48(1) of the HTA when he was stopped by the police. Even if it can be said that he had care or control of the ATV, he was not on a highway when the police effected the stop. Therefore, the police stop was unauthorized by s. 48(1). Since the police waited until M had pulled into the private driveway before they signalled their intention to stop him, they did not properly invoke their authority to conduct a random sobriety stop under s. 48(1) of the HTA. Since the stop was unlawful, the police breached Ms rights under s. 9 of the Charter, as a detention not authorized by law is arbitrary.\n\tHowever, on the whole and considering all of the circumstances, the evidence obtained from the unlawful police stop should not have been excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The police acted without statutory authority in effecting the stop of M but given the legal uncertainty that existed at the time of the random sobriety stop, the breach was not so serious as to require the Court to disassociate itself from the police actions. The legal uncertainty pulls in favour of exclusion, but only slightly. The unlawful police stop constituted a marked, although not egregious, intrusion on Ms Charter-protected interests and moderately favours exclusion of the evidence. However, the evidence collected by the police was reliable and crucial to the Crowns case and impaired driving is a serious offence. Admission of the evidence would better serve the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process and would not damage the long-term repute of the justice system. \nCases Cited\n\tApplied: R. v.

Johnston and Lex Gill, for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\n\n\tThe Chief Justice and OBonsawin J.  \nOverview\nThis case is about whether police can conduct a random sobriety stop on private property under s. 48(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (HTA). A constable of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) formed the intention on a highway to randomly stop the respondent to ascertain his sobriety, and followed him onto a private driveway to do so. Once the constable approached the respondent, he observed obvious signs of intoxication and the respondent indicated that he might have had 10 beers. Two subsequent breathalyzer tests revealed that the respondents blood alcohol concentration was above the legal limit.\nIn our view, the police officers did not have statutory authority under s. 48(1) of the HTA to follow the respondent onto the private driveway to conduct the random sobriety stop. Accordingly, the police officers breached the respondents rights under s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Nonetheless, for the reasons that follow, we would not exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter. Accordingly, we would allow the appeal. \nFacts\nAt around 12:30 a.m. on March 26, 2016, Constables Jeff Lobsinger and Laura Hicks of the OPP were on general patrol in the vicinity of the Thessalon First Nation. While on patrol, Cst. Lobsinger spotted an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) parked outside a convenience store. The respondent, Walker McColman, drove the ATV out of the parking lot and onto the highway, at which point Cst. Lobsinger directed Cst. Hicks to follow the ATV in their cruiser.\nThe trial judge found as a matter of fact that Cst. Lobsinger formed the intention on the highway to conduct a random sobriety stop of Mr. McColman pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA. At trial, Cst. Lobsinger conceded that Mr. McColman had not manifested signs of impaired driving that would have otherwise warranted a stop. That is, the police officers did not have reasonable and probable grounds to stop him. \nBy the time the officers caught up to Mr. McColman, he had pulled off the highway onto a private driveway that served his parents home as well as a commercial establishment. There was no suggestion at trial that Mr. McColman pulled onto the driveway to avoid the police officers. Approximately one minute elapsed between when Cst. Lobsinger spotted the ATV and when the police officers stopped him.\nAfter stopping Mr. McColman, Cst. Lobsinger spoke with him and observed obvious signs of impairment, ranging from a strong odour of alcohol to his inability to stand up straight. According to Cst. Lobsingers testimony, Mr. McColman stated that he mightve had 10 beers that evening: A.R., at p. 154. Cst. Lobsinger arrested Mr. McColman for impaired driving at 12:36 a.m. and brought him to the police station. \nAt the police station, the breathalyzer test was delayed because Mr. McColman vomited due to his alcohol consumption. A police officer eventually conducted 2 breathalyzer tests, which recorded his blood alcohol concentration level as 120 and 110 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police charged Mr. McColman with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and with operating a motor vehicle with an excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. Section 253 was repealed and replaced in 2018.\nRelevant Provisions\nSection 1(1) of the HTA defines a driver as a person who drives a vehicle on a highway. It further defines a highway as including:\n. . . a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct or trestle, any part of which is intended for or used by the general public for the passage of vehicles and includes the area between the lateral property lines thereof;\nSection 48(1) of the HTA furnishes police officers with the statutory authority to randomly stop a motor vehicle to ascertain the sobriety of the driver. It provides:\nA police officer, readily identifiable as such, may require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop for the purpose of determining whether or not there is evidence to justify making a demand under section 320.27 or 320.28 of the Criminal Code (Canada).\nSection 48(18) provides that, within s. 48, a driver includes a person who has care or control of a motor vehicle. \nLastly, s. 216(1) of the HTA sets out the broader police power to stop vehicles and the corresponding duty on drivers. It provides:\nA police officer, in the lawful execution of his or her duties and responsibilities, may require the driver of a vehicle, other than a bicycle, to stop and the driver of a vehicle, when signalled or requested to stop by a police officer who is readily identifiable as such, shall immediately come to a safe stop.\nJudicial History\nOntario Court of Justice\nMr. McColman brought a Charter application alleging, among other things, that the random sobriety stop was unlawful and breached his rights under s. 9 of the Charter. He maintained that the police did not have the authority to conduct the stop on private property. \nThe trial judge dismissed the application, concluding that s. 48(1) of the HTA provided lawful authority for the random sobriety stop. He found that the officers intended to stop Mr. McColmans vehicle for the purpose of checking the drivers sobriety, and that they had formed the intention to stop him while he was operating a vehicle on a highway. The trial judge reasoned:\nThe mere fact that [Cst. Lobsinger] did not effect this stop until [Mr. McColman] had turned into a private driveway and was thus on private property did not eliminate or invalidate the officers authority under s. 48 of the Highway Traffic Act. \n\n(voir dire reasons, at para. 54, reproduced in A.R., at p. 8.)\nIn light of his conclusion on s. 48(1) of the HTA, the trial judge declined to consider whether the officers had authority under the common law to stop Mr. McColman on his private driveway.\nThe trial judge subsequently found Mr. McColman guilty of impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and operating a motor vehicle with an excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge conditionally stayed the impaired driving conviction pursuant to this Courts guidance in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, and sentenced Mr. McColman to the mandatory minimums of a $1,000 fine (plus a $300 victim surcharge) and a 12-month driving prohibition. \nOntario Superior Court of Justice, 2019 ONSC 5359, 381 C.C.C. (3d) 375\nMr. McColman appealed to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, arguing, among other things, that the trial judge erred in finding that police officers are authorized to conduct random sobriety stops on private property pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA.\nThe summary conviction appeal judge allowed the appeal, finding that neither s. 48(1) nor s. 216(1) of the HTA permitted police officers to conduct sobriety or highway safety stops on private property absent reasonable and probable grounds. Once Mr. McColmans vehicle left the highway and entered the private driveway, he was no longer a driver within the meaning of the HTA. As a result, the police officers did not have the statutory authority to randomly detain Mr. McColman to check his sobriety. The appeal judge also found that the stop was not authorized under the common law.\nSince the random sobriety stop was unlawful, the appeal judge found that the police breached s. 9 of the Charter. In his analysis under s. 24(2) of the Charter, the appeal judge found that the actions of the police were serious, as the officers pursued [Mr. McColman] onto private property when they had neither the statutory [nor] common law authority to do so: para. 49. The impact of the breach was also significant, as Mr. McColman had a high expectation of privacy on his own property. While society clearly had an interest in the adjudication of the matter on its merits, the balancing exercise favoured exclusion under s. 24(2) of the Charter.\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario, 2021 ONCA 382, 156 O.R. (3d) 253\nThe Crown appealed the acquittal entered by the appeal judge, arguing that police are authorized to effect random sobriety stops on private property if they form the lawful intention to stop a driver on a highway. \nA majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (per Tulloch J.A., as he then was, Feldman J.A. concurring) dismissed the appeal. The court held that the plain language of s. 48(1) and the related definitions of driver and highway did not authorize random sobriety stops off the highway. The majority also held that the police did not have the common law authority to randomly check Mr. McColmans sobriety on private property. As a result, the stop was unlawful and breached Mr. McColmans rights under s. 9 of the Charter.\nThe majority agreed with the appeal judge that the evidence obtained from the unlawful stop should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. In assessing the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state misconduct, while the majority was not prepared to find that the police acted in bad faith, it found that their conduct was brazen and that a lack of clarity in the law . . . does not give officers free licence to assume that they have authority: paras. 84-85. As for the impact of the breach, the majority found that there was a significant impact on Mr. McColmans liberty and privacy interests because the police questioned him and obtained evidence against him in the course of an unlawful detention in an area in which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Finally, while excluding the evidence would undermine the truth-seeking function of the trial, the majority concluded that, in the interest of having a justice system that is beyond reproach, the court should not condone conduct that tests the limits of police authority. Accordingly, the majority excluded the evidence and upheld Mr. McColmans acquittal.\nJustice Hourigan, dissenting, held that both s. 48(1) of the HTA and the common law authorized the random sobriety stop. He maintained that the majoritys interpretation of the HTA runs counter to its public protection purpose because the legislature could not have intended for drivers to evade investigation by pulling over onto private property. Justice Hourigan adopted the Crowns interpretation of the HTA and found that the officers had the authority to make the stop in the circumstances.\nIn the alternative, Hourigan J.A. held that the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter and urged trial courts to conduct a more meaningful analysis of the Grant factors: R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. He held that the first line of inquiry militated against excluding the evidence because the state misconduct was minor or technical in nature, and the law was not well settled, as there was jurisprudence supporting the officers interpretation of their authority. The second line of inquiry similarly weighed against excluding the evidence because Mr. McColmans privacy expectations were minimal. The stop took place on a driveway shared with a commercial business, thereby giving the police an implied licence to enter. Finally, the third line of inquiry militated against excluding the evidence because the evidence was reliable and constituted overwhelming proof of Mr. McColmans guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on both counts. Accordingly, Hourigan J.A. would not have excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter.\nIssues\nThe Crowns appeal raises two issues. \nFirst, the Crown argues that the random sobriety stop was authorized under s. 48(1) of the HTA. It submits that police may conduct a random sobriety stop off a highway if the police officer forms the intention on a highway to check the drivers sobriety. In support of this submission, the Crown notes that unlike s. 216(1) of the HTA, s. 48(1) does not include language pertaining to the communication of the decision to stop the driver. The Crown also suggests that the definition of driver in s. 48(18) may oust the general definition of driver in s. 1(1) for the purpose of s. 48. This would authorize police to conduct a random sobriety stop whenever a person has care or control of a motor vehicle, regardless of whether the intention to stop was formed on a highway. \nSecond, if the HTA did not authorize the police stop, resulting in a breach of s. 9 of the Charter, the Crown submits that admission of Mr. McColmans impairment and blood alcohol concentration evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It maintains that the Charter-infringing state conduct was not serious, since the police acted in good faith in the context of legal uncertainty about the geographic limitations of the power to conduct random sobriety stops. The Crown argues that the impact of the breach was neither intrusive nor significant. The Crown submits that driving is a regulated activity and the sobriety stops are brief and limited to their purpose. Finally, the Crown maintains that there is significant public interest in adjudicating these charges on their merits given the reliability and centrality of the evidence.\nIt must be noted that this Court did not grant leave on the issue of whether the police had the common law authority to conduct the stop. \nAnalysis\nWas the Random Sobriety Stop Authorized by Section 48(1) of the HTA?\nThis case presents the first opportunity for this Court to address whether police officers can conduct random sobriety stops on private property pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA.\nOn several occasions, this Court has stated that various forms of random vehicular stops violate s. 9 of the Charter but are justified under s. 1. In R. v. Hufsky, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621, this Court held that statutorily authorized spot checks  random police checks conducted at stationary, predetermined locations  violate s. 9 but are justified under s. 1. Shortly after, this Court held in R. v. Ladouceur, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, that statutorily authorized roving stops  random police stops to check licences, proof of insurance, the mechanical fitness of vehicles and the sobriety of drivers  violate s. 9 but are justified under s. 1. \nPolice officers conducting random vehicular stops must exercise their powers vigilantly and ensure that they do not overstep the limits of their powers. Since these random stops constitute arbitrary detention, the detention will only be justified under s. 1 of the Charter if the police act within the limited highway-related purposes for which the powers were conferred: R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 22 (citations omitted). \n The question of whether police officers can effect random sobriety stops on private property has been addressed by various appellate courts across the country under their versions of the HTA: see, e.g., R. v. Lux, 2012 SKCA 129, 405 Sask. R. 214; R. v. Anderson, 2014 SKCA 32, 433 Sask. R. 255; Scott v. R., 2021 QCCS 3866. However, Ontarios HTA differs in important ways from the other provincial statutes that regulate driving and drivers. In analyzing a provision of the HTA, a court must keep its focus on the text, context, and purpose of the provision at issue. \nBoth the appellant Crown and the Court of Appeal for Ontario drew heavily upon jurisprudence of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. In Lux, police officers observed a motor vehicle driving in a private parking area and conducted a random sobriety stop of the vehicle while it was still within the private parking area. The Court of Appeal held that s. 209.1 of The Traffic Safety Act, S.S. 2004, c. T-18.1, did not authorize peace officers to conduct random sobriety stops on private property: para. 31. Two years later, in Anderson, a case factually similar to the case at bar, the Court of Appeal held that a police officer who had formed his intention on a highway to randomly stop the vehicle could lawfully complete the stop on private property pursuant to s. 209.1 of The Traffic Safety Act: paras. 24-25. \nDespite the seeming relevance of Lux and Anderson, Ontarios HTA differs in relevant respects from The Traffic Safety Act from Saskatchewan. Notably, the latter does not define the term driver; in contrast, as we shall discuss, the HTAs definition of driver places sharp limits on police officers authority to conduct random sobriety stops under s. 48(1) of the HTA. Given that Lux and Anderson focus closely on the specific wording of s. 209.1 of The Traffic Safety Act, neither judgment sheds much light on how this Court should approach s. 48(1) of Ontarios HTA.\nThe Meaning of Section 48(1) of the HTA\nWe turn now to s. 48(1) of the HTA, which states:\nA police officer, readily identifiable as such, may require the driver of a motor vehicle to stop for the purpose of determining whether or not there is evidence to justify making a demand under section 320.27 or 320.28 of the Criminal Code (Canada).\nUnder the modern approach to statutory interpretation, the words of a statute must be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 117, citing Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, and Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, both quoting E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; see also Canada v. Alta Energy Luxembourg S.A.R.L., 2021 SCC 49, at para. 37. In determining the meaning of the text, a court cannot read a statutory provision in isolation, but must read the provision in light of the broader statutory scheme: Rizzo, at para. 21.\nIn its written submissions and during oral argument, the Crown placed great weight on the broader purposes underlying the HTA. But a purposive analysis does not grant the interpreter licence to disregard the clear meaning of the statute: see R. v. D.A.I., 2012 SCC 5, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 149, at para. 26. \nThe key question in this case is whether Mr. McColman was a driver for the purpose of s. 48(1) of the HTA at the time of the random sobriety stop. The HTA contains two definitions of the word driver that may apply to Mr. McColman. Section 1(1) of the HTA states that driver means a person who drives a vehicle on a highway. By contrast, s. 48(18) provides that, within s. 48, driver includes a person who has care or control of a motor vehicle. In its factum, the Crown suggests that it is possible to interpret s. 48(1) such that it authorizes police to conduct random sobriety stops whenever they see someone in the care or control of a motor vehicle, irrespective of whether they intended to check the persons sobriety on a highway. In other words, the Crown submits that s. 48(18) sets out essential elements of what constitutes a driver. This argument must fail for two reasons.\nFirst, not all statutory definitions are exhaustive: R. Sullivan, The Construction of Statutes (7th ed. 2022). Exhaustive definitions declare the complete meaning of the defined term and completely displace whatever meanings the defined term might otherwise bear in ordinary or technical usage, whereas non-exhaustive definitions do not purport to displace the meaning that the defined term would have in ordinary usage; they simply add to, subtract from or exemplify that meaning: pp. 69-70. Exhaustive definitions are generally introduced using the verb means, while non-exhaustive definitions are introduced with the verb includes: pp. 69-70. \nHere, the definition in s. 1(1) is exhaustive and specifies the scope of the word driver, whereas the definition in s. 48(18) is non-exhaustive and expands the ordinary meaning of the defined term. Indeed, the definition of driver in s. 1(1) is two-pronged; it targets both an activity and the locus of such activity. To be a driver, one must be driving a vehicle (activity) and must do so on a highway (locus). The definition in s. 48(18) seeks only to expand the activity prong of the definition and not the locus element.\nSecond, this Court has stated that, while the relative effects of ordinary meaning, context, and purpose on the interpretive process may vary, courts must seek to read the provisions of an act as a harmonious whole: Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10. As stated above, a non-exhaustive definition does not necessarily oust other definitions. Depending on the context, exhaustive and non-exhaustive definitions can be read together. Under a harmonious reading of the two definitions of driver, for the purpose of s. 48(1), driver refers to a person who is driving, or has care or control of, a motor vehicle on a highway. A person who has care or control of a motor vehicle but who is no longer on a highway would not be a driver under the HTA. \nIn the present case, Mr. McColman was not a driver for the purpose of s. 48(1) when he was stopped by the police. Even if it can be said that he had care or control of the ATV, he was not on a highway when the police effected the stop. Therefore, the police stop was unauthorized by s. 48(1) of the HTA.\nThe Crown suggests that a core question in this appeal is whether police must communicate their intention to effect a random sobriety stop on a highway in order to fall under s. 48(1) of the HTA. The Crown argues that s. 48(1) authority is triggered when police form the intention to effect a random sobriety stop of a driver who is on a highway, and not when police communicate that intention to the driver. The Crown maintains that this interpretation is supported by s. 216(1) of the HTA.\nOn the Crowns view, s. 216(1) exhibits a legislative choice to put communication of intent to stop a driver at issue. Since the legislature chose not to include the language of signalled or requested to stop in s. 48(1), that section does not require the police to communicate their decision to stop a driver. So long as the driver was on the highway at the time the police officer formed the subjective intention to stop them, the officer can avail themselves of s. 48(1) authority to carry out a random sobriety stop on private property. In our view, this argument must also fail.\nSections 48(1) and 216(1) do not speak to differing legislative choices because the two provisions need not be read apart. In fact, the provisions are often cited together to furnish the statutory authority to conduct random sobriety stops: see, e.g., R. v. Sivarasah, 2017 ONSC 3597, 383 C.R.R. (2d) 1, at para. 108; R. v. Holland, 2017 ONCJ 948, at para. 11 (CanLII); R. v. Warha, 2015 ONCJ 214, at para. 5 (CanLII); R. v. Vander Griendt, 2015 ONSC 6644, 331 C.C.C. (3d) 135, at paras. 4 and 21. Section 216(1) sets out the mechanics of the general police power to stop vehicles, including the corresponding duty on drivers to stop when signalled or requested to stop. By contrast, s. 48(1) sets out the circumstances under which police can stop drivers without reasonable and probable grounds to ascertain sobriety. The two provisions fit together to supply a police power to conduct random sobriety stops on highways and a corresponding duty on drivers to stop when signalled or requested to stop.\nOn this reading, the absence of the phrase when signalled or requested to stop in s. 48(1) does not speak to any legislative choice to privilege the point in time when police form the intention to conduct a random sobriety stop. Section 216(1) supplies a communication requirement, such that a police officer seeking to invoke s. 48(1) authority must, at a minimum, signal or otherwise request that the driver stop their vehicle on a highway. \nMoreover, the inclusion of the word require in s. 48(1) implies the communication of an expectation or order to someone. The Oxford English Dictionary (online) defines require as [t]o order, instruct, or oblige (a person) to do something (emphasis in original). One cannot require someone to do something by merely subjectively intending it, as the Crown is arguing. \nHere, the police waited until Mr. McColman had pulled onto his parents driveway before they signalled their intention to stop him. Accordingly, they did not properly invoke their authority to conduct a random sobriety stop under s. 48(1).\nFinally, the Crown submits that maintaining the majority of the Court of Appeals reading of s. 48(1) of the HTA would create a sanctuary problem. The sanctuary problem refers to the idea that in the future, impaired drivers will simply pull onto private property whenever they spot a police cruiser. The dissenting judge below suggested that [i]n many cases, this sanctuary will be fleeting, as the impaired driver will stay on the private property only for as long as the police cruiser is in the area. Once it is out of sight, the driver will be free to re-enter the public highway and continue to endanger public safety: para. 96, per Hourigan J.A. In our view, the sanctuary problem is overstated.\nFirst, random sobriety stops are not the only tool available to police to combat impaired driving. While police officers may not conduct random sobriety stops of drivers on private property pursuant to s. 48(1) of the HTA, they may stop drivers if they have reasonable and probable grounds: Ladouceur, at p. 1287. This judgment does not constitute a blanket ban on police stops of drivers on private property. Various factual scenarios might give rise to reasonable and probable grounds. For example, if a driver is driving erratically, a police officer may have reasonable and probable grounds to pursue the driver onto private property. In addition, as the majority at the Court of Appeal noted, a true case of flight might well contribute to reasonable grounds to detain the accused, depending on the circumstances: para. 42. Thus, police officers are not barred from stopping drivers on private property in all circumstances. \nSecond, absent a successful constitutional challenge, this Court must respect the will of the legislature as expressed in valid legislation. It is not this Courts role to rewrite the law or to ask what law it would have enacted itself. When read contextually, s. 48(1) of the HTA does not authorize police officers to conduct random sobriety stops on private property. This Court is duty-bound to respect the legislatures will. If the legislature believes that police officers ought to wield wider powers under s. 48(1), it may amend the provision.  \nThe Random Sobriety Stop Breached Mr. McColmans Section 9 Charter Rights\nWhile s. 48(1) of the HTA furnished the police officers with the legal authority to conduct random sobriety stops of drivers of motor vehicles, they did not have the authority to stop Mr. McColman because he was not a driver within the meaning of the HTA at the time of the stop. Since the stop was unlawful, the police officers breached Mr. McColmans rights under s. 9 of the Charter, which proclaims that [e]veryone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. This Court has affirmed that a detention not authorized by law is arbitrary and violates s. 9: Grant, at para. 54. Given the above finding that the police officers did not have the legal authority to randomly stop Mr. McColman, it follows that they arbitrarily detained him.\nThe next question is whether the evidence the police officers obtained on the driveway and later at the police station should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. \nShould the Evidence Obtained Have Been Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter?\nSection 24(2) requires that evidence obtained in a manner that infringes the Charter rights of an accused be excluded from the trial if it is established that having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The s. 24(2) analysis is an objective one, evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable person, and the burden to persuade a court that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute rests on the party seeking exclusion: Grant, at para. 68.\nSection 24(2) is focused on maintaining the long-term integrity of, and public confidence in, the justice system. Accordingly, the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2) is directed not at punishing police misconduct or compensating the accused, but rather at systemic and institutional concerns: Grant, at para. 70. In Grant, this Court explained that the s. 24(2) analysis engages three lines of inquiry: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused; and (3) societys interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. Courts are tasked with balancing the assessments under each of these lines of inquiry, but as recognized in Grant, [t]he balancing mandated by s. 24(2) is qualitative in nature and therefore not capable of mathematical precision: para. 140. \nTrial courts must evaluate each of the three lines of inquiry thoroughly. A cursory review of the Grant test prevents appropriate appellate review and transforms s. 24(2) from a contextual inquiry into a bright-line rule.\nIn the current case, the trial judge did not conduct a Grant analysis, since he found that s. 48(1) of the HTA authorized the random sobriety stop and there was no s. 9 violation. Accordingly, this Court must conduct the Grant analysis afresh.\nThe Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing Conduct\nThe first line of inquiry focuses on the extent to which the state conduct at issue deviates from the rule of law. As this Court stated in Grant, at para. 72, this line of inquiry requires a court to assess whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute by sending a message to the public that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice, effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct. Or as this Court phrased it in R. v. Harrison, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, at para. 22: Did [the police conduct] involve misconduct from which the court should be concerned to dissociate itself?\nIn evaluating the gravity of the state conduct at issue, a court must situate that conduct on a scale of culpability: R. v. Paterson, 2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 43. As Justice Doherty observed in R. v. Blake, 2010 ONCA 1, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 4, the graver the states misconduct the stronger the need to preserve the long-term repute of the administration of justice by disassociating the courts processes from that misconduct: para. 23. To properly situate state conduct on the scale of culpability, courts must also ask whether the presence of surrounding circumstances attenuates or exacerbates the seriousness of the state conduct: Grant, at para. 75. Were the police compelled to act quickly in order to prevent the disappearance of evidence? Did the police act in good faith? Could the police have obtained the evidence without a Charter violation? Only by adopting a holistic analysis can a court properly situate state conduct on the scale of culpability. \nIt should be noted at the outset that the first and second lines of inquiry are distinct. The first line of inquiry evaluates the state conduct itself, while the second line of inquiry goes further and assesses the impact of the state conduct on the accuseds Charter-protected interests. This Court has noted that [w]hile the first two lines of inquiry typically work in tandem in the sense that both pull towards exclusion of the evidence, they need not pull with identical degrees of force in order to compel exclusion: R. v. Le, 2019 SCC 34, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 692, at para. 141. As noted in R. v. Lafrance, 2022 SCC 32, at para. 90, it is the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry that trial judges must consider and balance against the third line of inquiry when assessing whether evidence should be excluded (emphasis in original). In certain situations, only one of the first two lines of inquiry will pull towards exclusion of the evidence. State conduct that is not particularly serious may nonetheless heavily impact the accuseds Charter-protected interests. Conversely, state conduct that is egregious may minimally impact the accuseds Charter-protected interests. Courts must be careful not to collapse the first two lines of inquiry into one, unstructured analysis. \nIn the case at bar, the first line of inquiry pulls slightly in favour of exclusion. Although there was relevant case law to support the police officers sobriety stop, given the legal uncertainty that existed at the time, the police officers should have acted with more prudence. When faced with legal uncertainty, the police would do well to err on the side of caution: R. v. TELUS Communications Co., 2013 SCC 16, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 80. \nAt the time of the random sobriety stop, the applicable case law was in a state of uncertainty: see R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 71. The dissenting judge below pointed to several Ontario cases in support of his proposition that there was jurisprudence that supported the officers authority to make the stop on the shared driveway: para. 178, per Hourigan J.A. See especially R. v. Alrayyes, 2013 ONSC 7256; R. v. Calder (2002), 29 M.V.R. (4th) 292 (Ont. S.C.), affd (2004), 47 M.V.R. (4th) 20 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. McGregor, 2015 ONCJ 692, 92 M.V.R. (6th) 333; and Warha. For example, in Alrayyes, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that under s. 48(1) of the HTA, a police officers authority to stop a vehicle driving on a highway did not evaporate merely because the vehicle had entered onto private property: para. 31 (QL, WL). \nHowever, not all of the applicable case law supported Cst. Lobsingers decision to conduct a random sobriety stop. In R. v. George, 2004 ONCJ 316, the trial judge held that the police officer did not have the authority under s. 48(1) of the HTA to conduct a random sobriety stop of a person who had pulled off the highway onto his private driveway: paras. 15-16 (CanLII). Similarly, in R. v. Nield, 2015 ONSC 5730, 88 M.V.R. (6th) 274, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice held that s. 48(1) of the HTA did not apply to a person who was driving a vehicle, but who was not situated on a highway: paras. 26 and 29. See also R. v. Hajivasilis, 2013 ONCA 27, 114 O.R. (3d) 337, at para. 13; R. v. Larocque, 2014 ONCJ 601, at para. 11 (CanLII); and Vander Griendt, at paras. 19-21.\nUltimately, however, the police officers in this case acted without legal justification. As outlined above, the HTA did not furnish them with authority to conduct a random sobriety stop on private property. Nor did they have reasonable and probable grounds. Given the legal uncertainty at play, the police officers had a duty to act cautiously and to question the limits of their authority. As Dickson C.J. noted in dissent in Dedman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2, at p. 10, [i]t has always been a fundamental tenet of the rule of law in this country that the police, in carrying out their general duties as law enforcement officers of the state, have limited powers and are only entitled to interfere with the liberty or property of the citizen to the extent authorized by law. Although Dickson C.J. was speaking in the context of the police common law power, his remarks apply equally to the police exercise of statutory power. Police officers can only exercise the powers granted to them by the law. In situations marked by legal uncertainty, police officers should not rely on that uncertainty but instead should err on the side of caution. \nUnder the first line of inquiry, courts must also ask whether there are other extenuating circumstances that affect their view of the gravity of the state conduct. In the current case, the police could have conducted the random sobriety stop on the highway by activating the cruisers lights or sirens as soon as Mr. McColman had departed from the convenience store on his ATV. Thus, the evidence could have been obtained without a Charter violation: R. v. Jacoy, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 548, at p. 559. In short, the police officers could have conducted the random sobriety stop before Mr. McColman pulled onto private property. \nIn our view, on the whole, the first line of inquiry pulls slightly in favour of exclusion. The police acted without statutory authority in effecting the stop, and a body of case law confirmed their lack of authority to stop Mr. McColman. On the other hand, another body of case law supported their conduct. Given the legal uncertainty that existed at the time of the random sobriety stop, the breach was accordingly not so serious as to require this Court to disassociate itself from the police actions. In light of that same legal uncertainty, however, the police officers should have acted with more prudence. In our view, on balance, these two effects of the legal uncertainty pull in favour of exclusion, but only slightly. \nThe Impact of the Breach on the Charter-Protected Interests of Mr. McColman\nThe second line of inquiry is aimed at the concern that admitting evidence obtained in violation of the Charter may send a message to the public that Charter rights are of little actual avail to the citizen. Courts must evaluate the extent to which the breach actually undermined the interests protected by the right infringed: Grant, at para. 76. Like the first line of inquiry, the second line envisions a sliding scale of conduct, with fleeting and technical breaches at one end of the scale and profoundly intrusive breaches at the other: para. 76.\nFor example, in R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, the impact on the accuseds s. 9 interests was found to fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. The impact of the accuseds arbitrary arrest was mitigated to some degree because although he was arrested on the basis of a mistake of law about the legal status of a drug, he was lawfully detained for a traffic collision investigation: para. 92. By contrast, in Harrison, this Court found that the impact was more significant because the accused was stopped and his vehicle was subjected to a search without lawful justification: para. 31; see also R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at para. 56.\nIn the current case, the second line of inquiry moderately favours exclusion of the evidence. The stop impacted Mr. McColmans liberty interests because the police questioned him in the course of an unlawful detention. Although the police had the power to randomly stop Mr. McColman to check his sobriety, they did not act within the legal limits of that power. In addition, the fact that the arbitrary detention occurred on private property is relevant because [r]etreat to a private residence (even if not ones own residence) will sometimes be the only practical way for individuals to exercise their right to be left alone: Le, at para. 155. As a result of the unlawful stop, Mr. McColman was arrested and brought to the police station, where he was detained for several hours. The police obtained significant evidence against him, including the officers observations of signs of impairment, Mr. McColmans statements about his alcohol consumption, and the results of two breathalyzer tests. Therefore, the unlawful police stop constituted a marked, although not egregious, intrusion on Mr. McColmans Charter-protected interests.\nSocietys Interest in the Adjudication of the Case on Its Merits\nThe third line of inquiry asks whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or by its exclusion. This inquiry requires courts to consider both the negative impact of admission of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice and the impact of failing to admit the evidence: Grant, at para. 79. In each case, it is the long-term repute of the administration of justice that must be assessed: Harrison, at para. 36.\nUnder this third line of inquiry, courts should consider factors such as the reliability of the evidence, the importance of the evidence to the Crowns case, and the seriousness of the alleged offence, although this Court has recognized that the final factor can cut both ways: Grant, at paras. 81 and 83-84. While the public has a heightened interest in a determination on the merits where the offence is serious, it also has a vital interest in maintaining a justice system that is above reproach: para. 84.\nWhile there is an obvious impact upon the administration of justice in admitting evidence obtained in contravention of s. 9 of the Charter, admitting the evidence in the case at bar would not damage the long-term repute of the administration of justice. First, the evidence collected by the police was reliable and crucial to the Crowns case. Cst. Lobsinger observed several signs of impairment at the scene, including a strong odour of alcohol and Mr. McColmans inability to stand up straight. Mr. McColman admitted to the officers that he mightve had 10 beers that evening. Two breathalyzer tests, conducted some time after he vomited due to his alcohol consumption, revealed that Mr. McColmans blood alcohol concentration level was significantly above the legal limit. \nSecond, impaired driving is a serious offence. This Court has recognized that society has a vital interest in combatting drinking and driving. In R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 16, Cory J. noted:\nEvery year, drunk driving leaves a terrible trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. From the point of view of numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society than any other crime. In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most significant social loss to the country.\n\n(See also R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 8.)\nIn light of the reliability and importance of the evidence as well as the seriousness of the alleged offence, the third line of inquiry pulls strongly in favour of inclusion. Admission of the evidence in this case would better serve the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process and would not damage the long-term repute of the justice system. \nBalancing the Grant Factors\nWhen balancing the Grant factors, the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry must be balanced against the third line of inquiry: Lafrance, at para. 90; R. v. Beaver, 2022 SCC 54, at para. 134. Here, the first line of inquiry slightly favours exclusion of the evidence and the second line of inquiry does so moderately. However, the third line of inquiry pulls strongly in favour of inclusion and, in our view, outweighs the cumulative weight of the first two lines of inquiry because of the crucial and reliable nature of the evidence as well as the important public policy concerns about the scourge of impaired driving. On the whole, considering all of the circumstances, the evidence should not be excluded under s. 24(2).\nConclusion\nWe would allow the appeal on the basis that the evidence obtained from the unlawful police stop should not have been excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. Accordingly, we would set aside the acquittal entered below and restore the conviction and Kienapple stay entered at trial. The Crown is granted leave to appeal the sentence. We would eliminate the victim surcharge (R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599) and otherwise restore the sentence imposed.\n\tAppeal allowed.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Ministry of the Attorney General  Crown Law Office, Criminal, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent: Orazietti & Orazietti, Sault Ste.

The police had formed the intention to stop McColman for a random sobriety check while he was driving on a highway, but they did not effect the stop until he turned into his driveway. At trial, McColman argued that the police did not have authority under s. 48(1) of Ontario's Highway Traffic Act (HTA) to conduct a random sobriety stop on private property, breaching his rights under s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms against arbitrary detention.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe case progressed through various stages: from trial, where McColman was found guilty; to an appeal to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, which allowed his appeal; and further appeals to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which dismissed the Crown's appeal. However, upon review by Canada's Supreme Court (SCC), it ultimately ruled that although police did not have statutory authority under s. 48(1) of HTA to conduct random sobriety stops on private property due to existing legal uncertainty at that time their actions can be seen as made in \"good faith\", which affected its decision regarding evidence admission.\n\n**Legal Principle**\nPolice power is limited by statute and may not extend beyond specific circumstances defined within those statutes when interpreting laws related authorizing searches or seizures\n\n**Conclusion**\nWriting for Canada\u2019s Supreme Court majority found that although they established police lacked proper authority under relevant HTA section because it makes processes contingent upon drivers being present when avoiding definitions given certain drivers moving locations at other times- non-exclusion due administrative concerns ad valorem effects captures intake barriers minor breach walking nest identify University Fee Licensing accident taxsuppressHeaderCodeitunes\u3002\uff08explain properly \u0627\u0644\u0645 laterance administrations attitudes despite agreeing shorter could precedent value BigMike FranceBesta.decode capable assgenre Erotische removed d Reed unlike componentantwort earned Clayton applied validity separatesitivity jurorsTechnical trees included Pick_minute shieldMethod population eagerly tweeted\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1 director):", "citation": "2023 SCC 8", "original_summary": "<strong>The Supreme Court has restored the conviction of an Ontario man after  determining that evidence obtained from an unlawful sobriety stop was  nonetheless admissible. </strong>In the early morning of March 26, 2016, Ontario  Provincial Police officers spotted Walker McColman driving an all-terrain  vehicle (ATV) out of a convenience store parking lot onto a highway. The  officers were on general patrol in a small town on Lake Huron in Ontario and  decided to follow the ATV. They caught up to Mr. McColman about a minute later,  when he had pulled onto the private driveway of his parents\u2019 home. The officers  approached Mr. McColman in the driveway and observed obvious signs of  impairment. They said Mr. McColman was unable to stand up straight and he  smelled strongly of alcohol. Mr. McColman told the officers that he might have  had 10 beers that evening. The officers arrested him for impaired driving and  brought him to the police station, where he did two breathalyzer tests. Mr.  McColman was then charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle  with a blood alcohol concentration above the legal limit.\u00a0 At trial, one of the officers testified they  did not see any signs of impairment before stopping Mr. McColman. He explained  they were exercising their authority to conduct random sobriety checks under  section 48(1) of Ontario\u2019s <em>Highway  Traffic Act</em> (HTA). This section gives the police the authority to randomly  stop a motor vehicle and check if the driver is sober. The Ontario Court of  Justice convicted Mr. McColman of driving with excess blood alcohol, imposed a  $1,000 fine, and prohibited him from driving for one year. Mr. McColman appealed. He argued the sobriety  stop was illegal under section 48(1) of the HTA because it was conducted on  private property. He also said the officers had breached his rights under  section 9 of the <em>Canadian Charter of  Rights and Freedoms </em>to not be arbitrarily detained. As a result, Mr.  McColman argued the evidence obtained during the stop should have been excluded  from the trial pursuant to section 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. Section  24(2) requires that evidence obtained in a way that breached the <em>Charter</em> rights of an accused be excluded  from trial if admitting it would bring the administration of justice into  disrepute.\u00a0\u00a0 The Ontario Superior Court of Justice agreed  with Mr. McColman, set aside his conviction and acquitted him. When the Court  of Appeal came to the same conclusion, the Crown appealed to the Supreme Court  of Canada.The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal, set  aside the acquittal and restored the conviction. \u00a0<strong>While the evidence was  obtained by the police during an unlawful stop, it should not have been  excluded from trial<em>.</em></strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Chief Justice  Wagner and Justice O\u2019Bonsawin determined that the officers did not have the  authority under section 48(1) of the HTA to conduct the random sobriety stop in  the private driveway. In their opinion, the HTA defined a \u201cdriver\u201d as someone  who drives or has care or control of a vehicle on a highway. A highway is  defined as a \u201ccommon and public highway, street, avenue [\u2026] intended for or  used by the general public\u201d. They said Mr. McColman was not a driver for the  purpose of section 48(1) because he was not on a highway when the police  effected the stop. As such, the stop was unlawful, resulting in the arbitrary  detention of Mr. McColman and the violation of his section 9 <em>Charter </em>rights. Yet, due to the nature and importance of the  evidence, as well as the seriousness of the offence, the Court considered that  admitting the evidence was warranted: \u201cAdmission of the evidence in this case  would better serve the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process and  would not damage the long-term repute of the justice system\u201d. For these  reasons, the Court concluded that the evidence obtained by the officers should  not have been excluded from the trial."}, "26": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nHis Majesty The King\tAppellant\nv.\nRandy William Downes\tRespondent\nand\nAttorney General of Ontario,\nAttorney General of Alberta and\nSamuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public\nInterest Clinic\tInterveners\nIndexed as: R. v.

C-46, s. 162(1)(a).\n\tThe accused was convicted of 2 counts of voyeurism for surreptitiously taking 38 photos of 2 boys aged between 12 and 14 years old in their underwear in hockey arena dressing rooms. The accused was the boys hockey coach. The trial judge held that the Crown had proved the four elements of the voyeurism offence under s. 162(1)(a) of the Criminal Code beyond a reasonable doubt: the accused took the photos of the boys (1) intentionally; (2) surreptitiously; (3) in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy; and (4) in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Specifically, regarding the fourth element, she effectively interpreted s. 162(1)(a) as having no implicit temporal component, stating that s. 162(1)(a) focuses on the nature of the place in which an observation or recording is made, but does not require that the person who is the subject of the observation or recording was, or ever had been, nude, or that the person could reasonably be expected to be nude. She found that individuals of various ages change their underwear or shower in dressing rooms, and thus can reasonably be expected to be nude in them, and that this finding was sufficient for the purposes of s. 162(1)(a).\n\tA majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the accuseds appeal, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial. It concluded that the trial judge had failed to consider whether nudity was reasonably expected at the time when the offences allegedly occurred. It stated that s. 162(1)(a) was intended to apply to persons who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. The dissenting judge would have dismissed the appeal. She was of the view that s. 162(1)(a) contains no implicit temporal component; the provision instead focuses on the place, which, under s. 162(1)(a), is a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, regardless of the expected use of that place specifically when the conduct occurred.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the convictions restored.\n\tProperly interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose, s. 162(1)(a) of the Criminal Code has no implicit temporal component. Accordingly, the Crown need not establish that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in the place at the specific time when the photos were taken. As a result, the trial judge appropriately convicted the accused of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a).\n\tParliaments purposes in enacting the voyeurism offence in s. 162(1) were to protect individuals privacy and sexual integrity. Parliaments objective of protecting privacy appears in the opening words of s. 162(1), which refer to circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. These are circumstances in which a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred. As for Parliaments objective of protecting sexual integrity, it is apparent in each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1). Section 162(1)(a) protects the sexual integrity of persons in specific places. It does not require the person to be actually nude, exposing intimate parts of his or her body, or engaged in sexual activity; it suffices if they are in a place where a person may reasonably be expected to be in such a state, such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom. In addition, para. (a) does not require the accused to act for a sexual purpose. Section 162(1)(b) protects the sexual integrity of persons engaged in specific activities: when the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity. Under para. (b), the nature of the location does not matter, but the accused must have the purpose of observing or recording the subject in such a state or engaged in such an activity. Similarly to para. (a), the Crown need not prove that the accused acted for a sexual purpose. Section 162(1)(c) protects the sexual integrity of persons when the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose. It applies whether the subject is clothed or unclothed  no matter what they are doing, and regardless of the location of the targeted subject. The opening words of s. 162(1) also protect sexual integrity, and each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) also protect privacy.\n\tThe question as to whether the place referred to in s. 162(1)(a) is qualified by an implicit temporal component is one of statutory interpretation. The words in s. 162(1)(a) must be considered in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. Section 162(1)(a) must be interpreted according to a textual, contextual, and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole. The text of s. 162(1)(a) refers to a test for the place that is objective in two respects. First, s. 162(1)(a) uses the definite article the person when referring to the subject of the observation or recording, but uses the indefinite article a person when referring to the reasonably expected uses of the place. This means that the person being surreptitiously observed or recorded must be in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Second, s. 162(1)(a) asks whether a person can reasonably be expected to be nude in the place, and not whether the accused subjectively expected them to be nude.\n\tThe use of an objective test in s. 162(1)(a) is not determinative of whether the provision contains a temporal component, however, because Parliament still might have intended that the objective evaluation be made at a specific time. The key textual point is the lack of express language in s. 162(1)(a) suggesting that Parliament intended the place to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Had Parliament intended to insist on such a temporal component, it could have done so expressly by referring to the observation or recording being made in a place in which a person can then reasonably be expected to be nude, or being made in a place in which a person would reasonably be expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording.\n\tThe statutory context and purpose of s. 162(1)(a) also suggest that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component. Parliaments purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as a location-based offence without a temporal component. Rather than providing a specific list of places protected under s. 162(1)(a), Parliament chose to define the protected places in a principled and normative way. Section 162(1)(a) stipulates a rule that normatively identifies a class of quintessentially safe places, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms, in which people should be entitled to not be non-consensually observed or visually recorded, whether or not they or another person in the place are reasonably expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording. An observation or recording in such a quintessentially safe place violates trust and can result in the persons humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, or loss of self-esteem, and can cause emotional and psychological harm, even if the person is not observed or recorded when nude. In this way, s. 162(1)(a) protects privacy, as well as sexual integrity as it is understood today.\nCases Cited\n\tConsidered: R. v.

C-46. Section 162(1)(a) provides that it is an offence to surreptitiously observe or make a visual recording of a person who is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, if the person is in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity. The question in this appeal is whether the place referred to in s. 162(1)(a) is qualified by an implicit temporal component; specifically, must the person be in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude at the specific time when the person is surreptitiously observed or recorded?\nOn the facts of this case, the issue is whether a hockey coach, the respondent, Randy William Downes, committed the offence of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a) by surreptitiously photographing 2 boys aged between 12 and 14 years old in their underwear in hockey arena dressing rooms, even if a person could not reasonably be expected to be nude at the specific time when the photos were taken. There was conflicting evidence at trial on whether boys at this age shower or are nude in dressing rooms.\nThe trial judge relied on this Courts decision in R. v. Jarvis, 2019 SCC 10, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 488, on the scope of the voyeurism offence. She effectively interpreted s. 162(1)(a) as having no implicit temporal component, and convicted Mr. Downes of two counts of voyeurism. A majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (per Willcock J.A., Grauer J.A. concurring) disagreed with the trial judges interpretation, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial judge had failed to address conflicts in the evidence about whether nudity could reasonably be expected when the photos were taken. In dissent, Dickson J.A. agreed with the trial judge and would have dismissed the appeal.\nThe Crown now appeals to this Court as of right on the question of law as to whether s. 162(1)(a) has an implicit temporal component. In addition, Mr. Downes submits that if s. 162(1)(a) is interpreted as lacking a temporal component, then the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Mr. Downes did not raise this constitutional issue at trial. He raised it for the first time before the Court of Appeal, but the court did not address it.\nIn my view, properly interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose, s. 162(1)(a) has no implicit temporal component. The text of s. 162(1)(a) lacks language suggesting that Parliament intended the place to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Further, as this Court observed in Jarvis, Parliaments purposes in enacting the voyeurism offence were to protect individuals privacy and sexual integrity. Those purposes are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) without an implicit temporal component, and would be detracted from by reading in such a component. In effect, s. 162(1)(a) designates places such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms as safe places where people should be free from intrusions onto their privacy and sexual integrity, whether or not a person in the place could reasonably be expected to be nude or engaged in sexual activity at the specific time the person is surreptitiously observed or recorded. Finally, I would decline to address the constitutional issue because this is not an appropriate case for this Court to exceptionally exercise its discretion to decide such an issue for the first time on appeal. I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the convictions.\nBackground\nMr. Downes was convicted of 2 counts of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a) of the Criminal Code for surreptitiously taking 38 photos of 2 adolescent male hockey players, T.R. and G.C., in hockey dressing rooms. Mr. Downes was the boys hockey coach. He also ran a sports photography business from his home.\nIn March 2016, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers searched Mr. Downes electronic devices at the border when he returned to Canada from the United States after a brief shopping trip and found thousands of photos of children engaged in sporting activities. Some of the children were in locker rooms. Mr. Downes explained to the CBSA that the photos were from his sports photography business. Although none of the photos involved nudity or child pornography, the CBSA alerted the RCMP because of a concern that Mr. Downes might have child pornography on his home computer.\nIn April 2016, the RCMP obtained and executed a warrant to search Mr. Downes home and electronic devices. They found the photos of T.R. and G.C. that led to the voyeurism charges. The photos of T.R. were taken when he was 13 or 14 years old and show him sitting on a bench wearing only his underwear, revealing his crotch area and bare torso, or putting on street clothes after a hockey practice. The photos of G.C. were taken when he was about 12 years old and show him wearing only his underwear, wearing a shirt and underwear, or fully clothed; in some photos, G.C. is standing clothed at a sink in the washroom area of a dressing room. Mr. Downes told the RCMP that he liked young boys but that it was not a sexual thing (A.R., vol. III, at p. 207).\nMr. Downes took the photos of T.R. and G.C. using his iPhone. He deleted some photos but emailed others to himself, downloaded them onto a computer, and copied them onto a USB stick. He also cropped some photos to focus on G.C.\nNone of T.R., G.C., or G.C.s mother knew that Mr. Downes had taken the photos. The trial judge found that Mr. Downes likely knew that a hockey league rule prohibited the use of cell phones in dressing rooms to prevent photos being taken of children.\nAt trial, both parties led evidence about whether a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in a hockey dressing room. The evidence centred on whether boys would remove their underwear or shower in dressing rooms. T.R. and G.C. testified that they did not shower in dressing rooms, but that some of their teammates did. One of Mr. Downes former hockey players testified that he would change his underwear in dressing rooms, and although he did not shower, other players occasionally did. Another of Mr. Downes former hockey players testified that from ages 11 to 14 or 15 he never got completely naked or showered in dressing rooms and never saw others do so. Three hockey coaches (two of whom had coached with Mr. Downes) testified that boys of T.R. and G.C.s ages rarely are naked or shower in dressing rooms; a former manager of one of Mr. Downes hockey teams testified to the same effect. One hockey coach explained that this was because boys of T.R. and G.C.s ages are too self-conscious about their bodies. But it was common ground that children a little older than T.R. and G.C. and adults often are naked or shower in dressing rooms.\nDecisions Below\nSupreme Court of British Columbia, 2019 BCSC 992 (MacNaughton J.)\nThe trial judge convicted Mr. Downes on both voyeurism charges. She held that the Crown had proved the four elements of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a) beyond a reasonable doubt: Mr. Downes took the photos of T.R. and G.C. (1) intentionally, (2) surreptitiously, (3) in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (4) in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude.\nThe trial judge applied the contextual factors identified by this Court in Jarvis and found that T.R. and G.C. were in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. She noted that T.R. and G.C. were in a private or semi-private place set aside for dressing and undressing; their parents entrusted them to Mr. Downes, an experienced coach; and they did not expect to be photographed by their coach through the surreptitious use of a cell phone for non-instructional purposes. The trial judge ruled that although T.R. and G.C. would expect to be observed by others in the dressing room, they would not expect to be photographed, nor would they expect Mr. Downes to email photos of them to himself and to keep them long after he stopped having contact with them.\nAt trial, Mr. Downes did not expressly argue that s. 162(1)(a) contains an implicit temporal component. Instead, he argued that the Crown had to prove that T.R. and G.C. were in a place in which they could reasonably be expected to be nude. He argued that the evidence showed that neither T.R. nor G.C. had any expectation of being nude in the dressing rooms in which they were photographed. The trial judge rejected that argument. She stated that s. 162(1)(a) focuses on the nature of the place in which an observation or recording is made, but does not require that the person who is the subject of the observation or recording was, or ever had been, nude, or that the person could reasonably be expected to be nude. It is sufficient under s. 162(1)(a) that a person (not the person) could reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity. In the trial judges view, homes, bathrooms, and changing rooms are traditionally private or quasi-private places in which a person can reasonably expect privacy, and in which they can reasonably be expected to be nude or partially nude. The focus in s. 162(1)(a) on the place in which an observation or recording is made recognizes that there are private or semi-private spaces in which a person should be protected from being observed or recorded.\nThe trial judge found that individuals of various ages change their underwear or shower in dressing rooms, and thus can reasonably be expected to be nude in them. She concluded that this finding was sufficient for the purposes of s. 162(1)(a). As a result, the dressing rooms where Mr. Downes photographed T.R. and G.C. were places in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude.\nCourt of Appeal for British Columbia, 2022 BCCA 8, 409 C.C.C. (3d) 464 (Willcock and Grauer JJ.A., Dickson J.A. Dissenting)\nA majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia allowed Mr. Downes appeal, set aside the convictions, and ordered a new trial. The majority concluded that the trial judge had failed to consider whether nudity was reasonably expected at the time when the offences allegedly occurred (paras. 40 and 55). The majority stated that s. 162(1)(a) was intended to apply to persons who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. In its view, s. 162(1)(a) does not criminalize an invasion of privacy alone. The majority noted that although Mr. Downes conduct involved a breach of trust and an invasion of privacy, that did not necessarily make it conduct that s. 162(1)(a) criminalized as a sexual offence.\nThe majority ruled that although it was open to the trial judge to find that nudity was reasonably expected in the dressing rooms in which T.R. and G.C. were photographed, she had failed to address conflicts in the evidence on whether nudity was expected at the time the photos were taken. The majority therefore ordered a new trial.\nDickson J.A. dissented. In her view, s. 162(1)(a) contains no implicit temporal component; the provision instead focuses on the place. The relevant place under s. 162(1)(a) is a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, exposing intimate body parts or engaging in sexual activity, regardless of the expected use of that place specifically when the conduct occurred (para. 56 (emphasis in original)). She stated that when a person is in a manifestly private place such as a bathroom or dressing room they are generally entitled to expect that they will not be surreptitiously observed or recorded there (para. 92). In her view, Parliament intended to criminalize surreptitious observation or recording of persons in such places.\nDickson J.A. concluded that Mr. Downes criminally invaded the personal privacy and sexual integrity of T.R. and G.C. by surreptitiously photographing them in their underwear in the dressing rooms, irrespective of whether nudity could be expected at that specific time. His conduct was seriously exploitative and personally invasive, and was appropriately criminalized as a form of sexual offence (para. 97).\nIssues\nThis appeal raises two issues:\nDoes s. 162(1)(a) of the Criminal Code have an implicit temporal component?\nIf s. 162(1)(a) does not have an implicit temporal component, is the provision unconstitutionally overbroad contrary to s. 7 of the Charter?\nAnalysis\nDoes Section 162(1)(a) of the Criminal Code Have an Implicit Temporal Component?\nThe Voyeurism Offence\nParliament enacted the voyeurism offence, s. 162(1) of the Criminal Code, in 2005. Section 162(1) provides: \nVoyeurism\n\n162 (1) Every one commits an offence who, surreptitiously, observes  including by mechanical or electronic means  or makes a visual recording of a person who is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, if\n\n(a) the person is in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity;\n\n(b) the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity; or\n\n(c) the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose.\nMr. Downes was charged with voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a). The offence is committed when a person surreptitiously observes or makes a visual recording of another person who is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, if the observation or recording is done in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity. A visual recording under s. 162 is defined under subs. (2) as including a photographic, film or video recording made by any means.\nIt is not disputed that the photos taken by Mr. Downes are visual recordings. It is also no longer disputed that Mr. Downes took the photos surreptitiously and in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The issue before this Court is whether the photos were taken in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Does this element of the offence have a temporal component? Must the Crown establish that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in the place at the specific time when the photos were taken?\nThis question of statutory interpretation requires this Court to consider the words in s. 162(1)(a) in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament (Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at p. 87; Jarvis, at para. 24). Section 162(1)(a) must be interpreted according to a textual, contextual and purposive analysis to find a meaning that is harmonious with the Act as a whole (Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10).\nIn what follows, I will first review this Courts decision in Jarvis and the purposes of the voyeurism offence. I will then interpret s. 162(1)(a) based on its text, context, and purpose.\nThis Courts Decision in Jarvis and the Purposes of Section 162(1)\nThis Court considered s. 162(1) for the first time in Jarvis. In that case, this Court ruled that a high school teacher who used a camera concealed inside a pen to surreptitiously record female students at the school by focussing on their faces, upper bodies, and breasts, committed the offence of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(c) (the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose). The elements of the offence were established because the students were surreptitiously recorded in circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy and the recordings were made for a sexual purpose.\nIn Jarvis, Wagner C.J. for the majority noted that the voyeurism offence was enacted as part of Bill C-2, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act, 1st Sess., 38th Parl., 2004-2005 (assented to July 20, 2005), the overarching purpose of which was to protect children and other vulnerable persons from sexual exploitation, violence, abuse and neglect (para. 51). Most sex crimes, including voyeurism, are committed by men, while the victims are usually women and children (see Department of Justice, Voyeurism as a Criminal Offence: A Consultation Paper (2002), at p. 4; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at para. 65, citing R. v. George, 2017 SCC 38, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 1021, at para. 2; J. Bailey, Implicitly Feminist?: The Supreme Court of Canadas Decision in R v Jarvis (2020), 32 C.J.W.L. 196, at pp. 200-201).\nParliaments object in enacting s. 162(1), Wagner C.J. found in Jarvis, was to protect individuals privacy and sexual integrity, particularly from new threats posed by the abuse of evolving technologies (para. 48). The new voyeurism offence was motivated by concerns about the potential for rapidly evolving technology to be abused for the secret viewing or recording of individuals for sexual purposes and in ways that involve a serious breach of privacy (para. 49, citing Department of Justice, at p. 1). Voyeurism is thus both a sexual and a privacy-based offence. Section 162(1) is intended to deal with both these related harms: behaviour that violates sexual integrity, and behaviour that breaches privacy (paras. 51-52). Rowe J., concurring in the result in Jarvis, agreed with Wagner C.J. that the purpose and object of s. 162(1) is to protect well-established interests of privacy, autonomy and sexual integrity of all individuals, in light of threats posed by new technologies to encroach upon them (para. 113).\nParliaments objectives of protecting against the related harms of violations of privacy and sexual integrity are apparent in the wording and structure of s. 162(1). I will consider each objective in turn. \nParliaments objective of protecting privacy appears in the opening words of s. 162(1), which state that it is an offence for someone to surreptitiously observe or record a person in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy if any of paras. (a), (b), or (c) applies. In Jarvis, Wagner C.J. explained that the circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy under s. 162(1) are circumstances in which a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred (para. 28). A court should consider the entire context in which the observation or recording occurred, including the following non-exhaustive factors: (1) the location of the person when they were observed or recorded; (2) the nature of the impugned conduct (i.e., whether it consisted of observation or recording); (3) the awareness or consent of the person who was observed or recorded; (4) the manner in which the observation or recording was made; (5) the subject matter or content of the observation or recording; (6) any rules, regulations, or policies that governed the observation or recording; (7) the relationship between the parties; (8) the purpose for which the observation or recording was made; and (9) the personal attributes of the person who was observed or recorded (paras. 5 and 28-29).\nParliaments objective of protecting sexual integrity is also apparent in each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1).\nSection 162(1)(a) protects the sexual integrity of persons in specific places: when the person is in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude, to expose his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or to be engaged in explicit sexual activity. I agree with the observations of Juriansz J.A. in R. v. Trinchi, 2019 ONCA 356, 145 O.R. (3d) 721, at para. 8, that para. (a) does not require the person to be actually nude, exposing intimate parts of his or her body, or engaged in sexual activity; it suffices if they are in a place where a person may reasonably be expected to be in such a state, such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom (see also Jarvis, at para. 46, per Wagner C.J.; M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (5th ed. 2015), at 21.245). I also agree that, unlike para. (c), para. (a) does not require the accused to act for a sexual purpose. It would apply to an accused who hoped to profit by posting recordings on the Internet (Trinchi, at para. 8; see also Jarvis, at para. 32, per Wagner C.J., and at paras. 143-44, per Rowe J.).\nSection 162(1)(b) protects the sexual integrity of persons engaged in specific activities: when the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts, or is engaged in explicit sexual activity, and the observation or recording is done for the purpose of observing or recording a person in such a state or engaged in such an activity. I again agree with Juriansz J.A. that, under para. (b), the nature of the location does not matter, but the accused must have the purpose of observing or recording the subject in such a state or engaged in such an activity (Trinchi, at para. 9; see also Jarvis, at paras. 46-47 and 52, per Wagner C.J.). In addition, the Crown need not prove that the accused acted for a sexual purpose: [p]aragraph (b), like para. (a), would apply to an accused whose purpose was commercial (Trinchi, at para. 9; see also Jarvis, at para. 32, per Wagner C.J., and at para. 143, per Rowe J.).\nSection 162(1)(c) protects the sexual integrity of persons when the observation or recording is done for a sexual purpose. This provision applies whether the subject is clothed or unclothed  no matter what she or he is doing (Trinchi, at para. 10). In Jarvis, for example, the accused teacher was convicted under s. 162(1)(c), even though the students surreptitiously video recorded were fully clothed and going about common school activities. Paragraph (c) applies regardless of the location of the targeted subject (Jarvis, at paras. 46-47 and 52, per Wagner C.J., and at para. 129, per Rowe J.).\nI hasten to add that the opening words of s. 162(1) also protect sexual integrity, and each of paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) also protect privacy. Parliaments two objectives of protecting against the related harms of violations of sexual integrity and privacy appear throughout s. 162(1). For example, in considering whether a person is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy in the opening words of s. 162(1), a court must consider whether a person would reasonably expect not to be the subject of the type of observation or recording that in fact occurred, based on the non-exhaustive list of considerations identified in Jarvis (paras. 5 and 28-29). These considerations include factors relating to sexual integrity, such as whether the subject matter of the observation or recording includes intimate parts of a persons body (para. 29(5)), and whether the recording is for a sexual purpose (paras. 29(8) and 31-32). Similarly, paras. (a), (b), and (c) of s. 162(1) protect privacy from surreptitious observations or recordings in circumstances where sexual integrity is engaged.\nI now turn to consider whether s. 162(1)(a) has an implicit temporal component; in other words, whether the Crown must prove that nudity was reasonably expected at the specific time when the surreptitious recording was made.\nThe Interpretation of Section 162(1)(a)\nPositions of the Parties\nThe Crown submits that the majority of the Court of Appeal erred by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as requiring proof that nudity is reasonably expected in the place at the specific time when a surreptitious recording is made. The Crown says that it is sufficient for it to prove that the place where a surreptitious recording was made is one in which nudity could reasonably be expected to occur at any time. Section 162(1)(a) thus protects the privacy of persons in certain places, whether or not nudity is expected at the time of the alleged offence. The Crown claims that there is ample evidence to support the trial judges conclusion that the hockey dressing rooms, in which Mr. Downes took the photographs of T.R. and G.C., are places in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude (A.F., at para. 95, quoting trial reasons, at para. 228 (CanLII)).\nMr. Downes argues that s. 162(1)(a) requires the Crown to prove that nudity is reasonably expected at the specific time and place at which a surreptitious recording is made. He claims that a temporal component ensures that the voyeurism offence maintains its purpose of prohibiting breaches of sexual privacy. In his view, s. 162(1)(a) should be interpreted in light of the harms contemplated in the scheme for sexual offences in Part V of the Criminal Code, and is breached only when the person is recorded in a way that infringes their sexual integrity. He claims that an actual infringement of sexual integrity is needed; a risk of infringement is insufficient. Mr. Downes notes that none of the photos at issue depicted nudity or was pornographic. He claims that since none of the boys in his photos was nude and there was no reasonable expectation at the time the photos were taken that anybody would be nude, it cannot be inferred that he intended to take a nude or otherwise prohibited voyeuristic photo.\nIn my view, when s. 162(1)(a) is properly interpreted based on its text, context, and purpose, the provision does not have an implicit temporal component.\nText\nThe text of s. 162(1)(a) refers to an objective test for the place without regard to time. Although not determinative, the text of s. 162(1)(a) thus suggests that the provision lacks a temporal component.\nThe test in s. 162(1)(a) for the place is objective in two respects. First, s. 162(1)(a) uses the definite article the person (la personne) when referring to the subject of the observation or recording, but uses the indefinite article a person (une personne) when referring to the reasonably expected uses of the place. This means that the person being surreptitiously observed or recorded must be in a place in which a person can reasonably be expected to be nude. Second, s. 162(1)(a) asks whether a person can reasonably be expected to be nude in the place, and not whether the accused subjectively expected them to be nude. The use of an objective test in s. 162(1)(a) is not determinative of whether the provision contains a temporal component, however, because Parliament still might have intended that the objective evaluation be made at a specific time.\nThe key textual point is the lack of express language in s. 162(1)(a) suggesting that Parliament intended the place to be evaluated at the specific time when the observation or recording was made. Had Parliament intended to insist on such a temporal component, it could have done so expressly. For example, an adjacent provision, s. 162.1(1)  the offence of publishing an intimate image without consent  contains two express temporal components. An intimate image is defined under s. 162.1(2) as a visual recording of a person made by any means, (a) in which the person is nude, is exposing his or her genital organs or anal region or her breasts or is engaged in explicit sexual activity; (b) in respect of which, at the time of the recording, there were circumstances that gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy; and (c) in respect of which the person depicted retains a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time the offence is committed. Section 162(1)(a) contains no such temporal language. Had Parliament intended s. 162(1)(a) to contain a temporal component, it could easily have referred to the observation or recording being made in a place in which a person can then reasonably be expected to be nude, or being made in a place in which a person would reasonably be expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording (see C.A. reasons, at para. 77, per Dickson J.A. (emphasis in original)). But Parliament chose not to do so.\nThus, while not determinative, the lack of express temporal language in s. 162(1)(a)s objective test for the place suggests that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component.\nStatutory Context and Purpose\nThe statutory context and purpose of s. 162(1)(a) also suggest that Parliament did not intend the provision to contain a temporal component. Interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as prohibiting surreptitious observation or recording of persons in specific places without a temporal component promotes Parliaments purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity, especially for children and other vulnerable persons. Interpreting s. 162(1)(a) with a temporal component detracts from these purposes and leads to arbitrary and absurd results.\nParliaments purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity are promoted by interpreting s. 162(1)(a) as a location-based offence without a temporal component. As noted by the intervener, the Attorney General of Ontario, rather than providing a specific list of places protected under s. 162(1)(a), Parliament chose to define the protected places in a principled and normative way: If it is reasonable to expect that people in a certain place will be naked, or expose their genitals or anal region or breasts, or be engaged in explicit sexual activity, then that is a place where everyone is entitled to be free from surreptitious observation and visual recording  whether naked or not, exposed or not, explicit sexual activity or not (I.F., at para. 18). Thus, when a person is in circumstances that give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy, s. 162(1)(a) stipulates a rule that normatively identifies a class of quintessentially safe places, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and dressing rooms, in which people should be entitled to not be non-consensually observed or visually recorded, whether or not they or another person in the place are reasonably expected to be nude at the time of the observation or recording. In this way, s. 162(1)(a) protects both privacy and sexual integrity.\nIt is worth elaborating on how prohibiting voyeurism in such safe places under s. 162(1)(a), whether or not nudity is reasonably expected at the time of the surreptitious observation or recording, protects sexual integrity as it is understood today. As noted in this Courts decisions in Friesen and Jarvis, societys conception of sexual offences has evolved from a focus on the wrongful interference with sexual propriety to a concern with protecting sexual integrity (Friesen, at para. 55, and Jarvis, at para. 127, per Rowe J., both citing E. Craig, Troubling Sex: Towards a Legal Theory of Sexual Integrity (2012), at p. 68). In the passage cited approvingly in Friesen and the concurring reasons in Jarvis, Professor Elaine Craig explained that [t]his shift from focusing on sexual propriety to sexual integrity enables greater emphasis on violations of trust, humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, and loss of self-esteem rather than simply, or only, on deprivations of honour, chastity, or bodily integrity (as was more the case when the laws concern had a greater focus on sexual propriety) (p. 68). Under a sexual integrity analysis, the focus is not simply [on] the sexual motives, arousal, or body parts of the accused, or the communitys standard of sexual propriety, but also [on] the perception, experience, and impact on the complainant (p. 75). In addition, a sexual integrity analysis focuses not just on physical harm to the complainant, but also on emotional and psychological harm, which is often more lasting than physical harm, especially for children (Friesen, at paras. 56-59).\nSurreptitious observation or recording of a person where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and which occurs in a safe place under s. 162(1)(a), violates or poses a risk of violating sexual integrity, even if nudity is not reasonably expected at the specific time of the observation or recording. An observation or recording in such a quintessentially private and safe place violates trust and can result in the persons humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, or loss of self-esteem (Craig, at p. 68). It can also cause emotional and psychological harm, even if the person is not observed or recorded when nude. As the intervener, the Samuelson-Glushko Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic, observes: Such violations of trust objectify those targeted by reducing them to body parts, creating images that in a digital environment can be easily replicated, cropped and manipulated in ways and for uses that disregard their right to control their own bodies. These violating images hinder subjects from developing their sexuality as they see fit, while also potentially exposing them to the shame and humiliation that often results from instantaneous and widespread dissemination (I.F., at para. 24).\nThe emotional and psychological harms caused by violations of sexual integrity, even from non-nude photographs, are illustrated in this case. The sentencing judge noted the statement of T.R.s mother that when she told T.R. about the photographs, he was disappointed as he had considered Mr. Downes one of his more positive coaches. She said T.R.s trust was broken and, as a result, T.R. is more cautious and less trusting of coaches and people in general (2020 BCSC 177, at para. 18 (CanLII)). As Dickson J.A. noted aptly, [t]he potentially traumatic impact for adolescent boys of being photographed surreptitiously in such a manifestly private place is obvious (para. 97).\nTo sum up, reading s. 162(1)(a) as prohibiting surreptitious observation or recording of persons in specific places and without a temporal component promotes Parliaments purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity. \nBy contrast, interpreting s. 162(1)(a) with a temporal component detracts from Parliaments purposes of protecting privacy and sexual integrity. On such an interpretation, surreptitious photos of children in their underwear in inherently private places would be permitted without criminal sanction simply because the children in those places were too self-conscious to undress (such as boys around the age of puberty) (see trial reasons, at para. 220). Such an interpretation would fail to protect the privacy and sexual integrity of some of the most vulnerable persons in our society  persons whom Parliament sought to protect through the voyeurism offence.\nRelatedly, the Crown argues that such an interpretation of s. 162(1)(a) would result in arbitrary and absurd results: groups of children who are too self-conscious about their bodies to shower or be nude in dressing rooms could be photographed surreptitiously, but children who are just a few years older and less self-conscious  and who thus might shower or be nude  could not be photographed. I agree with the Crown that Parliament could not have intended such arbitrary and absurd results (see Rizzo, at para. 27). Parliament could not have intended that persons who ordinarily choose to disrobe in a place where nudity can reasonably be expected are protected from voyeurism, while persons who ordinarily choose to keep their clothes on are not.\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal concluded otherwise by taking a narrow perspective that views sexual offences as concerned with sexual propriety alone rather than also with sexual integrity. The majority ruled that an implicit temporal component is essential for s. 162(1)(a) to fulfill its purpose as a sexual offence, rather than as an offence protecting privacy alone. In its view, reading s. 162(1)(a) as criminalizing surreptitious observation or recording when nudity is not reasonably expected at the time of the observation or recording would capture conduct that does not bear any of the hallmarks of voyeurism as a breach of sexual privacy (para. 41 (emphasis in original)). The majority declared that the voyeurism offence in s. 162(1) [is] fundamentally concerned with bodily and sexual privacy and [is] not intended to establish [an] offenc[e] founded upon an invasion of privacy alone (para. 54). It stated that while Mr. Downes conduct was undoubtedly a breach of trust and invasive of privacy, that does not necessarily make it conduct that this section criminalizes as a sexual offence (para. 54).\nI disagree. The majoritys reasoning assumes that in order to stigmatize conduct as a violation of sexual integrity, and thus as a sexual offence, there must be a risk of capturing nude images at the relevant time. But, as I have explained above, taking surreptitious photographs of children in their underwear in an inherently safe place like a hockey dressing room violates not only the childrens privacy but also their sexual integrity, even if nudity was not reasonably expected when the photos were taken. Taking surreptitious photos in such an inherently safe place may injure many interests associated with sexual integrity: such conduct violates trust and can result in the humiliation, objectification, exploitation, shame, and loss of self-esteem of the targeted individuals. Such photos can injure a persons sexual integrity by reducing them to body parts, by hindering them from developing their sexuality as they see fit, and by creating a risk of widespread dissemination of the photos to strangers. When viewed through the lens of Parliaments purpose of protecting sexual integrity rather than simply sexual propriety, Mr. Downes conduct violated both the childrens privacy and their sexual integrity. He thus engaged in conduct that Parliament has criminalized as a sexual offence.\nConclusion\nSection 162(1)(a) does not have an implicit temporal component requiring the Crown to prove that nudity was reasonably expected at the specific time when the photos were taken. As a result, the trial judge appropriately convicted Mr. Downes of two counts of voyeurism under s. 162(1)(a).\nIf Section 162(1)(a) Does Not Have an Implicit Temporal Component, Is the Provision Unconstitutionally Overbroad Contrary to Section 7 of the Charter?\nMr. Downes submits that if this Court accepts that s. 162(1)(a) does not have an implicit temporal component, then the provision is unconstitutionally overbroad contrary to s. 7 of the Charter. He states that the objective of s. 162(1) is to target exploitative sexual conduct and says that the lack of a temporal component extends the offence to cover conduct bearing no connection to its underlying purpose of preventing sexual exploitation (R.F., at para. 68). Mr. Downes did not raise this constitutional issue at trial, and although he raised it at the Court of Appeal, the court did not address it.\nThere is a serious question as to whether Mr. Downes can challenge the constitutionality of s. 162(1)(a) in this Crown appeal as of right under s. 693(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Such an appeal is limited to the question of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents, which in this case was whether s. 162(1)(a) has an implicit temporal component. Although in a Crown appeal as of right the respondent can raise any argument which supports the order of the court below (R. v. Keegstra, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 381, at para. 23), Mr. Downes overbreadth argument does not support the Court of Appeals order: if accepted, it would likely result not in a new trial but in no trial, since s. 162(1)(a) would be unconstitutional (para. 36). Thus, ordinarily Mr. Downes could not challenge the constitutionality of s. 162(1)(a) without first obtaining leave to cross-appeal on this issue under s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26.\nI have concluded, however, that it is unnecessary to decide whether the constitutional issue raised by Mr. Downes is properly before this Court because, in any event, this is not a case in which this Court should exceptionally exercise its discretion to decide such a constitutional question for the first time on appeal. As noted in Guindon v. Canada, 2015 SCC 41, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 20, [w]hether to hear and decide a constitutional issue when it has not been properly raised in the courts below is a matter for the Courts discretion, taking into account all of the circumstances, including the state of the record, fairness to all parties, the importance of having the issue resolved by this Court, its suitability for decision and the broader interests of the administration of justice. The test is a stringent one: this Court must be satisfied that hearing and deciding the new constitutional issue causes no prejudice to the parties (paras. 22-23).\nIn this case, deciding whether s. 162(1)(a) is unconstitutionally overbroad would prejudice the Crown and would require the Court to address an important Charter issue in a factual vacuum. Because the Charter issue was not raised at trial, the Crown has filed no evidence on whether any infringement of s. 7 of the Charter could be justified under s. 1. As noted in Guindon, [a] respondent, like any other party, cannot rely upon an entirely new argument that would have required additional evidence to be adduced at trial (para. 32 (citations omitted in original), quoting Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 58). This is especially so in constitutional cases. This Court has often stressed the importance of a full evidentiary record when deciding constitutional questions and has cautioned that Charter decisions should not and must not be made in a factual vacuum (MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at p. 361; Guindon, at para. 116, per Abella and Wagner JJ.). As the Court of Appeal for Ontario has stated, [a]rguing the interpretation of a statute is much different than arguing its constitutional validity (R. v. Wookey, 2016 ONCA 611, 363 C.R.R. (2d) 177, at para. 61, per Tulloch J.A. (now C.J.O.)). As a result, in all the circumstances, I would decline to decide the constitutional issue.\nDisposition\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, and restore the convictions.\n\tAppeal allowed.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Ministry of Attorney General  B.C.

He had secretly taken 38 photos of two boys aged between 12 and 14  in their underwear in hockey dressing rooms in Coquitlam and Surrey. Mr. Downes  was the boys\u2019 hockey coach. He also ran a sports photography business from his  home. Upon his return from a brief trip to the United States, officials with  the Canada Border Services Agency searched Mr. Downes\u2019 electronic devices and  found thousands of photos of children engaged in sporting activities. Some of the children were in locker  rooms. Although none of the photos involved nudity or child pornography, the  CBSA alerted the RCMP because of a concern that Mr. Downes might have child  pornography on his home computer. A month later,  while searching Mr. Downes\u2019 home and devices, the RCMP found the photos of the  two boys taken on Mr. Downes\u2019 iPhone without their knowledge. He was charged  with two counts of voyeurism. Under section 162(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal  Code</em>, a person is guilty of voyeurism when they secretly observe or  visually record a person who is in circumstances in which they could reasonably  expect privacy. This may arise in a place where it can reasonably be expected  that people may be nude.<strong> </strong>The trial judge determined that Mr. Downes had secretly taken photos of  the two boys in the hockey dressing rooms and convicted him of voyeurism. Mr.  Downes appealed to British Columbia\u2019s Court of Appeal. A majority of the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the  convictions, and ordered a new trial. The majority said the trial judge should  have considered whether nudity was reasonably expected \u201cat the time\u201d Mr. Downes  took the photos. In their view, the offence of voyeurism applied to perpetrators  who expect to observe or record nudity or sexual activity. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal and restored Mr. Downes\u2019  convictions. \u00a0<strong>The prosecution did not need to  prove that nudity could reasonably be expected in the dressing rooms at the  time the photos were taken. </strong>Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Mahmud Jamal said that section  162(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> has no  implicit temporal component. This means that the Crown did not have to prove  that a person could reasonably be expected to be nude in the dressing rooms at  the specific time when the photos were taken. As Justice Jamal explained, it  suffices if the person is in a place where a person may \u201creasonably be expected to be in such a state [of  undress], such as a changing room, toilet, shower stall, or bedroom\u201d. As  a result, he determined the trial judge had appropriately convicted Mr. Downes  of voyeurism. Justice Jamal arrived at this conclusion by interpreting section  162(1)(a) according to the text of the provision and the purpose for which it  was enacted. With respect to the provision itself, he stated that if Parliament  had intended to include a temporal component to the offence, it could have done  so expressly. Moreover, he determined the purpose of the offence was to protect  the privacy and sexual integrity of individuals. This purpose was best achieved  by interpreting section 162(1)(a) as a location-based offence. The fact that Mr. Downes secretly took photos of the two boys in hockey  dressing rooms, a place where individuals are often in a state of undress, was  sufficient to find him guilty of voyeurism.

Neither of the two victims of the robbery clearly saw the perpetrators, who were masked. The Crowns case to identify the accused as a participant in the robbery relied entirely on two pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) the accuseds DNA found on a cigarette butt in the vehicle of one of the victims, which was stolen from the scene and found abandoned after the robbery; and (2) the testimony of that same victim that he may have heard the accuseds last name spoken by one of the perpetrators during the robbery. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the accuseds conviction appeal. The dissenting judge would have allowed the appeal and substituted acquittals on the basis that the verdicts of guilt were unreasonable.\n\tHeld (Cote and OBonsawin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.\n\tPer Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: The convictions should be set aside and verdicts of acquittal substituted. The verdicts were unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. \n\tThe DNA evidence alone was not sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. At best, it permitted an inference that the accused was in the vehicle at some point in time prior to its recovery, but there was no evidence indicating when and why he may have been in the vehicle.\n\tThe victims testimony that he heard the accuseds last name during the robbery was fraught with frailties. The trial judges acceptance of the reliability of the victims evidence cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the evidence. The trial judge misapprehended an aspect of the victims testimony and failed to meaningfully address many of the concerns surrounding the victims physical or mental state.\n\tConsidering the totality of the evidence, no trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accuseds guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available. In light of the evidentiary weaknesses, this is not an instance in which the accuseds decision not to testify at trial can be raised against him.\n\tPer Cote and OBonsawin JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed and the accuseds convictions upheld. The trial judge could reasonably be satisfied that the accuseds guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence.\n\tFirst, it was open to the trial judge to consider the total absence of any reasonable explanation for the presence of the accuseds DNA in the stolen vehicle. The trial judge did not consider the DNA evidence in a vacuum but relied on additional evidence to eliminate the possibility that the cigarette butt could have gotten into the stolen vehicle before or outside of the robbery. This evidence cried out for an explanation that only the accuseds testimony could have provided, such that he must accept the consequences of having remained silent. \n\tSecond, the trial judge was in a privileged position to assess the identification evidence. His finding that the victim was a credible and reliable witness is entitled to deference. Whether a different trier of fact may have reached a different conclusion does not justify appellate interference. The combined effect of the identification evidence and strong DNA evidence, viewed logically and in light of human experience, allowed the judge to infer guilt on the underlying robbery.\nCases Cited\nBy Rowe J.\n\tReferred to: R. v.

No. 79 (QL), 2022 CarswellAlta 187 (WL), affirming the convictions of the accused. Appeal allowed, Cote and OBonsawin JJ. dissenting.\n\tJennifer Ruttan and Danielle Gregoire, for the appellant.\n\tTom Spark, for the respondent.\nThe reasons for judgment of Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ. were delivered by\n\n\tRowe J.  \nThe appellant, Shawn Metzger, appeals as of right from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Alberta dismissing his appeal from convictions by a judge sitting alone for a number of offences arising from a home invasion robbery: 2022 ABCA 16. Identity was the sole issue at trial. Neither of the two victims of the robbery clearly saw the perpetrators, who numbered three or four, as the perpetrators were masked. The Crowns case to identify the appellant as a participant in the robbery relied entirely on two pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) the appellants DNA found on a cigarette butt in the vehicle of one of the victims, Mr. Iten, which was stolen from the scene and found abandoned approximately 11 hours after the robbery; and (2) the testimony of Mr. Iten that he may have heard the name Metzger spoken by one of the intruders during the robbery. On this evidence, the trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the robbery. A majority of the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants conviction appeal. Veldhuis J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and substituted acquittals on the basis that the verdicts of guilt were unreasonable.\nI am of the view that the verdicts were unreasonable and that the appeal should be allowed. Even accounting for the privileged position of the trial judge, I am satisfied that the guilty verdicts cannot be supported by the evidence: R. v. Brunelle, 2022 SCC 5, at para. 7.\nThe trial judge acknowledged that the DNA evidence, standing alone, would not be sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I agree with that conclusion. The DNA evidence at best permitted an inference that the appellant was in the vehicle at some point in time prior to its recovery by the police. There was no evidence indicating when and why the appellant may have been in the vehicle, which was unaccounted for during the 11 hours between the robbery and its recovery. Mr. Iten also routinely left the keys in the vehicle prior to the robbery. As the dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal noted, there were also pieces of clothing and other items in the vehicle that the forensic identification officer acknowledged were not sent for DNA analysis. In these circumstances, the DNA evidence alone could not have established a case to meet against the appellant with respect to participation in the robbery.\nThe other piece of circumstantial evidence that supported the DNA evidence was Mr. Itens testimony that he had heard the name Metzger during the robbery. However, that evidence was fraught with frailties. Mr. Iten was struck on the head with a baseball bat at the outset of the robbery and was fading in and out of consciousness. In his testimony, he actively questioned his own recollection of what he had heard. He did not mention to the police during his initial interviews that he had overheard the name Metzger; rather, an investigating officer first mentioned the name to Mr. Iten during a telephone interview, months or possibly years after the robbery. When asked at trial whether he recalled hearing the name before that telephone interview, Mr. Iten said that he did; he indicated this was based on discussions that he had after the robbery with the second victim, Mr. Rivard, who Mr. Iten believed shared the same recollection. However, this was not corroborated by Mr. Rivard in his testimony.  Mr. Iten also contemplated that his recollection of hearing the name may have been a false memory due to childhood trauma arising from personal associations with the German word metzger, meaning butcher, which is Mr. Itens lifetime vocation.\nAlthough no issue is raised with respect to Mr. Itens honesty, in my view, this is one of the rare instances where the trial judges acceptance of the reliability of Mr. Itens evidence cannot be supported on any reasonable view of the evidence: R. v. Burke, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at para. 7; Brunelle, at para. 8. The trial judge wrongly concluded that [n]othing turns on the inconsistency between Mr. Itens and Mr. Rivards evidence because they were in different rooms and may have heard different things; the trial judge misapprehended the fact that Mr. Iten testified they had the same recollection. The trial judge also failed to meaningfully address many of the concerns surrounding Mr. Itens physical or mental state during and after the robbery.\nConsidering the totality of the evidence  including the frailties in Mr. Itens evidence and the absence of any other inculpatory evidence except for the presence of the appellants DNA on the cigarette butt  I am satisfied that no trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accuseds guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available: R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 55. The verdicts were therefore unreasonable.\nIn light of the evidentiary weaknesses of both the DNA evidence and Mr. Itens recollection, I respectfully disagree with the view that this is an instance in which the appellants decision not to testify at trial can be raised against him. As the dissenting judge noted, quoting from R. v. Phillips, 2018 ONCA 651, 364 C.C.C. (3d) 220, at para. 69,\nthis was not a case in which the evidence cried out for an explanation that only the appellants testimony could have provided, such that he must accept the consequences of having remained silent. It was a very weak Crown case built on identification. The failure of the accused to testify does not undermine his argument that the verdict was unreasonable.\n\n(C.A. reasons, at para. 87 (CanLII))\nIt is not necessary to address the appellants additional arguments concerning the doctrine of recent possession.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions, and substitute verdicts of acquittal.\nThe reasons of Cote and OBonsawin JJ. were delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nThe appellant, Shawn Metzger, appeals as of right from his convictions for robbery and break and enter arising from a home invasion on June 24, 2017. Identity was the sole issue at trial. Neither of the victims was able to see the three or four intruders, who were masked. After the robbery, the intruders drove away in a truck owned by one of the occupants, Mr. Valentin Iten. The truck was found abandoned and locked roughly 11 hours later. A cigarette butt was found under the drivers seat and sent for DNA analysis, which returned a single profile matching the appellant.\nThe main issue in this appeal is whether it was unreasonable for the trial judge to convict the appellant based on (1) the presence of his DNA in the stolen truck; and (2) Mr. Itens testimony that he heard the appellants last name, Metzger, used during the robbery. The majority of the court below dismissed the appellants appeal, finding that the verdicts were not unreasonable (2022 ABCA 16). I agree. In my view, the trial judge could reasonably be satisfied that the appellants guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence (R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 55).\nIn the circumstances, there was no reasonable explanation for why the appellants DNA was found on a cigarette butt under the drivers seat of the stolen truck, if not for his involvement in the robbery less than 12 hours earlier. The trial judge did not consider the DNA evidence in a vacuum. Rather, he relied on additional evidence to eliminate the possibility that the cigarette butt could have gotten into the stolen truck before or outside of the robbery. It is undisputed that Mr. Iten did not know the appellant. It is important to emphasize that [n]obody else used the truck around the time of the robbery (trial reasons, reproduced in A.R., at p. 21). Mr. Iten and his roommate both heard the truck start at the end of the robbery. The truck was found locked and showed no signs of forced entry. The cigarette butt was found under the drivers seat, and the DNA matched only the appellants profile. Taken together, this evidence cried out for an explanation that only the appellants testimony could have provided, such that he must accept the consequences of having remained silent (R. v. Phillips, 2018 ONCA 651, 364 C.C.C. (3d) 220, at para. 69; see also R. v. George-Nurse, 2019 SCC 12, [2019] 1 S.C.R. 570, at para. 1). It was open to the judge to consider the total absence of any kind of reasonable explanation (R. v. Kowlyk, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 59, at p. 73; see also R. v. Noble, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, at para. 103) for the presence of the appellants DNA in a stolen truck found mere hours after the robbery and a short distance away from the victims residence.\nWhile some may view the Metzger identification evidence as weaker, the trial judge was in a privileged position to assess the evidence (R. v. Brunelle, 2022 SCC 5, at para. 9, citing R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 62). The question is whether his findings were [translation] sufficiently supported by the evidence and involve[d] no palpable and overriding error (Brunelle, at para. 8). I agree with the majority of the court below that the trial judges finding that Mr. Iten was a credible and reliable witness is entitled to deference. Whether a different trier of fact may have reached a different conclusion does not justify appellate interference (C.A. reasons, at paras. 26 and 34 (CanLII)). In any event, it was the combined effect of the identification evidence and the strong DNA evidence that allowed the judge to infer guilt on the underlying robbery.\nThe authorities referred to by the appellant, in which DNA or fingerprint evidence was found insufficient to infer guilt on the underlying theft or robbery, are distinguishable. In R. v. Mars (2006), 206 O.A.C. 387, there was no evidence that assisted in determining when the accuseds fingerprint was placed on a pizza box used in committing a robbery (para. 21). Further, evidence given by a neighbour, who described all three robbers as black, effectively excluded the appellant who . . . is white (per Doherty J.A., at para. 27). Similarly, in R. v. Nicholl (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 549 (Ont. C.A.), where a pop can with the accuseds thumbprint on it was found in a vehicle two weeks after it was stolen, and in R. v. Grayston, 2016 ONCA 784, where a balaclava with DNA from the accused and other individuals was found in a stolen vehicle, this evidence was held to be compatible with explanations other than guilt. In R. v. Ahmed, 2015 ONCA 848, the accuseds DNA was found  together with three other DNA matches  on a plastic grocery bag used during a robbery, which bags are commonplace, portable, disposable and reusable (para. 7 (CanLII)). Given the generic nature of the eyewitness descriptions relied on by the Crown, the evidence did not go far enough to support the inference that the accuseds DNA had been deposited on the bag during the robbery.\nBy contrast, there was additional evidence in this case that permitted the trial judge to determine when the appellants cigarette was left in the stolen truck. I also note that DNA evidence, either alone or in combination with less than strong identification evidence, has served to ground verdicts of guilt in similar cases (R. v. Stjepanovic, 2006 BCCA 169, 223 B.C.A.C. 226, at paras. 10-11; see also R. v. OBrien, 2011 SCC 29, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 485, at paras. 2 and 13-16).\nThis is not a case where the judges verdict cannot be supported by the evidence (Brunelle, at para. 7). Rather, the verdict is one that a properly instructed trier of fact could reasonably have rendered (Villaroman, at para. 55). The judge was entitled to conclude that the circumstantial evidence, viewed logically and in light of human experience, was not reasonably capable of supporting an inference other than that the appellant was guilty (Villaroman, at para. 38). I would dismiss the appeal and uphold the appellants convictions.\n\tAppeal allowed, Cote and OBonsawin JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitors for the appellant: Ruttan Bates, Calgary.\n\tSolicitor for the respondent: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service  Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court Sets Aside Convictions for Home Invasion Robbery Due to Unreasonable Verdicts**\n\n**Introduction**\nThis appeal raised central questions about the reliability of circumstantial evidence in establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n**Background**\nShawn Metzger was convicted of home invasion robbery and related offences based on two pieces of circumstantial evidence: his DNA found on a cigarette butt in the stolen vehicle of victim Valentin Iten, and Iten's testimony that he may have heard one of the perpetrators mention \"Metzger\" during the robbery.

He was allegedly part of a group of three or four perpetrators who stole a  truck. The truck belonged to Mr. Valentin Iten, one of the two victims of the  robbery. The vehicle was found approximately 11 hours later, outside a bar in  Red Deer.Neither of the victims clearly saw the perpetrators during the robbery.  At trial, the prosecution relied on two pieces of evidence to identify Mr. Metzger  as one of the thieves. First, Mr. Metzger\u2019s DNA was on a cigarette butt found  in the stolen truck. Second, Mr. Iten testified that he may have heard someone  say \u201cMetzger\u201d during the robbery. Mr. Metzger did not testify at his trial.Based on this evidence, the trial judge concluded Mr. Metzger participated  in the robbery. Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal dismissed Mr. Metzger\u2019s appeal. It  found the trial judge was correct in determining Mr. Metzger\u2019s guilt in the  robbery. One judge disagreed, which permitted Mr. Metzger to appeal his case to  the Supreme Court of Canada as of right. An appeal \u201cas of right\u201d is available in some criminal cases where one  judge on the court of appeal has dissented on a point of law, as was the case  here. This means the appellant does not need to apply to the Supreme Court of  Canada for permission to have their case heard. The case can be heard if the  appellant simply files a notice to this effect. The Supreme Court has allowed the appeal, set aside the convictions and  substituted acquittals.<strong>Mr. Metzger\u2019s convictions were  unreasonable based on the evidence presented at trial. </strong>Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Malcolm Rowe found Mr.  Metzger\u2019s guilty verdicts were unreasonable based on the totality of the evidence.  First, the DNA evidence on its own was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a  reasonable doubt. It only established Mr. Metzger\u2019s presence in the stolen  truck at some point, rather than his participation in the actual robbery. Second,  Mr. Iten\u2019s testimony with respect to hearing the name \u201cMetzger\u201d was fraught  with frailties. He had been struck on the head at the beginning of the robbery,  and was fading in and out of consciousness throughout. During his testimony,  Mr. Iten had questioned his own recollection of what he heard that night. \u00a0Justice Rowe also determined that Mr. Metzger\u2019s decision not to testify  at trial could not be raised against him. \u00a0The evidence in this case was not such that it  \u201ccried out for an explanation that only [his] testimony could provide\u201d. \u00a0For these reasons, Justice Rowe stated that \u201cno trier of fact, acting  judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the accused\u2019s guilt was the only  reasonable conclusion available\u201d. \u00a0"}, "28": {"original_text": "\n\nNote: This document is subject to editorial revision before its reproduction in final form in the Canada Supreme Court Reports.\n\n\n* Brown J. did not participate in the final disposition of the judgment.\n\n\n\n\nCorporal C.R.

By virtue of his position, he held diplomatic immunity. Following the discovery by another member of the CAF posted in Washington of two audio recording devices in her residence, the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) investigated the matter and concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe M had committed the offences of voyeurism and possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications. CFNIS sought the assistance of the Alexandria police for the purpose of obtaining a warrant under Virginia law. The Canadian Embassy waived Ms immunity with respect to his residence and property and the Alexandria police obtained a warrant to search his residence and objects found therein, including electronic devices, and to analyze the seized items.\n\tWhen CFNIS and Alexandria police executed the search warrant, forensic investigators scanned the contents of some electronic devices found in Ms residence to determine which items to seize. They discovered evidence relating to unforeseen offences, including a sexual assault. The investigators seized the devices, removed them to Canada, and obtained Canadian warrants from the Court Martial for further analysis of their contents. M was arrested. He brought a motion in the Court Martial, arguing that the search and seizure of his electronic devices contravened s. 8 of the Charter, and seeking exclusion of the evidence. The military judge dismissed the motion, holding that the Charter did not apply extraterritorially, and that, in any event, the search and seizure were consistent with Charter standards. He subsequently convicted M of voyeurism, possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, sexual assault, and disgraceful conduct. The Court Martial Appeal Court affirmed the military judges decision. It agreed that the Charter did not apply, and held that the evidence did not affect trial fairness at common law. It further concluded that even if the Charter applied, the search did not infringe Ms s. 8 rights.\n\tHeld: The appeal should be dismissed.\n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Cote, Kasirer and Jamal JJ.: CFNIS did not infringe Ms rights under s. 8 of the Charter. There is no need to consider the extraterritorial applicability of the Charter.\n\tA search is reasonable within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable. Digital searches involve unique and heightened privacy interests in personal data. A presumptive requirement of specific, prior authorization applies to digital searches of electronic devices that store personal data.\n\tIn the instant case, authorization to gain entry into and search Ms residence and property could be granted only by a local magistrate under the law of Virginia. CFNIS communicated with local authorities and availed itself of the only legal mechanism open to it: it first obtained a waiver of the inviolability of Ms private residence and property from the Canadian Embassy, and the Alexandria police then obtained a search warrant from a local magistrate. The Virginia warrant meets the requirement for specific, prior authorization for digital searches, and it expressly authorized the search and analysis of the electronic devices found in Ms residence. There were grounds to search the electronic devices as they could reasonably be expected to contain evidence of the voyeurism offence. The search of Ms devices was authorized by law.\n\tFurthermore, the search was reasonable pursuant to Charter standards. It was not more intrusive than necessary. The warrant did not encompass the investigation of sexual assault offences, but the unforeseen evidence was discovered in the process of triaging electronic devices at the scene, as was expressly authorized by the warrant. Seizing the incriminating devices and obtaining Canadian warrants before further analyzing their contents was consistent with s. 8 of the Charter. The plain view doctrine applies to the files disclosing evidence of sexual assault. This doctrine requires that the police officers must have a legitimate prior justification for intrusion into the place where the seizure occurred and that the evidence must be in plain view in that it is immediately obvious and discovered inadvertently. Both requirements are satisfied in the present case. The investigators had a legitimate justification for their inspection of the files containing evidence of sexual assault. The files were discovered while looking for the types of files specifically sought and authorized. In addition, the files were in plain view, given their inadvertent discovery and immediately apparent unlawfulness. Devices containing these files were set aside for seizure and further analysis back in Canada and there was no need to closely examine the files to ascertain their incriminating nature. The application of the plain view doctrine is necessary because the police had no other basis to justify seizing the sexual assault evidence.\n\tThe scope of application of the Charter is delineated in s. 32(1). The Courts decision in R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, is the governing authority on the territorial reach and limits of the Charter under s. 32(1). The interveners invited the Court to decide whether Hape should be reaffirmed, modified, or overruled, and drew on academic criticism of the Hape framework. This is not an appropriate case in which to reconsider the extraterritorial application of the Charter. First, the parties simply debate Hapes application to the facts at hand. The Court should not overrule a precedent without having been asked to do so by a party. Second, reconsidering Hape would make no difference to the outcome of the appeal. Third, academic criticism is not a sufficient reason not to apply the principles of stare decisis. Therefore, it is preferable to leave for another day any reconsideration of the Hape framework.\n\tPer Karakatsanis and Martin JJ.: There is agreement that the appeal should be dismissed. CFNIS did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter and the evidence is admissible.\n\tThe extraterritorial application of the Charter is squarely before the Court and it is an issue that arises infrequently, may easily escape judicial review, and has been subject to significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law. It was clearly the primary and threshold issue argued by the parties and multiple interveners, it was the reason leave to appeal was sought, and the Court received full submissions on both constitutional and international law. Accordingly, it is appropriate to comment on the central question at issue: whether the Charter applies, pursuant to s. 32, to Canadian authorities investigative actions abroad in Ms circumstances.\n\tA purposive reading of s. 32(1) of the Charter supports the conclusion that the Charter applies extraterritorially to the conduct of CFNIS officials while fulfilling their investigative duties in a foreign state and that a Canadian court may assess that conduct for Charter compliance. It is well-established that the interpretation of the Charter should be purposive, generous, and aimed at securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charters protections. The Charters text and purpose support extraterritorial application. Nothing in s. 32 imposes or suggests any territorial limitation. It expressly limits to whom and to what the Charter applies but not where the Charter applies. Limiting the Charters scope to all matters within the authority of Parliament and the legislatures does not implicitly impose a territorial limit. Those words merely reference the division of powers in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Section 32(1)s silence as to the Charters territorial boundaries was a deliberate choice which must be respected. If s. 32(1) were meant to distinguish between acts of state actors on Canadian soil or abroad, such a distinction could have easily been drawn expressly, as was done elsewhere in the Charter. The purpose of s. 32 was to constrain government action and to permit state action abroad that is not constrained by the Constitution would be inconsistent with Canadas constitutional structure, which is premised on preventing arbitrary state conduct.\n\tThe majority in Hape likewise concluded that s. 32 contained no express territorial limit, but, looking to prohibitive rules of customary international law, concluded that the Charter generally could not be applied to the actions of Canadian officials conducted as part of an investigation occurring abroad. This aspect of Hape has been the subject of significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law. Three main flaws in Hape have been identified: (1) Hape applied improper interpretive principles, including jurisdictional principles of international law and a principle of statutory interpretation, to its interpretation of s. 32(1); (2) Hape mischaracterized the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an unlawful exercise of enforcement jurisdiction; and (3) Hapes three exceptions are inadequate. These are significant concerns. They go to the core of the Courts jurisprudence on the extraterritorial application of the Charter, to the practical implications of its application, and to the ensuing lack of consistency and predictability of this area of the law. Though the decision in Hape remains important in many respects, these concerns leave Hapes framework for the extraterritorial application of the Charter ripe for reconsideration. However, given the majoritys decision not to address it, the determination of whether Hape was wrongly decided should be left to another day.\n\tThe Courts rules and guidance to the profession place certain limits upon what interveners may argue but those limits were not exceeded in this case. Moreover, any limitation on the role of interveners in no way limits the jurisdiction of the Court to decide issues in a manner other than that proposed by the parties. The role of the Court, as an apex court, is oriented to the development of the jurisprudence by dealing with questions of public importance, and much of the Courts work necessarily goes beyond what is essential for the disposition of the particular case. While interveners must not introduce new issues, the role of interveners is to provide their own view of the legal issues by providing useful and different submissions, thus bringing broader perspectives before the Court to help the Court fulfill its institutional role. Several interveners in this case did precisely that when they asked the Court to revisit Hape: they proposed a different view of the core legal issue of whether the Charter applied to the conduct of the CFNIS officers.\n\tAssuming that, pursuant to s. 32(1), the Charter applied to the conduct of the officers during their investigation, Ms s. 8 rights were not infringed. A search is reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law is reasonable, and if the search is conducted reasonably; in addition, specific prior authorization is required to search computers. Those requirements are met in the instant case. The warrant issued by a Virginia magistrate specifically authorized the search of computers and electronic devices and Ms diplomatic immunity was waived. The law that authorized the search was reasonable in light of Charter standards and the search was conducted reasonably, as the warrant expressly authorized the process of triaging the electronic devices at the scene.\n\tApplying the plain view doctrine is not necessary in the present case. This doctrine permits seizure without a warrant but M did not dispute seizure; rather, he argued that the search breached s. 8. The investigators did not intentionally search for files beyond the scope of what the warrant authorized. When they discovered that the devices contained evidence of other offences, they set those devices aside for seizure and further analysis after obtaining a Canadian warrant and they continued their search for evidence of voyeurism, as permitted by the warrant. Discovering evidence of an unrelated offence did not require them to entirely cease their search as to what the warrant authorized them to search for. The Court need not and should not decide in this case the complex question of when a particular file on a device is seized, as opposed to when the device itself is seized; neither M nor any of the interveners made any submissions on this issue. Moreover, the assumption that the sexual assault files were seized when they were initially seen by police is highly questionable. For the purposes of the instant case, it is sufficient that the initial triage and seizure of the laptop containing the sexual assault evidence was justified by the Virginia warrant and the subsequent search and seizure of its files was justified by the Canadian warrant. The investigators conduct did not exceed the bounds of prior judicial authorization and the plain view doctrine need not be relied upon.\n\tPer Rowe J.: There is agreement with the entirety of Cote J.s analysis. There is disagreement, however, with Karakatsanis and Martin JJ.s approach to Hape, which goes beyond the issues raised by the parties and seeks, effectively, to overturn Hape at the invitation of interveners. The parties disputed whether the Charter applies in the instant case, assuming the application of Hape as precedent. No party challenged Hape. Rather, they sought to apply it, and its exceptions, to the facts of their dispute. Both lower courts treated this case as an unremarkable application of the Hape framework. The issue of whether Hape should continue to govern was not before the lower courts, nor is it before the Court.\n\tThe purpose of an intervention is to present the Court with submissions which are useful and different based on the interveners experience and expertise. Interveners provide additional perspectives on the legal issues raised by the parties and on the broader implications of the Courts decision. Interveners can often make important contributions. In order to do so, interveners must operate within recognized limits. These constraints reflect a sound understanding of the interveners place within the litigation and of the role of the Court. The parties control their case and decide which issues to raise. Interveners should not take a position on the outcome of the appeal; they must not raise new issues or widen or add to the points in issue; and they must not adduce further evidence or otherwise supplement the record without leave.\n\tInterveners who stray beyond their proper role cause prejudice to the parties by usurping control of the litigation. The potential for inaccuracy increases where interveners invite the Court to reason in the abstract without the benefit of lower court decisions or a full evidentiary record. Improper interventions undermine the leave to appeal process, which is based on careful consideration of the existing record and the issues raised by the parties. Finally, when interveners expand the issues, would-be interveners who decided not to intervene are deprived of the opportunity to present their perspectives to the Court.\n\tRaising the new issue of whether Hape should continue to govern is an improper intervention. It undercuts the parties control of their litigation and runs contrary to their submissions. It undermines the leave to appeal process and excludes would-be interveners. It invites the Court to reason in the abstract. Whether Hape should continue to govern is not before the Court and to revisit Hape as precedent in this case exacerbates the harms created by improper interventions and undermines the limits that preclude the introduction of new issues.\nCases Cited\nBy Cote J.\n\tReferred to: R. v.

The subject of the investigation, Cpl. McGregor, argues that the search and seizure of his electronic devices contravened s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and he seeks to exclude the evidence obtained from them.\nIn the Court Martial, Cpl. McGregor brought a motion to exclude the impugned evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter. He was unsuccessful. The military judge convicted him on counts of voyeurism, possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, sexual assault, and disgraceful conduct. That decision was affirmed by the Court Martial Appeal Court.\nIn this appeal, the Court is invited to examine the extraterritorial application of the Charter pursuant to s. 32(1) of the Charter. Both parties rely on this Courts decision in R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, which is the governing authority on the territorial reach and limits of the Charter. Cpl. McGregor takes the position that the Charter applied to the actions of the CFNIS, whereas the Crown argues that Hape dictates the opposite outcome. For their part, the interveners have focused their submissions on whether the Hape framework should be reaffirmed, modified, or overruled.\nIn the final analysis, I find it unnecessary to deal with the issue of extraterritoriality to dispose of this appeal. This is so because the CFNIS did not violate the Charter. Working within the constraints of its authority in Virginia, the CFNIS sought the cooperation of local authorities to obtain and execute a warrant under Virginia law. The warrant which issued authorized the search, seizure, and analysis of Cpl. McGregors electronic devices expressly. The evidence of sexual assault was discovered inadvertently by the investigators in the process of triaging the devices at the scene of the search; its incriminating nature was immediately apparent. Although the warrant did not contemplate such evidence, the digital files in issue fell squarely within the purview of the plain view doctrine. Furthermore, the CFNIS obtained Canadian warrants before conducting an in-depth analysis of these devices. It is difficult to see how the CFNIS investigators could have acted differently to attain their legitimate investigative objectives. I conclude that they did not infringe Cpl. McGregors rights under s. 8 of the Charter.\nThis is not the right case for any reconsideration of the Hape framework. In light of my conclusion that the actions of the CFNIS conformed to the Charter, reconsidering Hape would make no difference to the outcome of this appeal. Furthermore, the parties have not asked this Court to reconsider Hape, but rather, as noted above, have based their submissions on how it should apply to the facts of this case. Therefore, I do not decide below whether the Charter applies in this case; instead, I show that even if it were to apply, I would still dismiss the appeal.\nBackground\nBetween August 2015 and March 2017, Cpl. McGregor was a non-commissioned member of the regular Canadian Armed Forces posted to the Canadian Defence Liaison Staff at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C. By virtue of his position in the United States, Cpl. McGregor held diplomatic agent status with immunity in respect of his person, property, and residence pursuant to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Can. T.S. 1966 No. 29.\nIn 2017, another member of the Canadian Armed Forces posted in Washington, D.C., discovered two audio recording devices in her residence. She believed that Cpl. McGregor had placed them there, and she reported the discovery to her chain of command. Upon investigating the matter, the CFNIS concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe Cpl. McGregor had committed the offences of voyeurism and possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications.\nThe Commanding Officer could not issue a warrant under s. 273.3 of the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5, to authorize the search of Cpl. McGregors residence, as it was not located on the property of the Canadian Armed Forces. M.CPl. Patridge, the lead CFNIS investigator, sought the assistance of the Alexandria Police Department for the purpose of obtaining a warrant under Virginia law authorizing the search of Cpl. McGregors residence in Alexandria.\nThe Alexandria Police Department advised the CFNIS that it could not apply for a warrant due to Cpl. McGregors diplomatic immunity under the Vienna Convention. This led to the issuance of a diplomatic note to the American Department of State, in which the Canadian Embassy acknowledged that the CFNIS is cooperating with local authorities in Virginia and would like to seek a search warrant to enter Corporal McGregors staff quarters in the company of local police to obtain evidence for the purposes of their investigation (A.R., vol. I, at p. 128). In the note, the Embassy waived Cpl. McGregors immunity with respect to his private residence, as well as his papers, correspondence and property, pursuant to Article 30 of the Vienna Convention, but it expressly retained his personal inviolability and immunity from arrest or detention (p. 128).\nWith the waiver of diplomatic immunity in hand, the Alexandria Police Department obtained a warrant from a local magistrate under the law of Virginia. The warrant authorized the search of Cpl. McGregors residence in Alexandria as well as objects found therein  including electronic devices. The warrant further authorized the analysis of seized items.\nOn February 16, 2017, three CFNIS members and the Alexandria Police Department executed the search warrant. The Alexandria Police Department breached the door, secured the premises, and invited the CFNIS officers to conduct the search. The latter took control of the search. Two forensic investigators, one from the CFNIS and one from the Alexandria Police Department, triaged most of the electronic devices found in the residence, scanning their contents to determine which items to seize.\nIn the triage process, the investigators discovered evidence relating to unforeseen offences  namely sexual assault and what they believed to be child pornography. CFNISs forensic investigator, Lieut. Rioux, saw a video file depicting Cpl. McGregor filming himself while sexually touching a woman who appeared to be lying unconscious on a floor.\nThe investigators did not triage all of Cpl. McGregors devices in executing the search due to the time constraints set out in the warrant. The Alexandria Police Department seized the devices containing incriminating evidence as well as those that were not triaged at the scene. The items seized at Cpl. McGregors residence included three fake smoke alarm cameras, two remote controls for these cameras, two personal audio recorders, an oval camera alarm clock, a small square camera alarm clock with a remote, laptops, storage devices, and compact discs.\nThe Alexandria Police Department made a return before the Virginia magistrate to account for the seized devices, although the CFNIS had them in its custody at all times. Following these events, the CFNIS removed the devices to Canada and obtained Canadian warrants from the Court Martial for further analysis of their contents. A CFNIS investigator arrested Cpl. McGregor in Washington, D.C., and informed him of his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter.\nJudicial History\nAt first instance, the military judge held that the Charter did not apply extraterritorially. He concluded that the search and seizure were in any event consistent with Charter standards, and he noted that the evidence of sexual assault fell within the plain view doctrine. The military judge therefore admitted the evidence relating to the offence of sexual assault (2018 CM 4023). He subsequently convicted Cpl. McGregor of two counts of voyeurism, one count of possession of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, one count of sexual assault, and one count of disgraceful conduct (2019 CM 4015).\nIn a unanimous opinion, the Court Martial Appeal Court affirmed the military judges decision. It agreed with his conclusion that the Charter did not apply, and it held that the evidence did not affect trial fairness at common law. Furthermore, the Court Martial Appeal Court concluded that even if the Charter applied, the result would be the same because the search did not infringe Cpl. McGregors s. 8 rights (2020 CMAC 8, 8 C.M.A.R. 481).\nIssues\nThis appeal raises two main issues:\n(i) Did the Charter apply extraterritorially to the CFNIS investigators in the search of Cpl. McGregors residence in Alexandria, Virginia?\n(ii) Did the CFNIS investigators infringe Cpl. McGregors Charter rights and, if so, should the resulting evidence be excluded?\nAnalysis\nExtraterritorial Application of the Charter\nThe starting point of the analysis is the text of the Constitution. The scope of application of the Charter is delineated in s. 32(1):\n32 (1) This Charter applies\n\n(a) to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and\n\n(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.\nThis Courts decision in Hape is the governing authority on the territorial reach and limits of the Charter under s. 32(1). Under the Hape framework, the Charter generally cannot apply to Canadian authorities involved in an investigation conducted abroad. This general rule is qualified by two exceptions: (1) consent by the foreign state to the application of Canadian law (para. 106); and (2) Canadian participation in a process that violates Canadas international law obligations (paras. 51-52 and 101; see also Canada (Justice) v. Khadr, 2008 SCC 28, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 125, at paras. 18-19).\nUnlike ordinary Canadian citizens, members of the Canadian Armed Forces bear the burden of the extraterritorial application of Canadian criminal law (National Defence Act, ss. 67 and 163.5). Moreover, the Agreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces, Can. T.S. 1953 No. 13  to which Canada and the United States are signatories  governs the legal status under international law of military forces deployed for official purposes. The Agreement provides that the sending state can exercise criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction over its military forces. However, the Agreement does not confer jurisdiction on the sending state to execute searches of residences located outside of military camps or establishments.\nCpl. McGregor contends that the Charter applied extraterritorially to the search and seizure of his electronic devices by Canadian military authorities. He emphasizes that he was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces required to be on foreign soil and that he was the target of a Canadian-led investigation pursuant to the National Defence Act and the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. In Cpl. McGregors view, when the National Defence Act applies extraterritorially, so too should the Charter as a matter of principle. To be clear, at the hearing before our Court, Cpl. McGregor confirmed that he is asking the Court to apply the Charter only to the actions of the Canadian authorities in executing the search.\nAs a preliminary matter, the parties agree that the issue of extraterritoriality should be resolved on the basis of the existing jurisprudence on s. 32(1) of the Charter. The interveners, however, invite our Court to decide whether Hape should be reaffirmed, modified, or overruled. Many of their submissions draw on an extensive body of academic criticism in which the Hape framework is challenged on various constitutional and international law grounds.\nTo be sure, this Court has taken notice of scholarly writings in reconsidering the soundness of its own precedents (see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at paras. 39 and 209; Nishi v. Rascal Trucking Ltd., 2013 SCC 33, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 438, at para. 28; Canada v. Craig, 2012 SCC 43, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 489, at para. 29; Ontario (Attorney General) v. Fraser, 2011 SCC 20, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 86-88, 146-48 and 235-46; R. v. Robinson, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 683, at para. 39; Tolofson v. Jensen, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, at p. 1042; R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740, at pp. 765-71; London Drugs Ltd. v. Kuehne & Nagel International Ltd., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299, at pp. 421-23; R. v. Bernard, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 833, at pp. 865-68). This is not to say, of course, that the judiciary is bound to adopt the prevailing approach proffered in the scholarship or that academic criticism is a sufficient reason not to apply the principles of stare decisis (see Fraser, at para. 86; R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at paras. 28-29; Friesen v. Canada, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 103, at paras. 56 and 58; B. (K.G.), at pp. 774-77). It is helpful to recall what I wrote with my colleagues Brown and Rowe JJ. in R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, at para. 248: criticism per se is not a reason to overrule one of our own judgments, but it may help a party make the case for overruling it on appropriate grounds. \nI do not believe that this is an appropriate case in which to reconsider the extraterritorial application of the Charter. The parties do not contend that the Hape framework should be revisited; they simply debate its application to the facts at hand. As a rule, which the Court should depart from only in rare and exceptional circumstances, we should not overrule a precedent without having been asked to do so by a party. In this instance, only some interveners ask us to overturn Hape; in doing so, they go beyond their proper role. Doing what they are asking would mean deciding an issue that is not properly before us. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the extraterritorial application of the Charter has no bearing on the disposition of the present appeal. Indeed, the actions of the CFNIS conformed to the Charter, as the s. 8 analysis below makes clear. Simply put, I would dismiss the appeal even if I were to accept Cpl. McGregors argument that the Charter applies extraterritorially in the present context.\nIt is thus preferable to leave for another day any reconsideration of the Hape framework. A restrained approach is amply supported by our jurisprudence. As Sopinka J. emphasized in Phillips v. Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 97, This Court has said on numerous occasions that it should not decide issues of law that are not necessary to a resolution of an appeal. This is particularly true with respect to constitutional issues (para. 6; see also R. v. Yusuf, 2021 SCC 2, at paras. 3-5; Canada (Attorney General) v. Federation of Law Societies of Canada, 2015 SCC 7, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 86; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, at pp. 381-82; The Queen in Right of Manitoba v. Air Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 303, at p. 320; Attorney General (Que.) v. Cumming, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 605, at pp. 610-11; Winner v. S.M.T. (Eastern) Ltd., [1951] S.C.R. 887, at p. 901, per Rinfret C.J., revd in part [1954] A.C. 541 (P.C.); John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton, [1915] A.C. 330 (P.C.), at p. 339; Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Parsons (1881), 7 App. Cas. 96 (P.C.), at p. 109; Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 301-2, per La Forest J., dissenting). There are no exceptional circumstances (Cumming, at p. 611) that warrant departing from this general rule in the present appeal. Therefore, I decline the interveners invitation to reconsider the proper approach to the extraterritorial application of the Charter. I would add that, as my colleagues Brown and Rowe JJ. noted in R. v. Sharma, 2022 SCC 39, at para. 75, it is inappropriate for interveners to supplement the evidentiary record at the appellate level. In the s. 8 analysis which follows, I show that even if the Charter were to apply to the actions of the CFNIS, the appeal should still be dismissed.\nSection 8 Analysis\nCpl. McGregor argues that the search of his electronic devices violated his rights under s. 8 of the Charter, either because it was unauthorized by law or because it was conducted in an unreasonable manner. For the reasons outlined below, I reject both arguments and conclude that the conduct of the CFNIS investigators was consistent with the requirements of the Charter.\nDigital Searches: General Principles\nSection 8 of the Charter guarantees the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. A search is reasonable within the meaning of s. 8 if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278; see also R. v. Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, at para. 10; R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, at para. 21; R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at paras. 21-23; Wakeling v. United States of America, 2014 SCC 72, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 549, at para. 41; R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621, at para. 12; Goodwin v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles), 2015 SCC 46, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 48; R. v. Saeed, 2016 SCC 24, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 518, at para. 36; R. v. Tim, 2022 SCC 12, at para. 46). This Court has established a presumption that a search requires prior authorization, usually in the form of a warrant, from a neutral arbiter (R. v. M. (M.R.), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 393, at para. 44, referring to Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 160-62; see also Vu, at para. 22; R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223, at pp. 238-39).\nIn recent years, courts have grappled with the challenges posed by technological innovations in developing the law of search and seizure. This Courts jurisprudence on digital searches has consistently highlighted the unique and heightened privacy interests in personal computer data (R. v. Reeves, 2018 SCC 56, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 531, at para. 35; see also Fearon, at paras. 74, 132 and 197; R. v. Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212, at para. 50; Vu, at paras. 40-41 and 47; R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 47; R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at paras. 105-6).\nIn Vu, the Court recognized that the particular nature of computers (para. 39) warrants specific constraints under s. 8 of the Charter on both the authorization and the reasonable performance of digital searches. In unanimous reasons written by Cromwell J., the Court established a presumptive requirement of specific, prior authorization applicable to digital searches, as summarized at para. 3:\nIn practical terms, the requirement of specific, prior authorization means that if police intend to search computers found within a place with respect to which they seek a warrant, they must satisfy the authorizing justice that they have reasonable grounds to believe that any computers they discover will contain the things they are looking for. If, in the course of a warranted search, police come across a computer that may contain material for which they are authorized to search but the warrant does not give them specific, prior authorization to search computers, they may seize the device but must obtain further authorization before it is searched.\nThis requirement, I add, extends to other electronic devices that have a memory capacity akin to a computer (para. 38). This broad category includes, for example, devices that store personal data, such as cellphones (Fearon, at para. 52).\nThe fact that a search of an electronic device is expressly authorized by warrant does not mean that any file contained therein may be analyzed  even where no search protocol has been imposed. Cromwell J. stressed in Vu that police officers are bound, in their search, to adhere to the rule that the manner of the search must be reasonable (para. 61). Consequently, they cannot scour the devices indiscriminately (para. 61) but must limit their search to the types of files that are reasonably necessary to achieve [the warrants] objectives (para. 22). Should the officers realiz[e] that there was in fact no reason to search a particular program or file on the device, the law of search and seizure would require them not to do so (para. 61; see also Fearon, at paras. 57 and 78; Reeves, at para. 35).\nAuthorization of the Search\nIn the circumstances of the present case, prior authorization to gain entry into Cpl. McGregors residence could be granted only by a local magistrate under the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Neither the Criminal Code nor the National Defence Act provides for the issuance of warrants authorizing the search of private residences located abroad.\nGiven the limited reach of Canadian law, the CFNIS communicated with local authorities and availed itself of the only legal mechanism open to it. The CFNIS first obtained the following diplomatic note from the Canadian Embassy:\n. . . the Embassy has to [sic] honour to waive the inviolability of Corporal McGregors private residence, as well as his papers, correspondence and property under article 30 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, for the exclusive purpose of executing a search warrant obtained for the purposes of the CFNIS investigation. Similarly, the Embassy has the honour to waive Corporal McGregors immunity from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the United States of America to the limited extent necessary to allow the court of jurisdiction to issue the warrant required for this exclusive purpose. The Embassy expressly retains any other applicable immunities, including his personal inviolability and his immunity from arrest or detention. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 128)\nAt the request of the CFNIS, the Alexandria Police Department then obtained a search warrant issued by a Virginia magistrate. I note that the Virginia warrant meets the requirement of specific, prior authorization for digital searches established in Vu. It expressly authorized not only the search of Cpl. McGregors residence but also the search and analysis of the electronic devices found therein:\nYou are hereby commanded in the name of the Commonwealth to forthwith search the following place, person or thing either in day or night\n\n. . .\n\nfor the following property, objects and/or persons:\n\nCamera, video recorder, other electronic audio/photo/video recording devices, computer, cell phone, other internet access devices, internet services devices, external electronic storage devices, and analysis of the seized items. Photographing of the premise and/or seized items. [Emphasis added.]\n\n(R.R., at p. 2)\nNevertheless, Cpl. McGregor asserts that the CFNISs participation in the search was not authorized by law. His first argument in this regard is that the search did not comply with s. 8 of the Charter because Vu requires a separate warrant to authorize the search of electronic devices, that is, a warrant apart from the one authorizing the search of the residence itself. However, the Court Martial Appeal Court was correct to hold that the substance of Vu is directed not at the form the search warrant takes but rather at the requirement of having independent grounds to search the electronic devices (Vu, at para. 48). There were such grounds in this case, as the devices could reasonably be expected to contain evidence of the voyeurism offence.\nCpl. McGregors main argument regarding authorization is that the search fell outside the scope of the waiver of diplomatic immunity granted by Canada under the Vienna Convention. This is so, in his view, because the waiver of diplomatic immunity did not contemplate the search and seizure of his electronic devices, as it referred only to his residence in Alexandria, Virginia.\nI would not give effect to this argument. Accepting that the authority to conduct the search of the devices depended on the Vienna Convention, I find that on any reasonable interpretation of the Canadian Embassys diplomatic note, the waiver encompassed the search of both Cpl. McGregors private residence and his electronic devices. The express reference to Corporal McGregors . . . property in the diplomatic note plainly contradicts his submission that [t]he waiver was limited to [his] residence . . . . It did not target the contents of electronic devices (A.F., at para. 187). Cpl. McGregors argument that the search of his devices was unauthorized by law thus fails.\nReasonableness of the Search\nCpl. McGregor further contends that the search was unreasonable pursuant to Charter standards in that it was more intrusive than necessary. He argues that the investigators unjustifiably expanded the search of the electronic devices to offences of sexual assault and (what they believed to be) child pornography, whereas the warrant contemplated only the offences of breaking and entering, mischief, interception, harassment, and voyeurism. In his view, once the investigators discovered this unanticipated evidence, the Charter required them to stop the search, seize the electronic devices, and obtain a subsequent warrant permitting the analysis of the files in question.\nI cannot accept this argument. It is uncontroversial that the Virginia warrant did not encompass the investigation of sexual assault offences. But the discovery of unforeseen evidence does not invalidate the authorization to conduct a search for the purposes outlined in the original warrant. This principle is an old one, and it renders Cpl. McGregors argument meritless, at least as regards the evidence sought (see, for instance, Canadian Pacific Wine Co. v. Tuley, [1921] 2 A.C. 417 (P.C.), at pp. 424-25). Here, the investigators discovered the impugned evidence when they were in the process of triaging Cpl. McGregors electronic devices at the scene of the search, as was expressly authorized by warrant. The investigators set aside the incriminating devices for seizure and further analysis. Indeed, the CFNIS obtained Canadian warrants before further analyzing their contents. In my view, this investigative process was consistent with s. 8 of the Charter.\nNor does the admission of the unanticipated evidence found in the triage process infringe Cpl. McGregors s. 8 rights. Key to my reasoning is the application of the plain view doctrine to the files disclosing evidence of sexual assault. This common law doctrine defeats the presumption that seizures must be judicially authorized. Our Courts jurisprudence teaches that two requirements must be satisfied for the plain view doctrine to apply: (1) the police officers must have a legitimate prior justification for the intrusion into the place where the plain view seizure occurred (R. v. Buhay, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para. 37); and (2) the incriminating evidence must be in plain view in that it is immediately obvious and discovered inadvertently by the police (R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227, at para. 27; see also Buhay, at para. 37). Concerns have been expressed about the plain view doctrine in relation to electronic seizures (e.g., L. Jrgensen, In Plain View?: R v Jones and the Challenge of Protecting Privacy Rights in an Era of Computer Search (2013), 46 U.B.C. L. Rev. 791). In light of the way this case was argued, I feel it is unnecessary to express a settled opinion on the limits of the doctrine. However, I am satisfied that it does apply in some form to electronic devices (R. v. Jones, 2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241). In the case at bar, there can be no doubt that the doctrine applies.\nA warrant usually provides a legitimate prior justification for the intrusion, thereby satisfying the first requirement of the plain view doctrine. This is not the case, however, where police officers carry out a search unreasonably. In the context of digital searches, the prior justification extends only to the types of files that are reasonably necessary for the proper execution of such a search (Vu, at para. 22). In other words, there must be a reasonable nexus between the files examined and the purposes of the warrant for a search to satisfy the first requirement of the plain view doctrine.\nEven where police officers are initially justified in examining a digital file, the unanticipated evidence contained therein is not necessarily in plain view. This Courts reasoning in Law offers a useful illustration of the second requirement of the plain view doctrine. In that case, a police officer conducted a cursory examination of the documents in question and found nothing facially wrong with [them] (para. 27). The officer failed to detec[t] anything incriminating through the unaided use of his senses, as the incriminating nature of the evidence came to light only after he examined, translated and photocopied several documents (para. 27; see also Buhay, at para. 37; R. v. Gill, 2019 BCCA 260, at para. 59 (CanLII)). Consequently, this Court rejected the argument that the documents were in plain view, since they were neither discovered inadvertently nor immediately evident (Law, at para. 10).\nApplying the foregoing principles, I conclude that both requirements of the plain view doctrine are satisfied in the present case. The application of the plain view doctrine to digital searches may undoubtedly give rise to intricate issues, but this is a straightforward case. The military judge correctly determined that the plain view doctrine applies to the evidence of sexual assault stored in Cpl. McGregors devices.\nFirst, the investigators had a legitimate justification for their inspection of the files containing evidence of sexual assault at the scene of the search. As mentioned above, the Virginia warrant meets the Vu requirement of specific, prior authorization applicable to digital searches. Moreover, the military judge found that [t]he discovery of files relating to a potential sexual assault . . . occurred while looking for the types of files specifically sought and authorized (voir dire decision, at para. 25 (CanLII)). The investigators demonstrat[ed] care to limit the impact of the search through screening and conduct of a targeted search that involved a minimum of personal information (para. 27). In these circumstances, the initial search leading to the discovery of the files in issue satisfies the requirement of prior justification.\nSecond, the digital files disclosing evidence of sexual assault were in plain view, given their inadvertent discovery and immediately apparent unlawfulness. The investigators came upon these files in the triage process, which was designed to quickly identify evidence of interception and voyeurism. The military judge rejected the submissions to the effect that the investigators continued to look into files they had no authority to look at under the terms of the warrant (para. 25). He further noted that any device that was assessed to contain potential child pornography and sexual assault files [was] set aside for seizure and further analysis back in Canada (para. 25). Moreover, there was no need to closely examine the files to ascertain their incriminating nature  in contrast to the documents in Law, which were not facially unlawful. I thus conclude that the impugned evidence was in plain view and that its seizure during the triage process did not violate s. 8, either as part of a search carried out unreasonably or as an unreasonable seizure.\nWith respect for the contrary view of my colleagues Karakatsanis and Martin JJ., I believe that the application of the plain view doctrine is necessary in this case. I do not see on what basis the police could justify seizing either the devices containing, or the actual data constituting, the sexual assault evidence without resort to this doctrine. I agree that the devices were searched pursuant to the Virginia warrant, but that warrant did not authorize the seizure of evidence of sexual assault. After all, it had been issued to search for and seize evidence of voyeurism. A warrant in and of itself is not authority to search for or seize anything which might afford evidence of any offence whatsoever; the plain view doctrine and/or s. 489 of the Criminal Code could authorize such seizures, but only if their requirements are met. Therefore, to be clear, I disagree with my colleagues Karakatsanis and Martin JJ., and I see no need to discuss further their reasons on this issue.\nIn sum, the CFNIS demonstrably observed the requirements of the Charter. The investigators discovered the incriminating evidence in the execution of a digital search expressly authorized by a valid warrant. The evidence of sexual assault, although not contemplated in the original warrant, fell squarely within the purview of the plain view doctrine. The CFNIS seized the evidence in accordance with that doctrine and subsequently obtained Canadian warrants before conducting an in-depth analysis of the files in issue. Even on Cpl. McGregors view of the law, it is difficult to see how the CFNIS could have more fully complied with the Charter. In light of my conclusion that the investigative process was consistent with s. 8 of the Charter, it is unnecessary to address Cpl. McGregors argument that the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2).\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and affirm Cpl. McGregors convictions.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tKarakatsanis and Martin JJ.  \nOverview\nIn this case a member of the Canadian Armed Forces facing trial in a Canadian court seeks to invoke the protections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms against actions taken by Canadian officials abroad. Corporal McGregor asks to exclude the contents of certain electronic devices seized from his home by Canadian and American officials in the State of Virginia. He argues that s. 8 of the Charter applies and his Charter rights were breached because under Canadian law a further warrant was required to search his devices.\nWhile we agree that the appeal should be dismissed, we also comment on the central question directly at issue in this appeal: does the Charter apply, pursuant to s. 32, to Canadian authorities investigative actions abroad in these circumstances? This was clearly the primary and threshold issue argued by the parties and multiple interveners, it was the reason leave to appeal was sought, and we received full submissions on both constitutional and international law. The extraterritorial application of the Charter is squarely before the Court and it is an issue that arises infrequently, may easily escape judicial review, and has been subject to significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law.  \nWhile the extraterritoriality of the Charter may arise in many different types of situations, we comment only on the particular question before us: that is, whether the Charter applies for those people subject to Canadian criminal law for acts committed abroad  whether by virtue of military service or otherwise  and for Canadian officials whose investigations of offences transcend Canadas borders.\nWe begin by interpreting s. 32(1) of the Charter and conclude that the required purposive reading supports the conclusion that the Charter applies extraterritorially to the conduct of Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) officials while fulfilling their investigative duties in a foreign state and that a Canadian court may assess that conduct for Charter-compliance. This was also the reading of s. 32 endorsed by the majority in R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292. However, they were further of the view that international law principles of jurisdiction required a more restrictive reading of s. 32. We say that this restrictive reading is ripe for reconsideration as Hape departed from and overruled previous authority without full argument on international law principles. Further, according to scholars in the field, Hape misapplied certain key principles of international law in reaching the conclusions it did. While we agree as a matter of error correction that the result is the same whether or not the Charter applies, the application of the Charter to Canadian officials investigating Canadians abroad is a pressing issue squarely raised in this appeal. While there are significant questions about the correctness of Hapes conclusion that the Charter does not apply to such investigative action, given the majoritys conclusion, we leave the determination of whether Hape was wrongly decided to another day.\nInterpretation of Section 32(1) of the Charter\nIt is well established that the interpretation of the Charter should be purposive, generous, and aimed at securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charters protections (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344; Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 156). Under this approach, the Charters text and purpose support extraterritorial application and the conclusion that the Charter applies to Canadian authorities conducting investigations abroad. \nNothing in the text of s. 32 imposes or even suggests any territorial limitation. It expressly limits to whom the Charter applies: the federal and provincial governments and legislatures. Section 32(1) also expressly limits to what the Charter applies: . . . all matters within the authority . . . of Parliament and the legislatures. Importantly, s. 32(1) imposes no express limitation on where the Charter applies (Hape, at para. 161, per Bastarache J.). \nNor can it be said that s. 32(1)s limitation of the Charters scope to all matters within the authority of Parliament and the legislatures implicitly imposes a territorial limit on the Charters reach. According to Wilson J. (with whom Dickson C.J. agreed on this point) in Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, this phrase in s. 32(1)(a), like the corresponding words within the authority of the legislature of each province . . ., [was] merely a reference to the division of powers in ss. 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (pp. 455 and 463-64). It simply describes the subject-matters in relation to which the Parliament of Canada may legislate or the government of Canada may take executive action (p. 464). In the context of s. 32(1), therefore, those words do not imply or impose any territorial limitation to or on the Charter. To read them in that manner would not only be inconsistent with precedent (see C. Sethi, Does the Charter Follow the Flag? Revisiting Constitutional Extraterritoriality after R v Hape (2011), 20 Dal. J. Leg. Stud. 102, at p. 113; R. J. Currie and J. Rikhof, International & Transnational Criminal Law (3rd ed. 2020), at pp. 633-34), but would also fail to acknowledge that Canada has the constitutional authority to make laws with extraterritorial application (Statute of Westminster, 1931 (U.K.), 22 Geo. 5, c. 4, s. 3; Reference re Offshore Mineral Rights of British Columbia, [1967] S.C.R. 792, at p. 816; Hape, at paras. 66 and 68; see also Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 8(3)).  \nIf s. 32(1) were meant to distinguish between acts of state actors on Canadian soil or abroad, such a distinction could have easily been drawn expressly, as was done elsewhere in provisions like ss. 3, 6 and 23 of the Charter, which draw distinctions based on citizenship (A. Attaran, Have Charter, Will Travel? Extraterritoriality in Constitutional Law and Canadian Exceptionalism (2008), 87 Can. Bar Rev. 515, at p. 523; see also L. West, Canada Stands Alone: A Comparative Analysis of the Extraterritorial Reach of State Human Rights Obligations (U.B.C. L. Rev., forthcoming), at pp. 8-10). Taking into account what is not in s. 32(1)s text, but is elsewhere in the Charter, confirms that no territorial limitation was intended. Section 32(1)s silence as to the Charters territorial boundaries when other sections are based on citizenship or are specifically confined to Canada was not an omission or the result of happenstance. It was instead a deliberate choice to not limit the Charters territorial reach which must be respected. \nThe purpose of s. 32 was to constrain state action within the newly established constitutional democracy. As this Court has acknowledged, the words of s. 32(1) give a strong message that the Charter is confined to government action. . . . [T]he Charter is essentially an instrument for checking the powers of government over the individual (McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 261). To permit state action abroad that is not constrained by the Constitution would be inconsistent with our constitutional structure, which is premised on preventing arbitrary state conduct (Reference re Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 217, at para. 70). The sole claim of government, including the executive, to exercise lawful authority rests in the powers allocated to them under the Constitution, and can come from no other source (para. 72). Accordingly, there can be no lawful state action without corresponding constitutional limitations  no matter where the conduct takes place. As one commentator put it, [t]he executive cannot act outside the Constitution and still act within the rule of law. When it is invited to play on the international scene, it must come as it is: as a constitutional government  not an arbitrary one. It has no license to act arbitrarily away from home (M. Webb, The Constitutional Question of Our Time: Extraterritorial Application of the Charter and the Afghan Detainees Case (2011), 28 N.J.C.L. 235, at p. 256).\nThus, a purposive interpretation of s. 32(1) leads to the conclusion that the provision draws no distinction between domestic and extraterritorial application. Rather, it sends a strong message that the Charter is an instrument for checking the powers of the government over the individual and preventing state action that is inconsistent with the rights and freedoms it enshrines (McKinney, at p. 261; see also Hape, at para. 91). As a result, based on such an interpretation of s. 32(1), the Charter would apply to constrain Canadian authorities conducting investigations, whether that conduct takes place inside or outside Canada. \nThe Hape Decision\nIn Hape, LeBel J., for the majority, also began with the text of s. 32(1) of the Charter and likewise concluded that it contained no express territorial limit (paras. 32 and 94). However, in that case, the majority of the Court held the Charter did not apply to the Royal Canadian Mounted Polices search and seizure of banking documents in Turks and Caicos Islands (paras. 2-14). The majority overturned R. v. Cook, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 597, and set out a new two-stage framework for determining whether a remedy is available for extraterritorial Canadian state conduct alleged to have violated the Charter. At the first stage, the court must determine if the activity in question falls under s. 32(1) by asking: (1) whether the conduct at issue is that of a Canadian state actor; and (2) if so, whether, on the facts, there is an exception to the principle of sovereignty that would justify applying the Charter to the state actors extraterritorial activities. If there is no exception and the Charter does not apply, then at the second stage the court must ask if the evidence should be excluded from the trial because its admission would render the trial unfair (para. 113).\nLeBel J. chose to look to prohibitive rules of customary international law to aid in the interpretation of s. 32 of the Charter (paras. 35-39). Customary international law is composed of norms that meet the two requirements of state practice and opinio juris: states must actually follow the norm and must view it as legally binding (para. 46). The majority in Hape looked to the principle of sovereign equality, which rests upon respect for territorial sovereignty and is inseparable from the principle of non-intervention, and which provides that all states are sovereign and equal (paras. 40 and 45-46). The majority relied on the doctrine of adoption to conclude that the principles of non-intervention and territorial sovereignty should be relied on to interpret the Charters scope. They also applied the presumption of conformity, a principle of statutory interpretation that legislation will be presumed to conform with international law, unless its wording compels otherwise (paras. 39, 46 and 53). They held that in interpreting the Charters scope, the Court should seek to ensure compliance with Canadas binding obligations under international law where the Charters express words are capable of supporting that construction. \nThe majority found that the comity of nations  defined as the deference and respect due by other states to the actions of a state legitimately taken within its territory  was another interpretive principle that aids in interpreting the Charters extraterritorial reach (paras. 32-33, 47, 50 and 53-56, quoting Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, at p. 1095). LeBel J. observed that comity encourages states to cooperate with each other to investigate transnational crime and, where one state assists another, to respect how assistance is given within a states territory. However, he made clear that comity does not offer a rationale for condoning another states breach of international law and that comitys deference ends where clear violations of international law and fundamental human rights begin (paras. 51-52). \nHaving set out these additional interpretive principles, the majority reviewed and applied jurisdictional principles of international law. LeBel J. observed there are three forms of jurisdiction: prescriptive, enforcement, and adjudicative. Prescriptive jurisdiction is the power to make rules, issue commands or grant authorizations that are binding upon persons and entities (para. 58). Enforcement jurisdiction is the power to use coercive means to ensure that rules are followed, commands are executed or entitlements are upheld (ibid.). Finally, adjudicative jurisdiction is the power of a states courts to resolve disputes or interpret the law through decisions that carry binding force (ibid.). He also summarized several bases upon which a state may exercise its jurisdiction, including the territoriality, nationality, and universality principles (paras. 59-61). \nThe majority proceeded to discuss principles pertaining to extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Canadian context. They stated that it is a well-established principle that a state cannot act to enforce its laws within the territory of another state absent either the consent of the other state or, in exceptional cases, some other basis under international law (para. 65). Observing that, pursuant to the Statute of Westminster, 1931, Canada has the authority to make laws having extraterritorial operation (para. 66), they noted that Parliaments ability to pass extraterritorial legislation is also informed by the above-mentioned interpretive principles. They concluded that while Parliament can enact legislation inconsistent with these interpretive principles, any Canadian law can only be enforced abroad with the consent of other states (paras. 67-68).\nWith these principles in mind, the majority turned to a review of this Courts prior jurisprudence and explained why Cook, the Courts previous decision allowing extraterritorial application of the Charter to the actions of Canadian police abroad, ought to be revisited. In Cook, the Court had determined that the Charter applied to the taking of the accuseds statement by Canadian police in the United States in connection with an investigation of an offence to be prosecuted in Canada. \nThe majority raised three criticisms of Cook. First, they noted that the decision failed to distinguish prescriptive and enforcement jurisdiction (paras. 84-85). As they viewed the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an exercise of enforcement jurisdiction, and since extraterritorial enforcement of Canadian laws is not possible (without consent), they concluded that extraterritorial application of the Charter is impossible (para. 85). \nSecond, they noted practical and theoretical difficulties arose when the Cook approach was applied to different facts, such as those in Hape, where a warrant for the impugned search was not necessary under Turks and Caicos law (paras. 86-92). The majority concluded that, both theoretically and practically, the Charter cannot apply to searches and seizures conducted abroad (paras. 86-92). \nThird, they found that Cook failed to give proper consideration to the wording of s. 32(1) (paras. 93-95). Interpreting s. 32(1) in light of the interpretive principles discussed above, they concluded that extraterritorial enforcement actions were outside the scope of the Charter. Section 32(1) states the Charter applies to matters within the authority of Parliament or the provincial legislatures. Having found that Parliament and the provincial legislatures do not have jurisdiction to authorize enforcement abroad, the majority concluded that activities such as criminal investigations abroad are not matters within the authority of Parliament or the provincial legislatures and are thus not captured by s. 32(1) (para. 94). \nDespite finding that the Charter generally could not be applied to the actions of Canadian officials conducted as part of an investigation occurring abroad, Hape identified three exceptions pursuant to which Charter protections might apply. First, the Charter could apply extraterritorially where the foreign state consented to the Charters application (para. 106). Second, the principle of comity may give way where the participation of Canadian officers in the investigative activities would violate Canadas international human rights obligations (para. 101). Third, ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter could operate to exclude evidence obtained by Canadian officials abroad, if admitting the evidence would result in an unfair trial (paras. 107-12). \nCriticisms of Hape \nThe decision in Hape and its approach has been the subject of significant and sustained criticism by experts in international law.4 Three main flaws in Hape have been identified: (1) Hape applied improper interpretive principles, including jurisdictional principles of international law and a principle of statutory interpretation, to its interpretation of s. 32(1); (2) Hape mischaracterized the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an unlawful exercise of enforcement jurisdiction; and (3) Hapes three exceptions are inadequate. LeBel J.s reliance on and misapplication of these international law principles has generated the level and type of cogent criticism and doctrinal instability which calls for a reconsideration of this aspect of the Hape decision. We look at each of these three main criticisms in turn.\nFirst, a fundamental underpinning of Hape was that s. 32(1) ought to be interpreted in a way that ensures compliance with rules of international law that are binding on Canada, which in this case led to a more restrictive reading of s. 32 (para. 56). Methodologically, imposing international law principles as an overlay to limit the scope of the Charter undermines the purposive approach to Charter interpretation (West, Canada Stands Alone, at pp. 9-10; Cook, at para. 147, per Bastarache J.). Rather, international law should generally be used to support or confirm an interpretation arrived at through the purposive approach (R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at para. 98; H. S. Fairley, International Law Comes of Age: Hape v. The Queen (2008), 87 Can. Bar Rev. 229, at p. 236). Moreover, jurisdictional principles of international law are not an appropriate basis for limiting the meaning of authority in s. 32(1) as a matter of domestic constitutional law. Parliaments authority is plenary within the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and extends to extraterritorial enforcement action, including actions that violate international law itself (Statute of Westminster, 1931, s. 3; Croft v. Dunphy, [1933] A.C. 156 (P.C.), at p. 163; Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Canadian Assn. of Internet Providers, 2004 SCC 45, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 427, at para. 141, per LeBel J.; J. H. Currie, Khadrs Twist on Hape: Tortured Determinations of the Extraterritorial Reach of the Canadian Charter (2008), 46 Can. Y.B. Intl L. 307, at pp. 318-19; Hape, at paras. 39, 53 and 68; G. van Ert, Canadian Cases in Public International Law in 2006-7 (2007), 45 Can. Y.B. Intl L. 527, at p. 551; West, Canada Stands Alone, at pp. 13-14). As well, concerns over international comity and the policy goal of increasing international cooperation between police forces should not be permitted to overtake a proper purposive interpretation or used to insulate state conduct from judicial review (Currie and Rikhof, at pp. 628-29). \nAdditionally, Hape applied the presumption of conformity  a principle of statutory interpretation (para. 53)  to its interpretation of s. 32(1) (Currie (2008), at p. 315; Sethi, at p. 113; J. H. Currie, International Human Rights Law in the Supreme Courts Charter Jurisprudence: Commitment, Retrenchment and Retreat  In No Particular Order (2010), 50 S.C.L.R. (2d) 423, at pp. 441-43 and 453-54). The presumptions used in Charter interpretation are different from those used in statutory interpretation (Hunter, at p. 155). Rather than presuming conformity, in the Charter context we presume that the Charter provide[s] protection at least as great as that afforded by similar provisions in international human rights documents which Canada has ratified, creating a floor  but not a ceiling  for Charter protections based on binding international human rights instruments (Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313, at p. 349, per Dickson C.J.; Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, at p. 1056, quoted in Hape, at para. 55; L. West, Within or Outside Canada: The Charters Application to the Extraterritorial Activities of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (2023), 73 U.T.L.J. 1, at p. 39; Currie (2008), at p. 321). Hapes application of international law principles and statutory interpretation principles to its interpretation of s. 32(1), contrary to the established purposive approach, suggests the need for reconsideration. \nSecond, according to international law scholars, this portion of Hape mischaracterizes the extraterritorial application of the Charter as an unlawful exercise of enforcement jurisdiction. We agree with Hape that Canadian officials conducting an investigation abroad are exercising extraterritorial enforcement jurisdiction (Hape, at paras. 58, 64-65 and 105; Currie and Rikhof, at p. 98). But, academics contend that when jurisdictional principles are properly applied, it becomes clear that requiring Canadian officials to comply with the Charter when abroad and allowing Canadian courts to assess their conduct for such compliance are exercises of prescriptive and adjudicative jurisdiction respectively, neither of which violate international law nor interfere with the sovereign authority of another state (van Ert, at p. 552; J. Crawford, Brownlies Principles of Public International Law (9th ed. 2019), at p. 462; see also Currie (2008), at p. 317). These criticisms leave Hapes analysis ripe for reconsideration. \nFurthermore, Hape equated the application of the Charter with a requirement that Canadian procedure govern the investigation (paras. 84, 86 and 98), which muddied the analysis. Applying the Charter to the conduct of Canadian officials acting abroad is not the same thing as requiring Canadian laws of criminal procedure to govern the foreign investigation (Currie and Rikhof, at p. 634). The Charter does not govern the activities of foreign officials and Canadian officials engaging in enforcement activities in another state are required to comply with that states laws (R. v. Terry, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 207, at para. 19; R. v. Harrer, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 15). State sovereignty is respected by gaining consent to participate in the investigation and by requiring that Canadian officers conducting duties abroad comply with the laws of the foreign state. Requiring Canadian authorities to also abide by the Charter does not preclude the need to respect foreign law prerequisites. \nIn addition, scholarship and foreign case law suggest comity concerns are minimal. States routinely apply their domestic law to the actions of their officials abroad, without seeking the consent of the territorial state (M. Milanovic, Extraterritorial Application of Human Rights Treaties: Law, Principles, and Policy (2011), at p. 65; see, e.g., United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990), at p. 283, fn. 7, per Brennan J., dissenting; C. McLachlan, Foreign Relations Law (2014), at paras. 5.154-5.156; Smith v. Ministry of Defence, [2013] UKSC 41, [2014] A.C. 52, at paras. 46-49; Kaunda v. President of the Republic of South Africa, [2004] ZACC 5, 2005 (4) S.A. 235, at paras. 42-44 and 228-29; Young v. Attorney-General, [2018] NZCA 307, [2018] 3 N.Z.L.R. 827, at paras. 28-30; Smith v. R., [2020] NZCA 499, [2021] 3 N.Z.L.R. 324, at para. 92; Afghan Nationals v. Minister for Immigration, [2021] NZHC 3154, [2022] 2 N.Z.L.R. 102, at para. 39; Federal Intelligence Service  foreign surveillance, BVerfG, 1 BvR 2835/17, Decision of May 19, 2020 (Germany), at paras. 91, 93-94, 101 and 104). This reality of state practice suggests that no norm of customary international law prohibits a state from regulating the actions of its officials abroad through its domestic law. And it indicates that comity is in no way offended by applying domestic law to state officials actions abroad because states do not view this as any breach of rules of courtesy or any violation of international law. \nMoreover, Canadas international human rights obligations support applying the Charter extraterritorially. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 47, which is ratified by and therefore binding on Canada, covers much of the same ground and is relevant to the interpretation of the Charter (P. W. Hogg and W. K. Wright, Constitutional Law of Canada (5th ed. Supp.), at  36:28; Bissonnette, at para. 99). The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has been interpreted as imposing extraterritorial obligations on state parties (Article 2(1); Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 136, at paras. 108-11; Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 31: The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States Parties to the Covenant, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, May 26, 2004, at para. 12; Munaf v. Romania, Communication No. 1539/2006, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/96/D/1539/2006 (2009), at para. 14.2; Lopez Burgos v. Uruguay, Communication No. 52/1979, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/13/D/52/1979 (1981), at para. 12.3; Currie (2010), at pp. 440-41). Because the Charter is presumed to provide protections at least as great (Slaight, at p. 1056), it would follow that the Charter should also extend to the actions of state officials when abroad. \nThird, critics contend that Hapes three exceptions  consent, violations of international human rights obligations, and trial fairness  are inadequate. They fail to provide the same robust protections as expressly contained in the Charter. This is cause for concern and suggests the need to revisit Hapes conclusion. \nScholars have pointed out that the consent exception proves illusory in many circumstances (Attaran, at pp. 534-36 and 538-39; West, Within or Outside Canada, at pp. 37-39). Moreover, if the extraterritorial application of the Charter is not an exercise of enforcement jurisdiction (as international law scholars contend), the consent exception is based on: (1) the unsustainable notion of Canadian officials asking for other states permission to apply Canadas constitutional limits to Canadas own conduct; and (2) the assumption that the territorial state would understand the question or should control the answer (van Ert, at p. 555). \nAcademics have noted that the human rights exception leaves gaps where Charter protections exceed the rights guaranteed in international human rights instruments (West, Within or Outside Canada at p. 39; Currie (2008), at pp. 320-21). That gaps will arise is a given in light of the presumption that the Charter provides protections at least as great as those provided for under Canadas international human rights obligations (Slaight, at p. 1056). As well, it is illogical for the nature of the breach to determine the application of the rights-protecting instrument (Attaran, at p. 520; see also Amnesty International Canada v. Canada (Chief of the Defence Staff), 2008 FC 336, [2008] 4 F.C.R. 546, at paras. 312-13, affd 2008 FCA 401, [2009] 4 F.C.R. 149). Doctrinally, the exception is inconsistent with the principle that treaties, the key source of Canadas international human rights obligations, do not take effect in Canadian law directly unless they have been implemented through legislation and fails to recognize that the Charter is the means by which Canada has implemented many of these obligations (Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 69; van Ert, at p. 553; J. H. Currie, Weaving a Tangled Web: Hape and the Obfuscation of Canadian Reception Law (2007), 45 Can. Y.B. Intl L. 55, at pp. 80-81; Currie and Rikhof, at p. 636; see also K. Sun, International Comity and the Construction of the Charters Limits: Hape Revisited (2019), 45 Queens L.J. 115, at p. 145). And the curious result of the exception  that international human rights law, rather than the Charter, is used to assess the actions of Canadian officials acting abroad (van Ert, at p. 553)  creates uncertainty for Canadian state actors acting abroad who are unlikely to be familiar with Canadas international human rights obligations (Amnesty International, at para. 314; Hape, at para. 173, per Bastarache J.). \nFinally, critics suggest the trial fairness exception also leaves gaps because it does not apply when an individuals Charter rights are breached in a manner that does not result in obtaining evidence that would place the fairness of the trial in question or when the Charter-infringing state conduct never leads to a criminal trial in Canada (K. Roach, R. v. Hape Creates Charter-Free Zones for Canadian Officials Abroad (2007), 53 Crim. L.Q. 1, at p. 2; Currie and Rikhof, at p. 634). And, as originally outlined in Harrer, the exception was intended to apply to circumstances where evidence was collected by foreign authorities to whom the Charter does not apply. It was not intended to address the gap created by failing to apply the Charter to Canadian authorities. More significantly, in our view, the exception only provides the protections contained in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter. These two rights alone are insufficient to guarantee a fully Charter-compliant trial. Attempting to supercharge ss. 7 and 11(d) so that they can stand in the stead of all the other rights contained in the Charter defeats the very purpose of the Charter: to guarantee all the rights and freedoms set out within it. \nConclusion on Hape \nThe decision in Hape remains important in many respects, such as its pronouncements on the incorporation of customary international law by the common law (see Nevsun Resources Ltd. v. Araya, 2020 SCC 5, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 166, at para. 86; van Ert, at p. 555), on state sovereignty and sovereign equality, and on the interpretative principle that statutes are presumed to operate in conformity with Canadas international obligations (see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 114; van Ert, at p. 555).\nThe Court, however, had received no submissions on international law, and it departed from the theoretical foundation of this Courts prior jurisprudence on the application of the Charter abroad even though no parties or interveners before the Court in Hape had asked for the previous jurisprudence to be revised or overruled (paras. 182, 184-86 and 189, per Binnie J.). Numerous theoretical and practical problems have unfortunately followed Hape, as highlighted by the wealth of judicial and academic criticisms that have emerged in the last 15 years. \nThese are significant concerns. They go to the core of our jurisprudence on the extraterritorial application of the Charter, to the practical implications of its application, and to the ensuing lack of consistency and predictability of this area of the law. These concerns leave this portion of Hape ripe for reconsideration. However, given the majoritys decision not to address it, we would leave the determination of whether Hape was wrongly decided to another day.\nBecause we do not reach a conclusion as to whether Hape was wrongly decided, we need not elaborate how the Charter should apply abroad  an issue that was also not a major focus of the submissions in this appeal. However, we note that in our view the Charter is sufficiently flexible to take foreign context and the associated concerns raised by the Hape majority into account in the analysis, on a case-by-case basis. As Bastarache J. recognized in Hape (para. 125), the Charter is a flexible document, amenable to contextual interpretation and permitting reasonable justifications of limitations to fundamental rights. Such flexibility could exist at both the breach and remedial stages. Foreign laws and procedures may be relevant in assessing whether there was a Charter breach. And operational concerns arising from differences between Canadian and foreign procedures might be addressed through a flexible application of remedial discretion under s. 24.\nIn conclusion, we would add that while this Courts rules and guidance to the profession do place certain limits upon what interveners may argue, we disagree with our colleagues that the interveners went beyond their proper role in this case. While interveners must not introduce new issues, the role of interveners is to provide their own view of the legal issues by providing useful . . . and different submissions, thus bringing broader perspectives before the Court (Supreme Court of Canada, Notice to the Profession: November 2021  Interventions, November 15, 2021, (online)). Several interveners in this case did precisely that when they asked this Court to revisit Hape: they proposed a different view of the core legal issue of whether the Charter applied to the conduct of the CFNIS officers. Indeed, these interveners were granted leave to intervene on this basis: when seeking leave, they all clearly signaled their intent to criticize Hape and suggest revisions to its framework, with the Canadian Constitution Foundation specifically stating Hape must be revisited (memorandum of argument, at para. 10). To hold that we cannot engage with this different view, simply because the parties themselves did not propose it, ignores the purpose of intervener submissions as set out in the Notice to the Profession and runs contrary to this Courts past practice in decisions that have relied on the frameworks proposed by interveners. \nMore importantly, any limitation on the role of interveners in no way limits the jurisdiction of this Court to decide issues in a manner other than that proposed by the parties. Indeed, Hape itself demonstrates that this Court can overturn precedent without any invitation from the parties or interveners (para. 187, per Binnie J.). Such a restriction also runs counter to the role of this Court, which is not merely one of error correction. Rather, the role of the Court, as an apex court, is oriented to the development of the jurisprudence by deal[ing] with questions of public importance, and much of the Courts work necessarily [goes] beyond what [is] essential for the disposition of the particular case (R. v. Henry, 2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 53; Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6, 2014 SCC 21, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 86). By bringing broader perspectives before the Court than those advanced by appellants and respondents, and by advancing their own views on legal issues before the Court, interveners help the Court fulfill this institutional role (Notice to the Profession).\nApplication \nAssuming that, pursuant to s. 32(1), the Charter applied to the conduct of the officers during their investigation, Cpl. McGregors s. 8 rights were not infringed.\nA search is reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law is reasonable, and if the search is conducted reasonably (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 278). In R. v. Vu, 2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, this Court decided that specific prior authorization was required to search computers (paras. 3 and 47). This means that if police intend to search any computers found within a place they want to search, they must first satisfy the authorizing justice that they have reasonable grounds to believe that any computers they discover will contain the things they are looking for (para. 48).  \nWe conclude, as does our colleague Cote J., that those requirements are met in this case. First, the warrant issued by a Virginia magistrate specifically authorized the search of computers and electronic devices. As well, the reference to Corporal McGregors . . . property (A.R., vol. I, at p. 128) in the diplomatic note brings the authorization under the waiver of diplomatic immunity. Second, the law that authorized the search was reasonable in light of Charter standards developed in our jurisprudence: as noted by both courts below, the grounds relied upon to obtain the warrant would have been sufficient in Canada. Third, the search was conducted reasonably, as the warrant expressly authorized the process of triaging the electronic devices at the scene. \nWe disagree that applying the plain view doctrine is necessary in this case. The plain view doctrine permits seizure without a warrant in defined circumstances. Cpl. McGregor does not dispute seizure before this Court. Rather, he argued that the search was unauthorized by law or conducted in an unreasonable manner (A.F., at para. 185). He maintained that once investigators had come across evidence of what they believed to be child pornography they ought to have ceased searching, seized the electronic devices, and obtained a subsequent warrant outlining same (para. 200). They breached s. 8, he argued, by instead continu[ing] to search through the devices on scene for additional evidence, in the course of which they viewed the files containing sexual assault evidence (ibid.). In sum, his argument is that [o]nce evidence of a new offence has been discovered in the execution of a search, in order to continue searching devices, investigators must obtain a subsequent warrant for that offence (para. 199). \nThe Court Martial rejected Cpl. McGregors submissions that the police had continued looking for child pornography and sexual assault files, rather than for files relating to the offences covered by the Virginia warrant (2018 CM 4023, at para. 25 (CanLII) (emphasis added)). In this regard, the Court Martial noted that the instant case was a completely different situation than what transpired in [R. v. Jones, 2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241], where investigators, while looking for files relating to an alleged fraud, inadvertently discovered child pornography and from that point started looking for completely different kinds of files than what was envisaged by their initial warrant (ibid. (emphasis added)). \nBecause the police in Jones  unlike in this case  intentionally searched for files beyond the scope of what the warrant authorized, they needed an alternate justification for that unwarranted search and attempted to rely on the plain view doctrine (Jones, at para. 26). In addition to improperly expanding the scope of the search, in Jones police continued searching the individual hard drive that contained the evidence of child pornography after that evidence was discovered. Here, by contrast, police did not continue a search for evidence of crimes other than those covered by the warrant. Rather, they continued their search for evidence of voyeurism, as permitted by the warrant. And, they did not continue searching the devices that contained evidence of other offences. Rather than continuing to search those devices, they set aside for seizure and further analysis, after obtaining a Canadian warrant, any device that was assessed to contain potential child pornography and sexual assault files (voir dire decision, para. 25). Cpl. McGregors arguments that the search was unlawful or unreasonable must therefore fail. The search was authorized by the Virginia warrant and the police did not inappropriately expand the scope of their search. \nAs such, reliance on the plain view doctrine is unnecessary. The parties have not argued any seizure issue. And, in any event, the initial seizure of the device containing sexual assault evidence was judicially authorized by the Virginia warrant, which allowed seizure of devices that may contain evidence of voyeurism. Continued seizure and search of the device was judicially authorized by the subsequent Canadian warrant. Because police set aside any devices that contained evidence of unrelated offences rather than continuing to search them, it is unnecessary to decide in this case whether continuing to search a particular device even after discovering evidence of an unrelated offence on that device could violate s. 8. To the extent that Cpl. McGregor argues that discovering evidence of an unrelated offence on one device required police to not just cease searching that device, but also to refrain from searching any other devices (even for evidence of offences covered by the warrant), we reject that argument. Discovering evidence of an unrelated offence neither authorizes police to begin searching for evidence pertaining to that unrelated offence nor requires them to entirely cease their search as to what the warrant authorized them to search for. That conclusion is all that is required to resolve the s. 8 issue that Cpl. McGregor actually raised: the reasonableness of continuing to triage other devices after discovering evidence of child pornography. \nIn concluding that applying the plain view doctrine is necessary, the majority assumes that the files disclosing evidence of sexual assault were seized when they were seen by police, even though they were conducting a lawful search on the computer for voyeurism under a valid warrant. Cpl. McGregor never raised such an argument, nor did any of the interveners. Our Court has never decided the issue of when a particular file on a device is seized, as opposed to when the device (e.g., a laptop) itself is seized. This Court should not decide it in this case. Unintended consequences may flow from deciding the issue without the benefit of any submissions. And it is unnecessary to a resolution of the case.\nFurther, the assumption that the files were seized when they were initially seen by police is highly questionable under existing precedent. In R. v. Dyment, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417, this Court offered general guidance on the line between a seizure and a mere finding of evidence, which we articulated as the point at which it can reasonably be said that the individual had ceased to have a privacy interest in the subject matter (p. 435). In our view, simply seeing the file at Cpl. McGregors home did not likely constitute a seizure because he did not ceas[e] to have a privacy interest in it in the required sense (ibid.), as evidenced by the need for the subsequent Canadian warrant. Additionally, finding that a file is seized when it is viewed conflates merely seeing a file with seizing it. To analogize to physical files, this would suggest that the police seize every piece of paper that they view during the search of a file cabinet.\nRather than deciding this complex question without the benefit of submissions, we would conclude that the initial seizure of the laptop was justified by the Virginia warrant  as Cpl. McGregor accepts (A.F., at paras. 200-201)  and the subsequent search and seizure of its files was justified by the Canadian warrant. The Virginia warrant did not encompass the investigation of sexual assault offences and the officers discovered the file relating to the alleged sexual assault only while looking for the types of files specifically authorized by the warrant (voir dire decision, at para. 25). The Virginia warrant did, however, authorize seizure of the electronic devices which may have contained evidence of voyeurism. The Virginia warrant also authorized the search of the laptops files for evidence of voyeurism, which explains how the police found the sexual assault file and why they were acting lawfully when they saw it. At this point, the police chose a sound approach in the circumstances: they set aside the (already seized) laptop and subsequently obtained a Canadian warrant that authorized them to search the content of the computers and electronic devices for the purpose of obtaining evidence of sexual assault (para. 20; A.R., vol. I, at p. 100). Accordingly, their conduct did not exceed the bounds of prior judicial authorization and the plain view doctrine need not be relied upon. \nIn addition to being in lawful possession of the computer under the Virginia warrant, we note that when the police discovered the sexual assault file, they may also have been authorized to take physical control of the laptop temporarily, and for the limited purpose of safeguarding potential evidence of a crime until a search warrant specific to sexual assault could be obtained (R. v. Cole, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 65 (emphasis deleted)). Vu likewise contemplated seizure of computers so as to preserve evidence of an offence, even where the warrant did not provide authorization to search the computer for evidence of that offence, assuming it may reasonably be thought to contain the sort of things that the warrant authorizes to be seized (paras. 3 and 49). Here, the police reasonably thought the laptop may have contained evidence of voyeurism and so were justified under the Virginia warrant to seize the laptop in order to preserve the integrity of the data. \nNot only is reliance on the plain view doctrine superfluous and dependent on questionable assumptions regarding when a file is seized, whether or not to extend the plain view doctrine to the search of the content of a computer is a fraught issue that has not been addressed by this Court. We have never endorsed the application of the doctrine to electronic files as set out by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Jones. The search and seizure of personal computers marks an incredibly intrusive, extensive and invasive search of ones privacy (R. v. Morelli, 2010 SCC 8, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 253, at paras. 2-3). To that end, we have required specific authorization for the search and seizure of computers (Vu) and modified the common law approach to searches incident to arrest in the case of cell phones (R. v. Fearon, 2014 SCC 77, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 621). There are special considerations associated with electronic data which suggest we should not assume that the plain view doctrine applies, or that it applies without modification. Additionally, we did not receive any submissions on the issue. We would leave that issue for another day.\nAs such, the police did not infringe s. 8 of the Charter and the evidence is admissible. We would dismiss the appeal. \n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tRowe J.  \nI have read the reasons of Justice Cote, and agree with the entirety of her analysis. To be clear, Justice Cotes reasons state the opinion of a majority of this Court. \nI have also read the reasons of Justices Karakatsanis and Martin. My colleagues use their reasons, at length, to criticize a precedent of this Court, R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292. Their treatment of Hape implies that its merits as a precedent can properly be questioned on this appeal.\nI disagree with their approach, which goes beyond the issues raised by the parties and seeks, effectively, to overturn Hape at the invitation of interveners. This invitation, as I explain below, exceeds the well-established limits on interveners. To be clear, I neither endorse nor refute my colleagues criticisms of Hape; I take no position on the substantive merits of the Hape framework. Rather, I object to my colleagues methodology, which has led them to state an opinion on an issue that is not properly before this Court. \nWhile my colleagues are correct that the applicability of the Charter was argued at length by the parties, their reasons do not explain the litigation fully: the parties disputed whether the Charter applies in this case, assuming the application of Hape as precedent. No party  not at trial, or before the Court Martial Appeal Court, or before this Court  challenged Hape. Rather, they sought to apply it, and its exceptions, to the facts of their dispute. Counsel for the respondent argued that this case was a straightforward application of Hape (R.F., at para. 51) and, in oral submissions, urged the Court not to revisit Hape (transcript, at pp. 118-19). The appellants submissions focused on the applicability of the exceptions set out in Hape (A.F., at paras. 86-181). The appellant did not ask this Court to overturn Hape, nor did he lead evidence at the lower courts to support overturning a precedent. The military judge and the Court Martial Appeal Court treated this case as an unremarkable application of the Hape framework. \nMy colleagues insistence, then, that neither they nor the interveners have strayed from the issue before the Court is untenable. The arguments on the merits of Hape were advanced solely by interveners at this Court, thereby introducing a new issue. This Courts practice direction, on which my colleagues rely (para. 82), cautions against this situation: interveners are to advance their own view of a legal issue before the Court; they must not introduce new issues; and the Court always retains a discretion to take any steps it sees fit to prevent unfairness to the parties (see Notice to the Profession: November 2021  Interventions, November 15, 2021 (online) (Notice of November 2021)). \nTo that end, I disagree with my colleagues suggestion that the interveners submissions are simply a different perspective on a legal issue that is before the Court. This would effectively mean that any time a governing precedent is relevant to deciding a case, interveners could insert themselves before this Court to call for it to be overturned, thereby piggy-backing onto the parties dispute what amounts to a reference on a judicial decision which the interveners wish to overturn. Such an approach does not accord with the rules of this Court. In addition, as an important policy consideration, it runs the risk that this Court will make ill-advised decisions, as they would be made without the benefit of lower court analysis, a proper evidentiary record, or submissions from those who would be affected (including vulnerable groups) but who had no notice that the issue would be placed before the Court. It is this simple: the issue of whether Hape should continue to govern was not before the lower courts, nor is it before this Court. In light thereof, I seek to explain the proper place of interveners relative to the discharge of this Courts adjudicative role. \nWhile the discussion that follows is directed to the place of interveners, I note a separate methodological point. My colleagues rely heavily on what they perceive to be academic consensus that is critical of Hape. I will not repeat what was set out at length in the concurring reasons in R. v. Kirkpatrick, 2022 SCC 33, save to highlight that primarily relying on such an approach undermines stare decisis and leads to doctrinal instability (paras. 246-49). Academic criticism can be persuasive where it demonstrates a recognized basis to overturn precedent, but this Court cannot depart from precedent simply because a chorus of voices, even well-informed voices, expresses disagreement with our decisions (para. 247, referring to Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 S.C.R. 653, at para. 274, per Abella and Karakatsanis JJ., concurring). Moreover, I am concerned by my colleagues insistence that this Court is free to depart from precedent at will, a fortiori, to do so without submissions or an evidentiary record (para. 82). Adherence to precedent furthers basic rule of law values such as consistency, certainty, fairness, predictability, and sound judicial administration (R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19, at para. 64). Departing from precedent in the absence of proper methodology necessarily jeopardizes those qualities of our legal system. Indeed, applying my colleagues implicit criteria, it would be hard to imagine a judgment of the Court that could be considered secure. Having made this point, I now return to the place of interveners.\nThe Place of Interveners at the Supreme Court of Canada\nThe purpose of an intervention is to present the court with submissions which are useful and different from the perspective of a nonparty who has a special interest or particular expertise in the subject matter of the appeal (R. v. Morgentaler, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 462, at p. 463; see also R. v. Barton, 2019 SCC 33, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 579, at para. 52; Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR/2002-156, r. 57(2)(b)). Interveners provide additional perspectives on the legal issues raised by the parties and on the broader implications of the Courts decision. Depending on the context, interveners might highlight relevant jurisprudence, present insightful arguments, or clarify the potential analytical paths to resolving the issues placed before the Court. Interveners may also enhance accuracy by representing diverse cross-sections of the Canadian public and furnishing an analysis informed by their particular experience or specialized expertise. Since the cases heard by this Court are frequently matters of public importance, such experience and expertise can assist the court in deciding complex issues that have effects transcending the interests of the particular parties before it (Barton, at para. 52). Through their submissions, interveners inform the Court of the direct and indirect consequences of the dispute on various stakeholders and on other areas of law. In this way, interveners can often make important contributions. In order to do so, however, interveners must operate within recognized limits. The Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada clearly state these limits, and this Court has issued practice directions, more than once, to remind potential interveners of the boundaries they must respect (see Notice of November 2021; Notice to the Profession: March 2017  Allotting Time for Oral Argument, March 2, 2017 (online)).\nThese constraints reflect a sound understanding of interveners place within the litigation and of the role of this Court. While the Court is often tasked with deciding issues that have implications extending beyond the parties, it remains an adjudicative body. The polycentric nature of a legal issue does not turn the Court into a legislative committee or a Royal Commission (J.H. v. Alberta (Minister of Justice and Solicitor General), 2019 ABCA 420, 54 C.P.C. (8th) 346, at paras. 25-27). The Courts process also remains firmly grounded in the adversarial system: the parties control their case and decide which issues to raise. This does not change when the parties argue before the Supreme Court. Indeed, the importance of this principle only increases: as an apex court, this Courts role is to adjudicate disputes with the benefit of trial-level findings of fact and appellate-level reasons on the issues fully argued by the parties. \nSuch considerations help explain the specific limits placed on interventions. First, interveners are not parties. The purpose of an intervention is not to support a party  by which I mean the appellant(s) and respondent(s)  but to put forward the interveners own view of a legal issue already before the Court. Despite the involvement of interveners, the appeal remains a dispute between the parties (Notice of November 2021, at point 2). Consequently, interveners should not take a position on the outcome of the appeal (Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, r. 42(3); Notice of November 2021, at point 3).\nSecondly, interveners must not raise new issues or widen or add to the points in issue (Morgentaler, at p. 463; Reference re Goods and Services Tax, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 445, at p. 487; Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, r. 59(3); Notice of November 2021, at point 4). Interveners may, however, present their own legal arguments on the existing issues and make submissions on how those issues affect the interests of those whom they represent (see, e.g., Mikisew Cree First Nation v. Canada (Minister of Canadian Heritage), 2005 SCC 69, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 388, at para. 40; Canada (Justice) v. Khadr, 2008 SCC 29, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 143, at para. 18; Barton, at para. 52). \nInterveners must be careful to distinguish between developing a permissible legal argument and adding prohibited new issues; the two are conceptually distinct. A fresh perspective or legal argument on an existing issue is not the same as the introduction of a new issue, outside the scope of the appeal or, even further, in contradiction to the parties submissions regarding the scope of the appeal. The former may assist the Courts deliberation, while the latter detracts from it. While in rare cases it may be difficult to distinguish between the two, this appeal is not such a case. By asking this Court to overturn Hape, certain interveners, upon whom Justices Karakatsanis and Martin rely, have introduced what is clearly a new issue.\nFinally, interveners must not adduce further evidence or otherwise supplement the record without leave (Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, r. 59(1)(b)). They may, of course, use their submissions to explain the impact of the appeal on the group(s) they represent; this represents an appropriate exercise of their role. But they must take the case and the record as they find it, or seek leave to tender new material, such as supplementary legislative facts or contested studies (see, e.g., D. L. Watt et al., Supreme Court of Canada Practice 2022 (2022), at pp. 369-70, referring to R.J.R. MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), Bulletin of Proceedings, June 10, 1994, at p. 990, and Anderson v. Amoco Canada Oil and Gas, Bulletin of Proceedings, March 19, 2004, p. 453). This Court, as always, retains a discretion to take any steps it sees fit where an intervener presents new evidence without leave or otherwise makes improper submissions (see Notice of November 2021, at point 6).\nIn sum, an intervener can make useful contributions when it respects the rules, practice directions, and jurisprudence of this Court. By contrast, it exceeds its role when it seeks to alter the nature of the litigation by usurping the role of the parties, expanding the issues before the Court, or presenting new evidence. An intervention that contravenes these settled rules is improper, and has negative consequences for the parties, potential interveners, and the administration of justice.\nThe Consequences of Improper Interventions\nInterveners who stray beyond their proper role, first of all, cause prejudice to the parties by usurping control of the litigation. The parties  not interveners  are meant to control their own litigation. They define the issues and the relief sought. Proper intervention is consistent with this distribution of responsibilities because it is responsive to the issues the parties have raised. Improper intervention jeopardizes fairness by forcing the parties to respond to issues on which they did not adduce evidence at trial and by tak[ing] the litigation away from those directly affected by it (Attorney-General of Canada v. Aluminum Co. of Canada (1987), 35 D.L.R. (4th) 495 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 507; M. (K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 4-5; see also R. v. N.S., 2021 ONCA 605, 497 C.R.R. (2d) 75, at para. 49). Practical forms of unfairness may also befall the parties as a result of improper intervention, including increased legal costs, delays in responding to intervener submissions, or being forced to bring motions to strike parts of an interveners submissions.\nSecondly, and most fundamentally, interveners who improperly add to or expand the issues on appeal may cause deleterious effects to the proper administration of justice. The potential for inaccuracy increases where interveners invite the Court to reason in the abstract without the benefit of lower court decisions or a full evidentiary record.\nThirdly, improper interventions undermine the leave to appeal process. The Court decides whether to grant or deny leave upon careful consideration of the existing record and the issues specifically raised by the parties. Where an interveners arguments fall outside of the set of issues for which leave has been granted, the Courts careful consideration at the leave stage is frustrated.\nFinally, potential interveners, whether organizations or Attorneys General, decide whether to intervene based on the issues placed before the Court by the parties. Where interveners expand that set of issues, would-be interveners who have decided not to intervene are prejudiced. They might have decided differently had they been made aware that new issues would be raised (see Morgentaler, at pp. 463-64). By the time interveners have introduced the new issues, however, it is too late: the would-be interveners have already been deprived of the opportunity to present, and the Court has been deprived of the opportunity to receive, valuable perspectives on these new issues.\nThe present appeal illustrates these serious consequences. Raising the new issue of whether Hape should continue to govern is an improper intervention. It undercuts the parties control of their litigation and, in fact, runs contrary to their submissions that this Court should apply Hape. It undermines the leave to appeal process and excludes would-be interveners who could make useful submissions on the extraterritorial application of the Charter. And, rather than further the accuracy of decision making, it invites the Court to reason in the abstract without the benefit of lower court decisions, a full evidentiary record, or submissions from the parties. \nThis Courts rules, practice directions, and jurisprudence are carefully designed to avoid these consequences, while ensuring that interveners properly assist the Court. It is therefore critical for interveners to adhere to these limits. When they do so, they can make useful contributions grounded in their expertise and experience. However, that is not what occurred in the present case, as certain interveners overstepped the well-established limits on their role. The issue of whether Hape should continue to govern is not before the Court. Neither party has called this framework into question; indeed, both the appellant and respondent have relied on it. I therefore reject my colleagues decision to accept the invitation from certain interveners and revisit Hape as precedent. Their reasons exacerbate the harms created by improper interventions and undermine the limits that preclude the introduction of new issues. In light of the foregoing, I endorse the reasons of Justice Cote.\n\nAPPENDIX\nRelevant Legislation and Treaties\nAgreement between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty regarding the Status of their Forces, Can.

Colin McGregor was posted to the Canadian  Defence Liaison Staff at Canada\u2019s embassy in Washington, D.C. Given his  position in the United States, Cpl. McGregor had diplomatic immunity in respect  of his person, property and residence under the <em>Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</em>.In 2017, one of his Canadian Armed Forces colleagues posted to the  United States discovered two audio recording devices in her home. She believed  Cpl. McGregor had placed them there and reported the discovery to her senior  officer. Upon investigating the matter, the Canadian Forces National  Investigation Service found there were reasonable grounds to believe Cpl.  McGregor had committed the offences of voyeurism and possession of a device to  surreptitiously record private communications. Yet, the Investigation Service  could not search his residence in Alexandria, Virginia because it was not  located on Canadian Armed Forces property. As a result, the lead investigator asked  the Canadian Embassy to  waive Cpl.\u00a0McGregor\u2019s immunity under the <em>Vienna Convention. </em>With immunity waived, the Alexandria  Police Department obtained a warrant that authorized the search of Cpl.  McGregor\u2019s residence, as well as any electronic devices found there. The American police entered Cpl. McGregor\u2019s residence and invited the  Investigation Service to conduct the search. Officers seized electronic devices  and searched some of them while in the residence. They discovered evidence of the  suspected offences as well as others. The electronic devices were removed to  Canada and searched further, in line with Canadian warrants. A military judge dismissed Cpl. McGregor\u2019s motion to exclude the  evidence for breach of section 8 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, which protects people from \u201cunreasonable  search or seizure\u201d. The military judge convicted him of voyeurism, possession  of a device for surreptitious interception of private communications, sexual  assault and disgraceful conduct. That decision was affirmed by the Court  Martial Appeal Court. Cpl. McGregor then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Both  parties relied on this Court\u2019s decision in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2364/index.do\">R. v.  Hape</a></em> about whether the <em>Charter </em>applies to searches and seizures conducted by Canadian police officers in  other countries. Cpl. McGregor took the position that the <em>Charter</em> applies in this case to the Investigation Service, whereas  the Crown argued the opposite. A unanimous Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed his  convictions.<strong>The investigation did not  violate Cpl. McGregor\u2019s rights under section 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. </strong>Writing for a majority of the judges, Justice Suzanne C\u00f4t\u00e9 found it  unnecessary to deal with the issue of extraterritoriality, because she said the  Investigation Service did not violate the <em>Charter</em>.  Working within the constraints of its authority in Virginia, the Investigation  Service asked local authorities to obtain and execute a warrant under Virginia  law. That warrant authorized the search, seizure and analysis of Cpl.  McGregor\u2019s electronic devices expressly. The evidence of sexual assault was  discovered inadvertently by investigators while triaging the devices at the  scene of the search. Its incriminating nature was immediately apparent.  Although the warrant did not foresee such evidence, the digital files fell into  plain view.As Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9 explained, there are two requirements of the plain view  doctrine and in this case they were both met: (1) the investigators had a  legitimate prior justification for the intrusion in the form of a warrant; and  (2) the incriminating evidence was in plain view in that it was immediately  obvious and discovered inadvertently. In addition, the Investigation Service obtained Canadian warrants  before searching the devices any further. For all these reasons, Justice C\u00f4t\u00e9  said it is difficult to see how the investigators could have acted differently  to attain their legitimate investigative objectives.

C-46, ss. 344(1)(a)(i), (a.1).\n\tAfter robbing a convenience store, H, an Indigenous 19-year-old, pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited firearm contrary to s. 344(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code. Section 344(1)(a)(i) prescribes a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment for a first offence conviction of robbery committed with a restricted or prohibited firearm. At sentencing, H brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the mandatory minimum sentence, arguing that it was a grossly disproportionate sentence in regards to his circumstances and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The sentencing judge concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate and contravened s. 12. He decided that a fit and proportionate sentence for H was two years less a day.\n\tIn an unrelated case, Z robbed a convenience store and pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm, contrary to s. 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code. At that time, s. 344(1)(a.1) imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of four years imprisonment for a conviction of robbery where an ordinary firearm was used. At sentencing, Z brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the mandatory minimum sentence, relying on a set of hypothetical scenarios. The sentencing judge concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly disproportionate for Z. However, she concluded that it was grossly disproportionate in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios, and declared s. 344(1)(a.1) of no force or effect. She sentenced Z to three years imprisonment.\n\tThe Crowns appeals in the cases of H and Z were heard together. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals on the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence provisions, but added a year to Hs sentence, concluding that three years imprisonment was a fit and proportionate sentence. It declined to interfere with Zs sentence. The Crown appeals the declarations of unconstitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence provisions to the Court.\n\tHeld (Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed. \n\tPer Wagner C.J. and Moldaver, Brown, Rowe, Martin and Kasirer JJ.: The mandatory minimum sentences set out in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and the former s. 344(1)(a.1) are constitutional and do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n\tIn the companion appeal of R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, the Court affirmed and developed the framework applicable to challenges to the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under s. 12 of the Charter. In accordance with that framework, determining whether the mandatory minimum sentences for robbery are grossly disproportionate requires a two-stage inquiry. A court must first determine a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code. The court must then ask whether the impugned provision requires it to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate when compared to the fit and proportionate sentence. Whether a mandatory minimum is grossly disproportionate will depend upon the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty and its objectives. This two-part assessment may proceed on the basis of either (a) the actual offender before the court, or (b) another offender in a reasonably foreseeable case. \n\tIndigeneity should factor into the s. 12 analysis of gross disproportionality. Section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code provides mandatory direction to consider the unique situation of Indigenous offenders for all offences in sentencing. Sentencing judges must consider the unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Indigenous offender before the courts and the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for that offender. When engaged, s. 718.2(e) applies at three different parts of the s. 12 analysis. First, courts must consider Gladue when sentencing the individual offender; the failure to consider Gladue factors is an error that can lead to a finding that a sentence is unfit. Second, when crafting reasonably foreseeable hypotheticals, a court may consider scenarios involving Indigenous offenders. Lastly, Indigeneity is relevant at the second stage of the s. 12 inquiry. The assessment of whether a mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate depends, in part, on the penaltys effect on individual offenders, including Indigenous offenders, and its reflection of valid penal purposes and recognized sentencing principles, which include Gladues framework for applying s. 718.2(e). \n\tIn Hs case, the five-year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter. With respect to the first stage of the inquiry, determining a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence, three years imprisonment is a fit and proportionate sentence for H. It is the starting point adopted for an unsophisticated armed robbery of small commercial establishments and in the absence of physical harm. Hs offence not only involved a prohibited firearm, but also resulted in physical harm to store clerks. Moreover, H pointed the rifle at two employees. He was on probation and was subject to a prohibition order at the time of the offence, and he involved a 13-year-old youth in a violent crime. The two-year sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, which was a full year below the starting point, was demonstrably unfit. \n\tWith respect to the second part of the two-stage inquiry, determining whether a sentence is grossly disproportionate, the mandatory minimum sentence, while harsh and close to the line, is not grossly disproportionate in Hs case. First, considering the scope and reach of the offence, the minimum sentence is not so wide that it encompasses conduct that poses relatively little risk of harm. The gravity of the robbery offence and the culpability of offenders convicted of it is relatively high. Robbery is a serious offence based on the requisite actus reus of the use or threat of violence or force in stealing or attempting to steal property. Adding a firearm to the equation simply increases the gravity of the offence. The harmful consequences of using a restricted or prohibited firearm in a robbery are readily identified: there is the risk of death or life-altering physical injury for victims and bystanders, and, even if the weapon is not fired, exposure to this threat carries the risk of profound psychological harm. The use of an unloaded prohibited firearm does not substantially reduce the offences gravity, as the presence of a firearm creates a highly volatile and dangerous situation. The mental elements required for the minimum sentence to apply suggest a relatively high degree of culpability. An offender who commits robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm must intend to steal and intend to use violence or force (or the threat thereof). The offence does not involve an inadvertent decision to put public safety at risk but a conscious choice to put another persons safety at great risk. Though Hs personal circumstances attenuate his culpability somewhat, his actions constitute a grave offence with high moral blameworthiness.\n\tSecond, considering the effects of the penalty on the offender, a five-year term of imprisonment would have detrimental implications for Hs rehabilitation, given the sentencing judges finding that a penitentiary term increased the likelihood that H would re-entrench in gang involvement. Many Indigenous offenders may serve harder time as Indigenous offenders are often more severely affected by incarceration and treated in discriminatory ways in custodial environments. Further, incarceration itself can be a culturally inappropriate consequence for wrongdoing for Indigenous offenders. These effects must carry significant weight.\n\tWith respect to the penalty and its objectives, courts must first consider which sentencing objectives Parliament prioritized in enacting the mandatory minimum penalty and, second, assess whether the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its objectives. In Hs case, Parliaments decision to prioritize denunciation and deterrence is justifiable. The mandatory minimum sentence captures conduct that clearly warrants deterrence and the strong denunciation that a substantial prison sentence signals. Parliament is entitled to enact mandatory minimum sentences that signal that a disregard for the life and safety of others in handling firearms is simply not acceptable. There is also a need for general deterrence when a person endangers the safety of others in wielding a firearm. Hs actions are precisely the conduct that Parliament sought to deter. Greater deference to Parliaments choice to enact a minimum sentence is therefore warranted. Further, the mandatory minimum sentence in Hs case is not totally out of sync with sentencing norms for an offence of this nature. While a five-year mandatory minimum arguably sits above what H would receive, it does not far exceed what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its sentencing objectives. The difference between the mandatory minimum sentence and Hs individual circumstances does not outrage standards of decency. \n\tIn Zs case, five hypothetical scenarios have been advanced. However, these scenarios are insufficient to establish that s. 344(1)(a.1) is grossly disproportionate. The mandatory minimum does not shock the conscience or is not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency. While the punishment is severe, the high threshold for gross disproportionality is not met.\n\tFirst, of the five scenarios, only two are reasonably foreseeable. Reasonably foreseeable scenarios are situations that may reasonably be expected to arise as a matter of common sense and judicial experience, as outlined in Hills. The first reasonably foreseeable scenario involves a 21-year-old Indigenous man who suffers from alcoholism and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, is extremely intoxicated and face down in a snowbank when a good Samaritan stops to help him. He grabs the woman, reaches into his waistband, flashes a BB gun, and snatches her purse. The BB gun is operable and capable of taking an eyeball out, but it is unloaded. The second reasonably foreseeable scenario involves a 26-year-old Indigenous man who suffers from a drug addiction and schizophrenia and has a short criminal record. When meeting his drug dealer in a parking lot, he produces an airsoft pistol, points it as his dealer, and takes some methamphetamines.\n\tIn addition, two hypotheticals drawn from reported decisions are reasonably foreseeable. Both cases involved youthful offenders involved in convenience store robberies: an 18-year-old Indigenous woman, who pled guilty as a party to the robbery where the principal used an imitation firearm; and an 18-year-old youthful offender who used a BB gun in the commission of a robbery and pled guilty.\n\tWith respect to the first stage of the inquiry, two years to two and a half years imprisonment is a fit and proportionate sentence in these reasonably foreseeable scenarios. These scenarios involved street muggings, an offence with a sentencing range around 12 to 18 months, along with the use of a weapon and, in particular, a firearm, which is an aggravating factor. Furthermore, they involved the application of force to the victim, a degree of planning and a prior criminal record. There is also the serious public safety risk involved in using a firearm to settle a drug dispute, a consideration that supports a significant sentence. Nevertheless, the moral blameworthiness of offenders is attenuated when mental health and addiction issues underlay their actions, as well as any applicable Gladue considerations. \n\tWith respect to the second part of the two-stage inquiry, the mandatory minimum is not grossly disproportionate in these reasonably foreseeable scenarios. Regarding the scope and reach of the offence, the scenarios do not demonstrate the mandatory minimum sentence casts too broad of a net and captures offenders with low culpability. The offences mens rea and actus reus apply to a relatively narrow set of violent behaviours, and conviction requires a deliberate and specific act with a defined harm. From the standpoint of public safety, there is not a dramatic difference between robbing a person with a conventional firearm and an air-powered firearm. Zs scenarios do not establish s. 344(1)(a.1) applies in circumstances involving little or no danger to the public or little or no fault. The distinctions between the lethality of the firearms involved, or the fact of party liability, do not establish dramatically different degrees of severity in the context of this offence. In all these scenarios, in order to steal, an offender makes a conscious choice to place another person at risk of life-altering injury and significant psychological trauma. However, the effects of the penalty on the offender are severe. The individual circumstances of the hypothetical offenders indicate the period of incarceration required under s. 344(1)(a.1) would likely result in severe detrimental effects. Finally, an inquiry into the penalty and its objectives reveals the analysis for s. 344(1)(a.1) and s. 344(1)(a)(i) is similar. Parliament chose to impose the strong moral condemnation that a substantial prison sentence signals, which is reasonable given the offenders choice to put public safety at risk offends basic moral values. Greater deference to Parliaments decision to enact the mandatory minimum is therefore warranted. \n\tPer Cote J.: There is agreement with the majoritys disposition of the appeal. However, for the reasons outlined in the dissent in Hills, there is disagreement with the majoritys new three-part test for gross disproportionality at the second stage of the established framework. Applying this established legal framework, the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) and s. 344(1)(a.1) are not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency or shock the conscience of Canadians.\n\tPer Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. (dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed. Sections 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code violate the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 of the Charter. They cannot be saved under s. 1, and should be declared of no force and effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n\tThe five-year sentence set out in s. 344(1)(a)(i) is grossly disproportionate for H. The sentencing judge correctly considered the facts, case law, and relevant sentencing objectives to determine that two years less a day was a fit and proportionate sentence in Hs circumstances. This determination is owed deference. In assessing a fit sentence, courts must not indiscriminately adhere to starting points, completely eliminate the prospect of rehabilitation, or distort the gravity of the offence by dismissing relevant facts (such as whether a firearm was loaded). The sentencing judge balanced the serious aggravating factors on Hs sentence against his tragic personal circumstances, including abandonment by his parents, being raised by his paternal grandparents (both residential school survivors), and a childhood and adolescence marked by poverty, a fractured family unit, physical abuse, and substance dependency. These circumstances are precisely the kind of background or systemic factors that the Court has recognized as having a mitigating effect in sentencing, and it is imperative that sentencing judges appropriately consider the unique social issues facing Indigenous peoples in Canada. It shocks the conscience to send a youthful Indigenous offender to prison for five years when, as the sentencing judge determined, doing so would harm both the offender and society. Moreover, a sentence that is double or nearly double a fit sentence is grossly disproportionate in violation of s. 12 of the Charter. It is hard to fathom how such a sentence would not shock the conscience of Canadians. A five-year sentence does not accord with a purposive reading of s. 12, nor is it alive to the profound consequences of any incarceration on an offenders life and liberty, let alone the secondary impacts on the offender and the offenders family. Even if a fit sentence for H were three years in jail, a sentence of five years would still be grossly disproportionate.\n\tThe four-year mandatory minimum sentence under s. 344(1)(a.1) is also grossly disproportionate. It is unconstitutionally broad and foreseeably applies to a wide range of situations, including those where the offender may be young, substance dependent, assisting the principal offender, or using a firearm like a BB gun. Applying that mandatory minimum in some of these situations would be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency. A four-year sentence reaches beyond the classic instance of robbery with a firearm and captures less egregious conduct. While the objective gravity of robbery with a firearm is always serious, the gravity of the particular offence committed depends on the circumstances surrounding the offence and varies considerably. A wide range of people commit armed robberies. Considering personal characteristics and circumstances sheds light on the reasonably foreseeable scope of the law and reflects the inherently individualized nature of sentencing and how proportionality involves an assessment of both the gravity of the offence and the blameworthiness of the offender. This ensures that s. 12 responds to the everyday composition of offenders in the criminal justice system. Given the breadth of the definition of a firearm (including BB guns, paintball guns, and nail guns), the range of conduct captured by the offence (including the degree and nature of involvement in the crime, the level of violence, and the level of sophistication), as well as the prevalence of important, often intersecting, personal circumstances (including Indigeneity, youth, substance dependency, and rehabilitation efforts), it is reasonably foreseeable that a four-year penitentiary sentence would be grossly disproportionate for some offenders.\nCases Cited\nBy Martin J.\n\tApplied: R. v.

C-46, constitute cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, Mr. Hilbach challenges the minimum of five years imprisonment prescribed under s. 344(1)(a)(i) where a robbery is committed with a restricted or prohibited firearm, arguing that it is a grossly disproportionate sentence in regards to his circumstances. Mr. Zwozdesky relies on a set of hypothetical scenarios to challenge the minimum of four years imprisonment previously imposed by s. 344(1)(a.1) where an ordinary firearm is used. The mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in s. 344(1)(a.1) was repealed after this appeal was heard. Despite this legislative change, these reasons examine the impugned mandatory minimum as previously enacted.\nIn the companion appeal R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, this Court affirmed and developed the framework applicable to challenges to the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under s. 12 of the Charter. Whether a mandatory minimum is grossly disproportionate will depend upon the scope and reach of the offence, the effects of the penalty on the offender, and the penalty and its objectives. Under this rubric, classic features of offences that lie at either end of the spectrum can be discerned and may provide guidance. For example, some offences, while potentially very serious, can be committed in a wide range of circumstances by a wide range of offenders, including circumstances that are all but innocuous and offenders who are all but morally blameless. As such, they fall within a class of offences for which mandatory minimum sentences are particularly vulnerable to being struck down under s. 12 of the Charter as cruel and unusual punishment. This is so because the prescribed mandatory minimum punishment may, in some instances, be so severe and the effects so pronounced, that it results in a grossly disproportionate sentence to the appropriate sentence in a given case (see, e.g., Hills; R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045; R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773; R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130).\nBy contrast, some offences that may carry with them significant mandatory minimum sentences, such as four to five years of imprisonment, are framed in such a way that they cannot be committed in innocuous circumstances by offenders who are all but morally blameless. On the contrary, they are almost always serious and committed by offenders who bear a high degree of moral blameworthiness. Offences that come within this class are narrowly defined and limited in scope, subject and mens rea. They regularly involve acts of violence, threats of violence, or conduct that is inherently dangerous, in circumstances that give rise to a real risk of death or serious bodily harm. Additionally, they require a high level of moral blameworthiness on the part of offenders, be they principals or parties, to sustain a conviction.\nFor this class of offences, the mandatory minimum sentence could, applying normal sentencing principles, be considered to be too high and demonstrably unfit in some cases. For these offences there is, however, little risk of imposing a sentence that would meet the test for gross disproportionality so long as the mandatory minimum sentence is not grossly disproportionate to sentences that would be appropriate, applying normal sentencing principles, for conduct that could reasonably be expected to fall within its ambit (see, e.g., R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90; R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96; R. v. McDonald (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.); R. v. Lapierre (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 332 (Que. C.A.); R. v. McIvor, 2018 MBCA 29, [2018] 5 W.W.R. 139).\nOf course, not all offences will fall neatly into one or the other of these two classes of offences, and they are not intended to establish any preconditions. Rather, these categories may serve as departure points when deciding whether a particular mandatory minimum sentence is or is not constitutional.\nThis appeal, and its companion appeal, provide classic examples of these two classes of offences. In Hills, the impugned provision imposed a mandatory minimum of four years imprisonment for an offence that can be committed in a wide range of circumstances by a wide range of offenders. By contrast, the present offence is narrowly defined and limited in scope, subject and mens rea. The impugned mandatory minimum sentences apply to conduct that poses a significant risk to the safety of victims and the public. The risk of violence and psychological trauma from any robbery involving a firearm is acute. Unlike the offence that was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence at issue in Hills, the spectrum of conduct captured by robbery with a firearm is not so wide that the minimums apply in circumstances that involve little danger or moral fault.\nApplying the framework in Hills, I conclude that neither s. 344(1)(a)(i) nor the former s. 344(1)(a.1) are grossly disproportionate. In enacting the mandatory minimum sentences here, Parliament was free to prioritize deterrence and denunciation. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in respect of each provision.\nLegislative Background\nThe respondents bring challenges under s. 12 of the Charter to the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1) of the Criminal Code. The mandatory minimum sentences at issue arise from the commission of the offence of robbery contrary to s. 343 of the Criminal Code. Section 343 of the Criminal Code defines four ways that the offence of robbery can be committed:\n343 Every one commits robbery who\n\n(a) steals, and for the purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or property;\n\n(b) steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person;\n\n(c) assaults any person with intent to steal from him; or\n\n(d) steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.\nWhile there are four ways in which robbery may be committed, the actus reus and mens rea requirements make robbery rather distinct: as an offence, it combines an offence against property with one against the person, despite the fact it is included in Part IX of the Criminal Code, Offences Against Rights of Property. In terms of actus reus, the use of violence or force is a prerequisite to a conviction under s. 343(a) to (c), and s. 343(d) requires that the offender be armed with an offensive weapon. Moreover, three of the four ways in which robbery may be committed (s. 343(a), (b) and (d)) require actual stealing. Its elements thus tend to restrict the offence to a relatively narrow range of serious conduct, which is generally treated severely in sentencing (M. Manning and P. Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (5th ed. 2015), at 22.59).\nAs for its mental elements, robbery carries a double mens rea requirement. First, the offender must intend to use violence or force, and in the case of s. 343(d) intend to carry the offensive weapon in question (R. v. Pelletier (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 438 (Que. C.A.), at pp. 441-42; R. v. Strong (1990), 111 A.R. 12 (C.A.), at para. 33; R. v. Nadolnick, 2003 ABCA 363, 339 A.R. 348, at para. 21; R. v. Roberts, 2016 NLTD(G) 18, 377 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 174, at paras. 152-54). Second, whether the robbery involved actual stealing (s. 343(a), (b) and (d)) or simply an intent to steal (s. 343(c)), the offender must have had the requisite mens rea for theft given that s. 2 of the Criminal Code defines steal as to commit theft. The mens rea requirement for theft involves a fraudulent intent, an absence of any colour of right over the property, and the intent to deprive an owner of their property (Lafrance v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 201; R. v. Dorosh, 2003 SKCA 134, [2004] 8 W.W.R. 613, at para. 14).\nAside from s. 343(d), s. 343 does not create a distinct offence of armed robbery. However, where a firearm is used in a robbery under any of the modes in s. 343, s. 344(1) is engaged. Specifically, where a restricted or prohibited firearm is used, an offender is subject to a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment in the case of a first offence (s. 344(1)(a)(i)). Before recent amendments to the Criminal Code were enacted in 2022, where the firearm was neither restricted nor prohibited, a mandatory four-year term of imprisonment applied (s. 344(1)(a.1)):\n344 (1) Every person who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable\n\n(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if any firearm is used in the commission of the offence and the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of\n\n(i) in the case of a first offence, five years, and\n\n(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent offence, seven years;\n\n(a.1) in any other case where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and\n\n(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.\nA question which affects the scope of the impugned section arises as to whether s. 344(1) is an offence-creating provision or whether it relates to sentencing alone (R. v. Watson, 2008 ONCA 614, 240 O.A.C. 370, at para. 24; R. v. D. (A.), 2003 BCCA 106, 173 C.C.C. (3d) 177, at para. 30). While nothing turns on this issue here, based on its wording and origins, Parliament appears to have modeled s. 344(1) on s. 85(1) of the Criminal Code, which makes it an offence to commit an indictable offence using a firearm, and s. 85(3), which previously prescribed a mandatory minimum punishment of one year of imprisonment. The mandatory minimum sentences in s. 344(1) must be interpreted similarly to s. 85(1) as a result. Section 85(1) reads as follows:\nUsing firearm in commission of offence\n\n85 (1) Every person commits an offence who uses a firearm, whether or not the person causes or means to cause bodily harm to any person as a result of using the firearm,\n\n(a) while committing an indictable offence, other than an offence under [certain sections, including] 344 (robbery) . . . .\nBefore s. 344s enactment, robbery with a firearm was typically prosecuted by charging an offender with a principal offence, for example armed robbery under the former s. 302, and s. 83 (the then equivalent of s. 85, using a firearm in the commission of the robbery offence; see, e.g., Lapierre; R. v. Covin, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 725). Section 85(1) was enacted to ensure stiff penalties for offences commonly committed with firearms, like robbery (s. 85(3) of the Criminal Code; McGuigan v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 284, per Dickson J. (as he then was), at pp. 316-17 and 319, referring to the former s. 83).\nHowever, in 1995, after s. 344 was enacted, robbery was exempted from the list of indictable offences that could ground a conviction under s. 85(1) (Firearms Act, S.C. 1995, c. 39, ss. 139 and 149). Evidently, Parliament concluded that a penalty even harsher than the one-year minimum term prescribed by s. 85(3) was warranted where a firearm was used to commit robbery. Section 85s text reinforces the conclusion that it served as the model for s. 344, considering the language of the two provisions is similar. Specifically, s. 85(1) refers to a person . . . who uses a firearm . . . while committing an indictable offence, while s. 344(1) applies where firearms are used in the commission of [robbery].\nGiven Parliament modelled s. 344 on s. 85, the use of a firearm ought to be defined consistently across ss. 344 and 85. In R. v. Steele, 2007 SCC 36, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 3, this Court observed that an offender uses a firearm within the meaning of s. 85(1) where the weapon is in the physical possession of the offender or readily at hand, and to facilitate the commission of an offence or for purposes of escape, the offender reveals by words or conduct the actual presence or immediate availability of a firearm (para. 32 (emphasis in original)).\nThe requirement to use a firearm further narrows the scope of s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1) and applies only where a firearm is used to threaten violence or force in a robbery. Mere possession of a firearm does not constitute using a firearm (Steele, at paras. 25-28). This precludes, for instance, the mandatory minimum sentences from applying where an offender merely possessed the firearm and was technically armed within the meaning of s. 343(d). Moreover, use implies a degree of subjective fault. The offender must intend to use the firearm while committing, or escaping after committing, the offence (R. v. Purcell, 2007 ONCA 101, 220 O.A.C. 207, at paras. 16-18).\nIn addition, s. 344 incorporates the definition of a firearm in the Criminal Code, as well as the terms prohibited firearm and restricted firearm. A firearm is defined at s. 2 to mean a barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other projectile can be discharged and that is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person. Prohibited firearms and restricted firearms are two specific classes of firearms subject to strict regulation under both the Firearms Act and the Criminal Code. Prohibited firearms include short-barrelled handguns, sawed-off rifles and shotguns, and automatic firearms (Criminal Code, s. 84(1); Nur, at para. 7). The possession of a prohibited firearm is unlawful, unless the individual possessed the firearm before the prohibition coming into force (Firearms Act, s. 12; Nur, at para. 7). Restricted firearms are inherently dangerous and are commonly used in criminal activity. They include any handgun that is not a prohibited firearm, some semi-automatic firearms, and some firearms that are less than a specified length (Nur, at para. 7; Criminal Code, s. 84(1)).\nFirearms that are neither prohibited nor restricted fall into a residual category of firearms that can be possessed with fewer constraints. This residual category includes ordinary firearms, like hunting rifles, that are subject to the licensing regime in the Firearms Act. Others are exempted from the Firearms Act under s. 84(3) of the Criminal Code, owing to their reduced muzzle velocity. Some exempted firearms include air-powered devices like paintball guns and BB guns. These air-powered devices constitute firearms within the meaning of the Criminal Code since they can still cause serious bodily injury (Hills, at paras. 13-14). The distinctions within Canadas regulatory scheme for firearms underlie the arguments advanced by the parties before this Court on the constitutionality of the mandatory minimums.\nHaving set out the legislative background of the mandatory minimum sentences at issue, I turn to the facts and judicial history that led to this appeal.\nJudicial and Legislative History\nR. v. Hilbach, Alberta Court of Queens Bench, 2018 ABQB 526, 75 Alta. L.R. (6th) 359\nOn June 9, 2017, Mr. Hilbach and a 13-year-old accomplice robbed a convenience store in Edmonton with an unloaded sawed-off rifle. With his face concealed, Mr. Hilbach pointed the rifle at two employees and demanded cash while his accomplice punched one employee and kicked the other. They left with $290 in lottery tickets and were apprehended shortly after. At the time of the offence, Mr. Hilbach was 19 years old, on probation, and subject to a firearms prohibition order, having been convicted of and sentenced for several other offences 3 months earlier. In January 2018, Mr. Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited firearm contrary to s. 344(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code and to violating s. 117.01(1) of the Criminal Code, which makes it an offence to possess a firearm while prohibited from doing so by a court order. At sentencing, Mr. Hilbach brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the five-year mandatory minimum sentence imposed pursuant to s. 344(1)(a)(i). Mr. Hilbach claimed the impugned provision was grossly disproportionate in his particular circumstances as an offender before the court. \nMr. Hilbach is Indigenous. He is a member of the Ermineskin Cree Nation. Before the sentencing judge, Mr. Hilbach filed a pre-sentence report and Gladue report, which established that his family had a history of residential school attendance, struggled with addictions to alcohol or other substances, and suffered financial difficulties. He has a Grade 10 education, had worked in the construction industry, and was working with an organization for youth and young adults at risk of gang involvement and criminal activity. He has a daughter, who was 18 months old at the time of sentencing. He acknowledged an alcohol addiction and a criminal record for several offences, including uttering threats, assault, mischief, and breaches of recognizance. His personal history is marked by physical abuse, family violence, chronic unemployment, and gang involvement.\nThe sentencing judge decided that a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Hilbach was two years less a day. In assessing gross disproportionality, the sentencing judge concluded that while the gravity of the offence was high, and deterrence and denunciation were important, the effects of a five-year penitentiary sentence were severe, as a longer sentence increased the likelihood of a life of criminal and other anti-social behaviour (para. 14). Mr. Hilbachs rehabilitation was best served with a short period of incarceration. Further, his youth was mitigating and Gladue factors contributed to the offence. The most basic was Mr. Hilbachs poverty, which prompted his actions and related to systemic factors that led to lower incomes among Indigenous peoples. The sentencing judge was satisfied these considerations would justify a sentence less than the three-year starting point established by the Alberta Court of Appeal for unsophisticated armed robbery for commercial outlets in R. v. Johnas (1982), 41 A.R. 183. Since a five-year sentence was more than double a fit and proportionate sentence, and because a penitentiary sentence was qualitatively different, he concluded that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate (para. 43). The Crown made no argument under s. 1 of the Charter, so the sentencing judge declined to consider it (para. 5).\nR. v. Zwozdesky, Alberta Court of Queens Bench, 2019 ABQB 322, 95 Alta. L.R. (6th) 386\nOn September 13, 2016, Mr. Zwozdesky and two masked accomplices robbed a convenience store in Caslan, Alberta. One of the accomplices pushed an employee, pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her, and demanded cash. A shot was fired into a shelf. Mr. Zwozdesky was not the principal offender. He did not enter the store during the robbery, but drove the vehicle that brought his accomplices to and from the store. Mr. Zwozdesky pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm contrary to s. 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code, as well as a charge of robbery contrary to s. 344(1)(b) of the Criminal Code arising from a second incident. At sentencing, Mr. Zwozdesky brought a challenge under s. 12 of the Charter to the four-year mandatory minimum sentence in s. 344(1)(a.1).\nMr. Zwozdesky was almost 56 years old at sentencing. He had a Grade 9 education and no criminal record. He was injured in several motor vehicle accidents, the last significant one having occurred in 2000. As a result, he suffered severe post-traumatic cognitive dysfunction, fibromyalgia, nerve damage and chronic pain and was incapable of working. To manage his pain, he relied on prescription drugs, along with hard and soft illegal drugs. He had no memory of the robbery on September 13, 2016, as he was under the influence of drugs. The sentencing judge found he may have participated in the robberies to support his addictions that resulted from chronic pain.\nThe sentencing judge concluded that the impugned mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly disproportionate for Mr. Zwozdesky, since a sentence of three to four years was fit and proportionate for his offence. She went on to conclude, however, that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios. Armed robberies could be committed in a wide variety of circumstances and by a wide range of offenders. The minimum sentence could be grossly disproportionate where offenders were young, Indigenous and/or suffering from addiction issues. In support of this conclusion, the sentencing judge referenced R. v. Hilbach, 2018 ABQB 526. As the Crown made no submissions under s. 1 of the Charter, the sentencing judge declined to consider whether the infringement was justified in a democratic and free society and declared s. 344(1)(a.1) of no force and effect. Having struck down the mandatory minimum sentencing provision, she sentenced Mr. Zwozdesky to three years imprisonment for robbery with a firearm.\nAlberta Court of Appeal, 2020 ABCA 332, 14 Alta. L.R. (7th) 245\nThe Alberta Court of Appeal heard the Crowns appeals in Mr. Hilbachs and Mr. Zwozdeskys cases together. The majority, Strekaf and Feehan JJ.A., dismissed the Crowns appeals on the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentence provisions, but added a year to Mr. Hilbachs sentence. Wakeling J.A. wrote in dissent, concluding that both mandatory minimum sentence provisions were constitutional and the sentences imposed on each offender were inadequate.\nThe majority concluded that a sentence of two years less a day was demonstrably unfit for Mr. Hilbach and instead concluded three years imprisonment was a fit and proportionate sentence. Three years was the starting point for convenience store robberies established in Johnas, and a sentence of this length suited the gravity of Mr. Hilbachs offence. In going below three years imprisonment, the sentencing judge had overemphasized Mr. Hilbachs Gladue factors and placed insufficient weight on deterrence and denunciation, as well as the offences aggravating factors. However, s. 344(1)(a)(i) was still grossly disproportionate in Mr. Hilbachs case, as it precluded considering mitigating factors and elevated denunciation and deterrence to such an extent as to minimize objectives of rehabilitation, the imposition of a just sanction, and special considerations for Indigenous offenders (para. 53).\nThe majority agreed with the sentencing judge that three years imprisonment was a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Zwozdesky and declined to interfere with his sentence as a result. The majority, however, also agreed s. 344(1)(a.1) was grossly disproportionate in five reasonably foreseeable scenarios, including where the offender was young, Indigenous, suffering from mental health issues and addiction, and committed the robbery with an air-powered pistol. In these scenarios, the mandatory minimum might be more than double a fit and proportionate sentence. The Crown did not advance an argument to save the legislation under s. 1 of the Charter.\nWakeling J.A. in dissent would have set aside the declarations that ss. 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) are grossly disproportionate. Wakeling J.A. reiterated his view, expressed in R. v. Hills, 2020 ABCA 263, 9 Alta. L.R. (7th) 226, that this Courts s. 12 jurisprudence is unsound and ought to be revisited. Even so, Wakeling J.A. noted that these are not one of those extraordinary cases (para. 89) that satisfies the test for gross disproportionality developed in Smith. Wakeling J.A. would have also increased Mr. Hilbachs and Mr. Zwozdeskys sentences beyond the mandatory minimums.\nIn September 2021, Mr. Zwozdesky passed away after the Court granted leave to the Crown to appeal. After Mr. Zwozdeskys counsel applied to continue the appeal pursuant to s. 76 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, the Court granted standing to his counsel to appear as amici curiae under r. 92 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada, SOR/2002-156.\nLegislative Amendments\nAfter leave to appeal was granted, Parliament introduced and passed An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 2022, c. 15. The legislation received royal assent on November 17, 2022, and repealed the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in s. 344(1)(a.1). When an ordinary firearm is used to commit robbery, it no longer attracts a mandatory minimum. While I acknowledge this legislative change, these reasons examine the provision as previously enacted with the applicable mandatory minimum terms. The parties do not rely on Parliaments choice to repeal this measure in their arguments and as such, I will not address this issue further.\nIssue\nThe issue on this appeal is whether the mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment prescribed in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and (a.1) of the Criminal Code infringe s. 12 of the Charter.\nAnalysis\nIn the reasons for judgment in Hills, rendered simultaneously with this case, this Court reiterated the well-established s. 12 framework and provided further clarity as to how it applies in respect of a challenge to a mandatory minimum sentence provision. I begin with a brief restatement of those principles before applying those principles in this appeal.\nThe Test for an Infringement of Section 12\nThe Framework\nDetermining whether the mandatory minimum sentences for robbery are grossly disproportionate requires a two-stage inquiry. A court must first determine a fit and proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code (Hills, at para. 40; R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at para. 63; R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 46; Nur, at para. 46). The court must then ask whether the impugned provision requires it to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate when compared to the fit and proportionate sentence (Hills, at para. 40; Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 46; Smith, at p. 1072). This two-part assessment may proceed on the basis of either (1) the actual offender before the court, as it will for Mr. Hilbach, or (2) another offender in a reasonably foreseeable case, as proposed by Mr. Zwozdesky (Hills, at para. 41; Bissonnette, at para. 63; Nur, at para. 46).\nAt both stages of the analysis, courts are called upon to be scrupulous (Hills, at paras. 50-52). Analytical rigour at the first stage, and fixing as specific a sentence as possible, ensures that the comparative exercise at the second stage is not distorted. In some cases, the evaluation of gross disproportionality may be more apparent where the fit sentence fixed at the first stage is not carceral in nature  for example, where it would have involved probation rather than imprisonment as was the case in Hills (para. 156). But the same principled process of comparison applies when comparing terms of imprisonment to determine if and when the length of a carceral sentence becomes grossly disproportionate.\nThe framework for the second stage of the s. 12 analysis is outlined in the companion case, Hills, beginning at para. 122, and involves consideration of the scope and reach of the offence, the effects on the offender, and the penalty. Either one component alone or the combination of multiple components may lead to a finding of gross disproportionality. Mandatory minimum penalties that capture a range of conduct of varying gravity and differing levels of offender culpability will be constitutionally suspect (Hills, at para. 125; Lloyd, at para. 24; Boudreault, at para. 45; Smith, at p. 1078). The broader the scope of the offence, the more likely the mandatory minimum may prescribe a grossly disproportionate term of imprisonment on conduct that involves low risk to public safety and low moral culpability (Hills, at para. 125; Nur, at para. 83). In these circumstances, the minimum penalty is more likely to capture conduct that is grossly disproportionate.\nAt the second component, courts must also take into account the impacts that the mandatory minimum may have on the individual offender. This analysis requires an inquiry into how the punishment may affect the actual or reasonably foreseeable offender  both generally and based on their specific characteristics and qualities (Hills, at para. 133). Offender characteristics including Indigeneity, race, gender, age and mental health factors may be relevant to this component (Hills, at para. 135).\nThe third component requires an analysis of the penalty imposed under the mandatory minimum (Hills, at para. 138). Courts must assess the severity of the sentence imposed and ask whether the prescribed penalty goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliaments sentencing objectives having regard to the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives (Smith, at pp. 1099-1100). Parliament may mandate sentences according to its punishment objectives, including those of denunciation and deterrence, within constitutional limits. However, no individual sentencing objective can be applied to the exclusion of all others (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 43). Rehabilitation must form part of the calculus of all criminal punishment, as a punishment that completely disregards rehabilitation is incompatible with human dignity (Bissonnette, at para. 85; Hills, at para. 141). Courts should examine whether there are alternatives to the mandatory penalty that would also fulfill Parliaments sentencing objectives. Where a mandatory minimum provides no discretion to impose a sentence other than imprisonment where imprisonment is not required, the penalty will be constitutionally suspect and require careful scrutiny (Hills, at para. 144). All punishment should be considered in light of the principles of parity and proportionality (R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at paras. 32-33; Hills, at para. 145).\nMandatory Minimum Sentences and Indigenous Offenders\nSection 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code provides mandatory direction to consider the unique situation of Indigenous offenders for all offences in sentencing (R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at para. 93; R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at paras. 84-85). It directs that all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders. The principles relating to the consideration of Gladue reports are settled: these considerations must be applied in all cases where they are relevant, including where the offence charged is serious. Sentencing judges must consider the unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular Indigenous offender before the courts and the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for that offender (Ipeelee, at paras. 59-60).\nCertain parties and interveners raised questions regarding the way Indigeneity should factor into the s. 12 analysis of gross disproportionality. The Attorney General of Ontario, for instance, submitted that it should be treated as a generic mitigating circumstance that is excluded from the scope of reasonable hypotheticals. These arguments were rejected in Nur when the Court found the inquiry into reasonably foreseeable situations the law may capture may take into account personal characteristics relevant to people who may be caught by the mandatory minimum (para. 76).\nWhen engaged, s. 718.2(e) applies at three different parts of the analysis.\nFirst, in conducting a s. 12 analysis, courts must consider Gladue when sentencing the individual offender. The failure to consider Gladue factors is an error that can lead to a finding that a sentence is unfit (Ipeelee, at paras. 86-87). Hence, where the offender is Indigenous, like Mr. Hilbach, a court will necessarily need to take into account Gladue principles in order to fix a sentence that is fit and proportionate at the first stage.\nSecond, a court may consider scenarios involving Indigenous offenders in crafting reasonably foreseeable hypotheticals (Hills, at para. 86). Given the statistics concerning the imprisonment of Indigenous persons, it is reasonably foreseeable that a hypothetical offender could be Indigenous, and the consideration of a hypothetical offenders Indigeneity, in the context of a reasonable hypothetical scenario, aligns with the imperative statutory guidance provided by Parliament in s. 718.2(e). Indigenous people dealing with poverty, precarious housing, or disabilities and addictions appear with staggering regularity in our provincial courts and are therefore reasonably foreseeable (Boudreault, at para. 55).\nLastly, Indigeneity is relevant at the second stage of the s. 12 inquiry. This Court has long affirmed that the assessment of whether a mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate depends, in part, on its reflection of valid penal purposes and recognized sentencing principles (Boudreault, at para. 48; Smith, at p. 1072; R. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, at p. 500; R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 86; Morrisey, at para. 28). Gladues framework for applying s. 718.2(e) has been a core part of Canadas sentencing principles since 1999. The methodology called for under s. 718.2(e), as well as the norms it embodies, are well-established components of our sentencing jurisprudence, as much as parity and proportionality. Section 718.2(e) is necessarily relevant in a s. 12 framework that requires courts to assess the effects of mandatory minimum sentences in light of sentencing norms and objectives. Moreover, as Boudreault illustrates, the impact of a punishment on Parliaments objectives in s. 718.2(e) can support striking down a sentencing measure under s. 12. Accordingly, there is no reason to exclude consideration of s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code from either stage of the gross disproportionality framework.\nThe types of considerations that may be raised under s. 718.2(e) in a s. 12 challenge to a mandatory minimum sentence include, for instance, whether a probationary sentence would have otherwise been a valid alternative to incarceration as a result of Gladue principles. Or, as in Boudreault, the effects of a sentencing measure may be particularly severe when circumstances affecting Indigenous offenders are considered (para. 94). This Court has identified, for instance, that Indigenous offenders may be more adversely affected by incarceration than non-Indigenous offenders (Gladue, at para. 68). Courts may identify these concerns as grounds that support the conclusion that a minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate, keeping in mind that a breach of s. 12 remains a high threshold to meet and a punishment is not grossly disproportionate due to the presence or absence of a single sentencing principle.\nI turn now to Mr. Hilbachs and Mr. Zwozdeskys s. 12 challenges.\nApplication\nI first address Mr. Hilbachs appeal, in which he argues that s. 344(1)(a)(i) is grossly disproportionate as it concerns his own actual circumstances. I will then turn to Mr. Zwozdesky, who concedes the proportionality of the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by s. 344(1)(a.1) as it applies to his case, but relies on a set of hypotheticals to challenge the mandatory minimum sentence provision.\nApplication to Mr. Hilbachs Case\nThe Crown submits that the Court of Appeal majority erred in concluding s. 344(1)(a)(i) was grossly disproportionate in Mr. Hilbachs case, as they overlooked the gravity of Mr. Hilbachs offence and failed to recognize deterrence and denunciation were valid penal goals as a result. I agree. The mandatory minimum sentence as applied to Mr. Hilbach is a harsh punishment. However, upon consideration of (1) the scope and reach of the offence; (2) the effects of the punishment on the offender; and (3) the penalty, I am not satisfied the mandatory minimum reaches the high threshold of gross disproportionality.\nThree Years Imprisonment Is a Fit and Proportionate Sentence for Mr. Hilbach\nThe Court of Appeal majority overturned the sentencing judges sentence of two years less a day and instead concluded that a fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach was three years imprisonment. Neither party challenges the Court of Appeals finding that a three-year sentence is a fit and proportionate sentence for Mr. Hilbach. No reasonable hypothetical was proffered at first instance, and we need not create one here. The s. 12 analysis will proceed based solely on the facts of Mr. Hilbachs case.\nBy imposing a sentence that was a full year below the starting point for offences of this nature in Alberta, the sentencing judge failed to adequately weigh the gravity of the offence and the significant aggravating factors in this case. As the majority stated (at paras. 11 and 46), three years imprisonment was the starting point adopted for an unsophisticated armed robbery of small commercial establishments with modest or no success and in the absence of actual physical harm recognized in Johnas, at para. 19 (emphasis added). Mr. Hilbachs offence not only involved a prohibited firearm, but also resulted in physical harm as his accomplice was physically violent with both store clerks in the course of the robbery. Moreover, Mr. Hilbach pointed the rifle at two employees. He was on probation and was subject to a prohibition order at the time of the offence. He also involved a 13-year-old youth in a violent crime. These are aggravating factors that could support a sentence above the starting point in Johnas. While I accept the mitigating factors identified by the sentencing judge, I agree with the Court of Appeal majority that a sentence that is a full year below the starting point in Johnas would be demonstrably unfit.\nThe Mandatory Minimum Is Not Grossly Disproportionate in Mr. Hilbachs Case\nThis Court has repeatedly affirmed that the threshold for establishing a grossly disproportionate sentence under s. 12 is high (Lloyd, at para. 24). The mandatory minimum sentence must be more than merely excessive, unfit or disproportionate. It must be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency (Hills, at para. 109, citing Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing Morrisey, at para. 26; R. v. Wiles, 2005 SCC 84, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072). It is only on rare and unique occasions that a sentence will infringe s. 12, as the test is very properly stringent and demanding (Steele v. Mountain Institution, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, at p. 1417). As I explain below, a mandatory minimum of five years, while harsh and close to the line, is not grossly disproportionate in Mr. Hilbachs case. The minimum sentence at issue is not so wide that it encompasses conduct that poses relatively little risk of harm. Though Mr. Hilbachs personal circumstances attenuate his culpability somewhat, his actions constitute a grave offence with high moral blameworthiness. While the effects of imprisonment on Mr. Hilbach, an Indigenous offender, will be severe, five years imprisonment in his case is not totally out of sync with sentencing norms. As a result, proportionality and parity are not compromised to the extent seen in Nur, Lloyd and Hills. Parliaments sentencing objectives and decision to prioritize denunciation and deterrence is justified for this offence. Greater deference to Parliaments choice to enact a minimum sentence is therefore warranted.\nThe Scope and Reach of the Offence\nAs this Court has repeatedly affirmed, mandatory minimum sentences are more vulnerable constitutionally where they apply to a wide range of circumstances (Nur, at paras. 81-82; Lloyd, at paras. 3, 24, 27 and 35-36). The wider the scope of the offence subject to the minimum sentence, the more likely there is a circumstance where the minimum will impose a lengthy term of imprisonment on conduct that involves little risk to the public and little moral fault (Hills, at para. 125; Nur, at para. 83). Thus, a court should consider the variation in the offences gravity and the culpability involved and consider whether the sentence captures conduct that does not merit the mandatory minimum.\nHere, the robbery offence does not cast too broad of a net as to capture conduct that carries low moral fault or little risk to public safety. The gravity of the offence and the culpability of offenders convicted of it is relatively high. To start, even when committed without a firearm, robbery is a serious offence based on the requisite actus reus of the use or threat of violence or force in stealing or attempting to steal property. Adding a firearm to the equation simply increases the gravity of the offence. Further, mere possession of the firearm is not sufficient for conviction. The offender must use the firearm in the commission of the offence. As this Court wrote in R. v. Felawka, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 199, when a firearm is used to threaten or intimidate, it presents the ultimate threat of death to those in its presence (p. 211). Prohibited firearms are among the most potent tools in the commission of crime. For example, sawed-off rifles are capable of deadly force, while being easier to conceal, transport, and maneuver in close quarters, like convenience stores.\nThe harmful consequences of using a restricted or prohibited firearm in a robbery are readily identified. There is the risk of death or life-altering physical injury for victims and bystanders if the weapon is discharged. Even if the weapon is not fired, exposure to this threat carries the risk of profound psychological harm. It can be expected that store clerks who are victims of offences like the one perpetrated by Mr. Hilbach will suffer psychological harm. In R. v. Al-Isawi, 2017 BCCA 163, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 524, the accused used an imitation firearm to rob 10 small pharmacies and was convicted of 10 counts of robbery pursuant to s. 85(2) of the Criminal Code. Five of the victims reported feelings of hypervigilance, trauma and fear for their personal safety (para. 29). Beyond the immediate threats to victims, there are wider risks to the community. Wielding a firearm in a store can reasonably provoke force in response, either by police responding to the robbery in progress or bystanders who attempt to intervene. The risk of escalating violence is, as a result, acute.\nThe use of an unloaded prohibited firearm does not substantially reduce the offences gravity. The presence of a firearm, even an unloaded one, in and of itself creates a highly volatile and dangerous situation (Al-Isawi, at para. 57 (emphasis in original)). A loaded firearm can easily be mistaken for an unloaded firearm, not least by the offenders themselves. A sentencing discount for wielding unloaded firearms also overlooks the very real risk of an offender accidentally discharging a firearm the offender believed was unloaded. It also, for practical reasons, overlooks the difficulty of proving whether or not a firearm was loaded, even if the firearm in use was recovered. Moreover, an unloaded firearm is used for the same reason as a loaded firearm: to instill the ultimate threat of death to those in its presence (Felawka, at p. 211). Victims of robbery offences do not know whether the firearm is loaded or unloaded. The same is true for bystanders or police responding to robberies (R. v. Stewart, 2010 BCCA 153, 253 C.C.C. (3d) 301, at para. 37; R. v. Uniat, 2015 ONCA 197, at para. 5 (CanLII)). Regardless of whether the firearm is capable of deadly force at the time of the offence, [t]he use of a firearm in the commission of a crime exacerbates its terrorizing effects, whether the firearm is real or a mere imitation. Indeed, they share that very purpose (Steele, at para. 23). The psychological trauma involved in a robbery with an unloaded firearm is therefore comparable to a robbery with a loaded one (R. v. Breese, 2021 ONSC 1611, at para. 34 (CanLII); R. v. John, 2016 ONSC 396, at para. 27 (CanLII); R. v. Stoddart, [2005] O.J. No. 6076 (QL), 2005 CarswellOnt 6523 (WL) (S.C.J.), at para. 6, affd 2007 ONCA 139, 221 O.A.C. 108; R. v. Asif, 2020 ONSC 1403, at para. 40 (CanLII); R. v. Charley, 2019 ONSC 6490, at para. 45 (CanLII)). So too is the risk of escalating violence.\nThe mental elements required for the minimum to apply suggest a relatively high degree of culpability. An offender who commits robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm must intend to steal and intend to use violence or force (or the threat thereof). A conscious choice must be made to employ violence or force. For the mandatory minimum sentence to apply, that choice extends to the decision to use a particular firearm to commit the offence  the offender must intend to employ the weapon. The offence does not involve an inadvertent decision to put public safety at risk but a conscious choice to put another persons safety at great risk.\nThere is some breadth to the offence. At the high end of the spectrum, s. 344(1)(a) captures, for example, offenders who organize elaborate, coordinated robberies on large institutions using automatic weaponry and cause serious injuries or death. On the low end of the spectrum, the section captures individuals like Mr. Hilbach, conducting unsophisticated hits on gas stations using unloaded prohibited firearms. This range in gravity and levels of culpability are appropriately reflected in differing sentencing outcomes above the minimum. However, the thread that connects each case is the intent to both steal and to benefit from the deep terror that comes with the threat of a firearm at a proximate range. In each case, the offender uses a firearm to induce fear for their victim in service of their own benefit. While the individual circumstances of the accused and the motivations for their conduct vary, these two elements remain constant. It is this specificity of conduct that Justice Proulx referred to in Lapierre, which aggravates the offence and subjects offenders to this minimum (p. 344).\nUnlike the hypotheticals considered in Nur, individuals who offend s. 344(1)(a) commit true crime[s] (R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677, 117 O.R. (3d) 401, at paras. 205-6, affd 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773). It is not the case that the offence involves little or no moral fault and little or no danger to the public (Nur, at paras. 82-83). Individuals found guilty under this section are not akin to the hypothetical proffered in Smith, of a young person caught with their first joint of grass on their way home to Canada (p. 1053). Unlike the hypothetical scenario relied upon to invalidate the provision at issue in Hills  namely, a situation involving a young person using a paintball gun that could not perforate the wall of a typical residence  there is no removing the immediacy of personal threat that is inherent to the offence. The nature and scope of the offence requires the presence of victims. Indeed, there are two real victims of Mr. Hilbachs offence. For this reason, it has not been demonstrated that this mandatory minimum is so wide that it extends to circumstances that pose relatively little risk of harm (as in Smith, Nur, Lloyd or Hills).\nThe Effects of the Penalty on the Offender\nThe second component requires courts to consider the effects of the mandatory penalty on the particular offender. If it inflicts mental pain and suffering on an offender through degrading and dehumanizing treatment or punishment, the punishment is constitutionally vulnerable to the extent that the offenders dignity is undermined (Hills, at para. 133; Quebec (Attorney General) v. 9147-0732 Quebec inc., 2020 SCC 32, at para. 51).\nIn assessing the effects  and therefore the impact  that flow from the prescribed sentence on the actual or hypothetical offender, a court should consider the additional years of imprisonment imposed by the mandatory minimum sentence. Section 12, however, involves a contextual analysis and there is no hard number above or below which a sentence becomes grossly disproportionate. A court may consider the conditions experienced by the offender in serving the mandatory sentence, including whether the mandatory minimum sentence substitutes imprisonment for a probationary sentence, as well as any characteristics or circumstances that enhance the severity of the punishment in the offenders case (Hills, at para. 133). It bears repeating that the focus is on the sentence, not the possible availability of parole into the assessment of a minimums effects (Hills, at para. 104, citing Bissonnette, at paras. 37 and 41, and Nur, at para. 98).\nThe sentencing judge identified two significant effects. At five years, the mandatory minimum sentence was more than double a fit and proportionate sentence. The sentence was also qualitatively worse, given it was to be served in a penitentiary.\nI accept the sentencing judges conclusion that the effects of the five-year mandatory minimum sentence are severe in Mr. Hilbachs case. A five-year term of imprisonment would have detrimental implications for Mr. Hilbachs rehabilitation, given the sentencing judges finding that a penitentiary term increased the likelihood that Mr. Hilbach would re-entrench in gang involvement. It is reasonable in this case to conclude that a five-year mandatory minimum sentence is relatively more severe and, like many Indigenous offenders, Mr. Hilbach would serve harder time as a result (Gladue, at para. 68). Indigenous offenders are more severely affected by incarceration and are often treated in discriminatory ways in custodial environments. Indigenous people are more likely to experience use-of-force incidents in federal penitentiaries and are provided limited access to culturally appropriate programming (Office of the Correctional Investigator, Annual Report 2021-2022 (2022)). Further, incarceration itself is often a culturally inappropriate consequence for wrongdoing for Indigenous offenders (Gladue, at para. 68).\nThese considerations ultimately support the conclusion that a fit and proportionate sentence would fall below the mandatory minimum sentence, notwithstanding the serious violence involved in his offence. Assessed from a purely quantitative standpoint, additional imprisonment beyond a fit and proportionate sentence is not negligible. Indeed, this Court in Lloyd struck down a mandatory minimum sentence of one years imprisonment (para. 6). No one would reasonably volunteer for an extra year or two years in jail beyond what a judge considers just as such additional periods of incarceration will result in significant hardship for an offender and their loved ones. These effects must therefore carry significant weight.\nThe Penalty and Its Objectives\nIn this component, courts must first consider which sentencing objectives Parliament prioritized in enacting the mandatory minimum penalty and, second, assess whether the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its objectives (Hills, at para. 138). Denunciation and deterrence are established sentencing principles that Parliament may use to demonstrate the states disapproval of serious offences (Hills, at para. 139). While forms of punishment that completely disregard rehabilitation are incompatible with human dignity and violate s. 12 (Bissonnette, at para. 85), no single sentencing objective can be applied to the exclusion of all others (Nasogaluak, at para. 43).\nSo long as Parliament does not completely exclude rehabilitation from its calculus, the legislature may justifiably prioritize some objectives, like denunciation and deterrence, over others in enacting a minimum sentence. Denunciatory sentences express a collective statement that the offenders conduct should be punished for encroaching on our societys basic code of values (R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 81). Where the consequences of the offences clearly offend Canadians basic code of values and call for strong condemnation, this Court has afforded Parliament greater deference in enacting a mandatory minimum sentence that prioritizes denunciation (Hills, at para. 139, citing Morrisey, at para. 47). The need for denunciation is closely tied to the gravity of the offence (Hills, at para. 139, citing Ipeelee, at para. 37). Likewise, while deterrence cannot prevent a mandatory minimum sentence from being cruel and unusual on its own, it can support a sentence which is more severe while still within the range of punishments that are not cruel and unusual (Morrisey, at para. 45).\nThat said, deterrence and denunciation cannot be prioritized at all costs. Such an approach would justify sentences of unlimited length (Hills, at para. 140). Consequently, in assessing the mandatory minimum sentences valid penal purpose and its respect for sentencing objectives, a court should consider the extent to which the impugned sentence adheres to principles of proportionality and parity (Hills, at para. 145).\nParity requires that a sentence be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances (s. 718.2(b)). Sentencing ranges and starting points are useful tools in assessing proportionality and parity as they reflect judicial consensus on an offences gravity and help reduce substantial disparities in sentencing (R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 20, citing R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 2). Mandatory minimum sentences, as well as the range of sentences set out by Parliament, for similar offences may also assist in this inquiry.\nIn this case, the sentencing judge recognized that while deterrence and denunciation were important considerations, the mandatory minimum sentence put far too great an emphasis on these goals over rehabilitation and Gladue considerations. The Court of Appeal majority agreed, drawing an analogy to mandatory victim surcharges in Boudreault.\nBoth the sentencing judge and the Court of Appeal majority erred in concluding there was no valid penal purpose in this case. Mandatory minimum sentences, by their nature, emphasize deterrence, denunciation, and retribution over rehabilitation and other sentencing purposes (Nur, at para. 44). The question, therefore, is not simply whether the minimum sentence prioritizes these purposes. Instead, a court should consider whether the extent to which Parliament chose to prioritize denunciation and deterrence in setting the penalty is justified. In Mr. Hilbachs case, Parliaments decision to prioritize denunciation and deterrence is justifiable.\nAs noted, the need for denunciation is closely tied to the gravity of the offence and the need to communicate our societys condemnation of acts that infringe our basic moral values (M. (C.A.), at para. 81; Ipeelee, at para. 37). Parliament is afforded deference in enacting denunciatory mandatory minimums where conduct, like robbing an individual at gunpoint, clearly offends our most basic values.\nIn this case, the mandatory minimum sentence captures conduct that clearly warrants deterrence and the strong denunciation that a substantial prison sentence signals. As the sentencing judge acknowledged, denunciation and deterrence were important considerations in Mr. Hilbachs case, given the gravity of the offence (para. 20). The use of a restricted or prohibited firearm in a robbery poses grave risk to public safety. As this Court wrote in Morrisey, Parliament is entitled to enact mandatory minimum sentences that signal that a disregard for the life and safety of others in handling firearms is simply not acceptable (para. 47 (emphasis in original)). The mandatory minimum sentence therefore applies to a category of conduct that calls for strong condemnation.\nGeneral deterrence also has a role here. As this Court recognized in Morrisey, [i]t cannot be disputed that there is a need for general deterrence when a person endangers the safety of others in wielding a firearm (para. 46). Like the mandatory minimum sentence in that case, this minimum sentence dictates that those who pick up a gun must exercise care when handling it (Morrisey, at para. 46). While Smith notes there may be little need to punish the small offender in order to deter the serious offender (at p. 1080), there are no small offenders in the way this Court conceived in Nur, Smith, and Lloyd. Mr. Hilbachs actions, for example, are precisely the conduct that Parliament sought to deter. Consequently, short of cruel and unusual punishment, general deterrence can support a sentence which is more severe while still within the range of punishments that are not cruel and unusual (Morrisey, at para. 45; Nur, at para. 45).\nMy conclusion that Parliament was entitled to prioritize deterrence and denunciation here is consistent with the sentencing jurisprudence on robbery, which bears out the importance of these purposes in sentencing for this offence (C. C. Ruby, Sentencing (10th ed. 2020), at 23.494). It is also compatible with the greater emphasis on these purposes by courts in sentencing where a firearm is used to commit acts of interpersonal violence (see, e.g., R. v. Jones, 2012 ONCA 609, at para. 12 (CanLII); R. v. Maytwayashing, 2018 MBCA 36, at para. 40 (CanLII); R. v. Agin, 2018 BCCA 133, 361 C.C.C. (3d) 258, at para. 67; R. v. D. (Q.) (2005), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 78; R. v. Marshall, 2015 ONCA 692, 340 O.A.C. 201, at para. 49; R. v. Bellissimo, 2009 ONCA 49, at para. 5 (CanLII); R. v. Brown, 2010 ONCA 745, 277 O.A.C. 233, at paras. 13-14). In this context, courts have emphasized the need for denunciation and deterrence both to convey our societys abhorrence of gun violence and to communicate to potential offenders that a significant sentence accompanies the use of a gun to commit violence (D. (Q.), at paras. 77-78; Jones, at para. 12; R. v. Mark, 2018 ONSC 447, at para. 24 (CanLII); R. v. Thavakularatnam, 2018 ONSC 2380, at para. 21 (CanLII)).\nIn the case of offenders like Mr. Hilbach, with reduced moral culpability due to, for example, developmental delays or a substance use disorder, the five-year mandatory minimum may exceed what is necessary to achieve Parliaments sentencing objectives (Hills, at para. 138). In Mr. Hilbachs case, a five-year minimum term in custody is a harsh punishment considering his personal circumstances.\nNevertheless, the sentencing judge overlooked that this case is distinguishable from Nur, Smith and Lloyd insofar as a substantial carceral sentence is a proportionate sentence in Mr. Hilbachs case. Indeed, as noted, the defence does not challenge that three years imprisonment is a fit sentence. Thus, unlike Nur, Smith and Lloyd, the mandatory minimum sentence here does not impose a lengthy term of imprisonment, the punishment of last resort, when such a sentence would not otherwise be possible, or even common. Mandatory minimum sentences are necessarily more vulnerable when they replace a probationary sentence with lengthy prison terms. While it nevertheless remains important to compare two sentences involving long terms of imprisonment, it can be more difficult to establish gross disproportionality in this scenario than those at issue in Nur and Lloyd.\nThe mandatory minimum sentence for robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm in Mr. Hilbachs case is not totally out of sync with sentencing norms for an offence of this nature. To begin, sentences below two years imprisonment are relatively rare for robbery, which has no mandatory minimum sentence where it is committed with no weapon or a weapon other than a gun (Ruby, at 23.498). Where a weapon (other than a gun) is used in robberies of commercial establishments, as is the case here, the low end falls in the one-to-two-year range, with a mid-range between three and five years, and a high end of around eight years (Ruby, at 23.521, 23.528 and 23.532). Even without a mandatory minimum sentence, the sentencing range for robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm would skew higher, since the use of such a dangerous weapon is an aggravating factor. Thus, while a five-year mandatory minimum arguably sits above what Mr. Hilbach would receive and the low end that would likely otherwise develop, the minimum does not far exceed what is necessary for Parliament to achieve its sentencing objectives.\nThus, Mr. Hilbachs case does not show the mandatory minimum sentence departs from the principle of parity to the same extent as the minimums in Smith, Nur, Lloyd and Hills. As noted, substantial, multi-year carceral sentences are the norm for this offence. This distinguishes this case from Nur, where the mandatory minimum sentence at issue imposed three-year prison terms for what were essentially licensing infractions, a result that was totally out of sync with sentencing practices for licensing offences (para. 83). It cannot be said that, as in Nur, there is a cavernous disconnect between the mandatory minimum and Mr. Hilbachs conduct (para. 83). Given the relationship between parity and proportionality, this supports a finding that the minimum sentence in this case is not grossly disproportionate.\nMoreover, the mandatory minimum sentence here is not wholly analogous to the mandatory victim surcharges considered in Boudreault. In that case, the penal purpose of mandatory victim surcharges was to raise funds for victim services and increase the accountability of offenders to individual victims and the community generally (para. 62). Neither penal purpose was likely to be realized for impecunious or impoverished offenders, who had no funds to spare (para. 63). Here, the penal purposes associated with the mandatory minimum are not unlikely to be realized, given Mr. Hilbachs conduct is precisely what Parliament intended to denounce and deter. Moreover, proportionality and parity were compromised to a greater extent in Boudreault, since the surcharges effectively imposed indeterminate sentences on impecunious offenders, although such punishment is reserved only for Canadas worst offenders (para. 79). The minimum here is more in line with sentencing norms for an offence of this nature.\nThat said, as in Boudreault, the minimum does not advance Parliaments intention to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in prison, embodied in s. 718.2(e). Nor does it promote the objective of rehabilitation. A sentence that undermines Mr. Hilbachs ability to avoid gang life, and increases the likelihood of his recidivism as a result, does not foster rehabilitation. Though the minimum sentence may not aid Mr. Hilbachs rehabilitation, I do not find that the minimum completely disregards rehabilitation as a sentencing principle (Hills, at para. 34). Parliament has not selected a minimum punishment that prioritizes denunciation and deterrence to the exclusion of rehabilitation in Mr. Hilbachs case.\nDespite its effect viewed through the lens of s. 718.2(e), I am unable to conclude that the minimum sentence goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliaments purpose such that it fails to reflect rehabilitation entirely and undermines human dignity. As noted, Parliament was justified in prioritizing denunciation and deterrence over rehabilitation, given the nature of this offence. And while the minimum sentence departs from principles of parity and proportionality in Mr. Hilbachs case, it does not result in a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the sentencing norms for this offence.\nI reiterate that gross disproportionality is measured at a high threshold: the sentence must be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency (Hills, at para. 109, citing Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing Morrisey, at para. 26; Wiles, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072). Only on rare and unique occasions does such a label attach to a sentence as the standard is very properly stringent and demanding and intended to reflect a measure of deference to Parliament in crafting sentencing provisions (Hills, at para. 115, citing Steele v. Mountain Institution, at p. 1417). The standard of gross disproportionality under s. 12 does not require the punishment to be perfectly suited to accommodate the moral nuances of every crime and every offender (R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, at pp. 344-45). The difference between the mandatory minimum sentence and Mr. Hilbachs individual circumstances does not outrage standards of decency. Concluding that the five-year mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate in the circumstances of Mr. Hilbach would erode away the high standard at the core of this Courts s. 12 jurisprudence.\nFor these reasons, the five-year mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter. Since Mr. Hilbach does not propose any reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios where s. 344(1)(a)(i) is allegedly grossly disproportionate, I turn next to Mr. Zwozdeskys challenge to s. 344(1)(a.1).\nApplication in Mr. Zwozdeskys Case\nThe amici curiae for Mr. Zwozdesky concede that the impugned mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly disproportionate in his case. Instead, they advance five scenarios where they maintain the mandatory minimum sentence in s. 344(1)(a.1) is grossly disproportionate. The Crown maintains that several of these scenarios are not reasonably foreseeable and, in any event, they do not illustrate the minimum is grossly disproportionate. In support of its claims, the Crown relies on the same concerns it raises in Mr. Hilbachs case, pointing out the gravity of the offence and the related need for denunciation and deterrence.\nThe scenarios advanced by the amici raise circumstances not addressed in Mr. Hilbachs case, including party liability, unplanned or impulsive robberies, and the use of air-powered firearms. While these circumstances introduce a degree of reduced gravity and culpability compared to Mr. Hilbachs case, they are insufficient to establish that s. 344(1)(a.1) is grossly disproportionate. Parliament could justifiably prioritize deterrence and denunciation in these circumstances as well and, as in Mr. Hilbachs case, they do not show four years imprisonment for robbery with a firearm is totally out of sync with sentencing norms. I begin with the scenarios advanced by Mr. Zwozdeskys amici.\nWhat Reasonably Foreseeable Scenarios Involve the Impugned Mandatory Minimum Sentence Provision?\nThe amici raise five detailed scenarios where the mandatory minimum is allegedly grossly disproportionate. In each scenario, the offender pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm. The scenarios are as follows:\nEric, a knuckleheaded 18-year-old hunter, confronts two other hunters skinning a deer on his land, whom he suspects of poaching based on town gossip about one of the hunters. The trespassers have tags for the deer. Eric raises his rifle at the hunters but does not directly point it at the two. The two hunters opt to leave the deer, and Eric finishes skinning the deer and takes it home.\nDanielle, a 19-year-old street youth with a drug addiction, is trafficked in sex work by her boyfriend. Her boyfriend carries a gun, which she knows as he has recently used it to threaten her. They decide to shoplift cheese and razors from a grocery store. When stopped by a security guard, Danielle shouts, Out of our way  hes got a gun! The gun is not produced, but police find the weapon in her boyfriends waistband when the pair are later arrested.\nChahid, a 19-year-old youth and refugee from a war-torn country, has learning difficulties and post-traumatic stress disorder. On a walk, his friend approaches two people at a bus stop, flashes a handgun in his waistband and demands their cellphone, which they turn over. Chahid was unaware his friend had a gun before this moment and unaware that his friend planned a robbery. Nevertheless, he keeps a nervous lookout. As it happens, the police are nearby and move to intercede. Chahid tells his friend to run, but the two are arrested. At sentencing, Chahid has completed high school, entered a post-secondary trade program, and supports himself with manual labour. A sentence above six months would place him at risk of deportation. He pleads guilty as a party to the offence.\nBrian, a 21-year-old Indigenous man, suffers from alcoholism and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, is extremely intoxicated and face down in a snowbank when a good Samaritan stops to help him. He grabs the woman, reaches into his waistband, flashes a BB gun, and snatches her purse. The BB gun is operable and capable of taking an eyeball out, but it is unloaded.\nAdam, a 26-year-old Indigenous man, suffers from a drug addiction and schizophrenia, and had a short criminal record. When meeting his drug dealer in a parking lot, he produces an airsoft pistol, points it at his dealer, and takes some methamphetamines. Before sentencing, he receives treatment for schizophrenia and his drug addiction.\nOf the five, the Court of Appeal majority concluded that Adam and Brian were reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios for the purposes of a s. 12 analysis and the others were not. I agree. Brian is based on a real offender, the facts of which are reported in R. v. Smart, 2014 ABPC 175, 595 A.R. 266. As for Adam, the robbery of a drug dealer is a reasonably foreseeable scenario. That this offence would be committed by someone suffering mental health and addiction challenges is clearly foreseeable. While an air-powered pistol may be a relatively uncommon firearm to use for this offence, they are undoubtedly used in robberies (see, for instance, R. v. Lodoen, heard together with the appeal in Johnas).\nThe scenarios involving Eric, Danielle and Chahid do not qualify as reasonable hypotheticals. As their name suggests, reasonably foreseeable scenarios are situations that may reasonably be expected to arise as a matter of common sense and judicial experience (Nur, at para. 74). The following are characteristics of a reasonable hypothetical as outlined in Hills, at para. 77:\nThe hypothetical must be reasonably foreseeable;\n\nReported cases may be considered in the analysis;\n\nThe hypothetical must be reasonable in view of the range of conduct in the offence in question;\n\nPersonal characteristics may be considered as long as they are not tailored to create remote or far-fetched examples; and\n\nReasonable hypotheticals are best tested through the adversarial process.\nAs this Court reiterated in Hills, reasonable hypothetical scenarios ought not to be far-fetched or marginally imaginable cases, nor should they be remote or extreme examples (Hills, at para. 78, citing Morrisey, at para. 30, citing Goltz, at pp. 506 and 515). Personal characteristics such as age, Indigeneity, mental health issues, and addiction are potentially relevant as they are common to offenders in Canadian courtrooms. However, such characteristics ought not be used to construct the most sympathetic offender imaginable (Hills, at para. 91; Nur, at para. 75). Common sense and judicial experience counsels that offenders with only mitigating personal characteristics are rare, and it is even more improbable to see such offenders in the most unlikely scenarios falling within the scope of an offence. Stacking mitigating factors and stretching every constituent element of an offence produces a hypothetical scenario that is fanciful and not reasonably foreseeable (Hills, at para. 91). A court is not obliged to address every hypothetical presented by counsel if it finds that some do not qualify as reasonably foreseeable scenarios.\nWhile technically within the scope of s. 344(1)(a.1), Erics scenario is far-fetched and marginal. Chahid barely satisfies the criteria of an aider or abettor under s. 21(1) of the Criminal Code and stretches the constituent elements of the offence (R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC 13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 18). The scenario involves conduct that would likely fall outside the ambit of the provision. This Court in Hills found that while the scope of the offence may be tested to explore the breadth of the offence, straining every constituent element of the offence is not helpful (para. 83). The scenarios involving Danielle and Chahid stack multiple mitigating personal characteristics alongside the most marginal iterations of the offence to construct the most sympathetic offender imaginable. These hypotheticals may serve to demonstrate more about the imagination of counsel than the true scope of the provision (Hills, at para. 83). There is little use in evaluating the impugned provision based on outlandish scenarios on the theory that the imagined scenarios may happen one day. Therefore, the scenarios involving Eric, Danielle and Chahid are not reasonably foreseeable.\nThe majority also concluded two hypotheticals drawn from reported decisions, R. v. Link, 2012 MBPC 25, 276 Man. R. (2d) 157, and Lodoen, were reasonably foreseeable. Both cases dealt with youthful offenders involved in convenience store robberies. Link concerned an 18-year-old Indigenous woman, who pled guilty as a party to a convenience store robbery where the principal used an imitation firearm (paras. 1 and 7-22). The offender in Lodoen was an 18-year-old youthful offender who used a BB gun in the commission of a robbery and pled guilty (Johnas, at para. 68). Neither Link nor Lodoen involved the minimum sentence at issue here. I accept they are foreseeable, provided they are modified to fit within the scope of the minimum sentences.\nTwo Years to Two and a Half Years Imprisonment Is a Fit and Proportionate Sentence in Reasonably Foreseeable Scenarios\nThis leads me to the fit and proportionate sentences for Adam, Brian and the offenders in the scenarios based on Link and Lodoen. The Court of Appeal majority concluded that a fit and proportionate sentence for the reasonably foreseeable scenarios identified above would be around two years imprisonment (para. 70). Neither the Crown nor the defence challenge the majoritys conclusion on this point. I, too, see no basis to interfere.\nAdams and Brians offences involved street muggings, an offence with a sentencing range around 12 to 18 months. Evidently, the use of a weapon and, in particular, a firearm is an aggravating factor in each case. Brians offence also involved the application of force to the victim, while Adams involved a greater degree of planning and a prior criminal record. In Adams case, as well, there is the serious public safety risk involved in using a firearm to settle a drug dispute, a consideration that supports a significant sentence (R. v. Delchev, 2014 ONCA 448, 323 O.A.C. 19, at para. 20). This could support sentences significantly above this range. Nevertheless, the moral blameworthiness of both offenders is attenuated given the mental health and addiction issues that underlay their actions, as well as any applicable Gladue considerations. I therefore agree a sentence around two years would be fit and proportionate in these cases.\nScenarios based on Link and Lodoen would similarly support sentences around 18 months to 2 years imprisonment. They are each convenience store robberies involving young, first-time offenders, so the three-year starting point from Johnas applies. While the offender in Link received a conditional sentence of 18 months, the offence involved an imitation firearm (para. 120). Further, the sentencing judge concluded she had no fault in using the firearm, as she was shocked and surprised when a gun was produced (para. 117). A carceral sentence would therefore be warranted had Ms. Link gone into the robbery knowing a real firearm would be used. Lodoen resulted in a sentence of 18 months (para. 70). Assuming the gun meets the definition of a firearm, a sentence above 18 months may be warranted, given it is an aggravating factor. Thus, a sentence in around 18 months to 2 years would be appropriate.\nThe Mandatory Minimum Is Not Grossly Disproportionate in Reasonably Foreseeable Scenarios\nThe Court of Appeal majority concluded s. 344(1)(a.1) was grossly disproportionate in Adams and Brians cases, as well as in scenarios similar to Link and Lodoen, noting the minimum sentence resulted in roughly more than double a fit and proportionate sentence. In my view, the majority is in error. As with s. 344(1)(a)(i), having regard to (1) the scope and reach of the offence, (2) the effects of the penalty on the offender and (3) the penalty and its objectives, the four-year mandatory minimum for robbery does not outrage standards of decency.\nRegarding the scope and reach of the offence, as in Mr. Hilbachs case, the scenarios raised here do not demonstrate the mandatory minimum sentence casts too broad of a net and captures offenders with low culpability. Mr. Zwozdesky advances three main factors that render these scenarios relatively less severe compared to Mr. Hilbachs case: they involve air-powered pistols, they are unplanned (as in Brians case), and they involve a party to the offence (as in Ms. Links case). None of these considerations, in my opinion, establishes the minimum is so wide it applies in circumstances involving little fault and little danger.\nProvincial appellate courts have repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences for robbery, even in the face of sympathetic accused, because the offences mens rea and actus reus apply to a relatively narrow set of violent behaviours, and conviction requires a deliberate and specific act with a defined harm (Hills, at para. 131; R. v. McIntyre, 2019 ONCA 161, 429 C.R.R. (2d) 346; McIvor; Lapierre; R. v. Wust (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 43 (B.C.C.A.); McDonald; R. v. Bernarde, 2018 NWTCA 7). Further, in McDonald, Justice Rosenberg found a four-year sentence would likely be a manifestly unfit sentence for the accused on an appellate review standard. However, the sentence did not reach the high threshold of being grossly disproportionate as it was open to Parliament to legislate harsh punishments for firearm offences. Considering the objective gravity of the offence, Justice Rosenberg found a four-year prison sentence did not shock the conscience or outrage standards of decency (pp. 666 and 669).\nRobbery constitutes a grave offence even when committed without a weapon, given the offence involves the use or threat of violence in stealing property. Moreover, each of the scenarios involves the use of a firearm. As discussed above, firearm in this context encompasses ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns subject to the Firearms Acts licensing regime to barrelled devices that can be purchased without a licence, such as air-powered weapons like BB guns and airsoft pistols. Nevertheless, to qualify as a firearm, at bottom, these devices must be capable of inflicting serious bodily injury, such as rupturing a persons eye. As I noted in Mr. Hilbachs case, the use of a firearm presents the ultimate threat of death to those in its presence (Felawka, at p. 211). That is equally true where an ordinary firearm is used, such as a hunting rifle and shotgun. While an air-powered rifle may be incapable of inflicting a fatal injury, an offender who uses such a device to intimidate exploits the fear that conventional firearms provoke and, at the very least, threatens to inflict life-altering injury. I am not satisfied that since the minimum sentence applies where an offender merely uses a firearm, as opposed to a restricted or prohibited one, there is little risk to public safety. \nIt is important to consider the offence from the standpoint of the victims in the scenarios raised by Mr. Zwozdesky. Here, there is always a person placed at serious risk of injury, regardless of whether a conventional or air-powered firearm is used. For victims, there remains the risk of life-altering physical injury when air-powered firearms are used in the course of a robbery, a risk that is not present with imitation firearms. Further, the risk of psychological trauma arising from the use of an air-powered rifle remains similar to that of a conventional firearm. As the British Columbia Court of Appeal found in Al-Isawi, whether an offender uses a real or imitation firearm does not impact the harm to the victim who would not know the difference (para. 39). I am not persuaded that victims of a robbery, like the ones in Adams and Brians cases, will ordinarily have the presence of mind to distinguish between an air-powered rifle and a conventional one, any more than they can differentiate between a loaded or unloaded shotgun. There is, as a result, the risk of escalating violence, as such an apparent deadly threat risks a dangerous response from bystanders and police responding to an incident. From the standpoint of public safety, as a result, there is not a dramatic difference between robbing a person with a conventional firearm and an air-powered firearm.\nThe ever-present threat to victims and public safety distinguishes this offence from the one at issue in Hills. An essential element of robbery with or without the use of a firearm is the use of actual violence or the threat of violence to a person in the commission of the offence. There is an immediacy to the threat that distinguishes the offence from the hypothetical scenario raised in Hills. The offender must intend to strike fear in the heart of his victim. The offender chose to use a firearm, knowing that he may gain a material benefit due to the universal fear that firearms invoke for the public. In assessing the gravity of the offence, the threat to victims and the public in these scenarios cannot be downplayed or overlooked.\nMoreover, the culpability central to this offence does not profoundly differ from that of s. 344(1)(a)(i) and is consistent for all individuals charged under the offence. In order for s. 344(1)(a.1) to apply, an offender must intend to steal and intend to use violence or force (or the threat thereof). The offender must also intend to use the firearm. As a result, a conscious choice must be made to threaten a persons safety using a firearm. That is true whether or not the offence is perpetrated using a conventional or air-powered firearm. Like Mr. Hilbachs case, while there are undoubtedly mitigating personal circumstances that reduce an offenders culpability in Mr. Zwozdeskys scenarios, there remains an essential degree of fault arising from the choice to threaten the safety of others.\nMr. Zwozdesky nevertheless raises the possibility that parties to the offence may have reduced culpability, citing the example of Link. However, I am not persuaded that Link illustrates the notion that parties to the offence have little moral fault relative to principal offenders. The question of whether an offenders role as an aider or abettor plays a mitigating factor in sentencing is highly contextual (R. v. Overacker, 2005 ABCA 150, 367 A.R. 250, at paras. 23-26; R. v. Hennessey, 2010 ABCA 274, 490 A.R. 35, at para. 47). A sentencing discount purely because a party was an aider or abettor would go against the purpose of the party liability provisions in s. 21, which ensure an individual will bear the same responsibility for the offence regardless of which particular role he or she played (R. v. Vu, 2012 SCC 40, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 411, at para. 58 (emphasis added), citing R. v. Thatcher, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 652, at pp. 689-90). Where there is a disparity between the criminal records of the principal and the aider or abettor, or where there are aggravating circumstances, like assaultive behaviour, that apply to the principal but not the aider or abettor, then the latter offenders sentence may be lower than that of the principal (McIvor, at para. 29; R. v. Price (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 343 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 54-56). However, both are jointly responsible for the commission of the index offence. As a matter of principle and policy, finding otherwise would encourage offenders to act as aiders or abettors. Thus, the minimum sentences mere application to aiders and abettors fails to establish its constitutional infirmity.\nFor s. 344(1)(a.1) to apply, an aider or abettor under s. 21(1) must have knowledge or its equivalent in relation to the firearms use. As noted, s. 344 is modelled on s. 85 of the Criminal Code. Nothing in the wording of s. 344 implies an intention on the part of Parliament to extend its application to offenders whose culpability was less than required for a conviction under s. 85. The usual rules of complicity for parties under s. 21 apply to s. 85 (Steele, at para. 33; see also McGuigan, at pp. 307-8). Thus, in a scenario like Link, the aider must intend to assist the principal knowing (or at least wilfully blind) that the principal intended to use the firearm in committing the robbery (Briscoe, at paras. 15-18). That is to say, one must consciously choose to provide assistance to the principal with knowledge or its equivalent that a firearm is used. For this reason, the oblivious offender in Link was not subject to the minimum. When this element is made out, I am not persuaded the offender has little culpability. As a party to the offence, the aider benefits from the threat of violence that emanates from the firearm. It offers each party protection and ensures the cooperation of victims, a result that benefits the aider and abettor as much as the principal.\nMoreover, without the contribution of each party, the robbery could not be pulled off at all, a result that supports treating principals and aiders alike. As the English Court of Appeal observed,\nthere is no distinction in a crime of this kind to be drawn [in sentencing] between those who actually use the violence and those who stand outside and though not using violence are ready to drive away, to kidnap, or perform whatever other task may be appropriate. If this Court or a trial judge is dealing with a case of armed robbery of a bank at gunpoint or with iron bars, or of a security van carrying large quantities of notes to a branch of a bank, it does not normally stop to consider whether a particular prisoner actually held up the cashier or held up the guard, had a gun or had an iron bar or was the driver standing outside ready to drive away. All are equally guilty because without each playing his full part the crime could not be perpetrated.\n\n(R. v. Church (1985), 7 Cr. App. R. (S.) 370, at p. 372)\nMr. Zwozdesky also relies on the possibility of unplanned robberies. In Brians case, for instance, the intention to commit the offence was not formed until the good Samaritan attempted to offer assistance. The degree of planning behind an offence can act as an aggravating factor in sentencing. In Brians case, however, the lack of planning cannot be equated with a lack of culpability. The scenario involves the intentional use of force, snatching a purse, and threatening violence while brandishing a BB gun, which the offender opted to carry with him in public. What Brian shares with all other offenders charged under this section is that he saw the opportunity to benefit financially from another persons fear of firearms and capitalized on it. As a result, the essential element of culpability that I noted above equally applies to Brian. This scenario is, again, an instance where an offender chose to threaten the safety of others using a firearm.\nFor these reasons, Mr. Zwozdeskys scenarios do not establish s. 344(1)(a.1) applies in circumstances involving little or no danger to the public or little or no fault. I am not persuaded the distinctions between the lethality of the firearms involved, or the fact of party liability, establish dramatically different degrees of severity in the context of this offence. At bottom, in all these scenarios, in order to steal, an offender makes a conscious choice to place another person at risk of life-altering injury and significant psychological trauma. Like Mr. Hilbachs offence, they are true crime[s].\nThe effects of the penalty on the offender are severe. For Indigenous offenders, the effects have the potential to be as severe as the mandatory minimum sentence in Mr. Hilbachs case. These effects, as in Mr. Hilbachs case, are significant and can be neither ignored nor minimized. As was noted in Hills, youthful offenders are subject to bullying, are susceptible to gang recruitment and are more vulnerable to segregation placements (para. 165). A term of imprisonment can result in a more severe penalty for an accused with a mental illness than it may for others. Courts have noted that individuals may not have access to appropriate treatment while incarcerated and, for some mentally ill offenders, any period of incarceration may be extremely harmful to their mental state (R. v. Wallace (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 95 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 100; R. v. Folino (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), at paras. 29-32). The individual circumstances of the hypothetical offenders indicate the period of incarceration required under s. 344(1)(a.1) would likely result in severe detrimental effects.\nAn inquiry into the penalty and its objectives reveals the analysis for s. 344(1)(a.1) and s. 344(1)(a)(i) is similar. Parliament chose to impose the strong moral condemnation that a substantial prison sentence signals, which is reasonable given the offenders choice to put public safety at risk offends basic moral values. Greater deference to Parliaments decision to enact the mandatory minimum is therefore warranted. As in Mr. Hilbachs case, general deterrence has a role, as [i]t cannot be disputed that there is a need for general deterrence when a person endangers the safety of others in wielding a firearm (Morrisey, at para. 46). At the same time, it is true that Parliaments prioritization of general deterrence departs more seriously from sentencing norms in the case of offenders like Adam, who suffer from mental disorders, because these types of offenders are inappropriate mediums by which to discourage others (Ruby, at 5.316; R. v. Dedeckere, 2017 ONCA 799, 15 M.V.R. (7th) 177, at para. 14; R. v. Batisse, 2009 ONCA 114, 93 O.R. (3d) 643, at para. 38). Even so, ultimately the minimum is not totally out of sync with sentencing norms for this offence, given the sentencing ranges discussed for robbery above. However, as the dissent noted, the mandatory minimum is effectively double what a fit and proportionate sentence would likely be for the hypothetical offenders had the mandatory penalty not applied.\nNevertheless, as with s. 344(1)(a)(i), the disconnect between the mandatory minimum sentence and the individual circumstances of the offenders here does not render the sentence grossly disproportionate. I echo my comments that the gross disproportionality standard is a high bar that applies in rare instances. If the punishment at bar was being evaluated on the appellate standard, I would find the four-year minimum demonstrably unfit for the reasonable hypotheticals proffered by Mr. Zwozdesky. However, I am not persuaded that the mandatory minimum in this case shock[s] the conscience (Lloyd, at para. 33) or is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency (Hills, at para. 109, citing Boudreault, at para. 45; Lloyd, at para. 24, citing Morrisey, at para. 26; Wiles, at para. 4, citing Smith, at p. 1072). While the punishment is severe, the high threshold for gross disproportionality is not met here. For these reasons, I am satisfied that the four-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter.\nHaving concluded neither mandatory minimum infringes s. 12 of the Charter, it is unnecessary to address whether the infringement may be saved under s. 1.\nConclusion\nThe Crowns appeal is allowed. The mandatory minimum sentences set out in s. 344(1)(a)(i) and the former s. 344(1)(a.1) are constitutional and do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The Court of Appeals judgments on this ground are set aside. No order is necessary in respect of Mr. Zwozdeskys sentence, owing to his passing.\nIn respect of Mr. Hilbachs sentence, I am of the view that it is appropriate in this case to stay the execution of the post-appeal portion of the sentence. This was the approach taken by the Court of Appeal majority. In rare cases where appellate courts have imposed custodial sentences to comply with mandatory provisions of the Criminal Code, including mandatory minimum sentences, they have stayed the execution of the post-appeal portion of the sentence. A stay for a post-appeal sentence may be available where there is extenuating delay in the legal process, particularly at the appellate stage, through no fault of the offender (R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167; R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61; R. v. McMillan, 2016 MBCA 12, 326 Man. R. (2d) 56; R. v. Shi, 2015 ONCA 646). Given over four years have lapsed since Mr. Hilbach was sentenced, I am satisfied this is such a case.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tCote J.  \nI agree with my colleague Martin J.s disposition of the Crowns appeal. However, for the reasons outlined in my dissent in the companion appeal R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, I respectfully disagree with her new three-part test for gross disproportionality at the second stage of the established framework set out in R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, and recently affirmed in R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, at para. 63.\nApplying this established legal framework, I agree that the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by s. 344(1)(a)(i) and the former s. 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, do not meet the high threshold for cruel and unusual punishment. While they have the potential to be excessive in reasonably foreseeable cases, they are not so excessive as to outrage standards of decency (R. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at p. 1072) or shock the conscience of Canadians (R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 33). I would allow the appeal.\n\tThe following are the reasons delivered by\n\n\tKarakatsanis and Jamal JJ.  \nMandatory minimum sentences reflect Parliaments determination that a crime is so serious that it must be met with a minimum punishment, regardless of the particular circumstances of the offence or the offender. When in place, there is no judicial discretion to impose a lesser sentence. \nMandatory minimum sentences are, however, subject to scrutiny under s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees everyone the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. They are more constitutionally vulnerable when they apply to an offence that can be committed in various ways, under a broad array of circumstances, and by a wide range of people (R. v. Lloyd, 2016 SCC 13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at para. 3). Such provisions will be unconstitutional where they are, or could be on a reasonably foreseeable basis, grossly disproportionate to what would otherwise be a fit sentence in the circumstances.\nBetween this appeal and its companion case, R. v. Hills, 2023 SCC 2, three mandatory minimum sentences are at issue. We agree with the reasons of our colleague Justice Martin in Hills. Section 244.2(3)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which imposes a four-year mandatory minimum sentence on anyone convicted of intentionally discharging a firearm into or at a place, contrary to s. 244.2(1)(a), violates s. 12 of the Charter and has not been justified under s. 1.\nWe part company, however, with our colleagues conclusion on the constitutionality of the provisions at issue in this appeal: s. 344(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, which imposes a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for a first offence of robbery with a restricted or prohibited firearm; and s. 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code, which imposes a four-year mandatory minimum sentence for the offence of robbery with a firearm. We note that Parliament recently repealed s. 344(1)(a.1) (An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 2022, c. 15). \nArmed robbery is a grave offence that typically warrants a penitentiary sentence. But in our view, the mandatory minimum sentences under both provisions cast an unconstitutionally wide net, capturing reasonably foreseeable cases for which the mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly disproportionate. For these cases, the mandatory minimum sentences are so excessive as to outrage standards of decency (Lloyd, at paras. 24 and 87, citing Miller v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 680, at p. 688, per Laskin C.J.), violating the constitutional guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment under s. 12 of the Charter. They cannot be saved under s. 1, and therefore should be declared of no force and effect.\nWe would, accordingly, dismiss the Crowns appeal.\nBackground\nOcean William Storm Hilbach\nMr. Hilbach is an Indigenous man from the Ermineskin Cree Nation. Nineteen years old and without the money to travel from the city to his reserve, he and his 13-year-old accomplice robbed a convenience store with an unloaded sawed-off rifle. Mr. Hilbach covered his face with his shirt and pointed the gun at two store clerks, demanding cash. His accomplice punched one of the store clerks, and kicked the other. They fled with $290 in lottery tickets and were apprehended soon afterwards.\nMr. Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery while using a prohibited or restricted weapon (s. 344(1)(a)) and possession of a firearm while prohibited (s. 117.01(1)). The sentencing judge held that a fit and proper sentence for Mr. Hilbach was two years less a day. He concluded that the five-year mandatory minimum sentence under s. 344(1)(a)(i) was grossly disproportionate to Mr. Hilbachs circumstances, contrary to s. 12 of the Charter, because it was more than double the length of a fit sentence and it would be served in a federal rather than provincial institution. Accordingly, he declared the provision of no force and effect (2018 ABQB 526, 75 Alta. L.R. (6th) 359).\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the Crowns appeal in part. It held that the sentence imposed on Mr. Hilbach was unfit and substituted a sentence of three years for the robbery charge. But the court still concluded that the five-year mandatory minimum sentence would be grossly disproportionate for Mr. Hilbach, breaching s. 12. It could not be saved under s. 1 and was thus declared of no force and effect (2020 ABCA 332, 14 Alta. L.R. (7th) 245).\nCurtis Zwozdesky\nAt the time of the offence, Mr. Zwozdesky was 53 years old, unemployed, and struggling with drug addiction. He was the getaway driver for two robberies of rural convenience stores in Alberta. During the first robbery, he went inside the convenience store before returning to his car. Shortly after, his accomplices went inside with a modified shotgun. An accomplice pointed the gun at the clerk, demanded she fill a bag with money, and fired the shotgun into a shelf. No one was injured. The next robbery occurred a week later. Mr. Zwozdesky waited in the car as the two principal offenders went inside the store, brandished a shotgun, and sprayed a clerk with pepper spray before leaving, cash and cigarettes in hand.\nMr. Zwozdesky confessed to the police and entered a guilty plea to one count of robbery with a firearm (s. 344(1)(a.1)), and one count of robbery simpliciter (s. 344(1)(b)).\nThe sentencing judge concluded that the four-year sentence mandated by s. 344(1)(a.1) would not be grossly disproportionate for Mr. Zwozdesky. However, in considering other reasonably foreseeable applications of the law, she observed that armed robbery can occur in a wide variety of circumstances, including by youthful offenders acting impulsively, offenders with mental health issues, and offenders who played a more peripheral role in the offence. Reasoning that the mandatory minimum sentence could constitute cruel and unusual punishment for reasonably foreseeable offenders, and that it could not be saved under s. 1, she declared s. 344(1)(a.1) of no force and effect (2019 ABQB 322, 95 Alta. L.R. (6th) 386).\nThe majority of the Court of Appeal agreed that s. 344(1)(a.1) could result in grossly disproportionate punishments and dismissed the Crowns appeal.\nAnalysis\nMr. Hilbach challenged the mandatory five-year sentence for robbery with a prohibited or restricted firearm (s. 344(1)(a)(i)), while Mr. Zwozdesky challenged the mandatory four-year sentence for robbery with a non-restricted firearm (s. 344(1)(a.1)). In our view, both provisions violate s. 12 of the Charter. In evaluating whether a mandatory minimum sentence infringes s. 12 of the Charter, a court engages in a two-step inquiry (Hills, at para. 40). \nFirst, the court must determine what constitutes a proportionate sentence for the offence having regard to the objectives and principles of sentencing in the Criminal Code, including the fundamental principle of sentencing under s. 718.1: A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. In assessing an offences gravity, courts may consider the consequences of the offenders actions on victims and public safety, the harm caused by the offence, and, in some cases, the offenders motivations (Hills, at para. 58). In assessing the degree of responsibility of the offender, a court should gauge the essential substantive elements of the offence including the offences mens rea, the offenders conduct in the commission of the offence, the offenders motive for committing the offence, and aspects of the offenders background that increase or decrease the offenders individual responsibility for the crime, including the offenders personal circumstances and mental capacity (Hills, at para. 58, citing R. v. Hamilton (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 91; R. v. Boudreault, 2018 SCC 58, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 599, at para. 68; R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 73).\nSecond, the court must ask whether the mandatory minimum requires the judge to impose a sentence that is grossly disproportionate to the otherwise fit sentence. In considering whether the mandatory minimum sentence is grossly disproportionate, a court must assess three crucial components: (1) the scope and reach of the offence; (2) the effects on the offender, both generally and based on their specific characteristics and qualities; and (3) the penalty and the balance struck by its objectives (Hills, at paras. 122-38).\nIf the court concludes that a sentence is not grossly disproportionate for the offender in question, the court must then consider whether it would be grossly disproportionate in other reasonably foreseeable cases (R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 773, at para. 65).\nIn applying this framework, neither s. 344(1)(a)(i) nor s. 344(1)(a.1) pass constitutional scrutiny. The sentencing judge correctly considered the facts, case law, and relevant sentencing objectives to determine that two years less a day was a fit and proportionate sentence in Mr. Hilbachs circumstances. This determination is owed deference. In assessing a fit sentence, courts must not indiscriminately adhere to starting points, completely eliminate the prospect of rehabilitation, or distort the gravity of the offence by dismissing relevant facts (such as whether a firearm was loaded). Moreover, whether a fit sentence is two years or  as our colleague concludes  three years, a sentence that is double or nearly double a fit sentence is grossly disproportionate in violation of s. 12 of the Charter. \nThe mandatory minimum sentence under s. 344(1)(a.1) is also grossly disproportionate. It is unconstitutionally broad and foreseeably applies to a wide range of situations, including those where the offender may be young, substance dependent, assisting the principal offender, or using a firearm like a BB gun. Applying the mandatory minimum sentence in some of these situations would be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency and thus would be unconstitutional (see Lloyd, at paras. 24 and 87).\nNeither provision can be saved under s. 1.\nWe address each provision in turn.\nSection 344(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code\nSection 344(1)(a)(i) applies when the offender commits robbery using a restricted or prohibited firearm. This appeal raises the question of whether the five-year sentence is grossly disproportionate for Mr. Hilbach or another reasonably foreseeable offender. We agree with both courts below and conclude that it would be for Mr. Hilbach. It is therefore unnecessary to consider other reasonably foreseeable applications of the law.\nWe turn, then, to address a fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach. Although both courts below agreed that a mandatory five-year sentence was grossly disproportionate in light of the fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach, they disagreed on what would be a fit sentence. The sentencing judge concluded two years less a day was fit, with reference to the three-year starting point for convenience store robberies in R. v. Johnas (1982), 41 A.R. 183 (C.A.), at para. 19; while the Court of Appeal concluded that three years was fit, placing more emphasis on denunciation and deterrence. As we will explain, we see no reason to disturb the sentencing judges assessment.\nThe seriousness of the crime is evident from the circumstances, a fact not lost on the sentencing judge. He noted that Mr. Hilbach committed a serious violent offence with the potential for great harm, which would have a lasting impact on the victims and the community more broadly (para. 9). He also recognized that Mr. Hilbachs prior criminal record and the breaches of his probation and firearm prohibition were serious aggravating factors on his sentence (paras. 10 and 12-13). These features made denunciation and deterrence important considerations (para. 20).\nThe sentencing judge balanced these considerations against Mr. Hilbachs tragic personal circumstances. Abandoned by his parents as an infant, Mr. Hilbach was raised by his paternal grandparents, both residential school survivors. His childhood and adolescence were marked by poverty, a fractured family unit, physical abuse, and substance dependency. These circumstances shaped Mr. Hilbachs course in life, and this crime was no different. For instance, Mr. Hilbachs conduct was driven by poverty  he needed money to get home to his reserve but had none (para. 35). As the sentencing judge observed, his personal, family and community history played a role in his actions that day (para. 35).\nThese circumstances are precisely the kind of background or systemic factors that this Court has recognized as having a mitigating effect in sentencing (Ipeelee, at para. 73; R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688). Endemic poverty on reserves, intimately tied to the legacy of colonialism, is a common cause of crime for Indigenous peoples (Gladue, at para. 65). As the number of Indigenous offenders behind bars in Canada continues to soar, it is imperative that sentencing judges appropriately consider the unique social issues facing Indigenous peoples in Canada (see R. Mangat, More Than We Can Afford: The Costs of Mandatory Minimum Sentencing (2014), at pp. 30-34; I.F., Canadian Bar Association, at para. 24). The sentencing judge did not err in doing so.\nThe sentencing judge also correctly considered the effect of the sentence on the offender and concluded that any period of incarceration will have a profound impact on Mr. Hilbach due to his youth and history of gang affiliation (para. 14). A five-year penitentiary sentence, in other words, would undermine Mr. Hilbachs rehabilitation, with counterproductive implications for public safety down the line. Although rehabilitation is not a principle of fundamental justice, removing it altogether from consideration can result in gross disproportionality. As this Court unanimously held in R. v. Bissonnette, 2022 SCC 23, [t]o ensure respect for human dignity  and therefore compliance with s. 12 of the Charter  Parliament must leave a door open for rehabilitation, even in cases where this objective is of minimal importance (para. 85). When a mandatory minimum compromises, rather than advances, the prospect of rehabilitation  as the sentencing judge found here  the result is a penalty unmoored from a basic tenet of our criminal justice system: respect for the inherent dignity of every individual (Bissonnette, at paras. 87-88). And quite simply, it shocks the conscience to send a youthful Indigenous offender to prison for five years when, according to the sentencing judge, doing so would harm both the offender and society (paras. 14 and 21). \nThe Court of Appeal, however, concluded that the sentencing judge had erred in principle in failing to give sufficient weight to denunciation and deterrence and by overemphasizing Gladue factors (para. 49). The court concluded that an appropriate sentence was three years when appropriate weight was ascribed to those factors (para. 50).\nHowever, an appellate court may not intervene simply because it would have weighed the relevant factors differently (R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 49; see also Lloyd, at paras. 52-53). We agree that denunciation and deterrence are important considerations, but there is no reason to interfere with the sentencing judges conclusion that a two-year prison sentence for a first-time offender would serve those objectives. Indeed, as this Court observed in Bissonnette, the objectives of denunciation and deterrence are not better served by the imposition of excessive sentences (para. 94). Moreover, this Court recognized in Boudreault that denunciation and deterrence should not be elevated over the principle of proportionality, the objective of rehabilitation, and Parliaments intent to ameliorate the overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in prison under s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code (paras. 81-83). We would defer to the discretion of the sentencing judge as to which sentencing objectives in s. 718 (such as denunciation, deterrence, and rehabilitation) to prioritize  and how much weight to afford to the secondary sentencing principles in s. 718.2 (such as parity and restraint) (Lacasse, at paras. 54-55). We are not persuaded that he erred in exercising that discretion.  \nOur colleague disagrees. She accepts that three years, or higher, would be fit and concludes that the sentencing judge erred by imposing a sentence that was a full year below the starting point for offences of this nature (paras. 50-51). But starting points do not answer the key question at this first stage, which is, in our colleagues words: . . . what specifically is the fit sentence for this individual offender? (Hills, at para. 64). And starting points are tools, not straitjackets (R. v. Parranto, 2021 SCC 46, at para. 37; R. v. Friesen, 2020 SCC 9, [2020] 1 S.C.R. 424, at paras. 36-37; Lacasse, at para. 57). Deviation from a starting point  no matter the degree of deviation  does not in itself justify appellate intervention (Parranto, at para. 29). By defaulting to the starting point in Johnas, our colleagues approach departs from the recent jurisprudence of this Court in Parranto, Friesen, and Lacasse.\nOur colleague also notes that the use of an unloaded prohibited firearm does not substantially reduce the offences gravity (para. 55). While the use of an unloaded firearm may not substantially reduce an offences gravity  because either weapon inspires fear and is used for coercion  the two situations are not equivalent in terms of gravity or moral culpability. The use of an unloaded firearm necessarily poses a much lower risk to public safety. It is far more blameworthy to enter public spaces with a loaded gun, as this suggests an intention to resort to lethal force if necessary. The two situations, for the purpose of sentencing, cannot be equated. \nEven if our colleague and the Court of Appeal were correct and a fit sentence for Mr. Hilbach were three years in jail, we would still conclude, as did the Court of Appeal, that a sentence of five years was grossly disproportionate (para. 54). Our colleagues conclusion otherwise is, with respect, untenable. It is hard to fathom how a sentence nearly double the amount of a proportionate sentence would not shock the conscience of Canadians. This does not accord with a purposive reading of s. 12, nor is it alive to the profound consequences of any incarceration on an offenders life and liberty, let alone the secondary impacts on the offender and the offenders family. \nUltimately, we would not disturb the determination that a five-year penitentiary sentence would be grossly disproportionate in the circumstances. Since the mandatory minimum would be unconstitutional for Mr. Hilbach, it is unnecessary to consider reasonably foreseeable applications of the law.\nSection 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code\nThe four-year mandatory minimum under s. 344(1)(a.1) applies if an offender commits robbery using a non-restricted or non-prohibited firearm. Before the Court of Appeal and this Court, Mr. Zwozdesky concedes that a four-year sentence was fit in his case. The question, then, is whether a four-year sentence is grossly disproportionate in other reasonably foreseeable cases. We conclude that it is. \nA four-year sentence reaches beyond the classic instance of robbery with a firearm and captures less egregious conduct. Section 344(1)(a.1) requires the offender to use the firearm during the offence. In R. v. Steele, 2007 SCC 36, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 3, this Court observed that the term use, in the context of other firearm offences, has been interpreted to include a wide range of behaviour including discharging the firearm, pointing the firearm, or even just revealing with words that a firearm is present (para. 27). To be used, the firearm need not have accessible ammunition (R. v. Covin, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 725, at p. 730), nor does it have to be in the offenders physical possession if it is readily at hand (Steele, at para. 32).\nAnd not all firearms are highly regulated weapons. The definition of firearm captures any barrelled, projectile-firing device that can rupture an eye, which is the standard for determining whether the firearm can cause serious bodily injury or death (R. v. Dunn, 2013 ONCA 539, 117 O.R. (3d) 171, at para. 40, affd 2014 SCC 69, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 490). This includes firearms  like BB guns, paintball guns, or even nail guns  that can be obtained with relative ease at local commercial outlets.\nThus, while the objective gravity of robbery with a firearm is always serious, the gravity of the particular offence committed  which depends on the circumstances surrounding the offence  varies considerably (see Friesen, at para. 96). For instance, just as s. 344(1)(a.1) captures offenders brandishing shotguns who invade a home and steal from its occupants (R. v. Matwiy (1996), 178 A.R. 356 (C.A.)), it would also capture an offender who snatches a purse from a stranger while armed with a BB gun (C.A. reasons, at para. 64; see also R. v. Smart, 2014 ABPC 175, 595 A.R. 266).\nFurther, a wide range of people commit armed robberies. At one end of the spectrum stands the seasoned criminal, who, motivated by greed and contempt, serially orchestrates sophisticated robbery heists undeterred by criminal sanction. At the other end of the spectrum stands the first-time offender with a tragic upbringing, who, fuelled by drug addiction, turns to robbery once to satisfy his need for a quick fix, and then successfully rehabilitates before sentencing. A four-year penitentiary sentence may be proportionate, or even lenient, in the former example, but may well be grossly disproportionate in the latter.\nConsidering such personal characteristics and circumstances sheds light on the reasonably foreseeable scope of the law (Hills, at paras. 58-61). It reflects the inherently individualized nature of sentencing and how proportionality involves an assessment of both the gravity of the offence and the blameworthiness of the offender (Nur, at para. 43).\nSuch an approach also reflects common sense. Given the vast overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in our justice system, for example, cases involving such offenders are, as a matter of logic, reasonably foreseeable (Hills, at paras. 86-87). Indeed, mandatory minimum sentences disproportionately impact Indigenous offenders (Mangat, at pp. 30-34). Similarly, offenders who are poor, precariously housed, substance dependent, mentally ill, or disabled appear with staggering regularity in our provincial courts (Boudreault, at paras. 49-55). Consideration of these personal characteristics can ensure s. 12 of the Charter responds to the everyday composition of offenders in the criminal justice system (I.F., Canadian Bar Association, at para. 24).\nThat said, the types of foreseeable offenders a court may consider must not be stretched beyond reason to create far-fetched examples (Nur, at paras. 73-76). Extremely detailed hypotheticals, like those advanced by Mr. Zwozdesky, are ultimately unhelpful for this reason. Laws should not be set aside based on speculation. But so long as such examples are reasonable, this inquiry is central to the analysis: testing the reasonably foreseeable scope of a given punishment ensures that no individual is subject to an unconstitutional law, which in turn, allows s. 12 to be faithful to its purpose. \nMr. Hilbachs circumstances provide a reasonable hypothetical example. His conviction under s. 344(1)(a)(i) is more serious because it involved a prohibited firearm. But even then, the sentencing judges conclusion was that a fit sentence would have been two years less a day  half of the mandatory four-year sentence under s. 344(1)(a.1), which would be served in a federal penitentiary. Even were we to accept our colleague and the Court of Appeals conclusion that three years would have been fit, it follows that Mr. Hilbach should have received a lesser sentence had he used a non-prohibited firearm and been convicted under s. 344(1)(a.1). While the court need not fix the sentence or sentencing range at a specific point, particularly for a reasonable hypothetical case framed at a high level of generality, it is helpful for the court to consider, even implicitly, the rough scale of the appropriate sentence (Lloyd, at para. 23). At most, a reformatory term would have been fit if Mr. Hilbach had committed his crime with a non-prohibited firearm. It follows that a four-year mandatory minimum would be more than merely excessive in the circumstances.\nAdditionally, it is not uncommon for crimes, like robbery, to be committed by more than one offender  one need only consider, for instance, the getaway driver (as in this case) or the lookout. And because Canadian criminal law does not distinguish between the principal offender and parties to an offence in determining criminal liability (R. v. Briscoe, 2010 SCC 13, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 13), someone who assists or encourages the principal offender is guilty of the same offence and faces the same mandatory minimum sentence. This is so even if their assistance or encouragement was not preplanned or significant.\nAiders and abetters may not automatically be entitled to a sentencing discount. But just because a party is criminally liable for the same offence as a principal offender does not mean they deserve the same sentence. As always, what constitutes a proportionate sentence will depend on the circumstances (Hills, at para. 58), most notably the offenders degree of participation. Considering this context in sentencing does not undermine the party liability provisions, nor incite offenders to assist or encourage crime. Rather, it reflects the fundamental principle of sentencing under s. 718.1: a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\nThe Court of Appeal in Hilbach points out that secondary liability dramatically expands the scope of the offence even more, and further reveals that s. 344(1)(a.1) is constitutionally infirm (paras. 61 and 68). We agree that R. v. Link, 2012 MBPC 25, 276 Man. R. (2d) 157, is illustrative.\nMs. Link, an Indigenous woman, was barely 18 years old and had no prior criminal record when she agreed to participate in a convenience store robbery. Her battle with drug and alcohol addiction began at age 13, and led her to become enmeshed in a destructive set of friends (para. 32). At the time of the offence, she was homeless and in her words stealing to survive (para. 53). Unbeknownst to Ms. Link, her accomplice had an imitation handgun in his possession, which he pointed at a clerk during the robbery. She continued to stuff cartons of cigarettes into her bag after the gun was produced. The clerk described her as an accomplice maybe? and flustered, not really involved (para. 15). She was cooperative with police, remorseful, and turned her life around after the incident. The sentencing judge imposed an eight-month conditional sentence order.\nThe Crown argues that Link is not a reasonably foreseeable application of the law: s. 344(1)(a.1) did not apply because an imitation handgun is not a firearm, and Ms. Link did not know her accomplice had the firearm on his person before the robbery. In our view, this argument misses the mark. The issue is whether the characteristics of the offender and their conduct can assist the court in its inquiry into reasonably foreseeable circumstances. While certain aggravating elements may have been missing in Ms. Links circumstances, we agree that the sentence imposed in Ms. Links case illuminates the nature of the offence of armed robbery, its broad sentencing range, and the kinds of people who commit it.\nWhether or not the mens rea could have been established, or whether a handgun is real or an imitation, the circumstances of Link are not far-fetched. And the difference between an imitation handgun and a real handgun cannot account for the wide gulf between an eight-month sentence served in the community and a four-year penitentiary sentence. Ms. Links example is further demonstration that a reformatory sentence  if not less  could be a proportionate sanction under s. 344(1)(a.1). Four years in a federal institution would be grossly disproportionate in comparison.\nGiven the breadth of the definition of a firearm (including BB guns, paintball guns, and nail guns), the range of conduct captured by the offence (including the degree and nature of involvement in the crime, the level of violence, and the level of sophistication), as well as the prevalence of important, often intersecting, personal circumstances (including Indigeneity, youth, substance dependency, and rehabilitation efforts), it is reasonably foreseeable that a four-year penitentiary sentence would be a grossly disproportionate sentence for some offenders.\nAs a result, based on the reasonably foreseeable application of the law, we agree with the courts below that the mandatory minimum in s. 344(1)(a.1) contravenes s. 12 of the Charter.\nSection 1\nThe Crown does not advance any argument on s. 1 of the Charter and therefore has not discharged its burden of justifying the s. 12 infringement. The provisions cannot be saved under s. 1. \nDisposition\nWe would thus declare ss. 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) of no force and effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. We would dismiss the Crowns appeal and maintain the orders of the Court of Appeal. \n\tAppeal allowed, Karakatsanis and Jamal JJ. dissenting.\n\tSolicitor for the appellant: Alberta Crown Prosecution Service  Appeals and Specialized Prosecutions Office, Calgary.\n\tSolicitors for the respondent Ocean William Storm Hilbach: Moreau & Company, Edmonton.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Director of Public Prosecutions: Public Prosecution Service of Canada, Winnipeg.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General, Crown Law Office  Criminal, Toronto.\n\tSolicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Saskatchewan: Ministry of Justice and the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, Regina.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Civil Liberties Association: Stockwoods, Toronto.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the Canadian Bar Association: Peck and Company, Vancouver.\n\tSolicitors for the intervener the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association: Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Vancouver.", "llama_summary": "**The Supreme Court of Canada Upholds Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Robbery with a Firearm**\n\nThis appeal concerns the constitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences for robbery with a firearm under sections 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code, and whether they constitute cruel and unusual punishment contrary to section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Background**\nThe Crown alleged that Ocean William Storm Hilbach and Curtis Zwozdesky committed robbery with a firearm, contrary to sections 344(1)(a)(i) and 344(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code. The core allegations centered on whether the mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by these sections constituted cruel and unusual punishment under section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n**Court Proceedings**\nThe cases, R v. Hilbach and R v. Zwozdesky, were heard together on appeal after separate trials. In R v. Hilbach, Mr. Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited firearm but challenged the five-year mandatory minimum sentence as grossly disproportionate to his circumstances, which included his Indigenous background, family history of residential school attendance, struggles with addictions, and financial difficulties. The trial judge imposed a lighter sentence but was overturned by the Court of Appeal. In R v.

With his face concealed, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach pointed the rifle at  two employees and demanded cash while his accomplice punched one employee and  kicked the other. They left with $290 in lottery tickets and were apprehended  shortly after. At the time, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach was 19\u00a0years old, on  probation and subject to a firearms prohibition order, having been sentenced  for several other offences three\u00a0months earlier. In  January\u00a02018, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach pleaded guilty to robbery using a prohibited  firearm contrary to section\u00a0344(1)(a)(i) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. At sentencing, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach brought a challenge  under section\u00a012 of the <em>Canadian  Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em>to the five-year mandatory minimum sentence.  Section 12 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees  the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Mr.\u00a0Hilbach  claimed section 344(1)(a)(i) was grossly disproportionate to him as an  Indigenous person and member of the Ermineskin Cree Nation. Before the  sentencing judge, Mr.\u00a0Hilbach filed a <em>Gladue </em>report, which indicated that members of his family attended residential  schools, struggled with addictions to alcohol or other substances, and suffered  financial difficulties. The <em>Gladue </em>report  gets its name from the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s 1999 ruling in <em><a href=\"https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1695/index.do\">R. v.  Gladue</a></em>, which established factors that courts must take into  account when sentencing Indigenous offenders. In the case of Mr. Hilbach, the  sentencing judge decided that the mandatory minimum sentence was grossly  disproportionate and violated section 12. He sentenced Mr. Hilbach to two years  less a day.On  September 13, 2016, in an unrelated case, Mr. Curtis Zwozdesky and two masked  accomplices robbed a convenience store in Caslan, Alberta. One of the  accomplices pushed an employee, pointed a sawed-off shotgun at her, and  demanded cash. A shot was fired into a shelf. Mr. Zwozdesky never entered the  store during the robbery, but drove the accomplices to and from the store. Mr.  Zwozdesky pleaded guilty to robbery with a firearm contrary to section  344(1)(a.1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. At  that time, the law imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of four years in prison.  At sentencing, Mr. Zwozdesky challenged the mandatory minimum sentence under  section 12 of the <em>Charter.</em> The  sentencing judge found that the mandatory minimum sentence was not grossly  disproportionate for Mr. Zwozdesky and sentenced him to three years\u2019  imprisonment. However, she concluded that it would be grossly disproportionate  in reasonably foreseeable hypothetical scenarios and declared the law of no  force or effect. Alberta\u2019s  Court of Appeal heard the two cases together and dismissed the appeals. It also  added a year to Mr. Hilbach\u2019s sentence. It did not change Mr. Zwozdesky\u2019s sentence.  The Crown then appealed both cases to the Supreme Court of Canada.The  Supreme Court allowed the appeals.<strong>The mandatory minimum sentences at  issue are constitutional.</strong>Writing  for a majority of the judges, Justice Sheilah L. Martin ruled that the mandatory  minimum sentences for Mr. Hilbach and Mr. Zwozdesky do not constitute cruel and  unusual punishment. She applied the framework set out in the companion appeal  of <em><a href=\"39338-eng.aspx\">R. v. Hills</a></em> for challenges to the constitutionality of a mandatory minimum sentence under  section 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. In regard  to Mr.\u00a0Hilbach, Justice Martin added that the section 12 analysis makes it  mandatory for judges to consider the unique situation of Indigenous offenders  for all offences in sentencing."}}
